1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, it looks like it happened again. Another solo cheesy cast. The only member of the PCP who actually shows up on time around here.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, I mean, I guess we could go into questions. I don't got that much to talk about. I usually write notes, but I didn't this week for this.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I told you guys I'm moving, right? Yeah, but I thought long and hard about this, and I'm thinking that I kind of don't want to live in a place with like 10 other people anymore.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think, I don't know, I think that isn't too good for my psyche. I'm thinking maybe I need to like look for like a solo spot, but Boston is expensive.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I was thinking like, hmm, it'd probably be cheaper to live in an RV. So yeah, I'm going to invest into getting an RV as soon as I can.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And you know, just shove it in your studio space. Am I right gamers? Am I right gamers?

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Anyway, I guess it's question time. Time to pull up the questions right now. Right now.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Ben, you can jump in now. I'm out of material.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Wait, what? Huh? What? Oh, was I supposed to jump in?

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, shit. Oh, sorry. I, sorry. I was, um, I was distracted at watching the new Geo Wizard video, uh, the new mission across Scotland.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It was just so engrossing. I know you were doing a bit and I was supposed to jump in, but I just, I started watching his, his journey, his journey across Scotland.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I was just so engrossed. I couldn't, I couldn't tear my eyes away.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, okay. Well, at least you were doing something productive. Am I right?

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Am I right? I just wanted to hear your, I just wanted to hear you, your Ben saying impression. Got to say, I'm offended.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is that really what you think of me? Is this, is this, is this true?

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think if I want to do a better Ben saying impression to be like.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Was your heart in it?

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It would be like, um, have you ever seen the, the movie Italian Spider-Man?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wait, wait, wait. Is that's the one with the gift of the guy going, oh.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Like he's pointing. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there's this one scene where these, uh, these Italian like college boys are a cat calling one girl.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then Italian Spider-Man just comes out of nowhere and punches the boys and says, respect women.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then the woman, the woman, the woman goes up to Italian Spider-Man and says, thank you Italian Spider-Man.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then Italian Spider-Man just punches her in the face and says, shut up pussy cat. Now give me a macchiato.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay. Is it supposed to be funny? It sounds like it's supposed to be funny.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's like if, um, I, the premise is like, imagine if like in the seventies, like somewhere in Italy, someone made like a bootleg Spider-Man movie where he acts nothing like Spider-Man.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's just named Spider-Man and that's it.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's, oh, he's just like, he's just happened to be called Spider-Man, but he has nothing to do with the character.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Right. Yeah. But throughout the whole, yeah, but throughout the whole, the whole movie is on YouTube and I think it's like under 30 minutes.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not too long. And yeah. And everyone just calls him Italian Spider-Man.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Like they say that.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Like in the movie, like in the movie, they call him Italian Spider-Man.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah. They call him Italian Spider-Man.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Right. And besides that,

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why are they, are they Italian?

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Um, it's implied. I mean, it's, it's the way it's shot is that

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Does it take place in Italy?

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Um, I don't know. I think it takes place in, I think the, the production company is Australia and I think they filmed the whole thing in Australia.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But, um, the, the joke is that they, they said the whole, they said all the lines in English, but then they dub it over with like Italian, right?

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So it looks like, um, you know, it looks like that bad kind of dubbing, but that's like part of the charm, you know?

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I see. I don't, I don't understand. I don't get it. I mean, I've seen the GIF.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm surprised I don't know more about this movie because I've been hearing about the Italian Spider-Man movie for like years.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Like that's such an old meme.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And yet I, I, this is all news to me.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you watch the Italian Spider-Man movie at the end, like after the credits, it says, go visit the Italian Spider-Man MySpace page to get more info.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's, it's that old.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, okay.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I was going to say, I mean, that's newer than I thought.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Like I thought it was from like the 80s.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, no, it's supposed, it's supposed to look like it's from like the 70s or 80s.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like that's kind of like the bit, like they did that on purpose, you know?

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, well, they, they got me.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They got you.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They fucking tricked me.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
They fooled the Great Ben Saint.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They got him under his fucking nose.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Nothing, nothing gets past me.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yep. Nothing gets past Ben ever.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Um, I will quickly mention at the beginning of this episode that if you've been listening, you know that every so often I bring up, we have the Kato anthology guys on the Kato anthology, the Kato anthology Kickstarter is ending this weekend.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you're hearing this, it will be ending on Monday.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So this will be the last weekend.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It is, um, it is closing in on $4,000.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think the next stretch goal is for $4,200.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Nice.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Or 4,200.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Get in there.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's get that to 69.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Am I right?

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Am I right?

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So link, link in the description.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Check that out.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's your last chance.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It is the last opportunity.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Um, yeah.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Check it out guys.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Very good.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I would check it out.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I would donate, but, um, I am broke at the moment.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I just moved into a new place.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you?

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Did I go on?

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Broke?

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yep.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you fucking, what are you fucking stupid?

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Like what's wrong with you?

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But you don't have any money.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is there something genetic?

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Something genetically wrong with you, my guy?

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Like, well, how can you be broke?

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Broke?

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're got, you're being real queer coded right now.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Cheesy.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's really queer coded.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Ben, you're giving me a lot of gender envy right now, Ben.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I would recommend you stop.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Uh, uh, I mean, that's what I do.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's why I just go out there and perform my gender in a way.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I just, just, I'm just, I'm a dysphoria machine.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm an engine for it.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Everyone's jealous.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I wonder if there's anyone out there who watches, who watched like the

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sonichu lecture and they're all, they look at you and they think,

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
damn, Ben's giving me some real gender envy right now.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sure there's not.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm going to, um, I, I saw, oh man.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I watched the Sarah Zed video about the, the, the, the,

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
what are they called them?

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A Bimbam brothers.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh yeah.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
McElroy's.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I had, I didn't know anything about those guys.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I had like, I'd heard their names.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I knew that they did a D and D podcast.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I didn't know what they were famous for or anything about them.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But the one with the purple hair looks uncomfortably like me.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh no.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
With the pink hair.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I didn't, I didn't like, I didn't like seeing that and wrecky like,

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
oh that's, he's kind of got my vibe going.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh no.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He's me.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't know if I feel about this.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It looks like me.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He does a podcast with his brother.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This, this is too real.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He does.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's too spot on.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Um, he's, he's like a, he's like, if, uh, he's like if Ben St.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're a loser.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's like what people should say.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I look at what is it to me?

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't even know which one.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was about to say, I was about to say it's like if Ben St.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
was productive.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was going to say.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Got him.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Um, I was, um, I was shocked.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was just, I was surprised listening to that video because she

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
mentions that one of the Mabim Bams wife does a podcast called

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Saw Bones and I had heard of Saw Bones because John Boyce

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
mentioned Saw Bones in the pretty good episode where he talks

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
about the set.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think it's the second ever like Olympic marathon where like,

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
do you, do you know this, what I'm talking about this video?

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Is that the, is that the story about the lady who like cheated

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or something?

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The lady who cheated.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
In like a marathon or?

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, you must be, you must be thinking of something else.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If this, the, the John Boyce pretty good video about the

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Olympic marathon, basically the story is that it was held in like

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
110 degree weather on like a dirt road and it was like, yeah,

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
like the runners were like collapsing from heat.

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They were like breathing in like dust and like choking.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Some of them almost died.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There was like no water available on the route and it turned out

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
spoilers.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Go watch this video, but if you haven't seen it, it spoiler is

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that it turns out that like the guy in charge of it was some kind of

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
like, I think he was some kind of like sicko fucking Auschwitz

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Nazi scientist or something who like used the whole thing as

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
like an opportunity to test what happens when humans are

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
deprived of water.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It was like a sick experiment.

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you know what year this was?

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think it must have been in the 1800s or so.

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't, I have no idea.

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was like recent enough that there are like pictures of it,

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
but they're like old timey black and white photographs.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So in that episode, he talks to the lady from Sawbones,

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
which I guess must be one of the McElroy Brothers wife and asks her

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
if because one of the doctor, no, not the doctor, one of the

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
coaches, like one of the runners coaches is like following along

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
with him in a truck and he won't give the runner water because

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
he thinks that drinking water will like prevent him from

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
running.

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He instead lets him like coat the inside of his mouth with egg

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
whites and then gives him like strict nine pills as like a

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
stimulant.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, that's what they fucking did.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It sounds like you would fucking puke on on the fucking

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
spot if you gave me that fucking shit.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like they all like nobody finished the race.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like only like a handful of the runners actually finished it.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, I mean, if you puke in the middle of the race,

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
secondly, you should be faster because you have less weight in

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you, right?

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, that must have been what he was thinking.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You don't want that all that heavy water weighing you down.

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Exactly.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You know, maybe also if you shit your pants while you're running,

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you should be able to run 10 times faster, right?

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Just get it all out.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Right, exactly.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Just get it all out.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Cut your arms and legs off too.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They're just weighing you down.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You know how swimmers are like swimmers like fucking have to

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
trim all their body hair because hair like slows you down

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
when you're swimming, right?

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It creates drag.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Right, exactly.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I assume it works the same way.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Jesus Christ.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was just, I was shocked to hear that thing mentioned in,

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't know.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It was just like, wait, that thing is connected to this thing.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I know, and I know what that thing is.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And it's two different things.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's that podcast incest.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll tell you that much.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I had another moment like this one, and this one really,

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
really pissed me off this week.

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've been, I've been listening to a bunch of Tim Rogers stuff from

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Kotaku.

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Well, yeah, it's a bunch of Tim Rogers videos, his own stuff from

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Action Button and his older stuff from Kotaku.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And no, sorry, I've, I've unburied the lead.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I've spoiled a little bit.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Sorry, I meant to bring up, there's a new atrocity guide video

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
about Bob's game.

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh yeah, I saw that.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Which is like, yeah, the story about the guy who made a game,

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
demanded that Nintendo publish it on the DS and staged like a,

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
like a hundred day strike and did all these like weird protests

241
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to protest Nintendo not publishing his game on the DS.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
In that video, she says that like someone who was involved in

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
like breaking that story was a guy who knew Bob and that was

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Tim Rogers.

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He like knew the guy.

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And I'm like, oh wow, that's a weird coincidence.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then I'm, I'm listening to want some old Tim Rogers video

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
on Kotaku.

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And he just casually throws out like, yeah, I don't even remember

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
what we were talking about.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think they were going shopping for games.

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No, it's the video where he's going through games and he's

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
describing their box art from memory without looking at them.

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And he's talking about finding a game on a shelf in a store.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And he says, yeah, I was shopping at a mall with my good friend

256
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Vito Guisualdi.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I'm like, I know that guy.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I hate that guy.

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Fuck that guy.

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This makes me so mad.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Isn't Vito that one like edgy, like internet comedian guy?

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah.

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The guy who, the guy who I thought he seemed okay until I saw him

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
being like, JK Rowling actually makes some good points.

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was like, okay, nevermind.

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Nevermind.

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fuck this guy.

268
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He kind of reminds me of Lilith Lovett, who I hate too.

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Who?

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Lilith Lovett?

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah.

272
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you know who Lilith Lovett is?

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I do.

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I've never heard of them.

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No.

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
She's a trans, like libertarian who like, I don't know.

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's like, there's people on Twitter that I always see who like

278
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
every time I see one of their tweets, it's always like a fucking

279
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
atrocious ass.

280
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
She must know.

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I wonder if she knows Aria DiMzzo.

282
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Remember Aria DiMzzo?

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That sounds kind of familiar.

284
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Friend of the show.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That sounds kind of familiar.

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Friend of the show was running for, was running for sheriff of

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
that county in New Hampshire.

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I mean, they couldn't.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Another trans woman libertarian.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm not surprised.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They hope so.

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah.

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Lilith Lovett was like, I mean, I feel like that's not a huge,

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I feel like that's not a huge like, like van diagram crossover.

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Those two things.

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Maybe there is.

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know.

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Not really.

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I was about to mention earlier that I think one of the

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
McElroy's brothers were like a former Kotaku writer or something.

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Right.

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean, they're, I wouldn't surprise me at all if they did.

304
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Cause like, I mean, when you're, when you're famous, you can just

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
write for anyone.

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Anyone will publish your shit.

307
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Right.

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah.

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You could have for like a second.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I just, just made me mad.

312
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Just made me wait.

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What?

314
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I said you cut out for a second there.

315
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, sorry.

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Um, I just made me mad cause like, um, oh fuck Vito.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Fuck all these people.

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They're all in a big club and I'm not in it.

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's all about who you know.

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It doesn't mean it's all, it's all, it's, it's all a bunch of horseshit.

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You know, you know, people, Ben, right?

322
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You have a laundry list.

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No.

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Who do I, who do I, this, who do I fucking know?

325
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Who do I fucking know?

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, oh, I'm that.

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh, Ben St.

328
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You mean that guy who's friends with Digi bro?

329
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's, that's me.

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's my legacy.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah.

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's me.

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You might be wondering how I got into the situation.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This, this is what it is.

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This is the reality of my situation.

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And it's so bad.

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's so shit.

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You know, I think at some point in the past I must have thought like, yeah, maybe

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
like, you know, this is what you do.

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You get a bunch of people, you get a bunch of creatives or whatever.

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You form a little click.

342
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You form a little collective.

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You, you, you, you become like, oh, you're, you're associated with that group.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, that group does all this stuff.

345
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know.

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You forge a, you forge a collective identity.

347
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Um, and then you all like mutually support one another and stuff.

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Uh, well, I don't know.

349
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Maybe at some point I thought that's what was going to happen, but it didn't work out

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that way.

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Uh, things didn't go, things didn't go quite how I expected it.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm, and I'm, and I don't like it.

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It frustrates me.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm like, why couldn't I, why couldn't I have been?

355
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We could have, we could have fucking, I don't know.

356
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Maybe if I'd made better friends, we could have, uh, we could have started our own Kotaku

357
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
or whatever.

358
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think the, the real, uh, Genesis point was when, uh, Ben say it became a comedy.

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think that really ruined everything.

360
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That I, if, you know what, if, if that hadn't happened, we probably would be, we probably

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
would be, we probably would have started a video game journalism outlet on the internet

362
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and, uh, you know, or whatever.

363
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We probably would have, you know, really hit that algorithm and like, you know, just gotten

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to the front page of Reddit every, every, every day.

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know.

366
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I've been saying, I've been saying this for years.

367
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I've been saying this for years.

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Uh, PCPs got to go back to their alt-right roots, you know.

369
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How many years have you been saying it for?

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's been too long.

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I've been saying it for years.

372
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like, yeah, like it was much better when, um, Ben saying didn't like people who are a

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
darker skin.

374
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It was a way funnier era.

375
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The jokes are funnier.

376
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Um, spiral has continued his, uh, his quest to document every usage of the N word in,

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
uh, in the PCPs history.

378
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Uh, he says he will eventually make a spreadsheet.

379
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Who said it the most about it?

380
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Um, who said it the most?

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Um, I mean, like, is that what he's trying to figure out that like he's going to have

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
a spreadsheet?

383
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, among, among, among other things, among other things, hold on.

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Um, um, hold on.

385
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He's posted some of his incomplete data.

386
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Uh, I will summarize.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Was in the lead.

388
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Tell me.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay.

390
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes.

391
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So it was before, okay.

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Apparently there is a, there is a big moment.

393
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There's a big point in which, uh, it gets said a lot, uh, and it was the empathy episode.

394
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And I think that it was like, Trixie says it a lot.

395
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think a bunch of people had said it before.

396
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Trixie says it a lot in the empathy episode, but I want to see the before empathy and after

397
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
empathy numbers.

398
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, wait.

399
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah.

400
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I remember that episode.

401
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
She famously said, I have no empathy for the N words.

402
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I remember that classic line.

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Is that what she said?

404
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No, that's not what she said.

405
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No, what the fuck?

406
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's terrible.

407
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No empathy for the N words.

408
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'd say she has too many, she has too much empathy for N words.

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's why like bird is like transracial or something, right?

410
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No, Riley is transracial.

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh my gosh.

412
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Or something.

413
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah.

414
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
One of them is transracial.

415
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I remember Trixie tweeting one time like, I'm a fusion of like Huey and the other little

416
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
girl from BoomDocs.

417
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I forgot, but she's the one who's like mixed.

418
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
She has like a black, a black dad is like a lawyer and a white mom.

419
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You know what I'm talking about?

420
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Wait, who are you talking about?

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The one little girl character from the BoomDocs.

422
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh God, I don't remember her name.

424
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But I know what you're talking about with the big, the big buns.

425
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, exactly.

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hair buns.

427
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah.

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I remember Trixie saying that she was like a fusion of her and Huey.

429
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Wow, that's stupid.

430
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What a stupid thing to say.

431
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know.

432
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You should tweet out your fusion of Applejack and Twilight Sparkle or something.

433
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, so before the empathy episode, which is episode 30, the N word count for soft A

434
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
was Trixie 11.

435
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Everyone else, nothing.

436
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Damn.

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The hard R count before episode 30.

438
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think this is right was, no, or is this just the episode, or is this just in the hard,

439
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
in the episode?

440
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know.

441
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think this is in, I'm a little confused looking at the data, but whatever.

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The point is after it, after episode 30, episode totals were soft A, Trixie, 15, Nate, 14,

443
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
9-0, 4, but gets a pass.

444
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Obviously, DeVoo, 2, Ben, 1.

445
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I think I said it with the A one time during the empathy episode.

446
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I think it was my first one.

447
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Looks like Ben wins again.

448
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Ben's the real winner here.

449
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, no, because a bunch of names aren't on here.

450
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That is true.

451
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm surprised.

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Hard R, hard R, Jesse, 8, Nate, 6, Trixie, 6, Monkey, 6.

453
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, I just wanted to say I'm surprised Monkey's not on the list, but never mind.

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Well, he only used the hard R.

455
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Oh, epic.

456
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's very in line.

457
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Very epic.

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's crazy because now he's on a podcast.

459
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Actually, so did Jesse.

460
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Jesse only ever said it with the hard R and never with the A.

461
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I am not surprised.

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's crazy because Monkey's now on a podcast with Reactor and Rusty Cage.

463
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't think he says the N word at all on that podcast.

464
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He saved them all for the PCP.

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Reactor fucking sucks.

466
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Reactor's a piece of shit.

467
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm not a fan of Reactor.

468
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Rusty Cage, I don't know.

469
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He seems all right.

470
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I thought he was, I don't know.

471
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I have this inclination towards people who just make comics.

472
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It might be a bias.

473
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I kind of just respect people who make comics more than normies, you know?

474
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Absolutely.

475
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Right, exactly.

476
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Absolutely.

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If you don't make comics, you're not even human to me at TPH.

478
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
As Monchi once said, it's the most heroic art form.

479
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The most heroic art form.

480
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Rest in peace, Monchi.

481
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We miss you, bud.

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Rest in peace, Monchi.

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, but that being said, I don't know.

484
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I think what really kind of bothered me was that he was getting a lot of advice from Doug

485
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to Naples.

486
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Doug to Naples probably gave him a good ass comic advice.

487
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That being said, I don't like Doug to Naples.

488
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah.

489
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, I think from what I know about him, he's just another, he's a real Scott Cawthon.

490
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

491
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He's a real, who's that other one?

492
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He's Two-Faced.

493
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Orson Scott Card.

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Oh, it was a guy who makes a Dilbert.

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Who's the one that?

496
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Dilbert.

497
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, that guy's his own can of words.

498
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I was going to say he's like another, who's the Timmy Turner, fairly odd parents guy?

499
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Butch Hartman.

500
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Butch Hartman.

501
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He's just one of these fucking like Christian children's entertainment douchebags.

502
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's funny.

503
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
He's like a huge like, transfer, but I remember in, I think in One Stream, I was watching that,

504
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
he was on the Drunken Head.

505
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Who, Doug, Doug Tennipal is?

506
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
He's like this huge ass transfer.

508
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah.

509
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
On One Stream.

510
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

511
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
On One Stream, he was talking about how he thinks, he says that Rebecca Sugar is like a genius.

512
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And I mean, I think Rebecca goes by day, I think.

513
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They, um, they were like, yeah, I'm not, I can't remember.

514
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I mean, I could always look it up.

515
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'll look it up in a second.

516
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But, um, they, um, they consider Rebecca Sugar a genius and Rebecca Sugar is like a former

517
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
student of Doug Tennipal.

518
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Cause he, I don't know if he still does like classes on animation, right?

519
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting.

520
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I don't know.

521
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Some people are like, I mean, I think Scott Coffin is probably the example of like, oh,

522
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I really love the LGBT community.

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You know, the big part of the fandom, but you know, like, like, you know, we shouldn't

524
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
like, uh, we shouldn't, uh, you know, we shouldn't encourage it.

525
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
We shouldn't alienate people who are Republican and want to wipe out LGBT people.

526
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Have you read his, uh, have you read his apology?

527
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Compromise?

528
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Doug's apology?

529
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Uh, no, um, Scott's apology.

530
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Scott, Scott Coffin's apology.

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
No.

532
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I didn't, I didn't actually read it.

534
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I saw it and I was like, I get it.

535
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I saw like, uh, the couple of, like I, I retweet it.

536
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Guys, here's a fucking surprise.

537
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Probably no surprise.

538
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I don't really read the majority of the shit I retweet.

539
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Um, if you follow me on Twitter, it's all kind of blends together after a while.

540
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah.

541
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
My, my, my stream, my Twitter is a stream of consciousness.

542
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm just fucking retweeting shit.

543
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I do not care.

544
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Like, like the only reason that I see any art on Twitter is because you retweet it.

545
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Um, based.

546
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Um, based.

547
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Pretty based.

548
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That is pretty based.

549
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Pretty based.

550
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah.

551
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That is pretty fucking based.

552
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Um, speaking of art.

553
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So this, by the time this podcast comes out, um,

554
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Speaking of comics, I think.

555
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Speaking of comics.

556
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

557
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So I think you're talking about how heroic they are.

558
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah, exactly how you're probably, you're just probably a better person.

559
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You're probably handsome.

560
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You probably got like a big dick too.

561
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Like TBH.

562
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Most likely.

563
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Right.

564
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Most likely.

565
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You ever, um, oh, now that you're, now that you are a Daniel Klaus fan, uh, Ben, have

566
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you ever read that?

567
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
True.

568
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You ever read his, is he made like a little comic called Ink Studs?

569
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You ever heard of it?

570
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think I've heard of it.

571
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I haven't read it.

572
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's, it's like, what was the one that you, what was the one that you gave me to read

573
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and remind me what the title was again?

574
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Daniel, Daniel boring.

575
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No, it's not.

576
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I mean, David boring, my bad.

577
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
David, yeah.

578
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
David boring.

579
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah.

580
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay.

581
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I knew it.

582
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Okay.

583
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Right.

584
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
David boring.

585
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I liked it a lot.

586
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Uh, I'm glad.

587
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm glad.

588
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You should read the rest.

589
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But anyway, he made this one comic called Ink Studs.

590
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
This is all it is.

591
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's just one page.

592
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And it's basically just like, hey ladies, ditch these loser musicians guitar, uh, like,

593
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
uh, betas and get with the real chats, which are the comic artists.

594
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh, wait.

595
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I've, I've seen this.

596
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I've seen, you might have shown this to me actually.

597
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, it's great.

598
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Uh, 10 out of 10.

599
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Also it's true.

600
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And it's not ironic.

601
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Come to think of it.

602
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll take an ink stud.

603
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I get it.

604
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Come to think of it.

605
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Hmm.

606
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Per.

607
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Now that I, now that I've run the calculations again.

608
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Uh, yeah.

609
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Gotcha.

610
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh God.

611
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But yeah.

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What was saying?

613
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

614
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay.

615
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So also on Monday, I think I'm going to have, I'm going to, no, I'm not, I don't think I'm

616
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
going to have pre-orders for the next physical copies of villain verse, but I'm going to

617
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
also villain verse.

618
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yep.

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Eleazar.

620
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Hey post, post the cover, post the title or not the, yeah, post the cover for the next

621
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
issue that you are, that you are releasing, I guess, publishing, opening up pre-orders

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
for.

623
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hold up.

624
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But show it on screen.

625
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Eleazar.

626
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It'll be on the screen right now.

627
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm going to post it in a second.

628
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Anyway.

629
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Um, yeah, I'm going to rework it because if you, uh, Ben, you bought like previous copies

630
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
of villain verse.

631
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I think I bought, uh, I have two, I have two, uh, comics.

632
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Do I have all of them?

633
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I think you just might have all of them.

634
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah.

635
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah.

636
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Hell yeah.

637
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah.

638
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think this would be, this would be the, the cover.

639
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
All right.

640
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
This is the cover for the.

641
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
There.

642
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes.

643
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Oh dude.

644
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Is that a, is that a champion reference?

645
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Cause he's got tusks.

646
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh yeah.

647
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Ben saying inventor of tusks.

648
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I forgot.

649
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I invented tusks.

650
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah.

651
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Hell yeah.

652
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Ben say directed the movie tusks.

653
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's pretty good.

654
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Check it out.

655
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Is that a Brunswick reference?

656
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Dude.

657
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Epic.

658
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Bro, is that, oh my God.

659
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
A reflection.

660
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Is that, is that a vapor's reference?

661
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Oh my God.

662
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Is that a glass, is that a glass reflections my favorite anime YouTuber reference?

663
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's a vapor's reference because none of the characters in vapors reflect on themselves.

664
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I just spoiled the ending of the vapors.

665
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What was it going to say?

666
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah.

667
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So if, if you, if you, if Ben, if you were to grab your physical copy of villain bridge,

668
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
you would notice that it, each physical copy includes like two chapters in them.

669
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Right.

670
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I, I'm aware.

671
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Right.

672
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I've read them.

673
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
This was a dumb mistake.

674
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm going to fix this.

675
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I see.

676
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Because I only did that because I wanted people to read the prologue and jump right into chapter

677
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
one.

678
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Like I didn't want anyone to like take a break or anything or like have to wait for chapter

679
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
one.

680
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So that's why like I have the prologue and chapter one in the same book.

681
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And then the next one I put two and three together.

682
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But then I realized like, wait a second, why am I doing these for the next books?

683
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Like the other ones could be just self-contained.

684
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So I, I, what I'm going to do is just make after chapter one, each chapter is just going

685
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to be a single issue and it's not going to like be a combo book anymore because it's

686
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
like,

687
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Are they going to be longer chapters or are you just going to chop them up?

688
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No, but chapter five, which is,

689
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I mean, honestly, honestly, the second book is pretty thick.

690
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Like for a, for a, what do you, for like a trade paper, it's, it's quite thick for a

691
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
trade paperback comic book.

692
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So like may make sense.

693
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah.

694
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The, the first book was like the prologue is like 20 pages and chapter one is like 25.

695
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And then the second book is chapter two and chapter three and both of them are around

696
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
like 26 pages.

697
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Right.

698
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So that's why it's like thicker.

699
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah.

700
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Also, I started adding like, I started adding like bill and verse fun fact sheets at the

701
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
end, you know,

702
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Which is good.

703
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That's what, that's what I like.

704
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's what I like in a trade paperback is.

705
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Extra.

706
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Fun facts.

707
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Fun facts.

708
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah.

709
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
If, if I, if I could, maybe I'll start doing this, but I'm a big fan of like the little

710
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
like, you know, in the chapters of one piece of what the beginning of each chapter has

711
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
like a single image that would be like its own like story that takes place outside of

712
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
the one piece story.

713
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, I don't remember what those are called, but I know what you mean.

714
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

715
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah.

716
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And then later on in the story, like those would connect back, you know, I kind of want

717
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
to fucking, God, I would, I'm tempted to kind of do something like that.

718
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Um, because there's just constantly things happening outside of the main bill and verse

719
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
story, you know,

720
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Expand the universe, but naturally.

721
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Right.

722
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Exactly.

723
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
But I don't know.

724
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm still thinking about it.

725
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I kind of liked the fun fact stuff because it's kind of like, I guess easier to dump.

726
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Like, oh, um, this thing they use, it has a name or some, some random bullshit.

727
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I think I'm going to like highlight like lesser villains and, um, and these next fun fact sheets

728
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
like, um, like you see a lot of like villains in the background who don't get names and

729
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I think I'm going to like start naming them.

730
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
There's some, wait a second.

731
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I want to highlight.

732
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I want to ask you what one's name is cheesy and entertain them for a moment.

733
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, so how about them?

734
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
How about them?

735
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Mets.

736
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Am I right?

737
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Gamers?

738
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh my God.

739
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
If you haven't read Villainverse, uh, go read it.

740
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That shit's free.

741
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's all going to be free when it's over.

742
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Uh, chapter five should be out by now.

743
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That should took too long.

744
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That should took like five months to make chapter.

745
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Okay.

746
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm back.

747
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
All right.

748
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm back.

749
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
All right.

750
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So let me, let me, let me get, uh, let me find the one who I remember.

751
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I was taking a shit as I often do when I picked up my copy of Villainverse chapter three.

752
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Ben ran out of, uh, paper, uh, toilet paper and he thought like, oh, well this Villainverse

753
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
chapter might do.

754
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Exactly.

755
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Uh, it's, it's when they're all getting eaten by the bugs, um, spoilers.

756
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Uh, uh, no, it's, it's further ahead than that.

757
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Uh, yes.

758
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes.

759
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Shit.

760
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The pages aren't numbered.

761
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah.

762
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
No.

763
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Describe the panel.

764
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Describe the panel.

765
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I know all of them by memory.

766
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Okay.

767
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Well it's the page where all the bugs are like coming out of the ground in a big like tornado

768
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and like they're all like coming at the, the camera and they're just crunch, crunch, crunch,

769
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
buzz, buzz, buzz.

770
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Right.

771
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And there's the guy in the door face is like running away and he looks scared and underneath

772
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
the villain says, yes, yes, eat them up my children, fill your bellies with their flesh.

773
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Right.

774
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
While one is one, like he's like black, like he's being bitten and he's being stretched.

775
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
He looks like, he looks like a cartoon.

776
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
He looks like a, like a squash and stretch cartoon.

777
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh, and then on the previous page, on the previous page, there's a bug guy who's shooting bullets

778
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
at him.

779
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh no.

780
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,700
Or like two pages before there's an action scene and a guy with a, like a praying mantis

781
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,700
head is shooting bullets and this same like squash and stretchy, stretchy black man is

782
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
like out of one side.

783
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
He's got like drool coming out of his mouth.

784
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Yes.

785
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Oh wait.

786
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
Oh wait.

787
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
I know what you're talking about.

788
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
No, no, no.

789
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
Before.

790
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Yeah.

791
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Yeah.

792
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,700
It's like two pages before the eat them up my children.

793
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Yeah.

794
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,700
It's someone, it's like the kind of small, it's kind of like the big, it's like the panel

795
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
at the bottom.

796
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
I know you're talking about.

797
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Yeah.

798
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Oh, okay.

799
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
That's the one.

800
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
That guy's name is inky toad.

801
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
And he's like inky toad.

802
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Yeah, that's his name.

803
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,700
He was actually like, so what's cool about villain verse is that like it's a good excuse to just

804
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,700
use a bunch of character designs I created when I was younger.

805
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
Right.

806
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Yeah.

807
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Cause I drew that guy, I think in like high school, maybe.

808
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,700
And then I like found the drawing of the guy and then I like read.

809
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
I'm like, oh, this guy could be like a villain.

810
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,700
Right.

811
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
He's like a little guy.

812
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Yeah.

813
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:34,700
I think, um, I think the bug guy is called like, I think he's just called the roach maybe.

814
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I don't care.

815
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
I don't care about that guy.

816
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Yeah.

817
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
I'm a big ink.

818
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
I'm a big inky toad Stan.

819
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Oh yeah.

820
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Yeah.

821
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
There'll be, um, there'll be more inky toad.

822
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,700
Um, like, I guess I think I said this before, but the ending is going to be very Avengers

823
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,700
end game where like everyone comes back and there's like a giant.

824
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,700
It's like a giant fight, but that's, that's the most I'll say.

825
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Cool.

826
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
Oh yeah.

827
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
There he is.

828
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Mary is prototype.

829
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Yeah.

830
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,700
I, I, I noticed this guy in a couple of shots and I was like, this guy doesn't have a name,

831
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
but I'm, I'm kind of interested.

832
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
He actually does get it.

833
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
I'm sure there's more to him because.

834
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
Yeah.

835
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,700
Does he?

836
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Wait, he, um, hold up.

837
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Does, does he get in?

838
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Does he get introduced and I missed it?

839
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
Yeah.

840
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Let me just, I'm looking for.

841
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Damn.

842
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Okay.

843
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
Wait, this is filed too big.

844
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Ah, I'm going to pull it out in a second, but just say what you're going to say.

845
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,700
I was going to, I mean, there's like, there's like hundreds of these guys that all have

846
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
names and numbers.

847
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
So I wouldn't be surprised if I missed one.

848
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Oh, there he is.

849
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Inky toad.

850
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,700
VSR.

851
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
What is it?

852
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Eight, 20, eight, eight, 89.

853
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,700
That's, that's pretty good.

854
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
That's not too bad.

855
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
That's not too bad.

856
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
Yeah.

857
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
I think.

858
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Yeah.

859
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,700
All of these guys are just like little OCs or characters that I created when I was like

860
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,700
younger and I'm just repurposing them.

861
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
You know, it's pretty fucking.

862
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Makes sense.

863
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Yeah, it's pretty fucking base.

864
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,700
But, um, also some of them I've been like, I think I'm going to might reuse a couple

865
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
other designs that exist out.

866
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,700
Like, like, let's say the inky toad character pops up in a non-villain verse related word.

867
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,700
You know, cause like, why not?

868
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
You know, why?

869
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,700
Yeah.

870
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Why not?

871
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
Yeah.

872
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Why the heck not?

873
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Yeah.

874
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Yeah.

875
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
I guess.

876
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Yeah.

877
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Cause, um, I think later on it's going to be implied.

878
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
There's like multiverses.

879
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
Right.

880
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Sure.

881
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Yeah.

882
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Sure.

883
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
That's that's some of it.

884
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,700
When is the is the is the villain verse going to merge with our reality and the dimensional

885
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,700
merge?

886
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
Oh, did you not?

887
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Oh, wait, hold up.

888
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,300
You gotta read the fun facts page, Ben, because I remember one said that one fun facts page

889
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,500
said that humans are extinct and a villain verse.

890
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
I remember that.

891
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I remember that.

892
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,700
Um, so, but if our dimensions merged, well, no, it must, it must be a different, it must

893
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:03,300
be a different universe than C one nine seven because there are definitely humans in C one

894
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
nine seven.

895
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,600
God, I wish, I wish, uh, I wish they wouldn't merge.

896
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,300
Um, I wish Chris, uh, Sina would read villain verse.

897
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Please.

898
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,800
That's the, that's the, you just call it Christina.

899
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Uh, is that, oh, it's Christine, right?

900
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Christine.

901
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah.

902
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Yeah.

903
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Yeah.

904
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Um, uh, that's, that's the strat.

905
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Right.

906
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
That's the marketing strat.

907
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Yeah.

908
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Christine.

909
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
That's how you do it.

910
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,800
No, no, that's how you become, that's how you become famous, wildly successful and famous

911
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,800
is you get that person to acknowledge you and then everyone respects you for your work.

912
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Yes.

913
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Yes.

914
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,800
If you, if you get her to obsess over your, um, like franchise or your, or your IP, your

915
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,340
instant, instant cash starts flowing now.

916
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:53,140
Are you on board for the hashtag save MLP movement is I, I think I retweeted it.

917
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,340
I think I retweeted your quality, but what is it?

918
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Uh, can you go in specific?

919
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
What is it?

920
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,220
I, I, at first I thought that it was just like an account that she made.

921
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,500
Now I'm, I'm not sure.

922
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,840
I think it might just be some other weirdo, but the point is it's a Twitter account dedicated

923
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:18,220
and, and a petition dedicated to get Hasbro to know, do not make, uh, uh, MLP gen five,

924
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:25,340
go back to gen four, we, we have to go back, um, we, we, we, we none of these new ponies

925
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,980
keep us with the old ponies, please.

926
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,580
And I guess they want to retcon.

927
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,640
They wanted to like, they want has, they like, literally they want Hasbro to be like, actually

928
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,100
that last episode didn't happen.

929
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,020
That flash forward to like princess twilight didn't happen.

930
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,900
That was all fake, uh, never mind.

931
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,900
We were joking.

932
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,820
It was a dream or something.

933
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,420
You know, this is like, this is not the first time you hear about like people trying to

934
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,460
petition like, Oh, fine episode is not canon anymore.

935
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,780
Like, has that actually fucking worked?

936
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,940
Like, is that like what the fuck, what's the point?

937
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,580
Uh, I wonder, I feel like, well, I mean.

938
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,640
They did, uh, Mass Effect, right?

939
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,000
Everyone complained about the Mass Effect ending.

940
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Did they retcon the ending?

941
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,240
And they didn't like, I think they didn't like change it, but I think they did maybe

942
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,440
retcon some bits of it.

943
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Like in DLC.

944
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Oh yeah.

945
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
I remember that.

946
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,600
Actually, there was like a DLC that what I'll go fix it.

947
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:35,200
I, something like, I remember Mr. B tongue was not particularly impressed with the retconning

948
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:44,300
job that they did, um, the, um, bass, I guess, uh, so I mean, I guess sometimes it kind of

949
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:50,540
works a little, it's, I don't know what's like, um, it's so, I don't know.

950
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:56,980
I wouldn't, isn't that, isn't like, I think like the current, um, the last one is a gen

951
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,980
four.

952
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
Is that, is that the one?

953
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,980
Uh-huh.

954
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Yeah.

955
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,580
So gen four is the one with Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, etc.

956
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,480
I think what's kind of really cool here is that they could kind of do like a magical girl

957
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,240
power ranger kind of thing where like each gen, they have like a certain number of like,

958
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,680
um, main six they have to like create, right, but they're like different every gen and then

959
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:27,600
they just have crossovers with previous gens, you know, like I, I anticipate, I mean, since

960
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,000
gen four was such a hit, I feel like it's a virtual certainty that we'll have references

961
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:40,460
to it in gen five and, uh, maybe, maybe even some, maybe even some character, I don't fucking

962
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,460
know, it could happen.

963
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,140
I mean, like power rangers do that all the time where they like, um, cross, they always

964
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,100
have an episode where they cross over with the previous, uh, team, right?

965
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Yeah.

966
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
Yeah.

967
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:57,540
And you know, so based, so based, so based, you know, I, uh, that one episode, that one

968
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,180
episode with like the eight, 18 different red rangers from like all the previous incarnations.

969
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,080
And I mean, I've, I've seen the Linkara, I've seen the Linkara retrospective.

970
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Yeah.

971
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Oh, big Linkara.

972
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Pretty much.

973
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:16,640
Big Linkara head shout outs to tectonic improv to tectonic improv, although that's not technically

974
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,920
about that lecture.

975
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,800
That's about, um, the Toboli flee, which the lecture does not, I guess no, the lecture,

976
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,360
I guess the, I guess the power rangers, he is in character as Linkara.

977
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
So I guess it is.

978
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,540
Is he, he doesn't do any like skits on the history of power.

979
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,060
He doesn't, he doesn't do any skits.

980
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,780
No, he doesn't, he doesn't do any skits, but I, I think he's still, I think he's always

981
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,900
like in character as, I mean, because like his, his reviewer persona is Linkara.

982
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,660
So as far as I'm concerned, if he's reviewing something, he's Linkara, whether he's doing

983
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
a bit or not.

984
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:59,060
Where does the, where does, uh, Lewis begin and Linkara and, you know, it's Lewis.

985
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,280
Lewis love hog.

986
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,000
I forgot.

987
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,280
Um, but that's pretty, that's a pretty cool name.

988
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,040
It's, it's all right.

989
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,400
It's all right.

990
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,800
It'll do.

991
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,920
I was thinking about Linkara.

992
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,320
Oh, so, um, yeah, shout out to tectonic.

993
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:19,160
Um, next time I come back, I always try to come back every two months, like motherfucking

994
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,560
Jeepers, we can't, we can't get rid of you.

995
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,040
Right.

996
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,600
Exactly.

997
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,680
You can't, um, you know, we need a little mosquito buzzing in our ears.

998
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,220
There's too many, there's too many voicemail that, that say we need more POCs on, um,

999
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,860
the PCP dog.

1000
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,620
You heard, did you, did you hear the last episode?

1001
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,340
Um, I listened to half of it, but, uh, okay.

1002
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,540
Well, if you only listened to half, then maybe you don't know about the voice.

1003
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,020
I'm dreading the voicemails this episode.

1004
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,860
I think they're going to be real bad.

1005
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,420
Okay.

1006
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,260
Let's just drag this.

1007
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,900
I think there's good can and say, Oh, we ran out of time guys.

1008
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,700
I'm with the LA's are I can edit the rest though.

1009
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,700
No voice fails this week.

1010
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,240
We have, first of all, we have a lot of them, which to me seems like a lot of people like

1011
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,000
heard the last one and maybe responded to it.

1012
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,120
And I'm, I'm, I'm a bit concerned that like the gates have been thrown open and

1013
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,800
people suddenly realized, I think the, I'm, I'm, I'm worried that the, the, the

1014
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,080
interrupting pig or whatever has like, let people know, yes, you totally can fuck

1015
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,800
with a system that, you know, overtly has no oversight or moderation.

1016
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,100
And people go, Oh my God, me too.

1017
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,060
Oh, I'm going to fuck.

1018
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,860
I'm going to make bad voicemails on purpose too.

1019
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,660
Ha, it'll be so funny.

1020
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,140
It's going to be so cool.

1021
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,260
I think it's time to hire a person to look over like all the voicemails.

1022
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,220
Right.

1023
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,620
This is, this is an app like this is a, this is an application wanted a DM

1024
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:48,500
Ben, if you want to be the, the voice, no, leave, leave me a voicemail.

1025
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,220
Leave me a voicemail telling me your qualifications.

1026
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,800
Submit your resume, uh, if you want, if you think you have what the gumption,

1027
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,800
what it takes prove to Ben, you have good taste.

1028
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,320
All right.

1029
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,600
Like leave a voicemail and say the most good.

1030
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,280
Okay.

1031
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,240
Here's, here's the thing.

1032
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,960
Here's the standards.

1033
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,120
Leave a voicemail and say the one line that proves you have good taste and that

1034
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,120
like is evidence that you'd be a perfect moderator for the voicemails.

1035
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,080
Right.

1036
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,760
It's not, it's not actually true.

1037
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,960
I think, I think if it ever hits the point where we have, where I have to

1038
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,980
start like reading or like pre-screening the voicemails, I think that's the

1039
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,940
point where I just say no more voicemails.

1040
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,500
They're over.

1041
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,980
Why don't you, um, why don't you just like listen through them while you're like,

1042
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,140
I don't know, drawing or something.

1043
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,620
Cause that sounds terrible.

1044
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,500
Cause that sucks.

1045
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,780
What, what, what more do I need to say?

1046
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
That sounds miserable.

1047
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,620
I don't, cause I don't, cause I don't want to.

1048
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,020
I guess you're getting paid.

1049
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,740
How's that for an answer?

1050
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,620
Cause I don't want to get paid enough to do that.

1051
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,220
I, the point, the point.

1052
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,140
The whole, listen, this, this is the Ben St.

1053
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,580
show now.

1054
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,180
This is my solo show.

1055
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,980
What would be the point if I listened to them before the show and then listen to

1056
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,220
them again on, on recording?

1057
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,060
Oh my God.

1058
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,380
The point is to react to them.

1059
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,860
The point is to be surprised.

1060
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:07,660
No.

1061
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,980
If, if I have to pre-screen the voicemails, voicemails are over.

1062
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:11,460
All right.

1063
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,060
So yeah, if you, if you want, if you, so listen, if, if what you want is further

1064
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,940
never to be another voicemail again, then yeah, I guess do flood

1065
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,360
the voicemail submission box with deliberately bad voicemails.

1066
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,600
I have an excellent idea.

1067
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:31,160
How about you just like, you just accept like the first, I don't know, 10 voicemails

1068
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
and the rest are instantly thrown in the trash.

1069
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,160
So people have like a, like kind of like an, a window, you know, it's like a

1070
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,080
death battle style, like voicemail.

1071
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,920
I, I guess, yeah.

1072
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,720
I mean, I guess that would be one way to do it.

1073
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,080
I guess that would be one way to do it.

1074
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,360
Right.

1075
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,800
So people can't just, you know, I mean, there could be like one guy,

1076
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,820
like, well, well, well, that's what I would do if there were just simply too

1077
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:59,300
many good voicemails rather than like being flooded with bad ones.

1078
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:00,980
You know what I mean?

1079
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Yeah, it's different.

1080
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,780
It's different, uh, uh, just like with Digimon, you know, like different,

1081
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,180
different conditions, right?

1082
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,980
Like different, like win loss ratios will let your Digimon evolve into a

1083
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,660
different champion and ultimate form in the same way.

1084
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,020
Like, you know, different qualities of voicemails will cause that segment of

1085
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,040
the show to evolve into a different final evolution.

1086
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:22,680
Right.

1087
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,160
Exactly.

1088
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,160
It's like, it's like raising your chow.

1089
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,200
It's like raising your chow.

1090
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,000
It's like, are they darker or are they lighter?

1091
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,120
You know, are they hero?

1092
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,080
I don't want them darker.

1093
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,000
I don't want them darker.

1094
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,280
I don't know.

1095
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,360
Are they a P are they a POC or not?

1096
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,280
Yeah.

1097
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,200
How neuro divergent are they?

1098
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,400
I was fucking playing Sonic Adventure, um, last night actually on my game cube.

1099
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,280
No shit.

1100
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:47,780
Yep.

1101
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:51,900
And we went to the chow guarded and the chow guarded in the first, um,

1102
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,700
adventure game is kind of, it's kind of boring.

1103
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,900
There isn't that much you could do.

1104
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,020
Right.

1105
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,420
Yeah.

1106
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,060
I think in two is where they have all the fucking little funny little fucking

1107
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,180
mini animals pieces.

1108
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,260
And I mean, I've never played any of them.

1109
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,820
So I don't know.

1110
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,380
Oh, it's probably for the good.

1111
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,300
I mean, like, look, like I love shitting on Aaron Hansen, but he was kind of

1112
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,100
right about those adventure games.

1113
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,100
Like not going to lie.

1114
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,960
Yeah.

1115
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,240
What?

1116
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,600
And that's just that they're not as good as everyone remembers them.

1117
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:19,840
Yeah.

1118
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,240
They're not as good as I'm sorry.

1119
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:28,120
Well, I mean, I mean, I've, I feel like fans recognize that like in, in cyber

1120
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,360
shell, not cyber shells in, in, in running Shine's review of it, he's

1121
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,440
just like, here's my guide to whether you'll like Sonic Adventure.

1122
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,160
If you liked it as a kid, you'll probably like it.

1123
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,800
If you didn't, you probably won't.

1124
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,760
I, I, yeah, I liked it as a kid.

1125
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,200
Like I beat the whole game.

1126
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,980
I did, I did every campaign.

1127
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,940
Um, and, and just to let you know how much like as a little kid, I liked it.

1128
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:55,180
I didn't realize like I beat like bigs, like level is like campaign, but I didn't

1129
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,940
realize that everyone on the internet actually hated that campaign.

1130
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,020
I kind of just thought like, oh, yeah, what's so bad about that?

1131
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,380
Right.

1132
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,700
Yeah.

1133
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,060
Sure.

1134
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:04,340
Yeah.

1135
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,980
I mean, as a kid, you don't fucking think about those things.

1136
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,740
Um, no.

1137
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:09,460
Right.

1138
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:09,700
Right.

1139
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,380
Exactly.

1140
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,820
Um, so we got a shitload of voicemails, right?

1141
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,940
There's quite a few.

1142
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,300
Yeah.

1143
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:16,900
Okay.

1144
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
Why you want to get to him?

1145
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,820
I mean, uh, I want to say it, if you want to, if you want to, uh, if you want to,

1146
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,380
I kind of want to say two last things before we do that.

1147
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:34,180
Um, I mean, you're more than welcome to say, you're more than welcome to say as

1148
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,100
many things as you, as you want to say.

1149
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,460
Actually, I have another news, but go on.

1150
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,980
No, no, no, baby.

1151
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,780
No, no, after you, no, after you, you know, by what it means.

1152
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,760
No, after you, no, I insist.

1153
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,920
No, but I insist.

1154
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,000
Listen, you're, you're a person of color.

1155
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,520
You're higher on the purpose of stack.

1156
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,720
You need to be platformed ahead of me.

1157
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,880
We need to, we need to elevate your voice.

1158
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,640
So please speak.

1159
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,840
I command you.

1160
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,360
Oh God.

1161
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,040
Okay.

1162
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,440
All right.

1163
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,560
I, I'll go first.

1164
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,480
When a white, when a white man tells me, never mind.

1165
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,240
I take it all back.

1166
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,520
When a white man tells me to speak, I will speak.

1167
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,160
You are right.

1168
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:07,920
That's right.

1169
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,680
That's right.

1170
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,920
I mean, I mean, I mean, I, it's complicated.

1171
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,240
Okay.

1172
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,220
I think I was going to say that, like, uh, yeah.

1173
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,420
Shout out to take tonic.

1174
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,020
Uh, next time I come back, I want to take tonic back.

1175
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,900
Love that guy.

1176
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,860
Um, shout out, shout out to his podcast, journalism, not included or journalism,

1177
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,100
not guaranteed my bad.

1178
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:26,620
Yeah.

1179
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,780
It's pretty good podcast.

1180
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,660
Oh no, I did a, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, baby.

1181
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,940
But, um, what else are you going to say?

1182
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,420
Yeah.

1183
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,020
Uh, read villain verse, uh, pre-orders will be on Monday.

1184
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,780
Um, fuck the Cato anthology.

1185
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,140
Just buy villain verse.

1186
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,060
I'm sorry.

1187
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm sorry.

1188
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,200
You're like, I would have done the Cato anthology, but like I have my own.

1189
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,560
Well, now if you, if listeners, if you hate cheesy and you hate villain verse,

1190
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,960
then you should buy the Cato anthology out of spite, cause that would make him

1191
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,520
really mad.

1192
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,320
Those are the two teams it's.

1193
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,760
And same, and same for if you really hate the Cato guys, you should buy villain

1194
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,440
verse out of spite.

1195
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,440
Cause I, I, they told me this was in DMs.

1196
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,600
I won't show screenshots.

1197
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,280
They told me that they would be so mad if people bought villain verse.

1198
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:11,900
Yeah.

1199
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,900
I'm ironic ruin their day, like behind, like, um, I was, I was supposed to be on

1200
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,900
the Cato Cato anthology episode, but then Ben told me, like, yeah, um, they,

1201
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,700
they don't fuck with you.

1202
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,420
So you can't, they hate you.

1203
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:27,380
They told me, they told me like that guy's toxic.

1204
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,100
He, he, he saw what I post on Twitter.

1205
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,580
They say I'm too political.

1206
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,900
And in my opinion, they were absolutely right.

1207
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,780
I wish I had the courage.

1208
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:35,980
Right.

1209
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,780
So I wish I had their courage.

1210
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,540
I wish I could tell cheesy to a stupid fucking face.

1211
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,840
You shut the fuck up on Twitter.

1212
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Yeah, but I'm too, I'm too fucking scared though.

1213
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,000
Too cocked.

1214
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,200
They'll do those teams.

1215
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:48,920
These are the teams.

1216
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,920
Team Cato versus team villain.

1217
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,480
Uh, which side are you on gamers?

1218
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,000
Uh, comment below.

1219
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,800
Yeah, please.

1220
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Yeah, please.

1221
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,440
Okay.

1222
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,640
I, I think, uh, okay.

1223
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,120
That's it.

1224
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,840
Uh, all right.

1225
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,000
Uh, see you later, Ben.

1226
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,760
I'm like, no, I want to complain.

1227
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,080
I want to complain about my life.

1228
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,840
All right, all right, baby.

1229
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,120
I broke, I broke my fucking toe again.

1230
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,580
Remember how I did that before?

1231
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:10,860
Yeah.

1232
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,500
You remember how I've done that like five times?

1233
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,260
Why it happened again?

1234
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,660
Was it the same piece of furniture?

1235
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,700
No, I'll, I'll go through the history of my, of my feet.

1236
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:28,340
Um, the, the first time I broke my toe was when it was in this house, same house

1237
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:33,180
I live in now, I was coming down the stairs and I missed a step and I like fell

1238
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,140
on my foot and I broke my.

1239
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,000
Metatarsal the like side bone on the side of the left foot.

1240
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,040
And then at Radcon two, I think I was, I was during the, I think it was during

1241
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,160
the Tony Hawk pro skater, let's play that Jesse and Vic were playing.

1242
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,160
I run through the door and I stubbed my toe, my left toe, same toe, different

1243
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,760
bone against like a piece of furniture, break it, go to the hospital.

1244
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,320
Oh my God.

1245
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,840
Uh, yeah.

1246
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,300
It happened again.

1247
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:09,220
I don't even remember when it happened again, but I like basically the same

1248
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,860
thing, stub that same left toe.

1249
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,780
This time I didn't go to the hospital because they don't do anything.

1250
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,660
All they do is tape it to your next toe and give you a sandal to wear.

1251
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,020
And they're like, wear the sandal.

1252
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,580
Don't walk on it too hard.

1253
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:23,660
Yeah.

1254
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,540
So that's what I did.

1255
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,540
So, and that's what I'm doing this time, but this time it's my right foot.

1256
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,740
This is the first time I've broken my right, my right pinky toe.

1257
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,480
I was, I was working on my game.

1258
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:41,320
Patreon.com slash Ben St joined my patron discord channel where I post

1259
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,080
exclusive updates.

1260
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,440
I've been posting updates there.

1261
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,680
I've been posted whips, works in progress for those that don't know.

1262
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,000
I've been posting sprite art.

1263
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,200
I've been posting like animations, being like, Hey guys, check out this coming

1264
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,000
along, new feature added, new feature added.

1265
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,800
The updates are coming fast and loose.

1266
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:05,460
Um, I want, and I, and I was in the zone and I was like, all I want to do

1267
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,060
tonight is just grind out sprites.

1268
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,420
I know I just have like a hundred sprites to grind out.

1269
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,300
I just want to grind them out.

1270
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:17,060
I'm going to go and buy some alcohol and just get a little drunk and just kind

1271
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,940
of zone out and do it.

1272
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,140
And that's what I did.

1273
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,620
And it worked great.

1274
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,300
It was working.

1275
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,180
The plan was going according to plan.

1276
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,100
It was going perfectly.

1277
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:31,020
I wasn't the night was still young and I had gotten plenty done and I had run

1278
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:31,360
to get plan.

1279
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,120
I was in the zone and then I go to the bathroom and I'm coming out and I'm

1280
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,800
little uncoordinated and I just my toe against the door frame smashed it.

1281
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,200
It's horribly bruised.

1282
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,240
It still hurts.

1283
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,920
I still hurts to walk on it.

1284
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,640
Uh, and I am upset.

1285
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,880
My summer is ruined.

1286
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,240
Uh, this is, this comes on the heels.

1287
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,340
No pun intended of me needing to go and like, I need to be house hunting.

1288
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,500
I need to be out on the streets, looking for a new place to live.

1289
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,540
And now I can't fucking walk without it hurting.

1290
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,540
Damn.

1291
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,660
This is awful.

1292
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,900
It's like you're, you're like a curse or something, you know?

1293
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,180
I, it's, it's, it's, it's not fair.

1294
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,180
You know what?

1295
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:13,660
It's not fair.

1296
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,220
You know, it's not fair.

1297
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,380
It's, it shouldn't have been me.

1298
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,220
It should have been you.

1299
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,260
I wish, I wish it was you instead.

1300
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,100
You know, it's funny.

1301
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,940
Just right before I got into the recording, I did stuff my toe on like the

1302
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,400
doorframe of my bathroom.

1303
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,320
Right.

1304
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,920
Well, you should have stubbed it harder in solidarity.

1305
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,400
It's, it's, it's annoying.

1306
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,560
I don't, I don't know.

1307
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,760
It's hard to tell if the bone is broken or not.

1308
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,520
It doesn't look like bent or anything.

1309
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,520
It was quite bruised for a while.

1310
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,840
The bruising is, is letting up a little bit.

1311
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,600
Um, it doesn't hurt to like push.

1312
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,480
I can touch it and it doesn't hurt at all.

1313
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,680
And I can like stretch my toes up and that doesn't hurt at all.

1314
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,420
But when I curl my toes down, it feels weird.

1315
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,180
It hurts.

1316
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,860
And if I walk on it, it hurts a little bit and it's, it's uncomfortable.

1317
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,820
It's got a weird feeling.

1318
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,300
I think the bone is like micro fractured or something.

1319
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,020
Yeah.

1320
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,260
I'm just bummed.

1321
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:04,900
I'm just bummed.

1322
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,740
You're bummed.

1323
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,020
What, what, what, uh, bones.

1324
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:08,340
Yep.

1325
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,780
You're bones.

1326
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,180
It's sad.

1327
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,100
It makes me sad.

1328
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,820
I am like, when I think about it, I'm just like, oh, that's unfortunate.

1329
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,580
An unfortunate thing happened to me.

1330
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,020
Why?

1331
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,580
Why?

1332
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,460
Why, bed?

1333
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,820
Well, why, why must this straight?

1334
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,500
Why boys suffer so much?

1335
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,680
Why must, why must dad things happen to good people?

1336
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,200
You know what, Ben, I'm, I'm being honest with you.

1337
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,160
Here's my honest opinion.

1338
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,920
I don't, I don't believe that you, you broke in your toes or any of your toes

1339
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,680
in any, all, I think all those stories are fake.

1340
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,280
Um, okay.

1341
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,640
And, but I think the only way you can probably, the only, the way you can

1342
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,000
probably prove to me that those toes have been broken.

1343
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,360
If I don't know, if you took a picture of them every time you're like, I don't

1344
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,760
know, stop them and you DM them to me, you know?

1345
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,660
Uh, man, it was very purple.

1346
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:57,300
It was very purple and splotchy and horrible looking for a day there.

1347
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,860
Uh, it's, it's bad.

1348
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,900
It's a little better now.

1349
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,100
It's just kind of like red.

1350
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,100
The bruising is letting up a bit.

1351
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,620
Ugh.

1352
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:10,180
Um, I just want to, I just want this, it came, this happened right as.

1353
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,180
Oh yeah.

1354
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,340
The rad content has started to come out again.

1355
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,980
The, um, did you see the Brad lecture?

1356
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,420
I saw, I saw half of it.

1357
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,020
Yeah.

1358
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,420
It's a, it's funny.

1359
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,100
I don't know.

1360
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,060
I remember it.

1361
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,580
Like it was only yesterday.

1362
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:27,380
So watching, watching it again, I'm like, it's so weird.

1363
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,580
All the, all the comments were so like melancholy.

1364
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:39,340
All the comments I noticed that all the comments are like, damn, it's just sad.

1365
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,100
Like watching what it used to be.

1366
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,780
And it's like, look at the state of things.

1367
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,540
Now it's, it makes me sense.

1368
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:52,000
And up, you've, chin up, you fucking, you fucking, you fucking saps you fucking dweebs.

1369
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,800
Get over it.

1370
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,680
I should have come life has changed.

1371
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,000
I should have commented on that.

1372
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,400
I was going to, I, I was going to comment like, damn, I, I, oh, like seeing them like

1373
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,560
this now, I, I hope that my comic could somehow travel through time and they could

1374
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,240
see my comments and just warn them of things to come.

1375
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,800
Warn them of the things to come.

1376
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,160
Yeah.

1377
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,600
Yeah.

1378
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,600
You can tell them, no, there will, no, there will be a pandemic.

1379
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,780
No, coronavirus.

1380
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,900
No, go becoming trans.

1381
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,060
No, watch out, it's coming.

1382
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:28,900
It would be like, it would be like Oedipus, like, um, was it the fucking fortune teller guy?

1383
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,380
The Sphinx, the Sphinx, right?

1384
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,740
Or was it the Oracle?

1385
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,060
I don't know.

1386
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,620
That was like a, you know, the Oracle tells, um, Oedipus dad that like his son is going

1387
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:42,460
to kill him and bone his, um, his wife and he like tries to prevent it from happening,

1388
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,660
but it happens anyway.

1389
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,800
So I go back in time and I warned them about, oh, you're all going to transition and that's

1390
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,400
going to throw out the PCP.

1391
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:58,680
Everyone, no, it was the Oracle warns Oedipus's dad, but I think, I think at some point he

1392
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,560
has to answer a Sphinx's riddle.

1393
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,400
I'm like 75% sure that happened.

1394
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,080
I think it's, I think it's referenced in the story that he does that.

1395
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,960
It's like a previous adventure, right?

1396
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,960
Previous adventures.

1397
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,480
Yeah.

1398
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:12,920
Yeah.

1399
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,720
World building.

1400
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:14,920
Yeah.

1401
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,600
A lot of world building, you know, it's like, it's like in, um, Star Wars, uh, new hope

1402
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,440
when, uh, Princess Leia said that you help my father in the Clone Wars and you're

1403
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,520
wondering, whoa, where are the Clone Wars, right?

1404
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,640
Um, that was Ben Kenobi that said that.

1405
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,720
He says we fought in the Clone Wars and Lucas, you fought in the Clone Wars and then

1406
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,040
Solid Snake, and then Solid Snake goes Clone Wars.

1407
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,040
Uh, what's that?

1408
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,800
Man, Star Wars sucks.

1409
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,280
It's garbage.

1410
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,740
I, I agree.

1411
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,260
I'm not a fan.

1412
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,340
It's overdone.

1413
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,060
It's overrated.

1414
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:48,940
There I said it.

1415
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,180
Sucks.

1416
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,820
Except for episode eight.

1417
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,660
How would you say something so controversial and yet so?

1418
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,580
I'm going to say it.

1419
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,540
I'm not scared to say it.

1420
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,980
I'm not going to, I'm not scared to say it.

1421
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,460
Star Wars kind of lame.

1422
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,660
You're kind of a big nerd.

1423
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:08,860
I wish I had your courage, cheesy to call out the Star Wars to call out Star Wars.

1424
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,420
I have a biggest media property in the universe.

1425
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,560
If you say that, they're going to come down on you.

1426
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,160
I'm going to say this, the fist of an angry guy.

1427
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,360
Villainverse is better than Star, Villainverse is like, if Star Wars was good, I'll

1428
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,240
tell you that much.

1429
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,880
I would, I would say it.

1430
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,840
I would say it.

1431
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,720
If the corporate, if the corporate oligarchy didn't have their thumb on my, on my.

1432
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,640
Yeah, I can't afford to speak the truth like you.

1433
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,480
I'm not free.

1434
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,880
Villainverse is more nuanced than a Star Wars and Star Wars is like, what?

1435
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,920
Oh, I'm, oh, I joined the dark side.

1436
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,920
I'm a bad person.

1437
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,060
Oh, I joined the light side.

1438
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,580
I'm a good person.

1439
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,900
I got like, oh, okay.

1440
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:44,540
All right.

1441
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,420
Very child, very straightforward, very simple for man, children, you know,

1442
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:52,420
Villainverse, it's like, Villainverse, like looks you right in the face and says,

1443
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,300
like, bro, like capitalism, kind of bad, kind of not good.

1444
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:01,140
It causes a lot of villains, causes a lot of villains, if you will, which, which panel

1445
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,980
is that the ending, the ending of Villainverse, the villains just grabs you by

1446
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:10,700
the scruff of your fucking shirt and grabs you the viewer and

1447
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,080
speaks through the fourth wall.

1448
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,840
It says, I am a metaphor for capitalism.

1449
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,080
I invented capital.

1450
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,080
That's what the villain says.

1451
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,560
He invented all that as E1.

1452
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,600
Then he says capitalism.

1453
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,720
He also says he invented Star Wars too.

1454
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,920
But that's, that's, that's, that's, this is Joey.

1455
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,040
That's just, that's just a little, that's just something for the fans.

1456
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,560
Cool.

1457
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,240
Um, God.

1458
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,160
Shit.

1459
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,160
All right.

1460
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,760
Do you want to go?

1461
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,800
Do you want to start voicemails?

1462
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,860
Yeah, let's go to voicemails.

1463
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:45,140
Let's, let's, I will, we're going to blast through them because I fucking hate

1464
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,020
all these people.

1465
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,580
I hate, I hate their, their, I hate their solo.

1466
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,860
Oh, I'm so funny.

1467
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,420
Oh, I'm so clever.

1468
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,540
I made a voicemail.

1469
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,900
I used a voice modulator.

1470
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,900
I played the piano.

1471
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,460
Um, all right.

1472
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,140
Here we go.

1473
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,340
First voicemail is called.

1474
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:05,900
Giga fa de fa three, three, two, one go.

1475
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:23,420
Why though, why though, why though, okay, next one, why though, next one is called here we go.

1476
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,860
It's called Mike Hunt.

1477
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,580
Three, two, one, go.

1478
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,620
Yo, Ben, finally looked at that Kato collection thing you've been chilling for the last 20

1479
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:39,740
to 30 years, saw the cover you drew, gotta say, boy, that shit ass piece.

1480
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,660
I don't, is he saying the cover is shit ass?

1481
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,140
I, I, is he saying the cover is not bad, it's like it's a bad cover.

1482
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,500
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

1483
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,620
I'm, I'm, hey, can you, can you offer any more specific, can you offer any more specific

1484
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,180
criticism?

1485
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,060
You're just jealous.

1486
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,340
You're just jealous that you didn't get to draw the cover.

1487
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,300
That's what I think.

1488
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,660
Uh, okay, whatever.

1489
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,540
Next one, huh, what?

1490
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,980
You guys want to say, you guys want to say?

1491
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,720
I don't care, Ben says, I don't care about the cover.

1492
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,600
I ain't reading that shit.

1493
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,440
Next voicemail is called drive through Joe.

1494
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,520
Three, two, one, go.

1495
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,160
Absolutely.

1496
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,320
Right away, sir.

1497
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,280
Okay, I get it.

1498
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:41,660
Next one is called, uh, wait, what did something happen?

1499
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,860
He just started screaming.

1500
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,500
Nice.

1501
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,820
I'm glad I stopped listening.

1502
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,100
Next one is called message for Gib and the gang.

1503
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,180
Three, two, one, go.

1504
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,060
Fuck you.

1505
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:00,380
Ben no, Saint, Tom, Oliver currently makes $400 plus a

1506
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,140
Patreon.

1507
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:01,660
Okay.

1508
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,540
And Saint is not.

1509
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,120
That just, yeah, that, I mean, that's proof that Tom is better

1510
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:07,680
than Ben.

1511
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,880
That's, that's true.

1512
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,160
I mean, that's true.

1513
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,720
I know he's better.

1514
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,840
He's better looking.

1515
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,000
He has a bigger cock.

1516
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,480
You know, it's taller.

1517
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,920
It's like that old, it's like that old, uh, it's that old, uh, Mr.

1518
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,880
Schoes get more money equals better than it.

1519
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,600
Yeah, I never thought about it.

1520
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,120
I never thought about how true it was, but the average Ben

1521
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:33,900
Saint fan and the average Tom, Tommy Oliver, enjoyer, you

1522
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,860
know, Oliver, Oliver, enjoyer has the average Tommy Oliver,

1523
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:42,380
enjoyer has about 25% more money to give to, you know,

1524
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:46,340
creators that they value, um, and good for them.

1525
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,700
Yeah, that Ben is advocates too much for lower income people.

1526
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,180
So those lower income people only get a little bit of money.

1527
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,700
It puts off the, it puts off the high rollers.

1528
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,100
Right.

1529
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:57,820
Exactly.

1530
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,400
Um, next one is called sad, but surprisingly, no, sorry.

1531
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,760
Next one is called smashly three, two, one go.

1532
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,000
So in the last episode, you guys were talking about the image you

1533
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,080
used for the podcast of the graveyard.

1534
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,760
Um, you guys realize that's like a military cemetery, right?

1535
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,280
That's why all the two stones are the same.

1536
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:24,080
So basically you guys have been like desecrating soldiers, graves,

1537
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,320
pigs coming out of cars for like several months now.

1538
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:34,660
And honestly, that's pretty big military, the American

1539
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,380
imperialist machine.

1540
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,740
Um, absolutely.

1541
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,460
I know, I know, you, I know people are going to be like, Oh,

1542
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,900
my brother was in the, oh, my dad's like, they're an idiot.

1543
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,180
They're fucking idiot.

1544
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:46,140
I said they're idiot.

1545
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,420
Brother is a victim of a, of a system that made them fucking

1546
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,540
throw their life on their fucking chopping block.

1547
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,460
They got exploited.

1548
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,820
American oil dolly.

1549
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,140
They did, they did.

1550
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,640
They should feel bad about it.

1551
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,520
They shouldn't be proud.

1552
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,800
I don't, I'm sorry.

1553
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,920
Like there's no honor in being exploited, you know, sorry.

1554
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,880
I don't, I agree.

1555
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,360
The hard truth.

1556
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:04,880
I agree.

1557
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:05,440
Right.

1558
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,520
Good voicemail.

1559
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,680
Finally, I like, I like that one.

1560
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:10,960
Uh, okay.

1561
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,040
Next one is called, um, wait, sorry.

1562
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,120
We got, do the, do the one that's numbered three, three, two, eight, three.

1563
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,520
Uh, next one is called a sad, but surprisingly enticing boy.

1564
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,460
Three, two, one, go.

1565
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,860
Hey, Ben, I designated your Kato anthology cover to be

1566
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,100
asked a couple of days ago.

1567
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:38,540
That's right.

1568
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:41,740
I had some time to think about my words and I wanted to apologize.

1569
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,660
That cover was a mess.

1570
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,940
That assessment was way to harsh of me and that stepped out.

1571
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,380
Agreed.

1572
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,180
Sorry.

1573
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,500
We all make, that shit, but though we all make

1574
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,120
mistakes.

1575
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,480
Well, we all make mistakes.

1576
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,080
It's cool.

1577
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,560
Did he say that shit fucks though?

1578
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,280
Is that what he said?

1579
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,840
I think, I think it's, he said it's shit, but yeah, that, that shit, but that shit,

1580
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,760
but so, you know, motion in the right direction.

1581
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,280
All right.

1582
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:13,440
Okay.

1583
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,720
Next one is, next one is called wholesome w or L in disguise.

1584
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,520
Three, two, one, go.

1585
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,760
I'm really baffled on Twitter right now and I want to know what you guys think.

1586
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,420
You know, when someone can't afford their medical expenses and their family has to

1587
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:29,180
like sell possessions or open it, go fund me in order to pay for it.

1588
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:29,700
Sure.

1589
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,980
I'm like, wow, that's fucked.

1590
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,700
It's a failing of the system and it's a tragedy that it would be put in that

1591
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,220
scenario.

1592
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:34,740
That's right.

1593
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,580
So from dudes posting their w is a situation that is exactly identical,

1594
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:43,260
except it was a kid got a bunch of donations after selling his Pokemon cards in

1595
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,500
order to pay for his dog's medical treatment.

1596
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,940
This is not to say that dogs should be under like the healthcare system, but

1597
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,600
the point is that regardless, it's a situation that is still fucked in all

1598
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,480
the same ways, yet everyone on Twitter is treating it like it's a wholesome W.

1599
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,000
Like what do you really think it's a W for this kid that the only thing keeping

1600
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,360
his dog from fucking death is the sale of his Pokemon cards?

1601
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,760
No, you're insane.

1602
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,360
Yeah.

1603
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,920
Why do you feel about the count of men posting their W's?

1604
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:20,060
I mean, most of the time when I see it, it does seem pretty wholesome.

1605
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:21,860
Mm hmm.

1606
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:26,100
I don't know if I think I think I've seen that one that he's talking about.

1607
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:26,540
I get it.

1608
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:32,540
I like, they seem pretty like I, it's interesting to see like the contrast

1609
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:36,420
between like men posting their W and women posting their W.

1610
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,820
Like the majority of women posting their W is like, oh, I graduated.

1611
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,940
Oh, I got a doctorate.

1612
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,500
Oh, like my journal got to play.

1613
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,200
I got a job or whatever.

1614
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,520
Yeah, I used to be a felon, but now I got a, I'm a lawyer.

1615
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:49,880
Yeah.

1616
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,840
It's all like very kind of like education, like these big achievements.

1617
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,200
But like men posting a W is kind of like, oh, I just kept kicking this little

1618
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,840
rock and I was just having fun with it.

1619
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:04,200
And it's, and I think that says a lot about society.

1620
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,160
It's a lot of like, it's the ones that I see are usually like, like a good

1621
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:15,020
Samaritan man, like help someone out or, um, I mean, I don't know.

1622
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,300
I'm a little torn on this one because like, yeah, I don't know if I think

1623
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,260
that like animals should be covered by universal health care.

1624
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,700
And if we had, I don't know about that.

1625
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,740
So it is, it's kind of nice.

1626
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:27,780
I mean, it's nice.

1627
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,700
It's pretty heartwarming to think that a kid like sold it.

1628
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,100
Do kids even collect Pokemon cards anymore?

1629
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:37,240
I mean, I mean, it's like, I think it's one of the fucking Paul brothers

1630
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,020
made Pokemon cards popular again.

1631
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:45,100
I see, you heard the story about like all these people now buying a shit load

1632
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:45,700
of them, right?

1633
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,380
Oh, oh, yeah.

1634
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,460
I thought that was magic.

1635
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,980
I thought like people were like fucking lining up and like storming stores

1636
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,340
for like the new magic set or whatever.

1637
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,300
Is it Pokemon too?

1638
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,700
Yeah, it's, it's, it's Pokemon.

1639
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,140
Like people are buying like Pokemon.

1640
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:03,460
Yeah, like I think now one of the, one of the polls, like on their podcast,

1641
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:07,860
they like do a lot of Pokemon unboxing videos, Pokemon card unboxing videos.

1642
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:08,100
Right.

1643
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:08,760
I mean, it makes sense.

1644
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,720
Like I like was a kid when Pokemon first came out.

1645
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,040
Right.

1646
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,560
So, you know, weren't we all bringing it back?

1647
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,320
Huh, not me.

1648
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,280
I'm not a nerd.

1649
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,760
Nevermind.

1650
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,280
I grew up on how old, how old are the Pauls?

1651
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,120
Are they like 30?

1652
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:30,360
They're like 20, I think they're around my age, maybe like 25 or wait.

1653
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:34,840
So, so if he was a kid when it came out, then you would have been a kid

1654
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,800
when it came out because the generation that came out with the

1655
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,340
generation I remember as a kid when in elementary school, it was a Ruby version.

1656
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:48,420
Like that was the, that was, yeah, it was, um, yeah, it was home in that region.

1657
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:48,780
Right.

1658
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,700
And then a Diamond and Pearl.

1659
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:50,900
Right.

1660
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,860
Those were like the big two I remember.

1661
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,780
So, so yeah, it was a, you were a kid.

1662
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:56,140
Okay.

1663
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:56,500
Okay.

1664
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,260
I got you.

1665
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:00,660
Um, well, I don't know.

1666
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,580
I think it's pretty sweet that a kid sells his Pokemon cards to save his dog.

1667
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,660
I think, I think that is heartwarming.

1668
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,400
No, I think I'm going to go with it is a W.

1669
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:14,720
I think it's, um, I have this weird, like, if I can like analyze both like

1670
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,440
accounts of like, when posting their W and men posting their W's.

1671
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,640
Wait, wait, before you, before you do that, before you do that, I just, okay.

1672
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:27,720
Yeah, it's like, yeah, I, I guess I do, I guess I do have to agree that the kid,

1673
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,880
the kid's dog probably should have had been able to get that fucking dog

1674
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,560
surgery without selling his Pokemon.

1675
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,160
I don't know.

1676
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,740
Yeah, I, I see what you mean.

1677
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:41,580
It's kind of, it is kind of sad that like, if the story hadn't gone viral or

1678
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:45,020
whatever, if someone hadn't picked up the, then like, oh my God, this kid

1679
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,740
selling his Pokemon cards to save his dog.

1680
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:47,340
That's so sweet.

1681
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:47,940
Let's donate.

1682
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,620
Like if that hadn't happened, then the dog dies.

1683
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,260
Right.

1684
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,580
The kid sells his Pokemon cards.

1685
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,620
He still can't afford it.

1686
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:55,860
The dog dies.

1687
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,860
I mean, yeah, he's fucking terrible.

1688
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:01,020
So I guess it's like, what do you choose your Pokemon cards or your dog

1689
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,580
living, right?

1690
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,740
Well, it's really sweet that the kid would choose his dog.

1691
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,240
Right.

1692
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:05,760
Exactly.

1693
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,920
I mean, probably a lot of kids would, but it's nice.

1694
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,080
I mean, it sucks that like the surgery costs.

1695
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,440
I mean, just like, well, pets are like a luxury, right?

1696
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,520
And so of course it's going to be fucking expensive, you know?

1697
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,320
Yeah, a little bit.

1698
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,080
I don't know.

1699
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:20,480
I don't know.

1700
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,880
Vashh hasn't made a video about pet health care, so I have no opinion.

1701
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,480
Yeah, it's true.

1702
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:25,920
Yeah.

1703
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,040
So we got to move on.

1704
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,040
We got to move on.

1705
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,480
We're not, we're not qualified to speak on it yet.

1706
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,120
Okay.

1707
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,600
But what were you saying about the two accounts?

1708
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:39,620
Like, I think it's kind of interesting about like, you know, about, um, obviously

1709
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,260
patriarchy, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1710
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:47,980
But, um, like the, what, what is like the standard for, for men having a W and

1711
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:51,140
what's like the standards for like a woman, right?

1712
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,260
Or like, I don't think this is on purpose.

1713
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:57,020
It just might be some sort of subconscious shit where it's like, for a woman,

1714
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,300
it's like, they have to have a degree.

1715
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,700
They have to have a high paying job.

1716
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,400
Like that's like the W standard for women, like a tire.

1717
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,560
And for men, it's kind of like, bro, I just found a sick ass stick and

1718
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,680
I'm just hitting stuff with it.

1719
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:08,640
Right.

1720
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:09,960
Yeah.

1721
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:16,040
I haven't seen, I haven't seen any men Ws that are just like, lol, I found a cool

1722
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,320
rock that looks like Abraham Lincoln or like some, I haven't seen any like goofy.

1723
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,440
I'm sure there are some.

1724
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,800
I, I swear, I swear, there was like one where, um, oh great.

1725
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,860
There's like a shitload of like men posting their Ws accounts.

1726
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:31,180
Huh.

1727
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,540
I'm looking for the one, I think, well, there's, but there's the one, but

1728
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,580
there's the one big one.

1729
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:35,860
Yeah.

1730
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:40,100
The, the, the one with, with Leonardo DiCaprio, right?

1731
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:40,420
Yeah.

1732
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,420
Is the icon.

1733
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:41,900
Yeah.

1734
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,060
Yeah.

1735
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:48,180
I'm like looking for it, but I'm seeing like ones about like ones where it's

1736
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:52,780
like men posting their W, but they have like the Swedish gamer.

1737
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,940
Um, Swedish gamer.

1738
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,600
Well, the guy, the guy was like, no, the guy who says yes.

1739
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,160
Oh, the guy was like, gamer.

1740
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,920
The, I, I've never heard him called that before.

1741
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,040
Isn't, isn't that what that meme is called?

1742
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,400
Or what the guy was just saying?

1743
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:08,840
Yes.

1744
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,000
And he has like the Chad look.

1745
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,680
Yeah.

1746
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:15,720
You know, I don't know what is, I, I, if you'd asked me, like what is he called?

1747
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,320
I don't know what he's called.

1748
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,040
Maybe he's called Swedish gamer.

1749
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,880
I would call him, I would call him Nordic.

1750
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,840
Oh, wait, it might be Nordic gamer actually.

1751
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,280
Hold up.

1752
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,560
He's not, he's not always a gamer though.

1753
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,160
No, but I think the original, sometimes he's just a head.

1754
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,320
I think the original version was like supposed to be a gamer.

1755
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,200
Yes.

1756
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,520
Chad, also known as Nordic gamer.

1757
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,040
Yeah.

1758
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,520
He's when I, I mean, when I think Chad, I think, you know, tiny beetle like

1759
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,960
stride arms perpetually in contra posto.

1760
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,120
Well, I cannot out shirt.

1761
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,240
I cannot find the fucking.

1762
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:59,900
How can you not find the men posting their W's?

1763
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,060
It's so weird.

1764
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:01,460
What the fuck?

1765
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,180
I can't find it.

1766
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,060
It's called, it's called dudes posting double.

1767
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:04,620
I found it.

1768
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,420
Oh, it called dudes.

1769
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:06,460
Yeah.

1770
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:07,860
I found it right away from a Google.

1771
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,900
It's called dudes posting W's.

1772
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,260
Ironically funny and wholesome DMs open for submissions.

1773
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,540
Dudes post.

1774
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,220
Oh, okay.

1775
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,980
I found dudes posting their W twos.

1776
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:30,520
I mean, I see the guy who called an Uber for a, an injured bird, um, uh, a biotech

1777
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:37,800
startup has 3D prints, faked rhino horns, poached rhinos.

1778
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,960
I'm going to do my own, um, I'm going to make my own fat guy who lost a bunch of

1779
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:46,200
weight, I'm going to do my own like, uh, dudes posting their W's account, but

1780
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,780
every post it just so happens to be like about someone making a comic.

1781
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:53,380
That's just constantly, that's the only W I acknowledge.

1782
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:57,620
And I'm sort of just looking at all these W's too many, a lot of like, a lot of

1783
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:06,260
like fitness and like health related W's, uh, things in things that people

1784
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:12,260
invented, you know, heartwarming moments of like personal, you know, with, with

1785
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,580
helped a kid do something.

1786
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,320
What do you, what do you think about like wholesome, like wholesome accounts?

1787
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:23,240
I always feel weirdly suspicious about anyone who like parades as like a wholesome

1788
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,320
type, you know.

1789
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,120
Well, I mean, I mean, the guy who runs the like women posting their L that guy,

1790
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,040
um, it's not blackpilled.com.

1791
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,240
It's, uh, he's like, uh, what's that guy's fucking name?

1792
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,560
I, I, I can't remember, but I know he has like some sort of podcast where he's

1793
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,880
like a huge misogynist.

1794
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:44,700
He has like a Duke Nukem avatar or something.

1795
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,140
It redux something redux, doesn't he?

1796
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,940
Doesn't he kill a redux?

1797
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:55,260
Doesn't he also run the bad movies, opinion account or like bad film takes?

1798
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:59,220
He, he runs a bunch, he runs a bunch of account of like gimmick accounts.

1799
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,220
And he sucks.

1800
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:01,180
He sucks really bad.

1801
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:06,580
And sometimes his, and sometimes his L's are just like, I was raped.

1802
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,140
Like sometimes that's, like, oh my God, yeah, exactly.

1803
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:15,120
It's so fucking, I remember back when he, when he was running like bad film

1804
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,120
takes, like just any, like, any, like film take where someone shits on the

1805
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,920
Star Wars prequels, he would consider bad by the fault.

1806
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,640
And everyone just kept pointing it out.

1807
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,160
So cool.

1808
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,120
I just kept saying like, well, like the, yeah, the peaks, the prequels aren't

1809
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:28,800
that good, bro.

1810
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,680
And like, why the fuck are you constantly defending them?

1811
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,840
And, and he would just quote, he would just like screenshot the tweet and just

1812
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,240
post it as the bad take.

1813
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,640
Oh my God.

1814
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:39,540
Okay.

1815
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:42,780
I saw, I saw an account.

1816
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,060
Uh, whatever.

1817
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:47,380
What?

1818
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,820
Yeah.

1819
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:52,380
The, the, the wholesome ones, the W's accounts, they generally seem okay.

1820
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,180
Like I haven't seen very many W's that are like, ooh, that's kind of

1821
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:58,980
problematic that you could really, you're calling that a W.

1822
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,300
I think the W's accounts are fine.

1823
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:01,660
Whoa.

1824
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,460
I mean, I'm not going to fall.

1825
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:03,220
I don't care that.

1826
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:03,500
Whoa.

1827
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,700
Father, make sure his children are all of lighter skin.

1828
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:06,900
Whoa.

1829
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:07,660
W, bro.

1830
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,200
Whoa.

1831
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:16,560
Father, father, father, uh, uh, convinces his, his trans daughter to be a boy again.

1832
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,000
I'm good job.

1833
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,720
To de-transition.

1834
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:18,440
Whoa.

1835
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,760
This doctor convinces teenagers to de-transition.

1836
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:23,120
Whoa.

1837
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,400
Um, based.

1838
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:24,960
Whoa.

1839
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,520
Epic.

1840
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,480
Based.

1841
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:32,280
Next, next voicemail is called, um, what is this called?

1842
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,280
Based Ben, based Ben.

1843
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,480
Three, two, one, go.

1844
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:44,940
Based Ben, Homestuck was at its best in the early parts and it peaked in act four.

1845
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:46,860
Uh, I agree.

1846
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,020
Yes.

1847
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:48,620
Yeah.

1848
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:49,820
You haven't read Homestuck, have you?

1849
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:55,180
No, I've not, but, um, but I'm going to, I'm just going to say my hate it.

1850
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,380
Okay.

1851
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:01,580
Homestuck got, Homestuck got really popular with the addition of the trolls,

1852
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:06,180
which was in like act, it's kind of started, I think in act three, but they got

1853
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,520
more and more prominence through acts like four and five.

1854
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,760
What's, uh, what's your take on the trolls?

1855
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,560
Do you like the trolls?

1856
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,680
They're, they're, I don't dislike them.

1857
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:18,080
They're fine, but I mean, I, I think they're good even.

1858
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,120
I like the part, I like act five.

1859
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,400
I think act five is good.

1860
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,000
It was just, um, my favorite part of Homestuck is the early part, which doesn't,

1861
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,600
which it's not good because it doesn't have trolls.

1862
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,440
It's not like the trolls are ruined it by being there.

1863
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,680
It's just my favorite part is the early part, which doesn't have any trolls.

1864
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:40,380
And it's very focused on this very like goofy, very problem, sleuthy kind of

1865
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,620
like just sort of winging it, like coming up with weird shit and like giving it

1866
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:50,340
weird, funny names, and then like just kind of making up rules as you go along.

1867
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:54,140
And then like really, really rigidly adhering to those rules, even when it

1868
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,540
doesn't make any sense, uh, which the story becomes more of a, the story becomes

1869
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:03,020
more of a traditional narrative as it goes along in lockstep with like the

1870
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,720
trolls becoming more and more prominent.

1871
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,720
And I think, you know, I think that has more mass appeal.

1872
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:09,320
Right.

1873
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,720
So it makes sense.

1874
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:11,120
Right.

1875
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,520
But that's, that's not what hooked me about it though.

1876
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,220
Did you have them?

1877
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:14,620
Yeah.

1878
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,520
This guy's base.

1879
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,120
You guys, you guys, you guys talked about the cycloneos, Anthony, right?

1880
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:25,920
We, oh, I don't think we.

1881
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,520
Cause I, I think we said we were going to do a, a cast about it and I

1882
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,720
haven't reread it yet.

1883
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,520
Oh, damn.

1884
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,620
Cause I, I, I read, I read all of it.

1885
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,020
Yeah.

1886
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,320
And I, I don't think.

1887
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,120
Yeah, you've read it.

1888
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:37,520
Yeah.

1889
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,320
We can, we can talk about it here a little bit.

1890
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:39,920
Oh yeah.

1891
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,520
Well, so how, how do you feel?

1892
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,420
Spoilers.

1893
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,020
Spoilers for cycloneos.

1894
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,020
How do I feel?

1895
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,220
Um, you know what?

1896
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,620
I don't, I don't want to go too deep into it because I do want to record

1897
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,520
that cast with Gibb.

1898
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,620
I think all I'll say is that like about the ending.

1899
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:55,220
Yeah.

1900
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:55,520
Yeah.

1901
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,920
It, go on.

1902
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,220
I, it's Fight Club.

1903
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,020
The, what?

1904
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,320
Cycloneos is Fight Club.

1905
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:06,920
They're literally almost the same story.

1906
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,620
Um, okay.

1907
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:12,520
Let me explain.

1908
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,420
So I see what you mean.

1909
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:14,520
Right.

1910
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,520
So there's like in Fight Club, both are about main characters who, um,

1911
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,820
who like created an alter ego and they create like a movement and it becomes

1912
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:26,120
like kind of massive, like huge, almost like out of their hands, right?

1913
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,520
And then like at the end, he has to like have a confrontation with his

1914
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,920
alter ego and then he kind of realized that that's like what he really

1915
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,420
wanted was like, like a human connection, like a relationship, right?

1916
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,320
And that's kind of like what cycloneos is.

1917
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,820
Like, like, if you read like kind of like the little epilogue thing with

1918
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:47,220
the note in the bottle, it's like, she says, like, loves, like loves the

1919
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,020
answer, right?

1920
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:53,220
And, and I thought, yeah, I guess that's okay.

1921
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:58,420
But I thought it was okay to me, like, I guess as a resolution, that's fine.

1922
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:03,520
To me, the story was not like about finding love.

1923
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,020
So like the fact that it ends in that way is a little like, okay, I guess.

1924
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:09,320
Whatever.

1925
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,120
I guess, I mean, it could be like, you probably make the argument

1926
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,020
that's like, oh, influencers and like, what do they need?

1927
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:18,320
Like what, like maybe this void that she was filling with me and an

1928
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,520
influencer could have been just filled with like loving someone.

1929
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,120
Hold on.

1930
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,220
She wasn't, I'm going to, I disagree.

1931
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,920
She doesn't, she doesn't fill the void by becoming an influencer.

1932
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:34,320
She fills the void by becoming like a fucking warlord.

1933
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:34,720
Yeah.

1934
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,720
Do you, I mean, do you, do you think they're basically one in the

1935
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,620
same in, in the, in the story of cycloneos?

1936
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,720
I mean, I'm not, I'm not like surprised.

1937
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:47,520
Like that's, that's like what Andrew Hussie is trying to like tell us.

1938
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:48,520
Right.

1939
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:48,820
Yeah.

1940
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,420
I think in retrospect, I think I probably overhyped myself too much

1941
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:56,320
with like the socialist angle because it doesn't really go into.

1942
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:04,120
Honestly, the conclusion is very like, oh, you know, everything's

1943
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,420
kind of inevitable.

1944
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:10,120
You know, anything ideological is just kind of like the fact

1945
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,220
that the fact, the fact that the clown revolution, this is very

1946
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,320
spoiler, the fact that the clown revolution is left wing is like

1947
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,620
very incidental and ends up kind of not mattering at all.

1948
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,420
Like it's just a, it's just a thing.

1949
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:23,920
Yeah.

1950
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,320
It's just an aesthetic, which I guess is kind of the point because

1951
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:34,120
like, oh, this is actually a like alien mind plot, which, okay,

1952
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,520
makes sense.

1953
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:40,320
But yeah, I guess it's a little disappointing that like the movement

1954
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,020
itself and what it stands for is not really important.

1955
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,420
Not what the story is about.

1956
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,620
It kind of doesn't even have an opinion about it.

1957
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,120
Right.

1958
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,520
Like really, like it's really more about like.

1959
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,520
Human connection.

1960
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,720
And I mean, that's fine.

1961
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,720
But you know, like, like, I don't know.

1962
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,420
Like I was thinking about this and I was saying like, I love

1963
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,420
rewatching Fight Club.

1964
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,520
I think rewatching Fight Club is pretty great.

1965
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:06,020
I don't know if I like want to like, maybe I'll reread

1966
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,720
Cycloneos eventually again.

1967
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,620
But it's I am going to reread it.

1968
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,620
I think it, I don't know.

1969
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:15,820
I think there's a chance that I might like it less on my second read.

1970
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,020
I, but I think there's also a chance I might like it more.

1971
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,820
I genuinely don't know what I'm how I'm going to feel about it.

1972
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:24,120
Because I know that you I you made the same.

1973
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:27,420
You chose the same thing I did at the ending, which is the crown.

1974
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:27,820
Right.

1975
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,520
Because because to me, that's way more interesting.

1976
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,820
Yeah, absolutely.

1977
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,220
She chose to me.

1978
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:34,520
Yeah.

1979
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:36,220
It's more.

1980
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,220
Here's my calculus.

1981
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,920
It's more interesting.

1982
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,620
I would say that there's a this is so spoilery.

1983
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,720
Whatever, I'll fuck it.

1984
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,820
I will elaborate more on this in the eventual in the

1985
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:53,020
eventual Cycloneos cast, but the the choice at the end

1986
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:57,620
between sword or crown, it's like there's a calculus because

1987
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:03,720
this being is telling you like what is to be one if you if

1988
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:08,620
you take the crown and what she's offering is like huge what

1989
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:12,420
she's she's basically offering you like pseudo immortality

1990
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:17,220
and like cosmic power and it's like if she if that's true,

1991
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,320
then like obviously you should take the crown like anything

1992
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:24,020
else you could get by refusing the crown is not as good.

1993
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:27,520
But there's a chance that this is just a delusion that you're

1994
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,020
having and none of this is real in which case if you take

1995
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,920
the crown, you're basically just going to die for no reason

1996
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,320
and you there's nothing to be gained in which case like don't.

1997
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,020
So yeah, in the end, I'm like, well, is this a delusion or

1998
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:40,920
is this real?

1999
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,020
I don't know.

2000
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:45,120
But yeah, it's a more interesting story if I just go for it.

2001
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,220
And so I'm going to go for it.

2002
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:49,620
I think I think a part of me was like because like when I was

2003
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:52,620
reading the last chapter, a part of me was like didn't want

2004
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:56,520
to accept that because I had a I had a rousing suspicion that

2005
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,020
like the final message was going to be all you needed.

2006
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,520
All you need is love and that's so dull.

2007
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:06,220
That's so like it's not it's not it's not super exciting.

2008
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,920
Like yeah, like I don't like it's like and then it kind of

2009
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,920
makes me rethink about like Andrew Hussey and it's kind of

2010
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:18,220
like, yeah, this guy is like a rich white guy like it's like

2011
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,120
I mean a rich fucking white guy who wrote this like all you

2012
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,520
need is like fucking like come on.

2013
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,920
It's so it's so frustrating.

2014
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,120
I started I see what you mean.

2015
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,620
I see what you I mean.

2016
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:32,820
I feel like it's it's sad because I feel like Hussey is genuine

2017
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,820
in his politics.

2018
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,020
He is like a he is like a Bernie bro.

2019
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,220
I think he is like left-wing and anti-capitalist in his

2020
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:42,720
personal life, but that's not really that's that's only here

2021
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,020
in psycholonials like aesthetically right and it's not

2022
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:47,320
really a theme.

2023
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,920
I've been very kind of like we're realizing a couple of

2024
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,020
things about like I've been thinking a lot like works of

2025
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:55,920
media like did you did you hear recently about like the the

2026
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,720
Bo Burnham like special and there's like a clip.

2027
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,120
Sure.

2028
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,020
Yeah, there's a clip that going around where like this like

2029
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,320
sock puppet the sock.

2030
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,320
Yeah, I like mentioned the problems capitalism and people

2031
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,720
were calling that radical when it's not it's not radical like

2032
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,920
the thing is like here's the thing.

2033
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,320
I haven't I haven't seen the special special is good.

2034
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,920
I like the contact special is pretty good.

2035
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,520
I like the special but that being said it's not radical like

2036
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:21,120
it's not radical to say capitalism is bad.

2037
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,020
That's not radical at all.

2038
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,620
What's radical is like what do you do about capitalism?

2039
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,320
That's radical, right?

2040
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,520
And I think yeah and there's like only a handful of works

2041
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,220
that I feel like are very explicit of what to do about

2042
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,520
like capitalism and I think the first one that comes to mind

2043
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,120
is like the movie sorry to bother you.

2044
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,420
That one's like very explicit of like what do you do about

2045
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:41,820
capitalism, right?

2046
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,620
Is that the one with the white voice?

2047
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,220
Yes, you got to watch that Ben.

2048
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,420
I think you haven't I haven't I know that one but I haven't

2049
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:47,820
seen it.

2050
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:50,720
It's really it's really good but and and then it got me

2051
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:54,120
thinking about how I like like I love One Piece.

2052
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:58,420
I think One Piece has like moments that feel very like left

2053
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,220
but there's like other moments that feel very like like the

2054
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,420
fact that like it a lot of the arts kind of end with like

2055
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,820
reinstating a monarchy, right?

2056
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,620
Which is pretty which is pretty unbased I'll I'll say it's

2057
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:14,520
pretty fucking pretty unbased pretty unbased and in my

2058
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,820
head I see it so easily like the fucking social is shown in

2059
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:22,220
it's so visible in my head right like it's easy like it's

2060
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:24,820
like it's like you it's like you take like the One Piece

2061
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:28,120
formula of him going around helping like disenfranchise

2062
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,520
people on different island and then he unifies the people

2063
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,920
right like like on paper what Luffy is doing and at times in

2064
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,920
the narrative it does seem pretty like radical but then what

2065
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,920
they actually yeah what they actually do a lot of the time

2066
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:47,120
is they they fight they fight a terrorist and they reinstate

2067
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,120
the monarchy.

2068
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,520
Right exactly it's totally do yeah it's like a lot of

2069
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,120
reinstating monarchies and I guess it goes back to like

2070
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:56,820
because probably in Luffy's head it's all like oh yeah I want

2071
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,320
to be the pirate king and here I am helping other kings am I

2072
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:06,520
right and it's so I mean it's so annoying yeah it's it started

2073
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,820
making me reflect on my he's got class solidarity Luffy's got

2074
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:13,420
class solidarity with like the Shichi Bukai and stuff like

2075
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:16,020
really they have the same because they're all on the same way

2076
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:20,220
but that's you know it's just like it's just like Tim Rogers

2077
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:25,820
and and Vito Giswaldi and fucking Mr. Bob's game or whatever

2078
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:28,820
they're all they're all the elites they all control our

2079
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:32,120
lives they're all in a big club and you and I aren't invited

2080
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,420
right exactly fucking Grimes isn't a fucking communist she's

2081
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,620
fucking she's rich.

2082
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:41,120
Yes, you're right like she's an example of course she's going

2083
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,320
to fucking date someone like Elon Musk actually communists

2084
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,020
should like my billionaire boyfriend owning everything

2085
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:52,420
because he's going to make a spaceship one day it's so fucking

2086
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:56,820
frustrating God it's like it's making me reflect a lot on my

2087
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,620
work like I'm gonna say this right now that I mean like

2088
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,020
all villain versus like capitalism bad right and like

2089
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:05,420
I'm not gonna say that like villain versus radical at all

2090
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:07,920
it's not it's not like radical but I think from now on I'm

2091
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,120
gonna try to like make sure my works are a little bit more

2092
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:14,420
radical right cuz I'm just so tired I'm so tired of like

2093
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:18,420
stories that are very like all you need is love or like like

2094
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,620
or humans are stupid right or it's it's kind of like I'm so

2095
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:23,920
tired of stories where it's like humans are these aren't these

2096
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,520
aren't radical messages yeah it's not like I know humans are

2097
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,020
stupid I live with humans all my fucking life I know they're

2098
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:31,820
fucking stupid I want a story that's like yeah humans are

2099
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,820
stupid but like you know we got to still do good despite of

2100
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:37,820
it you know we got to like like change it so it's so

2101
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:41,320
frustrating you know and I guess I got fucking tricked I got

2102
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:44,120
tricked by because Hussey was like oh here's clowns and

2103
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,320
communism and I'm like oh base but no it wasn't base it was

2104
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:54,720
actually cringe anyway it's like a 7 out of 10 I can't really

2105
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:58,420
disagree with you I'm gonna I'm gonna do a reread I'm gonna do

2106
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:03,620
reread but I agree it's too aesthetic I mean not I mean not

2107
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:08,020
not not every story has to be no of course message message

2108
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:12,820
laden some times a story can just be about a bunch of really

2109
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:16,920
powerful guys fighting each other right like like that's fine

2110
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,520
like that's fine too yeah don't get me wrong it's just I'm

2111
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,420
tired of being kind of like like tease you know I'm tired of

2112
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:26,520
like um no I hear I hear you I'm tired of getting like like

2113
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,420
fucking I'm getting edged all the time everyone's fucking

2114
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,920
edging me all like give like give me a theme like the theme of

2115
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:37,720
psychologials is definitely not you know it's definitely not

2116
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:42,220
that like the workers should own the fruits of their

2117
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:45,120
production productive labor right like that's not what the

2118
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,920
story is saying it feels almost like maybe just ideology is

2119
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,320
inherently destructive or something which I think is a very

2120
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,820
like yeah brain dead fucking take on it because everything

2121
01:30:55,820 --> 01:31:02,520
is ideology yeah you're at yeah it's very much like like I

2122
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,820
said this before in the end it doesn't matter what the movement

2123
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:08,120
was about the movement was doomed to be co-opted by you

2124
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:12,220
know the the power hungry right it was going to take the same

2125
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:15,820
form no matter what happened it's so which I mean maybe

2126
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:20,220
maybe that's true but it's not radical yeah yeah it's not

2127
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:23,820
right it's not radical right I mean yeah okay not every piece

2128
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:26,820
of work has to be radical but like I like I like stories like

2129
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:31,020
devil man I think they'll man is like pretty good because I

2130
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,920
think it's I haven't read it it's pretty it's pretty short

2131
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,120
actually like the man goes not too long I would recommend

2132
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,920
just like watching devil man cry baby but anyway here's here's

2133
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,720
devil man here's devil man if I wrote it this this would be

2134
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:49,920
me yeah hell yeah there's devil there's devil man if I had

2135
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,620
read it right there's devil man once you read the man's gonna

2136
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,120
make more sense you're gonna be like oh it was capitalism

2137
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:59,720
the real enemy was it actually capitalism no it was it was

2138
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:06,920
God it was God and the inherent like the ultimate theme and

2139
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,020
like devil man it's kind of like human fear is like

2140
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:14,020
incredibly destructive right sure right make sense and then

2141
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:16,720
there's like a there's like a little moment in devil man

2142
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:19,720
where it's kind of like I'm gonna unify all the devil people

2143
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,220
together and I'm like oh yeah base awesome right but that's

2144
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:25,220
like only like towards a little bit towards the end and then

2145
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:29,420
it kind of it has like a spoiler is like a sad ending I guess

2146
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:35,120
you know a good story anyway 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 all

2147
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,820
right let's let's move right along all right cool we've we've

2148
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:41,820
got another voicemail here this one that I posted before it is

2149
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:48,520
called what is it called a glimpse into the future bends

2150
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:55,620
ascension three two one go the year is 20 xx Boston has become

2151
01:32:55,620 --> 01:33:01,120
a massive super city now known as megachucin space neo

2152
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:06,420
American England a true capitalist hellhole this is where

2153
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:10,720
our story begins in the slums a small apartment with Ben

2154
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:15,820
Saint hard at work on his keto gummies it was upon a certain

2155
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:20,220
day there in a Thursday that Ben Saint perfected his keto

2156
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:25,020
gummy recipe Saint consumed the first of the batch but he would

2157
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:29,620
find no need to consume another as the slime shaped gummy dissolved

2158
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:34,720
into Ben's gut all of his chakra gate flung open and he entered

2159
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:40,520
a state which many only theorized of 13th level ketosis

2160
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,020
rapidly releasing energy Saint's apartment and much of the

2161
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:49,720
city block was consumed in a blaze Ben nowhere to be seen

2162
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:54,520
the naysayers assumed he was dead but soon signs would be

2163
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:59,720
found that Ben had not perished in the fire but ascended no

2164
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:06,920
longer Ben Saint but Ben God this is the future before you even

2165
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:11,520
now the hands of fate move ever closer to the eventuality this

2166
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:16,520
the really based future I gotta I guess I better get back to

2167
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:21,420
making the gummies again because my substitute for the

2168
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:25,420
isomalt oligosaccharides the Alulose it just isn't very good

2169
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:28,120
I haven't had good results with that it's been very discouraged

2170
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:31,620
very discouraged and can't you not buy this isn't that the

2171
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,420
replacement for like another ingredient that you like ran out

2172
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,120
over something

2173
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,120
no it was it was the isomalt oligosaccharides where the

2174
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:44,420
powder that I can't get from China anymore Alulose is like

2175
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:48,820
another it's like another sweetening powder that I saw the

2176
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:52,220
the the product that inspired me the sweet smart this sorry

2177
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:55,220
the smart sweets that inspired me to try making them they

2178
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:58,520
changed their recipe they still taste all right they switched

2179
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,720
from isomalt oligosaccharide to Alulose I was like well I guess

2180
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:05,120
I'll try Alulose and it's not good you're not it's just taste

2181
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,820
weird I like not like mixing it right and the proper ingredient

2182
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:12,320
you're not you're not turning the knob correctly maybe

2183
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:16,920
I may have like cooked it too much and given it's sort of

2184
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,320
like a burnt flavor in like trying to cook it down and

2185
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:24,020
like dehydrate it to make it chewy because it's like has

2186
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:29,020
like a sort of caramely flavor that I didn't that sounds good

2187
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:31,620
when I say like that but it's not good it's it's not good

2188
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,620
anyway it's true it's all true next voicemail is called a

2189
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:43,420
fuck been saints that mp3 3 I said what I was thinking

you take the cake so there's 102 we're all feeling blue

2193

anime been you're as lame as any fantasy sleep will ever be

Oh that's why we were just talking shit about you really here.

2231
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:18,420
That's right.

2232
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:19,020
That's right.

2233
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,820
Yeah I should have crashed the podcast.

2234
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:25,220
Yeah we have a rivalry now you and I we are we're rivals in

2235
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:25,820
the sense.

2236
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:29,020
Are you hot hot blooded rivals.

2237
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:31,820
Yeah yeah yeah we established earlier.

2238
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:35,120
Yeah I was talking mad garbage about Kato and I told people

2239
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:38,820
don't read the Kato anthology read my comic villain verse far

2240
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:43,420
superior now there's two teams team villain team Kato right.

2241
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:47,720
Oh my goodness yeah yeah that's the only way I recommend you

2242
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,420
also read it had to be it had to be this way I recommend you

2243
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:52,920
also read villain verse so you know your enemy you know.

2244
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,620
Right of course you want to know who you're dealing with.

2245
01:38:57,020 --> 01:39:00,220
The one way to settle this right of course you just everyone

2246
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:02,320
has to read both and come to their own conclusion.

2247
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,120
Okay yeah okay read both which one read Kato.

2248
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:09,220
Yeah look all I got to say is that Kato needs like how many

2249
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:12,820
people are in the anthology we have 10 come okay Kato needs

2250
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:17,720
like 10 people to make one comic villain verse just one guy

2251
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:23,320
and there's five chapters and a prologue for her numbers don't

2252
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:26,820
lie numbers don't lie I'm just saying you're I'm saying

2253
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:28,920
there's going to be a lot more villain verse they need to be

2254
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,720
catching up on then Kato.

2255
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:36,520
I don't want to forget about Kato to try to do everything by

2256
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:39,620
yourself wait wait I'm sorry man I turn to you I'm sorry

2257
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:42,620
what you say hoodie and I believe in the power of friendship

2258
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:45,720
we don't try to do everything by ourselves and that's why we

2259
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,420
will defeat a villain like you.

2260
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,920
Yeah okay she's a young man for someone you're taught you

2261
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,120
talked really you talked really big about about wanting socialism

2262
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,920
but I mean you know you seem like you're the sole owner of

2263
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:00,320
the means of your own production.

2264
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,320
That's just a little much.

2265
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:09,120
No I swear I can't I ever do anything on YouTube without

2266
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,120

Hey PCP monotone bitch here.

2309
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:40,720
A couple weeks ago I called and I like pee pee poo poo.

2310
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,720
I don't understand why you want to draw comics.

2311
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,720
I just like illustrations because I'm a lazy loser terrible

2312
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,020
and I actually read you all sorry and holy shit because

2313
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:48,820
they're so cool.

2314
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,820
Then aside from the insanely strong character writing my

2315
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:54,320
favorite part of the Vapors is how you play with lighting

2316
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,320
and the lack thereof.

2317
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:58,220
Wow that page in the first chapter where Vincent is walking

2318
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:01,020
at the games club and it's all dark and everything made me

2319
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:02,820
kill myself because it was so good.

2320
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:06,320
Yeah Lord of ghosts and give you have all these sick panel

2321
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,820
layouts like when the flower head slices the blood worm in

2322
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:12,020
half and I'm just like whoa whoa that's so cool.

2323
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,620
Anyway I finished that and now I have two comic pages sketched

2324
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:17,320
out and I'm going to do another one after work.

2325
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,020
So thank you guys for being so inspiring I guess fucking hell

2326
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:21,420
yeah.

2327
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,220
More voicemails like this where you just gush about how cool

2328
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:26,120
our stuff is.

2329
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,720
Got another one.

2330
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,720
Yeah I got I just I just happened to be a little bit

2331
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:36,320
looking at I had Saint comics open the other day and I just

2332
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,220
happened to be open to I think the exact page you're talking

2333
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:43,020
about where he's walking down the path and like the lanterns

2334
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:47,120
are on and he sort of has this little shadow is coming off

2335
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:51,820
of his feet and he'd like the silhouette of the of the buildings

2336
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:53,920
in the background I think I know the exact panel this guy's

2337
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,420
talking about I thought he was going to say the one where

2338
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:59,620
Vincent comes through the door and he's sort of like shadowed

2339
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:05,320
in the front with the the the the the what's the word for the

2340
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:09,120
little dots that you put on a comic the screen tone though

2341
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:12,320
he's got the screen tone shading on but no no the inky the

2342
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:15,620
inky blackness of that night with the bubbling lights of the

2343
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:20,420
of the lanterns the the the the light the light posts yes

2344
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:25,220
thank you guys.

2345
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:30,320
The villain versus pretty cool that guy hey that guy gig a gig

2346
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,020
a chat or whatever his name is got some Kirby crackle coming

2347
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,820
out of his head I mean that's oh yeah I'm a fucking I'm a

2348
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:39,420
fucking sucker I'm a simp for the Kirby crackle I'm a big Kirby

2349
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:47,220

2350
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:50,520
I think he deserves simps yeah more than stand there I said

2351
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:55,720
it was wait wait I'm him saying that he now is working on

2352
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:58,520
a comic just made me realize something you guys know about

2353
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:03,920
the Eisner's yeah yeah I saw Casey I saw Casey Noak tweeting

2354
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,120
about the Eisner's and saying that they suck the other oh they

2355
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:13,320
do but I still want one anyway sure and I think I know how

2356
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:16,520
so apparently like this year that they're like doing these

2357
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:19,820
forms where if you're just working if you just work in the

2358
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,220
comic book industry you just fill it out and then they'll

2359
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:25,620
send you like some sort of like email where like you get to

2360
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:28,920
vote on who wins but and then and and the thing is that it's

2361
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:32,420
just like an open link like anyone could get the link and I

2362
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:35,220
applied for it because I like technically self published

2363
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:39,320
something right and I'm seeing I'm seeing if maybe if that

2364
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:42,220
allows me to be able to vote which makes me think like

2365
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:46,420
maybe I could rig the Eisner's or like one of my things to

2366
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:49,920
that's what I'm hoping because like it may be because what's

2367
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,320
like exact like this because it's like what what what are the

2368
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:57,120
qualifications do I have to have worked in the big two or just

2369
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:00,020
like those indie stuff count if I indie and like relevant enough

2370
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:03,520
that's fine because there's like so many people who don't work

2371
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,920
or Marvel and DC who who are like mostly indie guys and

2372
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:09,620
they're getting like Eisner's even people who do like web

2373
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:13,620
comics you know like they get Eisner's too so it's like you

2374
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:16,920
have to just like make a comic to get an Eisner so I'm thinking

2375
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:20,820
because I'm pretty soon in the next couple of months I'm

2376
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:23,320
doing this one podcast with like my other with other like

2377
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:26,220
friends who also make comics and we're going to really push

2378
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:28,420
like our audience to make comics and I'm thinking like if I

2379
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:32,320
get enough of my audience to have published a comic in a way

2380
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:36,420
maybe I could get them to sign up to do Eisner voting and then

2381
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:37,820
like rig it so I win.

2382
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:43,020
That's my and if you can swing it. Yeah, that's swing it.

2383
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:44,720
What do you say?

2384
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:48,720
She said Casey Noak said God the Eisner's are stupid congrats

2385
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,620
to the four or five people who deserve it and dumb grats to

2386
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:55,220
Craig Thompson and the rest of the mediocre dipshits.

2387
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:59,420
I don't know who Craig Thompson that sounds very aggressive

2388
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,120
is your is your your comics Gator.

2389
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,920
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

2390
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,120
I have no clue.

2391
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,520
Craig Thompson's graphic novelist best.

2392
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:12,920
Oh, I've heard of some of these ways.

2393
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,420
Is he like a groomer or something?

2394
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,820
I couldn't tell you because like every other like graphic

2395
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:21,520
novel motherfucker turns out to be like some sort of groomer

2396
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:21,920
creep.

2397
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,520
Just he made he made blankets.

2398
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,920
I think I've heard of blankets blankets covers familiar.

2399
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,120
I think I've seen it in stores.

2400
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,520
Wait, I think I own.

2401
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:36,720
No, wait, Trixie loaned me that book.

2402
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,720
I think but I never read it.

2403
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:43,220
Damn thing unless I'm confused.

2404
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:43,820
I don't know.

2405
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:47,220
I think you should read more Daniel Klaus.

2406
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:49,620
Yeah.

2407
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:53,820
Yeah.

2408
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:54,220
Yeah.

2409
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:54,520
Okay.

2410
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:54,920
All right.

2411
01:47:55,620 --> 01:48:00,520
Next voicemail is called next voicemail is called

2412
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:03,820
um it's called.

2413
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:04,320
Yeah.

2414
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:04,820
Okay.

2415
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,820
Three, two, one, go.

2416
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:08,520
All right.

2417
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,520
So I'm probably like the fucking millionth person to say this

2418
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,620
exact same shit.

2419
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:15,120
Yes.

2420
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:19,420
But you know, I go away for a while and I come back.

2421
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:20,620
Oh, everybody's different.

2422
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:21,220
I know the pony.

2423
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:25,320
You see these different show up and there's no fucking pony

01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,420
He said he said the line.

2441
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:12,920
He said it more voicemails like this.

Hmm.

2445
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,220
No, I don't know.

2446
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,620
I don't got a fucking vote in that.

2447
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:25,320
No, I'm just I'm just I could I could if I wanted to just

2448
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:28,320
voice grail this person on my own, but I would feel wrong.

2449
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:29,720
I'm just I would feel wrong.

2450
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:32,520
I'm just fan favorite reoccurring guest cheesy Manfredo.

2451
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,320
I have no say in the grail or not.

2452
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,120
True.

2453
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:38,020
Okay.

2454
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:44,520
Next voicemail is called grill ish three two one go.

2455
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,520
Then why don't you like the dick show?

2456
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:49,720
Give what are your thoughts?

2457
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,620
Why don't I like the dick show?

2458
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:54,120
Well, I don't.

2459
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:55,820
Go on.

2460
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:56,920
He's annoying.

2461
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:58,620
He is annoying.

2462
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:01,520
He's yeah, he's annoying.

2463
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:03,820
It's I I don't know.

2464
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:06,420
I think like, like, look, don't get me wrong.

2465
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:10,020
Cheesy Manfredo loves a good misogynistic joke here and there.

2466
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:10,420
Right.

2467
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:17,020
But I think I think Dick's whole bit is like incredibly like overplayed at

2468
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:17,520
this point.

2469
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,320
What I don't.

2470
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,420
What even is his bit?

2471
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:20,820
Does he even do any bits?

2472
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:22,620
Like I don't even think anything is a bit.

2473
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:26,120
I the thing is like all of his fans like think he's all of his fans think

2474
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:29,520
he's a fucking genius and that he doesn't really he doesn't believe

2475
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,320
in anything he said, but he's been saying the same shit for like years.

2476
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,520
Now he's he's he's like.

2477
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:38,520
Remember that time Tim Poole was like from now on.

2478
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:40,620
I'm just going to say random shit all the time.

2479
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:42,820
So no one knows what I really think about anything.

2480
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:45,620
Dick is like that, but he didn't actually say it.

2481
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:48,020
All his fans just assumed it for him.

2482
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,520
Yeah, it's so weird.

2483
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,520
Like, oh my God, what's this?

2484
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,520
Like is Dick is Dick a genius?

2485
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,420
Like I don't see it.

2486
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:01,820
It's so Dick is a someone's responded to me on Twitter the other day and they

2487
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:06,620
said the thing like Dick being a gene like the idea that Dick is smart

2488
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:11,420
probably came from the fact that he was on biggest problem and Maddox is so

2489
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:14,120
dumb and Dick looks so smart in comparison.

2490
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:18,620
Oh my God, like Dick seemed like a genius at the time because he because he

2491
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:20,320
clowned on this on this idiot.

2492
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:23,820
This idiot this idiot that people used to respect.

2493
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:25,720
He clowned on him really hard.

2494
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,620
He made him look like a fool and then he fucking bounced off of that and he

2495
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:33,320
got a bunch of clout over it and he made a bunch of money and it's like,

2496
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,720
yeah, he sure did.

2497
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:39,920
He that sure was a that sure was he sure was a dude posting a W right

2498
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,320
there.

2499
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,920
He is the embodiment of dude posting the W.

2500
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:43,920
Am I right gamers?

2501
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:44,920
But what is that really?

2502
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,220
What does that really say about him other than the fact that Maddox is an idiot?

2503
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:49,020
Nothing.

2504
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:56,520
No, I find these content creators who like capitalize on comment wars about

2505
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:57,220
the dumb shit.

2506
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:03,920
They say very interesting that kind of is that kind of is the the the cycle.

2507
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:04,120
Right.

2508
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:10,520
It's like say say something say something that will annoy people and then and

2509
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:15,720
then make sort of a public spectacle about like, you know, responding to or

2510
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:19,320
or, you know, doubling down on or or even apologizing.

2511
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:21,020
You can play it any number of ways.

2512
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:24,220
But the way you get clout is you say something that annoys a lot of people

2513
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:27,220
and then you make a big show about responding to the outrage.

2514
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:29,120
And I mean, that's all he does.

2515
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,720
That's all that's all veto does.

2516
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:34,420
That's all anyone around the people who defended you at the start

2517
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,320
will just stick around.

2518
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:36,720
Yeah, right.

2519
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,920
They'll never change their mind.

2520
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:43,320
So do you guys remember when you guys know the game, Yic right?

2521
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,020
10 out of 10 game.

2522
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:49,620
Oh, the Y2K the postmodern the postmodern RPG.

2523
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,120
Right.

2524
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:50,620
Exactly.

2525
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:54,020
You know, like that guy was like that guy is like a fan of the Dick show

2526
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:56,720
and he even put Dick in Andrew Allinson.

2527
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:58,420
He put Dick in the game.

2528
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:58,620
Yeah.

2529
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,320
Dick's in the game.

2530
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:02,720
You could meet him and I think he has like voice over lines too.

2531
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,720
And he gives you a red pill.

2532
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,020
No, no, no wonder.

2533
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:06,920
No wonder that game came out so good.

2534
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,120
No wonder it was so epic.

2535
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:11,020
I mean, the thing is that I think like it's funny because the whole game is

2536
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:14,120
about kind of like about this like straight white guy like kind of

2537
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:17,020
reflecting on his character, right?

2538
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:20,320
But the game like the game does like a terrible job of doing that.

2539
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:23,320
And I think I think evidence of the fact that maybe this guy could

2540
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:29,020
never truly reflect on being like a straight white guy is due to the fact

2541
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:30,320
that he's like a Dick show fan.

2542
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:34,120
Like I think that's like evidence that he probably could not do this

2543
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:36,320
like introspective on himself, you know.

2544
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:42,620
I mean, yeah, it's it's it fits.

2545
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:48,620
It fits my it fits my my serial killer like forensic profile

2546
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:52,420
style understanding of like the listener of the to the Dick show.

2547
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:53,120
Oh, yeah.

2548
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:55,120
Yeah, I do that too.

2549
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:59,620
I feel like I think at some point I thought that Dick Masterson

2550
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:03,920
or the Dick show seemed like Jordan Peterson, but for people who don't

2551
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,720
think they need to improve.

2552
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:11,720
Like like if you if you're like, oh, man, I'm all fucked up.

2553
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,820
You know, oh, my I got to get back to my traditional values and sort

2554
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:15,520
my life out.

2555
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:16,820
Then you go to Jordan.

2556
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:20,820
But if you're like, I'm gonna I'm fine.

2557
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:21,920
You know, it's just fucked up.

2558
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,520
But like I'm kind of above it.

2559
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,620
I don't care any.

2560
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:25,820
I don't care that it's fucked up.

2561
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:27,420
Like I actually kind of like that.

2562
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:31,920
Then you're like then you go to listen to the Dick show instead, which way

2563
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,520
Western man obviously just women are just terrible.

2564
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,320
Like on ironically, well, I mean, either way.

2565
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:38,020
Yeah, either way.

2566
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:44,620
Obviously, we can all agree on that as we unify this brings us brings us

2567
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:45,220
together.

2568
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:45,620
Yeah.

2569
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:47,520
Anyway, sometimes dicks have some funny stuff.

2570
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:48,620
That's about it.

2571
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:51,320
I have I have laughed at a few.

2572
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:54,320
I mean, I thought that I thought the biggest problem was pretty funny,

2573
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,920
but I just don't think he seems like a very good guy.

2574
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,920
I don't think he's a good person.

2575
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,820
I don't I don't agree with anything he does.

2576
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,820
I just yeah, I think he's I think he's garbage.

2577
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,920
Yeah, garbage funny guy.

2578
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:11,820
But I mean, and I mean, and I mean the the the the Maddox thing was funny

2579
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:14,220
back in the day, but that was like six years ago.

2580
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:17,920
And yeah, I know that like Maddox Maddox brought the lawsuit against them

2581
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:19,120
and that was pretty shitty.

2582
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,420
And like, okay, yeah.

2583
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:23,620
Still like that's the thing.

2584
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:25,520
And like who who cares anymore?

2585
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:30,320
In my opinion, I hope that answers your question.

2586
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,520
Anyway, yeah, what?

2587
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,620
Yeah, Dick Masters in front of the show.

2588
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:35,220
A great guy.

2589
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:35,820
Ten of ten.

2590
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:37,620
He come on some time.

2591
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,020
Hey, buddy.

2592
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:39,620
Next.

2593
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:43,220
We should have you we should have you and him on to debate.

2594
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:45,520
Oh, you should debate.

2595
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,820
You should debate whether or not someone who makes the better argument

2596
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:53,420
wins or someone who's right wins the argument.

2597
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:54,620
Oh, yeah, I got this.

2598
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:55,920
I got this in the bag.

2599
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,820
I got this and I have to like prove it.

2600
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:58,920
I didn't have to prove that I'm right.

2601
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,020
I got in the bag.

2602
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:01,620
You just you just have to be right.

2603
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:03,120
And then you win automatically.

2604
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:03,620
If you're right.

2605
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:04,520
Yeah, exactly.

2606
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:08,520
Next voicemail is called Benjamin St.

2607
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,120
Jimman three, two, one, go.

2608
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:18,020
I mean, I am I hold my anime stuff in like a box for a while.

2609
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:24,420
And I'm trying to set up my room and I I I wanted to put up my serial experiments

2610
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:26,020
lane wall scroll.

2611
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:26,920
Don't do that.

2612
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:29,120
And I noticed I can't find it.

2613
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:32,620
Oh, I think I think Ben St.

2614
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:33,720
took my scroll.

2615
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:38,220
So I think I'm going to make 20 more voicemails about this.

2616
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:42,020
I think it would make a thousand more voicemails about this to become a new character.

2617
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:45,720
I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like the Samurai guy.

2618
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:47,420
I'm going to be like the Samurai guy.

2619
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:52,220
I would be like, I'm going to be PCP famous and I don't want to fuck me.

2620
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,520
I was like a fucking.

2621
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:59,120
Oh, my God, imagine wanting to be PCP famous.

2622
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:03,320
Typical, typical PCP listener right there.

2623
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:05,020
That's what they're all thinking.

2624
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:09,220
Average PCP fan, average dick show enjoyer.

2625
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:10,120
Am I right, guys?

2626
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:12,320
If like, you know, yeah.

2627
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:17,620
You know how, you know, like ever you see that you see the Amogus everywhere.

2628
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:21,420
Well, if you listen to the PCP everywhere you look, everything looks like a scroll

2629
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:25,920
and you think like, how can I pretend that Ben stole this from me?

2630
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:29,420
Why? Yeah.

2631
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:31,620
This might be a dumb question, but why a squirrel?

2632
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,420
I don't know.

2633
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:37,520
Is it just because he's the first one?

2634
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:39,520
The original just picked the scroll and that's it.

2635
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,120
Yeah, that's the sort of thing you would steal.

2636
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:48,220
I asked Cassidy or Cassidy said something to me about this one

2637
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:53,620
and because I was like why a scroll and she she said that like I said something

2638
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:57,920
about a scroll like I responded to the samurai off the top of my head.

2639
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,220
Just like something about a sacred samurai scroll.

2640
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,020
So like I apparently I came up with it.

2641
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,120
So it's my fault that it's weird.

2642
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:10,020
They're trying to gaslight you and to believe in you came up with the with the scroll.

2643
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,620
I probably that's probably true.

2644
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:21,820
It's they use the Shadow Clone Kagi Bunshin Jutsu to deceive me.

2645
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:22,420
Okay.

2646
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:29,820
Next voicemail is called my toe hurts my broken toe hurts and it's making me upset.

2647
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:31,320
That's a weird name for now.

2648
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:32,420
That's right.

2649
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:37,020
Henlo Corgo five voicemail grail and jail three, two, one go.

2650
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:45,120
So I finally checked out that Google doc of the voicemail grail and jail and I mean

2651
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:49,420
if I suppose if there is an easier way to listen to these, you'll mention it when you

2652
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:51,320
respond to this in the next episode.

2653
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:56,020
But I really want to check those out and find out why they're both in the grail or the

2654
01:58:56,020 --> 01:59:01,020
jail and I can't really find an easy way to do that besides listening to every fucking

2655
01:59:01,020 --> 01:59:02,220
episode of the show.

2656
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:07,420
So if you could make it slightly easier to track those down and listen to them, much

2657
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:08,220
appreciated.

2658
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:11,020
I'm not going to do that.

2659
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:17,720
I'm not going to go back through all the episodes and keep track of who got grailed

2660
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:21,420
when Ben doesn't get good luck to fucking do.

2661
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:24,220
I don't get paid and I don't get paid enough to do that.

2662
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:25,020
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2663
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:26,520
Like that sounds like a fan thing to do.

2664
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:31,720
You know, fans love to go back and like count maybe maybe maybe spiral.

2665
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:33,320
A spiral is going through them anyway.

2666
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:37,620
I don't think he's he's probably well before the point where voicemails even started.

2667
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:42,620
So maybe out of the kindness of his heart, he might be willing to take down some notes

2668
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:49,020
on when people get grailed as he completes his coveted n word tally.

2669
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:52,920
Once he gets the n word trophy, he's going to get the grail trophy.

2670
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:54,420
That's right.

2671
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:56,420
They're one in the same.

2672
01:59:57,120 --> 02:00:00,220
Yeah, next voicemail is called sorry.

2673
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:02,020
I didn't put it here in time.

2674
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:04,420
It is called wait.

2675
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:05,920
No, sorry.

2676
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,320
Listen to the one that's called three two nine five.

2677
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:12,020
That one is called hi Ben three two one go.

2678
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:14,420
Hey, what's up guys?

2679
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:18,520
So for the last decade of my life, I've been reading the secret pretty constantly

2680
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:21,820
and I think I willed into the universe.

2681
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:25,220
The inevitable crossover between my two favorite podcasts.

2682
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,120
That being the procrastinators podcast.

2683
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:32,220
That's me as well as a podcast called let me tell you about.

2684
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:38,020
So I started willing this into the universe around 2017, 2018.

2685
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:38,720
Is he peeing?

2686
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:43,620
And slowly but surely, I think he's peeing through sheer power of will.

2687
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:44,220
Yeah, that's me.

2688
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:44,620
All right.

2689
02:00:44,820 --> 02:00:49,220
So let me tell you about has now crossed over into the loudest podcast,

2690
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:54,620
which is loosely affiliated with you guys through Trixie and The Dick Show.

2691
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:58,620
And I'm I'm supposed to be on Chris Dery.

2692
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:04,020
So by the way, I've been supposed to be going to cross over.

2693
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:06,420
So why not go ahead and make it happen now?

2694
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:10,720
It's a lot less willpower on me and my spiritual chakras.

2695
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:13,420
And I mean, I got both.

2696
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:19,420
I got into both of your podcasts around the same time trying to look for a way

2697
02:01:19,420 --> 02:01:21,720
to introduce normies into Chris Chan.

2698
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:24,120
So I feel like you guys have a lot to talk about.

2699
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:26,620
Yeah, yeah.

2700
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:27,820
So yeah, make it happen.

2701
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:31,820
All all the stereos or Sriracha needs to do is just message me because they

2702
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:36,620
long, long ago, they said, Ben, you should be on an episode of Chris Dery.

2703
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:39,020
And I said, sure, of course.

2704
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:42,020
And since then, it's come up.

2705
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,420
They've said like, yeah, we're going to do that.

2706
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:47,320
You're all they have to do is ask all they have to do is ask.

2707
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,320
I'm down.

2708
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:53,720
I don't know if a crossover would work because I actually have seen.

2709
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:54,820
I used to watch.

2710
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:59,820
Let me tell you about whenever they would talk about a topic I was interested

2711
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:03,420
in and basically the premise is that one guy just tells us co-hosts all about

2712
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:04,520
a topic, right?

2713
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:08,020
Yeah, I've seen the I've seen it around.

2714
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:09,220
I've never listened to one.

2715
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:10,920
And I forget his name.

2716
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:14,120
I think his name is Ted or tab.

2717
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:15,320
Oh, dude, I'm sorry.

2718
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,320
I forgot this guy's name.

2719
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:17,920
But he's he seems like a cool guy.

2720
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:20,720
He's been on the he's been on the Laos podcast a couple of times.

2721
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:25,720
I mean, I mean, I could see Ben and him being on the podcast together

2722
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:30,320
because sometimes like a stereo likes to get little group chats together for bits.

2723
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:31,420
But I don't know.

2724
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:35,320
I don't know how like connected Ben is to a stereo's.

2725
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:42,120
You ever listen to like my little podcast that I did with a stereo's?

2726
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:47,220
No, it's something I notice about a stereo's that like

2727
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,720
in retrospect should have been obvious is that like, you know, you've been

2728
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:56,220
on a podcast before you talk to people and then you you'll pause to let like

2729
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:59,920
the other person say something after you like say after you say something,

2730
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,520
you let someone you pause and you let that person react, right?

2731
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:04,820
Yeah, right.

2732
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:08,520
Like for some reason, I would pause for a stereo's to react to something I said

2733
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,720
and he would not say anything.

2734
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:14,620
It was just kind of stay silent and I just I guess I just got to keep talking.

2735
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,020
I just kept on talking because they didn't want there to be dead air.

2736
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:20,020
And then I realized something comfortable.

2737
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:20,820
Yeah.

2738
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,120
Yeah.

2739
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:21,720
It felt weird.

2740
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:26,320
I don't even know if a stereo's realizes this, but um, but then I realized something.

2741
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:30,020
I realized something that a stereo's only talks after you explain something

2742
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:31,120
very long to him.

2743
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:34,120
And that should have been obvious weird.

2744
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:36,820
And that should have been obvious because on the loudest podcast,

2745
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:40,120
all that is is Sriracha explaining stuff to him.

2746
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:40,720
That's it.

2747
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:43,220
Wow.

2748
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:44,020
Okay.

2749
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:44,320
Yeah.

2750
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,120
I mean, that's the vibe I got.

2751
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:50,320
I don't know if you talk to him and things just feel different.

2752
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:51,620
Maybe I'm maybe I'm the weird.

2753
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:56,220
I've never I've never I've never I've never like talked to him with my voice.

2754
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:59,620
I've like, we've like tweeted at each other a little bit.

2755
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:05,620
It's someone asked the stereo's why he's so weird like that.

2756
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:07,220
Um, he's probably just because he's a boomer.

2757
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:13,020
Probably because he's a boomer or maybe I'm the one next voicemail is called

2758
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:16,420
Hi Ben two, three, two, one, go.

2759
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:18,720
Sorry, I forgot to flush.

2760
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,020
Yes.

2761
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,220
Good, good man.

2762
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:24,620
Never forget to flush.

2763
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:25,620
That's a that's a W.

2764
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:26,920
That's a dude posted his W.

2765
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:29,320
That dude posted his W right there.

2766
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:30,820
That's a blistered mail grill.

2767
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:33,820
That was a good, that was a good, that was a good bit.

2768
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:38,820
I'm like the inferior, um, like metal was called metalhead pig.

2769
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:39,920
The one I just interrupt.

2770
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:40,320
Yeah.

2771
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:46,320
We can all agree that the interrupting pig is a bit that was just basically

2772
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:52,320
just doomed to be bad just by its very, just by its very conception.

2773
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,820
Just the very idea behind is just rotten to the core.

2774
02:04:54,820 --> 02:04:57,920
Has any like interruption joke ever been like funny?

2775
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:58,620
Maybe.

2776
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,120
But not this time.

2777
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:07,020
Next one is called two five, two five, two, three, two, one, go.

2778
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:10,020
Which radcon was the best?

2779
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:12,020
Hmm.

2780
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:17,720
Um, I, uh, I'm going to say three.

2781
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,220
That I'm going to say three, four.

2782
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:23,220
No, four was the last one.

2783
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:24,220
You fucking dingus.

2784
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:25,720
Yeah, I don't watch radcon.

2785
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:34,320
For, I mean, four was fun, but we've said this before four was really busy.

2786
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:40,120
Like we were like on all of radcon for we had like every day we had to wake up

2787
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:41,720
and we're like, okay, we're going to film this.

2788
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:43,520
Okay, we're going to, we're going to work on this.

2789
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:45,720
We're going to make that we're going to stream that we got to get ready

2790
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:46,620
for such and such.

2791
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:52,520
Um, so like it was in terms of which one I think I enjoyed three more

2792
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,620
because we didn't have as much to do.

2793
02:05:55,620 --> 02:06:00,320
We didn't have as much like in mind of like, okay, these are the things

2794
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,720
we're going to make while we're here.

2795
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:05,520
We were just kind of like, we'll get together and we'll just make a bunch

2796
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:07,120
of shit and whatever we want to do.

2797
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:08,520
So it was more relaxed like that.

2798
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:09,720
So I would say right on three.

2799
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:15,320
Um, I mean, I guess we had the arena, but that was like, you know, that was

2800
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:20,920
so we recorded that in one day, uh, the, the OVA and stuff took like several

2801
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:27,120
days, uh, including the Brad lecture, which is out now on the channel and

2802
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:30,820
more stuff related to that will be coming soon.

2803
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:32,820
I think more rad content.

2804
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:37,520
Close to being ready to come out the pipeline.

2805
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:39,820
Lamar base.

2806
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:42,620
Um, base.

2807
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,120
Okay.

2808
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:46,220
Next voicemail is called Riley singing.

2809
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:48,020
Add the backing track.

2810
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:49,920
Ellie is our earn your keep.

2811
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:50,820
Okay.

2812
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:53,020
Three, two, one go.

2813
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:56,620
Hey, what's up?

2814
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:57,420
Fuckers.

2815
02:06:57,420 --> 02:06:58,720
It's me, Riley.

2816
02:06:58,720 --> 02:06:59,520
The busy.

2817
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,620
This is definitely do it.

2818
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:01,020
Gazing.

2819
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:03,420
And I thought that was had peaks up for a second.

2820
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:07,420
Have a clear reference point for my beautiful singing voice.

2821
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,420
Three, two, one.

2822
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:10,020
Let's hit it.

2823
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:11,620
My T is gone.

2824
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:12,620
Call the boy ring.

2825
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:15,820
Why I got out of bed at all.

2826
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:19,520
The morning rain clouds up my window.

2827
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:20,320
Yeah.

2828
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,820
Can't see it all.

2829
02:07:22,220 --> 02:07:22,920
Amen.

2830
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:23,820
If I could.

2831
02:07:24,820 --> 02:07:28,120
Put your picture on my wall.

2832
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:30,120
It reminds me.

2833
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:32,020
It's not so bad.

2834
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:34,820
It's not so bad being me.

2835
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:36,820
Riley.

2836
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:38,120
I know this is do it.

2837
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:38,420
Do it.

2838
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:40,020
Gazers because do do it.

2839
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:44,820
Gazers particular quirk is that his Riley impression sounds like a cold

2840
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:46,120
Corona impression.

2841
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:47,420
Oh my God.

2842
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:48,220
No wonder.

2843
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:48,920
Trixie.

2844
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:53,020
They right.

2845
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:53,620
Yeah.

2846
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:55,920
Magnet magnetized.

2847
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:57,120
Yeah.

2848
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:57,520
Yeah.

2849
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:03,620
I thought I thought he was going to go into the the rapping bit from the

2850
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:06,420
what's the name of the song that samples.

2851
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:08,120
It's Stan Stan.

2852
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:08,320
Yeah.

2853
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:10,620
Stan like dear Trixie.

2854
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:11,720
So just so and so.

2855
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:13,020
So I can't do it right now.

2856
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,120
I don't know what the lyrics.

2857
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:18,520
That would be you could probably make a pretty good a pretty good Stan

2858
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:26,220
you could probably make a better one than Riley's a weird like parody

2859
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,320
discord.

2860
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:29,120
You might not have.

2861
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,120
Did you hear did you hear that last episode?

2862
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:31,920
I did not.

2863
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:32,220
Yeah.

2864
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:34,320
I don't think I got that that far.

2865
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,320
But what is it?

2866
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:37,020
It's it's hold on.

2867
02:08:38,220 --> 02:08:40,320
The procrastinators podcast.

2868
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:40,520
Yeah.

2869
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:46,020
Someone someone submitted a voicemail that is a clip of Riley singing a very

2870
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:50,820
slightly altered lyrical version of the discord song discord.

2871
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:52,020
I'm howling at the moon.

2872
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:52,620
Oh yeah.

2873
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:53,520
I got to that part.

2874
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:53,920
Yeah.

2875
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:54,620
Okay.

2876
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:55,820
Well, it's real.

2877
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:57,120
Oh shit.

2878
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,020
Someone who who posted it.

2879
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:02,720
I'm going through the comments.

2880
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:09,820
Neckbeard bananas in the comments last time posted a here it is too.

2881
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:14,020
I'll we don't have to listen to it, but it's a real fucking thing.

2882
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:19,420
It's like a him and some guy I've never heard of called a hazen cruise and the

2883
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:26,220
joke of the song is like that someone is like talking shit or like trying to

2884
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:32,320
cancel this guy hazen cruise and they're doing it by posting screenshots on discord.

2885
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:36,220
And so the song is like ha discord is the villain because that's where

2886
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:38,320
they're trying to cancel hazen whatever.

2887
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:41,720
The point is just that it Riley sounds really bad.

2888
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:45,320
Riley's voice just sounds really bad on this track and it's very fun.

2889
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,520
I mean, so we thought it was fake.

2890
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:52,220
We discussed it last time and we both me and give fight.

2891
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:55,620
I'd be like, this would be really funny if it was real, but no, I can't be real.

2892
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:56,720
No, this sounds weird.

2893
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:57,720
No, that doesn't sound right.

2894
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:58,320
I think it's fake.

2895
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:58,920
It's real.

2896
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:02,220
It's real in case anyone was still wondering.

2897
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,720
It is amazing.

2898
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:04,420
It is.

2899
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:05,620
It is amazing.

2900
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:06,620
It's a pretty good find.

2901
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:07,520
It's pretty good find.

2902
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:11,920
A pretty good archaeological discovery.

2903
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:14,820
We need to describe what the topic of the song was.

2904
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:20,120
I'm like, yeah, that sounds like what a dick show would like talk about.

2905
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:21,420
That sounds like their priority.

2906
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:25,720
Yeah, I mean, they're trying to cancel.

2907
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,120
They're trying to cancel my boy hazen cruise.

2908
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:32,820
We got to record a we got to record a fucking parody brony

2909
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:37,120
diss track at them to shut up the haters.

2910
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:38,120
Yeah.

2911
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:45,220
Hello, this is Ben from the future with a with an urgent urgent alert.

2912
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:46,220
Red alert.

2913
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:47,220
Red alert.

2914
02:10:47,320 --> 02:10:49,120
The song has been deleted.

2915
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:56,220
The the legendary the the legendary track by a vizier

2916
02:10:56,220 --> 02:11:01,920
of yig and the presumably also legendary hazen cruise performing

2917
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:08,820
their relevant Tory hit single discord by the living tombstone.

2918
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:11,920
I think has been deleted in shame.

2919
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:16,720
If anyone has a saved copy, I would love to see it.

2920
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:22,720
If not, then I guess these episodes of the PCP will be the only

2921
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:30,720
place you will ever be able to hear these lost masterpieces that

2922
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:33,520
just wanted to just wanted to keep you updated.

2923
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:35,420
Okay, back to the episode.

2924
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,920
Next, next voice.

2925
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:38,520
Next voice.

2926
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:41,120
Now listen to 3299.

2927
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:43,620
Oh, sorry.

2928
02:11:43,620 --> 02:11:44,820
Yeah, you're right.

2929
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:51,020
Yeah, listen to 3299 is called High Ben three three two one go.

2930
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,020
Hey, what's up, Ben?

2931
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:58,720
What's next after 102 and slime and punishment?

2932
02:11:58,820 --> 02:12:01,220
The game, the webcomic, the game.

2933
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:01,820
Yeah.

2934
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:04,020
Inquiring minds would like to know.

2935
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:06,520
I think baby you want to say anything?

2936
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:15,120
What the fuck?

2937
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:22,720
Um, okay, uh, after, uh, yeah, after I finished the game and slime and

2938
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:26,620
punishment, I think the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go back

2939
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:31,320
and I want to finish Beast Capades because Beast Capades had an ending.

2940
02:12:31,620 --> 02:12:36,720
I knew exactly what the ending was going to be and I can just finish it.

2941
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:40,220
It might take me a little while, but I know how it ends.

2942
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:44,920
So I just have to do it because because when I have an idea.

2943
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:48,320
When I have something that I want to make or an idea for a thing that I

2944
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:53,820
could make, it is a demon inside of me and it torments me until I can

2945
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:57,020
manifest it into the world and put it out there.

2946
02:12:57,220 --> 02:13:00,120
And the demon of Beast Capades is still inside me.

2947
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:02,120
It has been tormenting me this entire time.

2948
02:13:02,620 --> 02:13:03,920
Uh, so it'll be the easiest.

2949
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:06,220
It'll be the easiest one to exercise.

2950
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:10,620
Uh, once, once I get this slime demon out once he's gone.

2951
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:13,520
Uh, that's, that's the plan anyway.

2952
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:17,820
Okay, next one is called Mark Fisher is what?

2953
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:18,220
Huh?

2954
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:18,620
What?

2955
02:13:18,620 --> 02:13:18,820
Huh?

2956
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:19,620
Yes, something to say.

2957
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,920
I was going to make a con joke, but we could keep on going.

2958
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:23,720
Okay.

2959
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:25,920
Next one is called Mark Fisher is dope.

2960
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:27,620
Three, two, one, go.

2961
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:31,620
Been talked about Tim Rogers recently and as I have an unhealthy

2962
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:34,620
parasocial relationship with the fellow, I'll shut some contacts for the

2963
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:35,920
second time I'll speed myself up.

2964
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:37,920
You can piece the story together by watching his stuff as it's a mixture

2965
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,120
of personal anecdotes and game analysis.

2966
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,220
This is what I've pieced together.

2967
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:42,120
He lived in Japan for a decade, working out a few large companies before he

2968
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:44,120
lost his reason how to leave his friend to go back to America.

2969
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:45,020
He worked in various shitty games.

2970
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:47,220
I think that's self-amended and notably, notably no more heroes.

2971
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:49,420
He did stuff in America for a while, then got a job making video content

2972
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:49,920
for Kotaku.

2973
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:51,320
This enlarged how many people knew about him.

2974
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:53,620
He's been writing on action button net for over 20 years now, but

2975
02:13:53,620 --> 02:13:56,320
games highly recommend his written f of six review called how and why I

2976
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,520
never finished becoming a detective.

2977
02:13:57,820 --> 02:13:59,320
Anyway, when he left Kotaku, he announced he was going to start making

2978
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:01,420
his own videos and the wide reach of a large corporation ended up with

2979
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:02,320
him having a huge Patreon.

2980
02:14:02,820 --> 02:14:04,120
But really, there's no one like him that I've found.

2981
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:05,420
There's so much overlap between his videos.

2982
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:07,320
He has an interesting writing style and little things that you'll pick up

2983
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:07,920
if you pay attention.

2984
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:11,120
Spoilers for his f of seven and toky make a video in the middle of toky make

2985
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:12,620
he goes off and attention about his best friend in Japan.

2986
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:14,720
Tim often uses friend when referring to his girlfriend and how they

2987
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:17,120
chatted every week until he says a date and then cuts himself off before

2988
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:19,520
going back to the analysis, implying that something happened.

2989
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:21,520
And the end of his f of seven series.

2990
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,120
He explains quickly why it's important to him and how it overlaps

2991
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:25,120
with his best friend who died.

2992
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:26,520
I'm pretty sure they're the same person.

2993
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:28,920
It gave me chills when I connected it and it still does.

2994
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:30,220
Anyway, cool guy.

2995
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:30,620
Interesting.

2996
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:31,720
Oh my God.

2997
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:32,620
He knew a guy.

2998
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:34,420
He knew someone that killed himself.

2999
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:36,420
Oh my God.

3000
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:38,420
That blows my fucking mind.

3001
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:40,920
So hard to shit, dude.

3002
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:41,620
Oh my God.

3003
02:14:41,620 --> 02:14:44,920
It's a twist ending kind of based.

3004
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:48,020
I mean, it's a good series.

3005
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:50,220
I watched the final fantasy seven series.

3006
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:51,320
It's a good series.

3007
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,020
Yeah, it ends with spoilers.

3008
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:55,920
It ends with kind of the twist that he's been talking about this friend

3009
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,120
every once in a while.

3010
02:14:57,320 --> 02:14:59,820
In the end, he reveals like, yes, she killed herself later.

3011
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:01,520
And it's like, oh, that's sad.

3012
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:04,020
He annoyed me.

3013
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:08,620
He annoyed me in one of, not in that video, in a different video.

3014
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:12,720
Someone, I think it was about the, the, it was either the action

3015
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:16,420
button review of the final fantasy seven remake or it was the Kotaku

3016
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:18,320
pre-review of the final fantasy seven remake.

3017
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:23,320
He says that people have been asking him if he's going to make a

3018
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:27,420
like slow translation video series about the remake like he did

3019
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:28,120
with the original.

3020
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,320
And he says no.

3021
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:32,820
And then he says like, and by the way, the final fantasy seven

3022
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:36,520
video wasn't about making fun of a bad translation.

3023
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:40,620
It was about, you know, going back to a work and having like new

3024
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:43,620
perspective on it later in life.

3025
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:47,520
And if you think it was about, you know, making fun of a bad

3026
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,620
translation, I don't know how to help you.

3027
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:52,520
He says that he says it in a way that's very much like, if you

3028
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:55,320
think that's what it's about, you're wrong and you're stupid.

3029
02:15:55,420 --> 02:15:59,920
And I think that he's an idiot because it is about the thing that

3030
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:03,420
he said it is about going back to final fantasy seven and having

3031
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:06,320
a new perspective on it from gained life experience, but it is

3032
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:11,920
also definitely to some extent about pointing out funny bad

3033
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:14,520
translations and having a good time doing so.

3034
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:15,920
It definitely is.

3035
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:17,620
It's about fucking both.

3036
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,620
You fucking, you fucking dweeb.

3037
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:22,520
That was a real, that was a real pretentious moment.

3038
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:25,020
That was a real, that was a real Jesse moment right there.

3039
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:25,820
I didn't like it.

3040
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,020
Real Jesse moment.

3041
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:29,320
That was a real Jesse moment.

3042
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:30,720
Real Jesse.

3043
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:36,220
Here's my, here's my, here's my, here's my Tim, my Tim

3044
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:37,320
Rogers impression.

3045
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:45,820
That's why Tokimeki Memorial objectifies love and makes you

3046
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:50,520
a fucking demon for playing and that's the bottom line.

3047
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:51,720
And I would know.

3048
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:54,720
I mean, I had six pack abs in high school.

3049
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,520
I ran a five minute mile.

3050
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:00,120
That's, that's, that's Tim.

3051
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:01,220
Oh my God.

3052
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:04,120
Um, we should get Tim on the show.

3053
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:06,220
We should get Tim on the show.

3054
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:06,920
Um,

3055
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:09,020
Tim, come on down, buddy.

3056
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:13,420
There's a, people, people have, people, Tim says weird stuff

3057
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:15,620
about himself and I don't know.

3058
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:19,220
He, he says, he sometimes will talk about like the memory thing.

3059
02:17:19,220 --> 02:17:22,120
He claims to have like a memory condition that makes him remember

3060
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:23,420
everything all the time.

3061
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:25,220
And I don't think that's real.

3062
02:17:25,220 --> 02:17:25,820
Oh, like Dr.

3063
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:28,720
That sounds like some, that sounds like some Chunebio,

3064
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:33,520
like, um, Alexandria's Genesis, like, like fake disability stuff.

3065
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:34,620
I don't know.

3066
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:38,220
I know that like, idetic memory is a thing, but that sounds fake.

3067
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:41,120
How does he remember things all the time?

3068
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:43,220
I don't know.

3069
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:44,120
Like, just kidding.

3070
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:47,720
Just, just have perfect memory is other words.

3071
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:50,120
I don't know.

3072
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:54,920
Just sometimes, sometimes he claims to have a, I haven't read

3073
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,620
that Final Fantasy six essay.

3074
02:17:56,620 --> 02:18:00,220
I should, I should find it because he mentions it in, um,

3075
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:03,120
I think it's the Final Fantasy seven remake review.

3076
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:04,920
I think I haven't seen it yet.

3077
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:10,420
Uh, he, he obviously doesn't remember everything because in

3078
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:14,620
the video where he remember, he recollects game box art covers

3079
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:17,420
from memory, he doesn't get everyone exactly right.

3080
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:20,320
He's pretty good at a lot of them, but he definitely doesn't

3081
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:21,220
get all of them right.

3082
02:18:21,220 --> 02:18:22,920
So his memory is not perfect.

3083
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:27,320
And like, what, what does it even mean to like remember everything?

3084
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:29,720
Also, apparently he's a Mensa member, which is not impressed

3085
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:30,120
me.

3086
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:34,120
That just makes me think he's a dweeb, uh, being, being, being

3087
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:34,920
in Mensa's lame.

3088
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:35,820
It's not cool.

3089
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:37,020
What does it even mean?

3090
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:39,420
I don't think he has perfect memory.

3091
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:42,820
He, um, he didn't make a video talking about memory 9-11.

3092
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:45,820
He forgot.

3093
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:46,520
He forgot.

3094
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,320
He forgot.

3095
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:47,820
I forgot.

3096
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:49,220
I'm like 9-11 is crazy.

3097
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:50,920
Whatever.

3098
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:53,020
He's his videos are kind of good.

3099
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:54,120
I guess I like them.

3100
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:57,220
I guess at the end of the day, he's like, he's my class enemy.

3101
02:18:57,220 --> 02:19:00,320
He's like, he has, he, him and he has more in common with Vito

3102
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:01,820
guess Walde than he has with me.

3103
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:04,020
He doesn't, he lacks solidarity.

3104
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:05,220
He's my fucking enemy.

3105
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:06,220
He's a class trader.

3106
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:07,520
I will behead him.

3107
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:09,720
Given half the chance.

3108
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:13,020
Um, that's what I'm, that's what I'm saying.

3109
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:18,620
That's the PCP is pro guillotine proitarian podcast.

3110
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:24,620
Prolet, the, that, the P, the, that would be the PTP.

3111
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:25,520
No, no.

3112
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:25,820
Yeah.

3113
02:19:25,820 --> 02:19:26,920
Change to the PTP.

3114
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:32,020
Next voicemail is called lesbian.

3115
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:34,020
Three, two, one.

3116
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:35,620
I'm going to read it.

3117
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:37,120
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to announce these like Tim

3118
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:40,620
Ryder's now three, two, one go.

3119
02:19:41,820 --> 02:19:43,120
Hey guys, I'm at work.

3120
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:47,520
I just thought about this since when is Trixie been into dudes?

3121
02:19:47,620 --> 02:19:51,320
I just realized she's dating Riley, but I've seen like she's not dating

3122
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:52,420
Riley video ever.

3123
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:53,520
Nobody can keep it straight.

3124
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:59,120
And she's always been like super into lesbianism and you know, like only

3125
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:01,520
watched lesbian porn and like all that stuff.

3126
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:02,920
How the hell does that happen?

3127
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:06,820
Uh, yeah, it's true.

3128
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:11,420
It's true that now she likes guys, I guess.

3129
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:13,120
I don't, I mean, I don't know.

3130
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:16,420
It's not, it's not crazy because I don't, I've known a couple of

3131
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:22,620
like, uh, trans ladies who were like kind of explicitly lesbian, but

3132
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:25,920
then dated like guys, which isn't a bad thing.

3133
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:26,520
You know?

3134
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:30,820
So they, so they weren't, so they weren't exclusively lesbian.

3135
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:31,020
Yeah.

3136
02:20:31,020 --> 02:20:32,920
I guess maybe they find out they're like bisexual.

3137
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:37,020
I mean, I don't know what Trixie would classify herself.

3138
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:41,820
Who can even say who even fucking knows whatever people, people's tastes

3139
02:20:41,820 --> 02:20:42,220
change.

3140
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:43,020
They change their mind.

3141
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:44,520
They try any things they do, whatever.

3142
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:45,120
I don't know.

3143
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:46,020
How the fuck should I know?

3144
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:46,720
Ask Trixie.

3145
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,120
What are you asking me this shit for?

3146
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:49,220
She's got a podcast.

3147
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:50,320
She's got a podcast.

3148
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:51,020
She's, she's.

3149
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:51,420
Yeah.

3150
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:53,620
Ask Colin, Colin to fucking void gazer.

3151
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:54,020
I'm sorry.

3152
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:55,920
I'm, I'm, I'm being mean.

3153
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:59,120
I don't mean to be mean to this person, but I genuinely have no clue and I

3154
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:00,620
don't know why you would think I would know.

3155
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:05,120
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to get into another void gazer live show.

3156
02:21:05,720 --> 02:21:06,320
Maybe.

3157
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:08,220
Yes, please.

3158
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:15,020
Next, next voicemail is called, um, it's, it's the three three zero two.

3159
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:18,720
It's called Lord of ghosts, fake, angry face.

3160
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,720
Three, two, one, go.

3161
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:26,720
Wait, so the Lord of ghosts isn't an actual ghost?

3162
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:27,420
I know.

3163
02:21:27,720 --> 02:21:30,720
Why the fuck is it called Lord of ghosts?

3164
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:31,520
My God.

3165
02:21:31,620 --> 02:21:34,020
That's like calling yourself the Lord of marine life.

3166
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:36,620
If you're not actually a goddamn aquatic creature.

3167
02:21:38,020 --> 02:21:39,920
It just bundles my mind.

3168
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:40,820
Why?

3169
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:42,620
Why are they fake?

3170
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:45,920
That hurts so fucking much.

3171
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:49,920
Okay.

3172
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:52,120
Uh, you could be.

3173
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:54,320
Well, it's like.

3174
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:57,720
Well, it's like Jesus, right?

3175
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:02,520
Jesus was king of the Jews, but obviously he wasn't a Jew because

3176
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:04,920
he was a Christian and he believed in his own divinity.

3177
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:07,720
So there you go.

3178
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:11,720
That's how it's like,

3179
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:14,220
it's funny because she's not even here to shame and answer this question.

3180
02:22:15,220 --> 02:22:19,620
There's, there's, um, I mean, there's so many like kings.

3181
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:23,420
There's so many like kings and royalty that ruled one country that

3182
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,820
were from another country.

3183
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:30,520
Like I'm pretty sure several of the Henry's were just like Dutch or something.

3184
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:31,120
I don't know.

3185
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,020
This happens all the time.

3186
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:35,720
You can be the Lord of something without being a member of something.

3187
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:36,820
You can just be their Lord.

3188
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:38,420
Um, it's easy.

3189
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:39,620
Easy shit, man.

3190
02:22:39,620 --> 02:22:40,720
This is, this is basic.

3191
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:46,220
I think I, I think I recognize this voice, but I'm not 100% sure.

3192
02:22:46,420 --> 02:22:48,220
I think it's, I think it's a friend of mine.

3193
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:50,320
Um, God, I hope not.

3194
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,220
Yeah, I hope not.

3195
02:22:51,220 --> 02:22:53,020
Imagine being friends with this freak.

3196
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:54,120
This guy.

3197
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:55,020
Okay.

3198
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:56,020
Oh, okay.

3199
02:22:56,020 --> 02:23:00,020
If it, I think it, I think it is, um, it's, I think it's death alchemist.

3200
02:23:00,220 --> 02:23:03,620
We send that voicemail and all I have to say to that voice.

3201
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:04,120
You think so?

3202
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:05,820
I know, I know death alchemists.

3203
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:08,020
I think that sounds like, well, death alchemist.

3204
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:11,320
I talked to him like every other day cause he's very acted in my server.

3205
02:23:12,220 --> 02:23:14,820
Um, but that sounded like him.

3206
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:19,720
And all I have to say to his question is that, um, the Batman in the dark night

3207
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,320
returns is a fascist death.

3208
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:24,620
He's a fascist.

3209
02:23:24,620 --> 02:23:25,220
I'm sorry.

3210
02:23:25,220 --> 02:23:25,920
I'm sorry to death.

3211
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,320
He is a fucking fascist.

3212
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:29,120
Like he fits the description perfectly.

3213
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:30,920
Bomber.

3214
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:31,420
Yeah.

3215
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:32,020
Bomber.

3216
02:23:32,420 --> 02:23:33,720
Then it goes to the next place now.

3217
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:34,820
I'm sorry to hear that.

3218
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:35,320
Yeah.

3219
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:37,620
I'm sorry to hear that I'm right.

3220
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:37,820
Yeah.

3221
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:39,320
You know, I'm sorry to hear that too.

3222
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:45,220
Next voicemail is called, uh, I'm stupid.

3223
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:49,620
Uh, the next voicemail is called influences.

3224
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:53,120
Uh, oh, well, can't wait to listen to it.

3225
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:54,420
Here we go.

3226
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:57,120
Three, two, one, go.

3227
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:01,120
So in regards to influences, I think one thing that I just want to say

3228
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:03,920
is don't pull from the influences that other people want you to pull from.

3229
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,120
You got to pull from your door.

3230
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,120
This is definitely, no, you're right.

3231
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:06,520
This is that.

3232
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,320
Actually based on a robot from Wallace and grommet, like really

3233
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:13,320
Wallace and grommet is connected to undertale.

3234
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:16,120
Like, do you have any idea how weird that sounds?

3235
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:18,320
It doesn't need to be anything big when it comes to your death.

3236
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:19,320
I already told you that.

3237
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:20,620
Oh, we are a serial mascot.

3238
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:21,820
You like my return.

3239
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:22,220
Yes.

3240
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:25,720
I want to put this in my webcomic, put it in your webcomic or just

3241
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:27,620
something you like, even from a YouTube video.

3242
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:28,220
Hmm.

3243
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:28,720
Yes.

3244
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:32,420
I will take this and put it in and make it unique me uniquely my own.

3245
02:24:32,920 --> 02:24:34,520
Just, just some food for thought.

3246
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:38,020
I absolutely agree with the sentiment.

3247
02:24:38,020 --> 02:24:44,220
And also that's really funny that Mediton was based on the robot

3248
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:45,420
from the wrong trout.

3249
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:47,520
Wait, no, it's not the wrong trout.

3250
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:48,320
It's the one from the.

3251
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:52,220
It's the isn't when they go to the moon.

3252
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:55,320
No, no, no, the one in the wrong trousers.

3253
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:56,820
The villain is like a penguin.

3254
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:59,620
Yeah, I think the one where they go to the moon.

3255
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:02,620
Yeah, the villain is like a it's basically like a refrigerator.

3256
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,720
Yeah, the ski is around on the cheese.

3257
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:05,320
Yeah, that's me.

3258
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:07,620
Uh, I totally see it.

3259
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:08,820
It's totally true.

3260
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:09,820
That's so funny.

3261
02:25:09,820 --> 02:25:13,820
I never saw that before, but I completely believe it and I like it a lot.

3262
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:16,720
Okay.

3263
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,520
Fucking fucking Windows Explorer just like keeps freezing on me

3264
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:25,020
and not letting me click and drag like that's voicemails.

3265
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:25,920
It's fucking late.

3266
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,920
By the way, we had it's so late.

3267
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,920
We have we don't have that many left.

3268
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:34,620
Okay, no, we got one, two, three, four, five,

3269
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:37,320
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 34.

3270
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:38,820
We've only got 16 more.

3271
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:39,720
So we're good.

3272
02:25:39,720 --> 02:25:40,220
Okay.

3273
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:41,120
That's too many.

3274
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:41,920
I'm leaving.

3275
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:43,720
All right.

3276
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:46,020
I don't forget to read villain or not fucking left.

3277
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:46,920
All right.

3278
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:49,120
By zero zero couldn't take it.

3279
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:51,320
Honestly, honestly, I can't blame him.

3280
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:54,320
Honestly, I can't play have the boys on like us.

3281
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:59,320
The next one is called inmates in the asylum, the sharpest sharpest

3282
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:00,920
swords on the horizon.

3283
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:03,020
I think I know what this is going to sound like.

3284
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:04,720
Three, two, one, go.

3285
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:07,020
Yep.

3286
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,220
All of it.

3287
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:19,620
Sharpening a skill to be a giant sword that lies on the horizon.

3288
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:23,620
People head to the intro music doesn't go into the learning

3289
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:27,120
do something brand new.

3290
02:26:27,220 --> 02:26:32,920
You're a single drop that amid something huge, a single fluid

3291
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:36,320
motion through the roiling ocean.

3292
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:40,820
Just go with the flow until you know for sure.

3293
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:44,720
You gave it all you got and you can give it some more.

3294
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:48,720
We're inmates in an asylum now.

3295
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:57,820
We'll try again and again until we learn how the intro music,

3296
02:26:57,820 --> 02:27:02,020
the pipe organ didn't flow into the poem.

3297
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:04,220
They were like two different things that just cuts off and then

3298
02:27:04,220 --> 02:27:05,020
the poem started.

3299
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:05,720
I don't know.

3300
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:08,520
I feel like I feel like it should connect.

3301
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:11,620
I feel like I thought that the poem was supposed to interrupt

3302
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:12,620
the pipe organs.

3303
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:15,420
Well, then what's the point of the organ intro?

3304
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:17,220
I don't know to throw you off.

3305
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:20,020
I feel like I'm not sure.

3306
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:22,220
I don't really like these.

3307
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:26,720
This is the like the bear cyborg guy, right?

3308
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:30,420
Yes, this is this is this is the bear.

3309
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:34,420
I think I think these need to I think these need to shake up

3310
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:35,820
the formula a little bit.

3311
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:38,720
Yeah, a lot of these are kind of starting to sound the same.

3312
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:41,620
Oh, zero says.

3313
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:43,620
A screenshot.

3314
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:45,020
I got a screenshot.

3315
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:48,420
Zero says, ha, ha, canceled on discord.

3316
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:51,320
You're going to post this around all over the place.

3317
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:55,320
Uh, uh, uh, zero said, sorry, fellas had to run.

3318
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:56,320
Thanks for having me.

3319
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:59,020
You're going to post that on Twitter and whip up on angry mob.

3320
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:01,920
Show that on show that on on screen.

3321
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:02,620
Ellie is our show.

3322
02:28:02,620 --> 02:28:05,020
The proof also proof is in the pudding.

3323
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:06,220
Make sure you add my comment.

3324
02:28:06,220 --> 02:28:07,920
This is read villain versus under it.

3325
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:09,720
Sure.

3326
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:11,320
Why not?

3327
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:13,220
You got to remind me.

3328
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:13,720
Okay.

3329
02:28:14,820 --> 02:28:15,220
Next.

3330
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:18,620
Next voicemail is YouTube.

3331
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:20,420
Poop.

3332
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:21,320
Wait.

3333
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:25,520
What are these all like all these are all like completely out of

3334
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:26,020
order.

3335
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:26,820
Here we go.

3336
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:27,520
YouTube poop.

3337
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,120
Here we go.

3338
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:30,720
Uh, it's loading.

3339
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:31,820
It's loading.

3340
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,520
It's loading.

3341
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,020
It's loading.

3342
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:35,220
Okay.

3343
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:35,620
Here we go.

3344
02:28:35,620 --> 02:28:36,920
Three, two, one, go.

3345
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:39,820
Bring a YouTube pooper onto the PCP.

3346
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:42,020
It'll be really good for them to talk about their shit.

3347
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:46,020
Just just smear their work all over the audience's faces.

3348
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:47,020
It'll be great.

3349
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:50,120
And by the way, Gib, I have a playlist of good YouTube poops.

3350
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:51,620
If you ever want to take a look at it.

3351
02:28:52,020 --> 02:28:53,820
Oh, this is typical death.

3352
02:28:53,820 --> 02:28:55,620
Always showing his YouTube poop playlist.

3353
02:28:55,620 --> 02:28:57,020
He does this in all the other chats.

3354
02:28:58,420 --> 02:28:59,520
No, this is not joking.

3355
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,420
This is like his bed.

3356
02:29:00,420 --> 02:29:03,420
He does like show his YouTube poop playlist.

3357
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:06,120
Must be very proud of it.

3358
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:07,720
Proud of his poop.

3359
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:10,820
Ben, Ben, please, Ben, please just agree with me.

3360
02:29:10,820 --> 02:29:14,220
Please just agree with me that Batman's a fascist in the Dark Knight Returns.

3361
02:29:14,220 --> 02:29:15,420
Just say you believe in me.

3362
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,320
I haven't seen the Dark Knight Returns.

3363
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:19,320
If we just say yes.

3364
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:21,520
Yes.

3365
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:21,820
Okay.

3366
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:22,420
Thank you.

3367
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:23,320
Of course.

3368
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:23,820
There you go.

3369
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:24,420
Of course.

3370
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:26,120
Yes, King.

3371
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:27,320
Right away.

3372
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:27,820
Thank you.

3373
02:29:27,820 --> 02:29:28,520
It's all I needed.

3374
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:29,020
Next one.

3375
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:33,920
Next one is called Japanese learning English, not hentai.

3376
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:35,820
Three, two, one, go.

3377
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:38,920
I have a bad case of diarrhea.

3378
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:46,320
I have a bad case of diarrhea.

3379
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:48,820
I have a bad case of diarrhea.

3380
02:29:48,820 --> 02:29:51,220
I have a bad case of diarrhea.

3381
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:53,520
I have a bad case of diarrhea.

3382
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:54,220
Wow.

3383
02:29:54,220 --> 02:29:56,720
Wasn't this from like a Jon Tron video?

3384
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:59,420
I don't know.

3385
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:01,120
I remember he made a video.

3386
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:05,620
I think I think he made a video where he watched like Japanese like VHS tapes

3387
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:09,020
or something and I think what this was like one of the bits maybe.

3388
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:11,020
Lame.

3389
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:13,020
Okay.

3390
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:20,620
Next one is called this is a 3307 based to cringe to question mark.

3391
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:23,020
Three, two, one, go.

3392
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:27,720
So Ben, I got to say at first the rad con with you in show was kind of funny.

3393
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:32,320
Then it got really cringe, but now I think it's come back around to being

3394
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:33,320
actually good and funny.

3395
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:36,920
So you got to keep it and for all you bronies out there.

3396
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:38,620
That's the real horseshoe theory.

3397
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:44,420
Oh, also, if Ben is so flanged, why hasn't Eleazar put some flanger on his voice?

3398
02:30:46,020 --> 02:30:46,520
Take care.

3399
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,920
Tom will never die.

3400
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:50,420
Is a flanger like an audio effect?

3401
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:52,020
I'm the bull.

3402
02:30:52,020 --> 02:30:54,120
I don't know anything.

3403
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:55,620
I have no idea.

3404
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:56,820
I have no idea.

3405
02:30:57,020 --> 02:30:58,620
Uh, next.

3406
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:01,320
Next voicemail.

3407
02:31:01,720 --> 02:31:06,220
The intro is based the intro forever chug jug.

3408
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:06,820
Okay.

3409
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:11,120
3308 in three is called quit yo bullshit.

3410
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:13,120
Three, two, one, go.

3411
02:31:14,620 --> 02:31:15,220
Hey, guys.

3412
02:31:15,220 --> 02:31:17,920
So that's what you were talking about when it's okay to accept free work from

3413
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:21,120
people and you specifically mentioned turning down offers of editing episodes of

3414
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:22,720
the PCP are making a website.

3415
02:31:22,820 --> 02:31:25,720
Well, I know that's a lot of hot shit because it in a 2019.

3416
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:28,720
I made that exact same offer and you guys welcomed it with open arms.

3417
02:31:29,020 --> 02:31:32,420
Now granted, I came to you guys and said that I'd do the work for free, but

3418
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:34,320
not once did any of you resist the idea.

3419
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:37,420
I'll refer any money and that's despite the fact that I paid for a

3420
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:40,620
domain, web server and premium plugins all out of pocket.

3421
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,520
Instead, you let me do dozens of hours of unpaid work and then when the site

3422
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:47,420
was 99% completed, you just went silent and ghosted me.

3423
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:48,420
So here I am.

3424
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:50,820
I go to be past telling you to quit spouting that bullshit.

3425
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:52,320
Whoa.

3426
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:53,020
Okay.

3427
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:54,220
Okay.

3428
02:31:54,220 --> 02:31:55,320
I believe this.

3429
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:57,320
I believe this could be true.

3430
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:00,220
I don't, uh, I don't know.

3431
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:02,820
This might be true.

3432
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:05,220
I remember.

3433
02:32:06,220 --> 02:32:08,420
Okay, but we didn't use the website.

3434
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:14,820
I don't, I don't think because there is because there is because the website

3435
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:15,620
we okay.

3436
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:23,220
The website we ended up using is, um, it's the pro natures.com.

3437
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:29,720
Um, I feel like I didn't talk to this person.

3438
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:33,520
I remember someone offered to make the website.

3439
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:37,520
Oh my God.

3440
02:32:37,820 --> 02:32:38,720
Wait a second.

3441
02:32:39,220 --> 02:32:39,520
Okay.

3442
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:43,220
This is off topic, but I just typed in the procrastinators.com.

3443
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:44,020
Yeah.

3444
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:45,320
And it's like a country.

3445
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:48,020
It's like a country band.

3446
02:32:48,620 --> 02:32:51,920
It's two guys sitting on their porch strumming guitars.

3447
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:55,220
They are they are they called the procrastinators.

3448
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:57,220
Yeah.

3449
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:00,420
The procrastinators.com.

3450
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:03,720
They've got a fucking Texas flag as their logo.

3451
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:07,220
What is their anti PCP?

3452
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:11,520
The procrastinators.

3453
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:15,720
Um, I'm getting as a bunch of clips for the amazing world of the gun ball.

3454
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:17,520
Okay.

3455
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:19,120
Now I don't really remember.

3456
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:20,620
I didn't talk to this person very much.

3457
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:24,120
I knew that someone had offered to make the website.

3458
02:33:25,620 --> 02:33:32,320
I don't know what was discussed or with who, but I'm pretty sure we didn't

3459
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:37,120
use the stuff because like you said, no one offered.

3460
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:41,720
No one offered to pay you, but we didn't use what you offered us either.

3461
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:43,620
I mean, I think that's why.

3462
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:49,720
I mean, I don't think that we like took what you were giving us and said

3463
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:50,320
buy.

3464
02:33:51,820 --> 02:33:54,220
Uh, I think it was like that.

3465
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:56,220
The Nate will know more about this.

3466
02:33:58,220 --> 02:34:00,820
Maybe prop probably.

3467
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:03,620
Adam, Adam on Twitter.

3468
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:06,420
Does even use Twitter now?

3469
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:12,520
Nate tweets once in a once in a long, long while.

3470
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:15,020
I don't know.

3471
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:15,720
Okay.

3472
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:17,320
I'm Michelle at Michelle.

3473
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:19,120
This is on four.

3474
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:20,220
I feel, I feel bad.

3475
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:21,120
I feel bad.

3476
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:26,120
I feel like maybe if we, if we weren't going to use this guy's work, we

3477
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:30,120
probably should have just told him, no, we don't want you to make a website

3478
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:33,320
for us, but maybe we were like, oh, maybe we should.

3479
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:36,920
Maybe you got to financially compensate him for his time.

3480
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:40,520
I don't know about that.

3481
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:42,420
I don't know about that.

3482
02:34:42,420 --> 02:34:48,120
He has to, he has to actually prove that, um, he does to happen.

3483
02:34:48,220 --> 02:34:49,320
He needs like receipts.

3484
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:50,920
He needs like screenshots.

3485
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:53,320
He needs like emails, you know?

3486
02:34:54,620 --> 02:34:55,620
Yeah.

3487
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:00,520
Because I guess any asshole in here and like, I don't want him.

3488
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:05,820
I don't, I don't want to like shit on this guy because it seems like he

3489
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:09,320
feels like we did, we done, we done wronged him.

3490
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:15,320
Uh, which, uh, I don't even, I genuinely don't know.

3491
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:19,320
I genuinely don't know the details of, of what was discussed here.

3492
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:22,620
I just kind of heard about it from other people and like, oh, is that guy

3493
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:25,420
making a website or is he going to do that?

3494
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:27,820
Or is, are we, are we like in use it or what's the deal?

3495
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:28,920
Oh, no, I guess we'll see.

3496
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:29,720
I guess we'll see.

3497
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:33,420
Kind of lame, kind of lame.

3498
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:34,420
Yeah.

3499
02:35:34,420 --> 02:35:37,620
Well, like, uh, yeah, I guess, I guess he won't get no conversation

3500
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:39,620
because no one could remember who he was.

3501
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:45,420
I remember that this was that I remember that this person is real

3502
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:49,720
and I believe that this is probably a real voicemail from that person.

3503
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:54,520
I don't see any reason not to believe that this person is real,

3504
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:57,320
but we don't acknowledge is real as being a real thing.

3505
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:59,820
So I get by that logic.

3506
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:01,320
This didn't happen.

3507
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:04,220
Absolutely.

3508
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:05,120
Okay.

3509
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:10,620
The next voicemail 3309 is called reused voicemails three, two, one go.

3510
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:15,020
Whoa, someone reused old voicemails.

3511
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:15,720
That was surreal.

3512
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:16,520
Is it going to be a pig?

3513
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:19,720
I sent that creative immortality mail like two years ago or something

3514
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:22,920
and remember quite clearly that you guys were talking over it.

3515
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:25,120
There's a prankster among us.

3516
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:29,020
Don't only PCP members have access to the voicemail archive.

3517
02:36:30,020 --> 02:36:34,520
They're, I mean, yeah, we have, you know, we do actually.

3518
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:36,820
We do have access to the archive.

3519
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:40,720
I don't know if we can like, can we look search for it?

3520
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:41,820
Imposter.

3521
02:36:41,820 --> 02:36:44,020
There's an imposter in the PCP.

3522
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:45,320
Funnily enough, old voice mail.

3523
02:36:45,320 --> 02:36:46,220
No, you know what?

3524
02:36:46,820 --> 02:36:47,520
I'm an idiot.

3525
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:48,920
We, we, we can.

3526
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:49,220
Yeah.

3527
02:36:49,220 --> 02:36:49,420
Yeah.

3528
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:53,220
No, I can like type a search thing and go through our archive and be like

3529
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:57,020
and find voicemails based on what they were titled.

3530
02:36:57,020 --> 02:36:58,620
That is totally a thing I can do.

3531
02:36:58,920 --> 02:36:59,920
I didn't realize.

3532
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:06,920
Next voicemail is called SM part four.

3533
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:08,820
And sorry, I'm posting it right now.

3534
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:11,320
SM part.

3535
02:37:12,220 --> 02:37:13,620
No, sorry.

3536
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:13,920
Yeah.

3537
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:14,820
No, SM part three.

3538
02:37:14,820 --> 02:37:15,820
This is SM part three.

3539
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:16,120
Okay.

3540
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:17,820
Three, two, one, go.

3541
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:22,220
I'm the guy who sent in Riley seeing discord the other week.

3542
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:25,820
Just want to say that was 100% real.

3543
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:30,620
I don't know why you guys would think that some fan would just

3544
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:35,020
pretend to be Riley seeing discord would be a really weird,

3545
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:36,620
strange thing to do.

3546
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:38,820
Anyway, it's on a sound cloud.

3547
02:37:38,820 --> 02:37:45,320
It's like a parody of discord related to the Maddox drama.

3548
02:37:45,620 --> 02:37:48,620
That's why he said I'm not a fan of Redditors.

3549
02:37:48,620 --> 02:37:50,620
Instead of I'm not a fan of puppeteers.

3550
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:51,920
Yeah.

3551
02:37:52,120 --> 02:37:53,420
Anyway, verse two.

3552
02:37:54,220 --> 02:37:55,920
I got fishes that is cool.

3553
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:57,820
He sounds so bad.

3554
02:37:59,320 --> 02:38:01,920
Oh God, you like breathe in the middle of his lines.

3555
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:03,020
He sucks.

3556
02:38:03,220 --> 02:38:04,720
He sucks.

3557
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:09,420
Oh, his voice breaks.

3558
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:11,820
He tries to like do a falsetto and he cracks.

3559
02:38:13,220 --> 02:38:16,020
He doesn't crack, but he's so breathy.

3560
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:17,420
It's really floundering.

3561
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:19,420
Sucks.

3562
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:25,020
Um, yeah, it would it would be weird for someone to fake it.

3563
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:27,520
But I mean, people do weird things all the time.

3564
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:28,120
I don't know.

3565
02:38:28,120 --> 02:38:29,220
I mean, I know that it's real.

3566
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:31,120
How old is that like sound cloud account?

3567
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:34,220
I don't know how the account is, but the song is only like eight

3568
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:36,420
months old, I think.

3569
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:40,220
I mean, and eight eight months ago, like no one knew who the

3570
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:41,720
fuck any of these guys were.

3571
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:46,120
Oh, no one in the PCP circle.

3572
02:38:46,220 --> 02:38:48,820
Maybe not no one in the PCP did.

3573
02:38:48,820 --> 02:38:50,320
That might be true.

3574
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:51,820
Wait, hold on.

3575
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:54,920
Let me confirm the song was posted.

3576
02:38:57,620 --> 02:39:00,020
I mean, the comments are from like eight months ago.

3577
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:04,220
So I don't know if I can see whatever it doesn't matter.

3578
02:39:05,020 --> 02:39:07,920
But that's like if it's about the Maddox drama, that seems

3579
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:08,720
really late.

3580
02:39:09,220 --> 02:39:09,620
Yeah.

3581
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:09,820
Okay.

3582
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:12,520
No, it was posted two years ago or more than a year ago.

3583
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:16,820
Well, they still talk about Maddox.

3584
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:17,420
I don't know.

3585
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:19,520
I'm sure.

3586
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:20,120
Yeah, too.

3587
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:20,920
A bit.

3588
02:39:21,220 --> 02:39:23,320
I mean, I don't think he's been doing.

3589
02:39:23,820 --> 02:39:28,120
I think now they just kind of like will like see Maddox

3590
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:31,020
live streaming and like make fun of him being awkward.

3591
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:35,120
I think that's just kind of where it's at.

3592
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:36,120
How entertaining.

3593
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:38,020
How how.

3594
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:39,020
Yeah, I know, right?

3595
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,020
Uh, okay.

3596
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:46,520
Next one is called quick and painless, right?

3597
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:48,120
Wait, it's loading.

3598
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:50,820
Oh, is that a 3 3 13?

3599
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:54,020
3 3 13 is called quick and painless.

3600
02:39:54,020 --> 02:39:54,420
All right.

3601
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:56,520
Wait, did we skip one?

3602
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:57,720
Did we skip 3 3 12?

3603
02:39:57,720 --> 02:39:58,120
Yes.

3604
02:39:58,320 --> 02:39:58,520
All right.

3605
02:39:58,520 --> 02:39:59,920
3 3 12 is called read.

3606
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:01,920
Just do computer science, bro.

3607
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:03,420
3 2 1 go.

3608
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:08,620
So CS is a very good way to make money that with minimal

3609
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:11,320
with less less time in college than you need to be like a

3610
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:12,920
lawyer or a doctor or whatever.

3611
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:16,220
I just would warn that that caller that not everybody is

3612
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:17,020
cut out for it.

3613
02:40:17,020 --> 02:40:18,620
And this is the test.

3614
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:23,220
Watch the three blue one brown linear algebra series on

3615
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:26,620
YouTube and if you can make it through it and you enjoy it

3616
02:40:26,620 --> 02:40:28,820
and you can follow along with what he's saying, then you're

3617
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:30,020
fucking perfect for it.

3618
02:40:30,020 --> 02:40:33,420
But if not, it might you might not be the thing for you

3619
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:37,320
because CS just requires that a lot of math and a lot of

3620
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:38,420
abstractions.

3621
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:41,620
It requires you to be able to think an entirely theoretical

3622
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:44,020
space a lot in order to do it well.

3623
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:46,520
But if you pass that test, you'll you'll do fine.

3624
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:50,120
I have never heard of three three blue one brown.

3625
02:40:52,420 --> 02:40:53,820
It's a YouTube channel.

3626
02:40:55,420 --> 02:40:56,220
I guess.

3627
02:40:57,520 --> 02:40:58,120
Okay.

3628
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:04,320
I mean, check it out if you want to know about thinking next

3629
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:08,520
to voicemail is called quick and painless, right?

3630
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:09,820
Three, two, one, go.

3631
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:13,720
You know how your perception of time can change like particularly

3632
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:17,220
when you're in pain or under stress?

3633
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:20,020
What if as your head is being crushed?

3634
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:23,620
It feels like a fucking million years or some shit.

3635
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:25,120
Yeah.

3636
02:41:25,720 --> 02:41:27,120
That would be so epic.

3637
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:27,520
I would.

3638
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:28,120
I would suck.

3639
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:29,420
I would not have a good time.

3640
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:32,020
What if when you die, you.

3641
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:36,720
You're dead, but your consciousness doesn't disappear.

3642
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:40,720
Rather, it's just stuck in whatever sensation you were

3643
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:43,420
feeling at the moment of death forever.

3644
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:44,020
I'll be there.

3645
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:46,820
Oh, God, I hope that's how it would die coming.

3646
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:49,320
Hope I die coming.

3647
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:53,820
Yeah, I'll be on my death bed and I'll tell my my my son's like

3648
02:41:53,820 --> 02:41:55,920
got really fucking drinking off your dog.

3649
02:41:57,020 --> 02:42:00,420
I'm really this is this is important.

3650
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:02,720
This is the one thing I'll ever ask of you, son.

3651
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:03,620
You got me.

3652
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:06,020
Yeah, you drive me up and up on his death bed.

3653
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:09,820
And I'm going to the only way I'm going to die when the nut hits.

3654
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:13,420
I got to die in fucking bliss.

3655
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:18,120
You ever pull the plug when the nut you ever see that one that

3656
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:20,720
one tweet that was a good screenshot of a fortune for it

3657
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:23,820
where this guy was talking about how you like he pitched his

3658
02:42:23,820 --> 02:42:26,320
idea for a book to so many publishers.

3659
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:30,120
And I'm one and like, I think he kept getting denied because

3660
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:31,720
his book was too fetishistic.

3661
02:42:32,420 --> 02:42:35,420
And people are kind of like, well, what's your book about?

3662
02:42:35,420 --> 02:42:37,320
And he said like, oh, it's about a guy who like, I think

3663
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:41,620
it gets into like a car accident or or no, it's about a kid

3664
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:43,920
who I think falls into like a cement mixer or something and

3665
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:44,720
that kills him.

3666
02:42:44,920 --> 02:42:48,620
But his consciousness is still in the cement and that cement

3667
02:42:48,620 --> 02:42:52,920
is like used to like pave like streets and he talks about

3668
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:55,620
all the sensations of like feeling people's like feet on

3669
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:58,520
him and how much he likes it when like he likes like women's

3670
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:00,120
like bare feet to walk on him.

3671
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:03,120
I see.

3672
02:43:03,620 --> 02:43:04,320
Yeah.

3673
02:43:04,820 --> 02:43:08,120
I have not seen that post but I get it.

3674
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:10,120
Next voicemail.

3675
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:13,320
Next voicemail is called rebutting Nate revisionism.

3676
02:43:13,820 --> 02:43:14,420
No, sorry.

3677
02:43:14,420 --> 02:43:16,320
Next one is called games for Ben.

3678
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:18,320
Three, two, one, go.

3679
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:21,220
Ben, are you aware of disco Elysium?

3680
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:22,820
It's a very Bencore game.

3681
02:43:22,820 --> 02:43:23,720
You probably like it.

3682
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:27,520
The characters in the setting and shit are all extremely

3683
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:31,120
Bencore because they're about like cops that fucking suck

3684
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:35,820
in like conflict between communists and libs and yeah,

3685
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:39,420
I've seen the setting is like there's this fucking actually

3686
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:41,720
I won't spoil that but the setting is fucking crazy.

3687
02:43:41,720 --> 02:43:42,420
You'd like it.

3688
02:43:42,420 --> 02:43:46,220
The it looks like maybe this kind of story I would like

3689
02:43:46,220 --> 02:43:50,320
but it's also like one of those isometric are CRPG's and I

3690
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:51,720
like don't really play those.

3691
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:54,920
So I'm like maybe I'd like it.

3692
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:56,620
Maybe.

3693
02:43:56,620 --> 02:43:57,120
Maybe.

3694
02:43:58,220 --> 02:43:58,820
Maybe.

3695
02:43:58,820 --> 02:43:59,320
I don't know.

3696
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:00,520
It sounds cool.

3697
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:01,620
I want to play it eventually.

3698
02:44:02,220 --> 02:44:04,820
That's just not my usual genre.

3699
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:06,120
It could be good anyway.

3700
02:44:06,820 --> 02:44:09,420
Next one is called rebutting Nate revisionism.

3701
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:11,120
Three, two, one, go.

3702
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:14,720
Nate was not a good host like he was all right.

3703
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:19,720
But remember when Nate had the most control over the podcast

3704
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:25,220
like around episode 120 X or one one X or so.

3705
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:27,320
It was fucking terrible.

3706
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:30,820
Every single episode needed to have a fucking topic and it

3707
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:34,020
was terrible and nobody had anything to say about the topic.

3708
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:34,820
So it sucked.

3709
02:44:34,820 --> 02:44:35,820
That's true.

3710
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:41,320
Nate was weirdly Nate was and like continues to be weirdly

3711
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:44,920
fixated on the idea that like the podcast must have a topic

3712
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:51,520
or it's like not worth doing even as though as though the

3713
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:56,620
it was ever about the topics like it like all it was always

3714
02:44:56,620 --> 02:44:59,920
the case that like the topic of the episode was just an excuse

3715
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:02,520
to like get the ball rolling and get us like talking about

3716
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:03,920
our own weird shit.

3717
02:45:04,620 --> 02:45:06,520
I don't know how he doesn't understand that.

3718
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:07,720
I really don't get it.

3719
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:11,920
But he but when I asked when I've asked him he said like,

3720
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:13,420
yeah, you know, the show's different now.

3721
02:45:13,420 --> 02:45:15,820
It's you know, it's not about topics anymore.

3722
02:45:15,820 --> 02:45:17,420
You know, it used to be about the topics, man.

3723
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:19,320
It used to be about the topics now.

3724
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:20,420
I don't know, man.

3725
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:22,420
Just without those topics.

3726
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:24,320
I'm just I'm just not feeling it anymore.

3727
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:28,020
I mean, I'm paraphrasing obviously some but he has a he's

3728
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:28,420
weird.

3729
02:45:28,420 --> 02:45:29,520
He's weird about I don't get it.

3730
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:33,620
I genuinely don't understand what what the thought I process

3731
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:35,520
even though I've asked him and he's explained it to me.

3732
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:36,720
I still don't understand it.

3733
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:40,620
I remember back when you guys still did topics and how I let

3734
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:46,520
I left like a paragraph long like comment on the on the episode

3735
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:50,320
titled monsters because like it didn't really seem like everyone's

3736
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:50,820
favorite.

3737
02:45:50,820 --> 02:45:51,820
Yeah, no one had nothing.

3738
02:45:51,820 --> 02:45:52,920
No, no, no monsters.

3739
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:55,720
Monsters to was the one that was like legendarily bad.

3740
02:45:55,720 --> 02:45:56,120
Right.

3741
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:59,420
Well, I thought monsters to was a patron exclusive.

3742
02:46:00,620 --> 02:46:03,720
I thought maybe maybe you're right.

3743
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:04,020
Yeah.

3744
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:04,820
No, I think you're right.

3745
02:46:04,820 --> 02:46:05,320
Actually.

3746
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:05,820
Yeah.

3747
02:46:05,820 --> 02:46:06,020
Yeah.

3748
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:08,120
Because monsters one was the one where like, yeah, it just seemed

3749
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:11,220
like you guys did like it's so weird because it's like this was

3750
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:13,820
back when you guys would still actively talk about like Pokemon

3751
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:15,320
and that's like a monster, right?

3752
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:17,820
Like because we always talked about Pokemon.

3753
02:46:17,820 --> 02:46:19,720
We don't have anything else to say about Pokemon.

3754
02:46:19,720 --> 02:46:24,520
And I don't fucking care at all about like Kaiju's or whatever.

3755
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:24,820
Right.

3756
02:46:24,820 --> 02:46:25,020
Right.

3757
02:46:25,020 --> 02:46:25,820
Exactly.

3758
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:28,920
Oh, wait, did you, um, did you see the trailer for that like

3759
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:30,320
Pokemon knockoff game?

3760
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:35,020
Oh, the one where they're like working in a sweatshop.

3761
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:35,920
They have guns.

3762
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:36,520
Yeah.

3763
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:38,320
Yeah.

3764
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:39,720
It looks stupid.

3765
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:40,320
I don't know.

3766
02:46:40,320 --> 02:46:43,120
I kind of think that yeah, go on.

3767
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:47,820
It doesn't look like the kind of it looks like the kind of thing

3768
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:52,520
that would generate interest from its kind of like surprising theme,

3769
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:56,020
but then like wouldn't actually be a good game underneath it.

3770
02:46:56,420 --> 02:46:59,220
I'm very that's that's what it seems like.

3771
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,320
I'm very interested.

3772
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:01,520
I'm hoping it's a good game.

3773
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:04,820
I think it'd be very funny if it was a good game because I kind of

3774
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:06,820
like it would be cool if it was good.

3775
02:47:06,820 --> 02:47:08,220
Yeah, I'm kind of interesting.

3776
02:47:08,220 --> 02:47:11,820
I mean, I like the angle of like, yeah, yeah, this is just like dog

3777
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:15,420
fights and we're just criminals and we poach and we use sweatshops.

3778
02:47:16,420 --> 02:47:17,620
It's just I don't know.

3779
02:47:17,620 --> 02:47:19,720
It's like your team rocket.

3780
02:47:19,720 --> 02:47:21,720
It's like you're playing as Team Rocket, though.

3781
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:23,220
Finally, finally.

3782
02:47:23,220 --> 02:47:24,220
Well, we all want it.

3783
02:47:26,220 --> 02:47:30,320
Yeah, it could be cool if it's good, but I kind of think it won't be good.

3784
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:31,020
All right.

3785
02:47:31,020 --> 02:47:31,720
I don't know.

3786
02:47:31,720 --> 02:47:32,820
You got to go next voice mail.

3787
02:47:32,820 --> 02:47:33,420
I don't know.

3788
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:35,320
Yeah, absolutely.

3789
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:38,020
Next one is called more thoughts on archiving.

3790
02:47:38,020 --> 02:47:40,020
Three, two, one, go.

3791
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:44,820
The destruction of knowledge, like the removal of an archive so that

3792
02:47:44,820 --> 02:47:49,420
you can only know about something through fucking memory and word of mouth

3793
02:47:49,420 --> 02:47:54,020
again, like in the in the prehistoric age, the fucking destruction of

3794
02:47:54,020 --> 02:48:00,620
knowledge like that of information, of media, of whatever is like

3795
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:03,420
existentially horrifying to me.

3796
02:48:03,420 --> 02:48:04,620
It's terrifying.

3797
02:48:04,620 --> 02:48:05,320
I hate it.

3798
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:10,620
I haven't heard anything from like whoever's in charge of the archive or

3799
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:12,220
I mean of the of the PCP Wiki.

3800
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:17,320
I don't know if maybe that person like reconsidered their position on like

3801
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:19,820
deleting or privating the Wiki.

3802
02:48:19,820 --> 02:48:25,420
I kind of hope they do since like I and I kind of think most people

3803
02:48:25,420 --> 02:48:28,020
think it's not what should happen.

3804
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:30,020
What happened to them?

3805
02:48:30,020 --> 02:48:31,520
I guess I didn't hear about this.

3806
02:48:32,220 --> 02:48:36,420
Some someone someone said that like the Wiki was being deleted because

3807
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:41,320
like things changed and it was things were different now.

3808
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:45,920
As though like that's not the purpose of an archive is to record

3809
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:48,120
how things previously were right.

3810
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:48,520
Yeah.

3811
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:49,220
Yeah.

3812
02:48:50,320 --> 02:48:51,820
Yeah, that's that's weird.

3813
02:48:51,820 --> 02:48:55,520
Like what if things change you are super weird.

3814
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:57,620
If things change, you archive the changes.

3815
02:48:57,620 --> 02:49:00,420
You don't like that's what you need an archive.

3816
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:00,620
Yeah.

3817
02:49:00,620 --> 02:49:04,120
You don't fucking rewrite old like information just because things

3818
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:05,920
change like you don't just like, uh.

3819
02:49:07,320 --> 02:49:09,620
Yeah, you know now we got we got Darwin's.

3820
02:49:09,620 --> 02:49:13,020
We got Darwin's theory of not intelligence.

3821
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:14,820
We got Darwin's theory of evolution now.

3822
02:49:14,820 --> 02:49:17,320
Like I guess we better I guess we better burn all these like

3823
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:21,320
Lamarckian books on like on design design or whatever.

3824
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:23,320
Like we don't do the science has changed.

3825
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:24,520
So this shouldn't be archive.

3826
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:25,120
We should delete it.

3827
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:29,420
It's like if it's like in like if the like Marvel or DC comic

3828
02:49:29,420 --> 02:49:31,920
Wiki like every time they read with a character, they just get rid

3829
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:34,020
of the old information or replace with the new one.

3830
02:49:34,220 --> 02:49:35,220
No, delete it all.

3831
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:35,920
Delete it all.

3832
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:37,720
We can't have anyone remembering that.

3833
02:49:37,720 --> 02:49:39,320
Yeah, that character isn't like that no more.

3834
02:49:39,820 --> 02:49:40,620
It's dumb.

3835
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:43,620
I mean, I guess maybe you need probably a fucking Nate had that's

3836
02:49:43,620 --> 02:49:45,620
the guy who runs is probably a fucking Nate had maybe.

3837
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:47,520
I mean, I have no clue.

3838
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:50,820
It wasn't even the person who did it who was like voicemail.

3839
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:53,320
It was like someone speaking on their behalf.

3840
02:49:53,320 --> 02:49:58,620
I think I so I'm a little bit mysterious actually like what's

3841
02:49:58,620 --> 02:49:59,820
even going on with it.

3842
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:00,220
Right.

3843
02:50:00,220 --> 02:50:02,320
I don't actually know who runs it.

3844
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:03,820
Oh,

3845
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:07,820
little sus.

3846
02:50:07,820 --> 02:50:08,720
It's little sus.

3847
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:09,420
It's Jeff.

3848
02:50:09,620 --> 02:50:10,220
It's Jeff.

3849
02:50:10,220 --> 02:50:11,320
It was always Jeff.

3850
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:12,520
It's always Jeff.

3851
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:13,020
Okay.

3852
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:16,120
Next voicemail is called Ben.

3853
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:17,420
I live at the beach.

3854
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:20,720
Please join me three two one go.

3855
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:24,220
Then I just want you to know I was really offended that you thought

3856
02:50:24,220 --> 02:50:26,420
I was going to make pig noises at you.

3857
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:27,120
I'm sorry.

3858
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:27,920
It's very rude.

3859
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:28,420
You're going to do it.

3860
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:29,220
You're going to do it right now.

3861
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:31,020
Oh, you didn't do it.

3862
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:31,420
Okay.

3863
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:33,520
Actually, the next one is going to be the pig noises.

3864
02:50:34,620 --> 02:50:36,020
Someone's got to do it.

3865
02:50:36,220 --> 02:50:38,320
Someone's someone's someone's going to do it.

3866
02:50:38,320 --> 02:50:38,620
Okay.

3867
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:44,320
The next one is called Johnny tsunami three two one go.

3868
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:49,320
Hello, bcp Johnny tsunami calling and again from Tokyo.

3869
02:50:49,720 --> 02:50:51,620
Your podcast gets worse every week.

3870
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:53,220
I don't even listen to it anymore.

3871
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:54,220
It's never so bad.

3872
02:50:54,220 --> 02:50:55,020
It's terrible.

3873
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:57,620
Really, you know what you should do?

3874
02:50:57,720 --> 02:51:01,220
You should kick Ben from the podcast even so I would be better

3875
02:51:01,220 --> 02:51:04,820
than him if you can't get Nate back at least replace Ben with

3876
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:07,120
someone who is a brain dead like Dr.

3877
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:07,420
Wolf.

3878
02:51:07,420 --> 02:51:11,120
He has a hundred twenty K subscribers forty seven million views

3879
02:51:11,420 --> 02:51:16,020
or I love him possible 130 K subscribers twenty six million

3880
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:18,320
views unique winners on your show.

3881
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:19,420
Not losers.

3882
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:21,620
He's right.

3883
02:51:22,220 --> 02:51:22,820
God damn it.

3884
02:51:22,820 --> 02:51:23,420
He's right.

3885
02:51:24,020 --> 02:51:25,020
What did you hear?

3886
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:25,420
Yeah.

3887
02:51:26,420 --> 02:51:27,020
Yeah, go on.

3888
02:51:27,420 --> 02:51:30,320
I was gonna say is he doing Trump impression Jesus help him

3889
02:51:30,320 --> 02:51:31,320
that fucking lag.

3890
02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:35,020
Was he was that a Trump impression?

3891
02:51:35,020 --> 02:51:35,420
Yeah.

3892
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:37,820
Was that a Trump impression?

3893
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:39,120
Is that what you're wondering?

3894
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:39,820
You're curious.

3895
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:42,420
You're not sure you're you're on the fence about whether that

3896
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:45,820
was a Trump impression moments that sound very like he got a

3897
02:51:45,820 --> 02:51:49,520
couple of the Trump isms like I'm pretty sure that was like that

3898
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:50,020
was like it.

3899
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:51,520
Oh my God.

3900
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:53,620
Yes, that was definitely I think that was like a Trump

3901
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:57,720
soundboard or something or like a or like an AI Trump voice.

3902
02:51:57,720 --> 02:51:58,420
Yeah, yes.

3903
02:51:58,420 --> 02:51:59,920
It was definitely a Trump impression.

3904
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:00,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3905
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:08,020
I think have you seen that clip of a Kamala?

3906
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:10,620
Yes, I know what you're talking about.

3907
02:52:10,620 --> 02:52:11,120
You know the one?

3908
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:12,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3909
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:12,920
You know what I'm talking about?

3910
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:15,620
Yeah, do not come do not come.

3911
02:52:16,720 --> 02:52:17,420

3912
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:20,320
Yeah, cuz the Trump saying I'm gonna come.

3913
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:22,020
I'm gonna come.

3914
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:23,920
And then he's like the crowd.

3915
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:24,620
Yeah.

3916
02:52:24,620 --> 02:52:26,420
And he's like, oh, it sucks.

3917
02:52:26,420 --> 02:52:28,320
Yeah, I wrote it for the wrong guy.

3918
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:30,120
I miss him.

3919
02:52:30,120 --> 02:52:31,220
I miss him.

3920
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:33,820
God, why do we have to have all these what you know, it's so

3921
02:52:33,820 --> 02:52:37,020
sad that we have all these like Nazis running around ruin it

3922
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:37,420
for us.

3923
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:39,220
Trump was the funniest president.

3924
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:41,820
We could have all just enjoyed it and had a good giggle

3925
02:52:41,820 --> 02:52:45,620
except people had to go and get serious people had everyone

3926
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:47,420
had Trump was being ironic guys.

3927
02:52:47,420 --> 02:52:49,320
It was just satire everything he was doing.

3928
02:52:49,320 --> 02:52:52,520
Trump Trump was being ironic and then some idiots had to go

3929
02:52:52,520 --> 02:52:53,820
and take it too seriously.

3930
02:52:53,820 --> 02:52:54,920
They took it too far.

3931
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:56,920
They ruined it for all of his fans.

3932
02:52:56,920 --> 02:52:58,520
I don't know that he's ironic.

3933
02:52:58,520 --> 02:53:00,320
He's supposed to be satirical and they just took.

3934
02:53:00,320 --> 02:53:01,320
Yeah, they took it too far.

3935
02:53:02,320 --> 02:53:03,720
Yeah, it's true.

3936
02:53:03,720 --> 02:53:04,520
It's true.

3937
02:53:04,520 --> 02:53:06,520
I choose to believe that it's true.

3938
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:10,120
Donald Trump has the worst fandom of any of any show on the

3939
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:10,720
hub, right?

3940
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:13,720
That is discovery.

3941
02:53:13,720 --> 02:53:14,520
Okay, next.

3942
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:17,920
I'm sorry.

3943
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:18,520
I'm sorry.

3944
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:20,520
I I dead named discovery.

3945
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:30,120
Next voicemail is called Henlo Corgo 6 3 2 1 go.

3946
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:34,520
Okay, so I honestly cannot remember for the life of me

3947
02:53:34,520 --> 02:53:36,120
which lecture it was.

3948
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:43,220
There was a PCP lecture where you been reference the song

3949
02:53:43,220 --> 02:53:47,920
Communist daughter by neutral milk hotel with the lion's

3950
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:49,820
seam and stains the mountain tops.

3951
02:53:50,220 --> 02:53:52,820
And for you, I've said I've referenced that all the time

3952
02:53:52,820 --> 02:53:53,820
just sticking around.

3953
02:53:53,820 --> 02:53:59,820
I can tell but since in the airplane over the seat by

3954
02:53:59,820 --> 02:54:03,020
neutral milk hotel is my favorite album of all time.

3955
02:54:03,620 --> 02:54:07,820
I was just kind of wondering like how much you actually

3956
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:12,220
like the album or if it's actually had an influence.

3957
02:54:12,220 --> 02:54:13,420
This is goofy.

3958
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:14,820
This is a goofy question.

3959
02:54:14,820 --> 02:54:17,320
Just please talk about neutral milk hotel.

3960
02:54:17,320 --> 02:54:19,420
Just talk about neutral milk hotel.

3961
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:21,220
I don't care if you love the album.

3962
02:54:21,220 --> 02:54:23,620
We're eating a lot of neutral milk hotel talk about

3963
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:24,620
neutral milk hotel.

3964
02:54:24,620 --> 02:54:29,720
I have the I think I do remember the others one lecture

3965
02:54:29,720 --> 02:54:33,220
where I just starts on seam and stains the mountain tops.

3966
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:34,820
I yell.

3967
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:39,920
I mean, when I lived at Digi House with Trixie and Davoo,

3968
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:44,620
there was like we had a running joke where we would just

3969
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:47,020
start yelling neutral milk hotel.

3970
02:54:47,020 --> 02:54:50,620
We would just start yelling I love you Jesus.

3971
02:54:52,620 --> 02:54:55,820
And I've done it on the podcasts many, many times.

3972
02:54:56,620 --> 02:54:59,820
I mean, it is a funny joke and it's a funny meme and

3973
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:01,620
they're funny lyrics and it's fun to go.

3974
02:55:07,420 --> 02:55:09,420
I mean, genuinely, I really like them.

3975
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:11,620
I don't listen to very much music, but that's like one of

3976
02:55:11,620 --> 02:55:15,320
the few albums that I have like that I do come back to

3977
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:17,420
every once in a while, listen to the album.

3978
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:20,520
I would say I'm a big fan of that album specifically the

3979
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:21,720
album as a whole.

3980
02:55:22,220 --> 02:55:23,620
I think it's a masterpiece.

3981
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:25,020
It makes me cry.

3982
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:28,120
That's what I think about it.

3983
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:29,520
But also it's funny to go.

3984
02:55:33,920 --> 02:55:38,420
All I know about that album is that it was for and Frank or

3985
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:38,920
not.

3986
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:41,420
Yeah, yeah, that's all I know.

3987
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:44,020
You're gonna say Lisa Frank.

3988
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:45,120
Yeah, Lisa Frank.

3989
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,120
I love.

3990
02:55:47,320 --> 02:55:49,020
Yeah, Rip Lisa Frank.

3991
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:51,920
She didn't have it come Rip Lisa Frank then.

3992
02:55:52,020 --> 02:55:52,520
Yeah.

3993
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:54,920
Yeah, I see taken from us too soon.

3994
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:56,820
If I if I see those Nazis, it's on site.

3995
02:55:56,820 --> 02:55:58,120
I'll just tell you that much.

3996
02:55:58,120 --> 02:55:59,920
Lisa Frank still has shooters out here.

3997
02:56:02,320 --> 02:56:05,120
Nazis were based until they killed Lisa Frank and then

3998
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:08,920
it got too real with Nazis that Hitler was being ironic

3999
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:11,120
and he was just being satirical and like I took it too

4000
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:11,720
fucking far.

4001
02:56:11,720 --> 02:56:14,520
They just took they didn't they had no sense of humor.

4002
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:16,220
Exactly.

4003
02:56:16,220 --> 02:56:17,120
That's like oh my God.

4004
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:20,320
That's why I hate the left on ironically he was he was

4005
02:56:20,320 --> 02:56:23,720
just he was just being he was just being a contrarian.

4006
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:25,720
You know, he was just putting some he was just putting

4007
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:28,520
some controversial shit out there to stir up some controversy.

4008
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:31,120
Get people talking make a big spectacle out of it.

4009
02:56:31,120 --> 02:56:32,320
It was a bit guys.

4010
02:56:32,320 --> 02:56:33,720
It was like bro.

4011
02:56:33,820 --> 02:56:35,220
It was just a bit.

4012
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:37,120
Look at his bus is mustache.

4013
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:38,720
It's a Charlie Chaplin mustache.

4014
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:39,820
It's a bit guys.

4015
02:56:39,820 --> 02:56:41,820
He was fucking clowning on it was a bit.

4016
02:56:42,020 --> 02:56:42,920
It was a bit.

4017
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:43,920
Nobody understood.

4018
02:56:43,920 --> 02:56:45,920
Nobody understood postmodern humor.

4019
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:46,420
Nobody.

4020
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:49,120
Nobody was operating on the same wavelength.

4021
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:50,620
Oh, yeah.

4022
02:56:50,620 --> 02:56:51,720
Um, yeah.

4023
02:56:51,720 --> 02:56:54,020
How many was that?

4024
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:54,620
No, that was it.

4025
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:55,520
That was the last one.

4026
02:56:55,520 --> 02:56:56,020
Okay.

4027
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:56,720
All right.

4028
02:56:56,920 --> 02:56:58,120
We're just under three hours.

4029
02:56:58,120 --> 02:56:58,720
It's amazing.

4030
02:56:58,720 --> 02:56:59,520
Oh, yeah.

4031
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:00,620
I guess let's fucking.

4032
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:01,720
I guess let's fucking.

4033
02:57:02,620 --> 02:57:05,220
You got any flat final words already.

4034
02:57:05,220 --> 02:57:06,920
I already mentioned villain verse couple of times.

4035
02:57:06,920 --> 02:57:07,820
Um, okay.

4036
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:08,820
I guess I guess another thing.

4037
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:10,420
I'll where do people find it?

4038
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:11,720
Where do people find you?

4039
02:57:11,720 --> 02:57:13,020
Where do people buy it?

4040
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:17,120
You just look up cheesy Manfredo on Google and you'll find

4041
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:20,220
either my gum road or my itch that IO page.

4042
02:57:20,620 --> 02:57:23,020
Um, and you can get like digital copies.

4043
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:26,020
If you type in villain verse, um, you'll, you'll find like

4044
02:57:26,520 --> 02:57:29,020
this should be a tumbler that has like the first three

4045
02:57:29,020 --> 02:57:30,220
chapters that are free.

4046
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:32,620
Actually, no, by the time this comes out, that'll be the

4047
02:57:32,620 --> 02:57:34,220
first four chapters that are free.

4048
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:37,020
You know, I plan to eventually have all of all of villain

4049
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:38,820
versus going to be free to read when it's over.

4050
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:40,020
I promise you that.

4051
02:57:40,520 --> 02:57:41,620
Um, right.

4052
02:57:41,620 --> 02:57:45,420
And I guess one more thing is that if, if you know me from

4053
02:57:45,420 --> 02:57:48,820
Twitter or any other like social media, my profile picture

4054
02:57:49,220 --> 02:57:50,320
is a little plush.

4055
02:57:50,320 --> 02:57:51,520
It's a little plush clown.

4056
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:52,020
Right.

4057
02:57:52,420 --> 02:57:55,620
And if you want your own, um, I'm not selling push.

4058
02:57:55,620 --> 02:57:58,520
I'm not selling like plush pasta, the clowns, but, but,

4059
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:02,120
but the person who custom made these, um, which is my partner,

4060
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:05,820
they are currently, um, you know, they're currently fully take

4061
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:07,220
commission commissions now.

4062
02:58:07,220 --> 02:58:08,020
So they have a slot.

4063
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:10,620
So if you want something in the same quality, you know,

4064
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:11,920
they do, they do all sorts of things.

4065
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:13,420
They have a whole commission.

4066
02:58:13,420 --> 02:58:15,420
They go by a rod and egg shop.

4067
02:58:16,920 --> 02:58:17,320
Yeah.

4068
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:18,320
It's a nice plush.

4069
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:18,720
Yeah.

4070
02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:19,320
It's a nice plush.

4071
02:58:19,320 --> 02:58:20,520
It's a, it squeaks too.

4072
02:58:20,520 --> 02:58:22,120
The note, the noise, the nose.

4073
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:24,020
If you look at it, it squeaks.

4074
02:58:24,020 --> 02:58:24,520
Yeah.

4075
02:58:25,420 --> 02:58:27,920
Oh, now that's, now that's delightful.

4076
02:58:27,920 --> 02:58:28,120
Right.

4077
02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:28,720
Exactly.

4078
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:30,820
It's pretty epic and base.

4079
02:58:30,820 --> 02:58:35,220
I recommend you guys buy one because you won't just be paying

4080
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:35,820
for their rent.
