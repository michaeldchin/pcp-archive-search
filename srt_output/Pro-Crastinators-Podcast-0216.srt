00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Hello everyone and welcome to the, to the, I remember it, so you don't have to, I remember

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,280
to show up to the podcast so you don't have to, it's Ben Saint of the Pro Crastinators

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:25,760
Podcast and it's finally happened, it's finally happened.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,160
Only one person showed up for the fucking call, only, I'm the only one, I'm it, I'm

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,000
it, it's just me, it's the legendary one man cast, we've been waiting, we've been waiting,

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,720
and now's the time for it to happen, it's just me, it's the just Ben cast here on the

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:57,880
Pro Crastinators Podcast. Remember that, remember Howard Dean? Good times, good times, good

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:10,640
time in my life, the Howard Dean era. Nostalgic, ah fuck, fuck Hippo you recording? Okay, well,

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:23,880
damn it, I'm, Hippo just joined the call, I'm recording, I started recording, I gotta

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,320
admit, Hippo, I kinda, I was very tempted not to add everyone to let everyone know that

11
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,400
I was here, and I kinda wish that I had, I kinda wish that, nothing personal, I'm sure

12
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm sure you would feel the same way, a sort of sense of regret that had I not added everyone,

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,080
the legendary event would have transpired. Yeah, I mean, last week I was feeling the

14
00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:00,360
same way, like, it was gonna be just me, nobody else seemed interested, but I felt like I

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,440
should, cause like, sometimes people forget, and also, I mean, I don't know, it's like,

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,920
there's only two people, there's only one person, how's the whole podcast gonna come

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:20,280
of this, doesn't really feel like the Pro Crastinators. If I hadn't, you know, everyone, then everyone

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,920
would have said, everyone would have said, Ben, why didn't you add everyone, why didn't

19
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,400
you add everyone, Ben, why didn't you, why didn't you take it upon yourself to remind

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,320
all of us, you know, and to be fair, I'm sure, normally Nate adds everyone in a normal

21
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,000
episode where he's here and everyone's here and all that shit. So, you know, I guess,

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,160
okay, it's fine. I mean, had it just been me, I guess my strategy would have been to,

23
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,400
you know, just kind of, just ramble for a little bit, which I'm sure I could do quite

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:07,120
easily, maybe for like, you know, 15, 30 minutes, you know, just, you know, insult everyone

25
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,880
else, talk about, talk about, you know, do a little self-aware bit where I comment on,

26
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:23,160
you know, the sorry state of the PCP these days, where this, you know, the, you know,

27
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,720
the, the, the clearly, the clearly defunct, the clearly malfunctioning machine, you know,

28
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,360
which puts, which outputs this, you know, gestures around myself to, to the one man

29
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,520
cast currently transpiring, which puts this out as it's, as its output, you know, as a

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,400
way to sort of head off criticism and put myself kind of above it, you know, put, and

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,760
then, and then, and then you, and then spend an inordinate amount of time doing like voicemails,

32
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,480
right? And just like go through every voicemail and try to just try, just try and stretch

33
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,880
you to one after as long as I can, you know, just maybe try and hit an hour and a half.

34
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,360
I think, I don't think it would be that hard. Anyway, that was my story. I was thinking about

35
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,880
this as I was sitting in the call, waiting for that mythical, for that mythical three

36
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,480
10 to round the corner.

37
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Yeah, I maybe I shouldn't have jumped in. I don't really have anything to talk about.

38
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:40,360
Um, no, it's fine. Well, I mean, up to you, I guess. But why don't we talk about, why don't

39
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,480
we talk about last week? It was just you and me last week, right?

40
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,960
Yeah, I was there and then you jumped in immediately as we started recording as I started

41
00:04:51,960 --> 00:05:02,080
writing. And so we talked about comics and and what each of us are doing. I was talking

42
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,560
about getting tired with internet discourse. And I have, I yeah,

43
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,320
getting getting tired of it, tired to the like weary, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,760
I wasn't I thought you said hired, like, putting out an ad everyone like, Hey, guys, here's

45
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:26,320
my resume, you know, you know anyone? No, it's it's it's poisonous. It's poisonous.

46
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,400
It's the worst. I don't like it anymore. Internet discourse. Yeah. Yeah. I've been feeling

47
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,880
the same way. Twitter sucks. Twitter is where I do most of my internet discourse. It sucks.

48
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,960
I need I need to do something about it, though. It's it's it's always such a habit to like,

49
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,080
you know, you know, I go on Twitter, just to see what's going on. And then, you know,

50
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:01,040
if there's an argument to be had, I decide to jump in usually. Yeah. And it's it's never

51
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,160
good. It's like, sometimes I get through to someone and we reach an understanding, but

52
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,600
more far more often, it's easier to do that in discord than it is on Twitter.

53
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,520
It's just it's just bad. It's just not good. I need to delete my Twitter or do something

54
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,960
drastic that would force me to stop because I'm because I am I'm out of control.

55
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,440
Something drastic, like suicide, for instance.

56
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,960
Don't even talk about that. Don't even talk about that. I've been thinking about it.

57
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,120
I've been thinking about it just a little bit. Oh, God, no. I know. I'm sorry. It's terrible.

58
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,200
It's terrible. I mean, when you say when so what when the words something drastic, that's

59
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,200
the first thing that comes to my head. Well, all right. I'm I'm not like, like on the on the

60
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,520
bridge right now. I'm not like staring down like 50 feet. There's nothing. Yeah. Of that

61
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,560
level going on. You're not you're not you're not fucking fucking. What's his name? Billy

62
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,800
Madison in It's a Wonderful Life. Yeah, I more, moreover, it's just that I've sort of

63
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,800
changed my opinion on like the the concept of ending one's own life. Because I was thinking

64
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,640
about it like like a few weeks ago. And it was just sort of like, you know, the the the

65
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,720
benefits of staying alive outweighing the the, you know, the detriment of no longer being

66
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,480
able to be alive. And then it's just like, sometimes, like things pile up to a point

67
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,640
where I could see I could see a future where it's like suicide would not be that strange

68
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,320
of an option. Obviously, it's it's behooves me to do everything in my power to make sure

69
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:02,240
my life does not get to that point. But it's like, I wouldn't like the this that whole

70
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,720
thing where like, suicide is a coward's way out. Or like, or it's brave, like there's

71
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,360
a lot of discussion about whether or not like it's correct for a person to commit suicide.

72
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,520
And there was this there was this, this general feeling that I always had, which was I would

73
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,320
just be doing something bad for everyone who would be sad to see me gone. And I would be

74
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,920
not contributing anything to anyone. And in fact, taking away things from other people.

75
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,600
And so in that way, it's a selfish move. And, you know, you shouldn't even really think

76
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:49,160
about it. And on the one hand, on the one hand, that's still kind of true. Yeah. But

77
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,920
on the other, it's it's sort of a weird, like, if there's only one thing stopping you from

78
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,160
committing suicide, and it's based in guilt, I don't know whether that's good. I don't know

79
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,280
if that's good for your potential recovery, you know, if the only if I see what you mean,

80
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,400
like if the only reason that you're not going to do it is Oh, but it'd be wrong, though,

81
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,560
it's like, oh, you should have more reasons than that, hopefully. Yeah, I mean, I obviously

82
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,120
do have a lot more reasons than that. But like, that was the one thing I've changed on. Because

83
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:33,160
it's like I remember, yeah, you got to have you got to care about number one yourself.

84
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:41,600
And if the guilt of, you know, I don't know, it would be cringe to do it, you know, any

85
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,360
anything else, anything else in life, they say, you know, you got to do it. Maybe this

86
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,800
is like a malformed point, maybe this is stupid. But like, I feel like other things in life,

87
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,760
it's like you got to do it for yourself, you can't you can't do it for other people.

88
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,960
All right. So if you're just, yeah, if you're just continuing to live, because I guess everyone

89
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,400
else wants me to, you know, it's usually not that's not the optimal state. Yeah,

90
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,120
sure. Sure. But yeah, yeah, I understand, I understand, I understand what you're saying.

91
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:25,320
There was a time, there was a time in my life, I guess I was probably like 24 ish, I don't

92
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,240
know, something like that. And I was never like, I've never like seriously considered

93
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,600
killing myself, but I was pretty depressed for a while. And I do remember, and this is

94
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,880
kind of stupid in hindsight, I feel a little embarrassed about it. But at the time it seemed

95
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,480
reasonable. I was like, I'm sad. I'm sadder now than I was like maybe a year ago, I feel

96
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,720
worse. What if I just keep feeling even worse? What if the trajectory continues? And I was

97
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,880
like, boy, if I get like much, if this continues, like who knows at what point will it be like

98
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,280
well time to kill myself. So I called the suicide hotline. And I was like, hey, listen, I'm

99
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,080
not about to kill myself. I'm worried that like, there might come a time in the future

100
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,680
when I will though. And the girl on the phone like had she I mean, it was like a young

101
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:26,680
woman who was like, clearly just kind of reading from a script. She was not, she did

102
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,840
not have like robust a robust discussion in the can ready to go on the subject. She was

103
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:41,000
just like, you know, I don't remember the details. She was not ready to engage on this

104
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,840
on this thing like a suicide. Well, it's a suicide hotline. But like, I feel like suicide

105
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,920
hotline as a concept only really works for like, very young suicidal people who are just

106
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,400
in the midst of an emotional storm. And they need somebody to say it's okay. And they come

107
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,440
to it. Yeah, it is meant. I shouldn't have it was stupid. It's meant for like, if you're

108
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,160
like right about to do it, you call them in and hopefully like, you don't do it. It's

109
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,200
like, I got to talk myself out of this right now or something bad is going to happen. That's

110
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:24,360
what it's supposed to be for. Dur. It's funny. It's funny. You know, with the PCP, I'm just

111
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,600
imagining the PCP channel being in the state that it's in. And I guess we're probably not

112
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,760
going to release this episode just yet. We might not really we might delay the release,

113
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,000
but I'm just imagining the PCP channel in the state that it's in, and the fucking, and that this

114
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,440
episode goes up, but it's like suicide. It would be funny. An episode about why not kill yourself.

115
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,840
I mean, yeah, it's not this is not brought on by like the progress in this channel. It is brought

116
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:05,240
on by the consistent like stress of COVID and a lot of other smaller things going on. Yeah. And

117
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,000
as it just been like COVID has exacerbated all of the things that have made me feel bad in the

118
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,280
past, they've just become more powerful. It sucks. I don't really know how to deal with anything.

119
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:25,720
All right, here's a little rant I can go on. I was I was looking into online counseling because

120
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,760
like, I've never really bothered because I assume it's too expensive and I looked into it and yes,

121
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,480
it is too expensive. Fuck it. But I paid upfront for a thing. And then only after I paid upfront,

122
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,000
they said I would get four sessions. And then it would be a monthly payment. So once a week.

123
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:53,000
But the person they have assigned to me, their schedule is booked, was booked for the first

124
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,160
like two weeks after I pledged the money so that I have to I waited basically all June to get this

125
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,120
counseling session. It's going to happen tomorrow. But like, I've needed this counseling session for

126
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,400
two weeks. And it is it is just I have even wait, have you been paying without getting it?

127
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,560
I paid the lump sum for the month, which is supposed to be four sessions for the month.

128
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:28,360
And I've been waiting for two weeks until I get the first one. And so I really hope I really hope

129
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,800
that this this doesn't mean I don't like I have to pay again for the next month.

130
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,760
Was there like a number of sessions or like a number of like time? It was it was a number of

131
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,640
sessions. Okay, yeah, yeah. So like four sessions. And they said you are in charge of organizing and

132
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,640
I clicked on the person and they had apparently apparently you're not in charge of organizing

133
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,760
if they're like, Yeah, but you can't do it. Yeah. So it's like sucks. I I

134
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:09,960
I can't wait to see if that does anything because like I can't I feel like I can't speak just generally

135
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,200
like if I if I go if I you know, I've done multiple things in the past when I've had

136
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,040
like depressive episodes, I go and make a stupid video that sucks and people like,

137
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,200
Oh, don't worry about it. Or or whatever. And it's not there's nothing less helpful. And it's

138
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,760
and I sorry to anyone. I'm sure everyone's intentions are great when they do it. But

139
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,120
there's nothing less helpful than like when you make then when you like post online,

140
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,440
whether that's on Twitter or like YouTube about about like, I'm sad and people try and like

141
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,560
make you feel better, you know, like it just it sucks. It's not it's not the the fault. It's not

142
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,880
that they suck. It's that it's that the strategy of posting a terrible strategy sucks. Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,080
It can do something for you if you just want positive reaffirmation. But I think

144
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:06,360
too cynically of myself to like agree with any of that. It only really works when it's like a,

145
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:14,040
you know, a sincere, like friendly, like a person I'm very close to who talks about it in a sincere

146
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,920
way. If it's just people, yeah, it I'll read all the responses and some of them will be helpful

147
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,880
and some of them won't. And I'll usually fixate on the ones that aren't helpful. And or like

148
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,680
that just sort of, you know, don't read the comments. I read them. I'm stupid. I'm really

149
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,680
stupid. That's right. But you know, that's right. No, there is no, you know, I just am.

150
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,400
And it sucks. I want to just I pain for this therapy. Give me therapy. Give me those therapy

151
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:56,120
points. I've the only time the only time I've been I've had like a like, like, well, no,

152
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,480
that's not true. I guess I've done a little bit of it in the past. But most of my experience with

153
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,200
it was like, you know, my dad is a psychologist. And like, he never like, therapy'd me himself.

154
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,160
I feel like that would be weird. And you're probably not supposed to do that. Yeah. He but he

155
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:20,840
like, um, he got he got me therapy, but he always got it for me. Stop me if I've told talked about

156
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:27,400
this before, but he always got it for me when he wanted wanted it, like when he had a reason

157
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:35,400
to want me to be doing something else, not like when I asked him, like when I was in high school.

158
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,960
I don't remember what was going on, but they had like a period where I was

159
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,160
like kind of, uh, except I was like mad or something. I would know. No, I don't know if I

160
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,040
like, my grades weren't doing so well, or if I was like just being weird or just like my dad

161
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,560
didn't like how I was acting, he got me like a fucking sessions with some guy. And the guy prescribed

162
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:03,640
me, I think it was Ritalin or something. And I started taking it very briefly. And it sort of put

163
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,000
me like, emotionally, it like fucked up my emotions and I ended up like kicking a hole in the wall.

164
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:17,480
Which my dad, remember who had put me, who had, who had sought out a psychiatrist to give me medicine

165
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,600
because my dad wanted to change my behavior. It did change my behavior. I kicked a hole in the

166
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,280
wall. My dad was furious and punished me, made me repair the hole, maybe like buy, like like,

167
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,400
like repair the hole myself, made me like go out and buy like, you know, putty to like fill the

168
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,560
hole and stuff and like, you know, made me do this like long project of repairing it.

169
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:45,480
Which, to be fair, is a pretty fair punishment. If like, you know, you've made a hole in the

170
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,680
wall, you got to fix it. But I think I was grounded for a while too. Doesn't matter. And then there

171
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,480
was another, it was like, like when I was like in my early, my very early 20s, I think like right

172
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,160
out of college, my dad was like, why aren't you, why don't you have a job? Why aren't you pounding

173
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,960
the pavement? You know, because he's a fucking boomer, idiot. Happy Father's Day, everyone.

174
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,720
Oh, gonna be calling them later, later on today. I feel very good about the fact that I made like

175
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,440
a little card for him. And I gave it to him and it was funny and he laughed and I was like, okay,

176
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:24,440
cool. Epic. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. I'm gonna redo. We did, we did, we did a Mother's

177
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,080
Day call, which God, I can't, it feels like feels like only yesterday. Where does the time go that

178
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,880
it was Mother's Day? They're so close together. Why are they so fucking close together? We did

179
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:41,640
a Zoom call. Why is it that the boomers all use this teleconferencing software called Zoom?

180
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,520
Where did Zoom come from? I don't know. I can only guess on how it propagated, but I assume it's just

181
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:57,080
like, it's like everyone suddenly needs to communicate via voice calls, whereas they never

182
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:04,360
needed to before. And they're like, what do we use? And in a lot of workspaces, apparently people

183
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,640
are saying, oh, we use this Zoom thing. And so people's word of mouth has spread it everywhere.

184
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,520
And so everyone of that age bracket who has not heard of, I mean, most people know Skype, but

185
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,400
nobody uses Skype anymore. They sold Zoom as a better version of Skype. And they're like, well,

186
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,600
okay, let's get that. I'm just saying, why aren't the boomers on Discord? That's all I'm saying.

187
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Because if they were, they would find out that what I say, they would see that I'm on Discord,

188
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,800
and they would say, hey, son. And I would like, oh, no. Oh, no.

189
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,440
I guess, I guess no joke. If the boomers were on Discord, people would stop using this. It would

190
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,200
become Facebook. Yeah. To a certain extent. Well, maybe, I don't know, maybe there could be,

191
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,120
you know, because, because. Imagine if your dad came into endless war.

192
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:59,160
If my, I'm imagining it, and it just doesn't track at all. It would be

193
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,280
it's a funny idea. But I think all that would really happen is he might

194
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,240
just make a couple of cringe posts and then never, never make a couple of just like me.

195
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,320
Like father likes son. Then he, then he'd do exhalation point thrash and then dab on you. Well,

196
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,720
dab on you like in a metaphorical sense. Oh, Christ. Munchy's my new son now.

197
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,840
Oh, no. Oof. Oh, man. The caffeine's, caffeine's hitting me all of a sudden. Oof. It's hitting me

198
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:40,920
hard. Oh boy. But yes, I would, I would be dabbed out of existence, perhaps, perhaps.

199
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,360
You know, you know what? You know what's really, even speaking of parents, you know,

200
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,720
it's really funny to me. It's, it's very funny to me that like Digi's mom likes a bunch of my

201
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,360
tweets these days. Digi's mom's really cool. Digi's mom seems pretty cool. Yeah. She's a big

202
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:07,080
Bernie bro. And she likes, she likes my like, she likes some of my, my more political tweets,

203
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,600
which is kind of funny. And I like that. I don't know. Just, that's just a funny fact about

204
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:25,080
reality. You know, when, when it comes to depression and stuff, the consistent, like,

205
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,640
a consistent way to stay depressed. Have you seen that CGP gray video, like 10 ways to maximize

206
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,120
depression? Is it the one about being on a boat? Yeah. But you're being on a boat,

207
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,600
how to make yourself as depressed as possible. So as, to, as an instructional guide for people

208
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,520
who are depressed, to just do the opposite of this and you will be, you'll be on the path to

209
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,160
being better. It's, yeah, yeah. It's like, it's like, here are some things that you are probably

210
00:22:51,160 --> 00:23:00,040
doing. Yeah. And so I'm like, all right, I feel bad right now. And talking, talking about it,

211
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,880
thinking about, thinking about is the worst. That just perpetuates things. Like, I'm just,

212
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,680
I think about it too much. And then I have an outburst on Twitter, not specifically at anyone.

213
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:17,000
I just like say, oh, I'm so sad, guys, in so many words. I had a thing. I had a thing. I made a

214
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
tweet. I succumbed to the urge the other day and I made a tweet. What did I say? Like a pissed off

215
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,160
and feeling bad. That was my, that was my indulgence. And it's sad. And it's like, oh, God, I did it.

216
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:38,040
I made an I'm sad post. Boo. Boo. Stop posting. Stop posting. But like, I was thinking today,

217
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:48,600
all right, I've got to, I've got to like work with myself. I am two people. I am me, the guy who

218
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,920
wants to stop being depressed and me, the idiot who is depressed. I need to try and coax myself out

219
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,640
of this. There's two wolves inside you. Yeah. And they're both going, oh. Yeah. They're both fucking

220
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:09,000
bass. One is bass and one is cringe. Which one do you feed is the question? Yeah.

221
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:19,640
Yeah. But I need to like, get myself busy with something. And I have no, the thing that, oh,

222
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,440
no, here we go again, Gibbs talking about art problems. But sucker sucker. There's the Gibbs

223
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:33,160
stupid idiot corner. Can we have a jingle? Eleazar, quick, write a jingle for Gibbs stupid

224
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:47,160
idiot corner. This is the stupid idiot corner. Hi, stupid idiot. All right. So I'm a stupid idiot.

225
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,600
And I've been talking, I talked last time about how like, there's a difference between working on

226
00:24:52,600 --> 00:25:00,120
something which is mindless and you're just following orders and creation, creativity.

227
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:10,040
Right now I'm depressed for various reasons. And going to work is difficult because it requires

228
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:19,080
a lot of thinking. Do you physically go to work? No. I mean, at my desk, you know. Right. Yeah. Oh,

229
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:27,720
yeah. Okay. Like drawing. So like, but creation, creativity is all very thoughtful. I need to

230
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,160
think about a lot of things. But if I'm, if I'm allowing myself to think too much, I'm easily

231
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,280
slipping into how all of the depression thinking I've been having that distracts me. And it's like,

232
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:45,960
all right, I need to busy myself with some like hard labor, some stuff, some meaningless tasks

233
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:53,320
that I can just say to someone, tell me what to do, sir. And they will say, okay. And so

234
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm going to, I'm going to like be a good boy and just ask my parents for if they need help,

235
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,120
if they need me to do something around the house, ask my brothers if they need help.

236
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,520
I'm just going to do that for a few days. I'm going to see if me being a workhorse will

237
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,040
figure out like, just get me out of this, whatever it is. Because like at the end of the day, there's

238
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,880
no one but me that is the guy who can get me out of whatever I'm in. And I need to find the easiest

239
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,520
way to stop myself from lounging around thinking about how everything sucks.

240
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,800
Interesting. Interesting.

241
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,080
Selfless volunteer tasks. That's my new plan.

242
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:44,520
I mean, you could, I mean, if that doesn't work, I mean, you could like volunteer for

243
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,000
like an org or something. I don't know if you just, yeah, that would probably be the next,

244
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,560
the next step. The next step. I mean, the reason I haven't gone immediately to that is because

245
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,320
I don't know what's open. I don't know whether you can go anywhere and do things right now.

246
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,000
Sure, there probably are. I could look into it. I don't know either, but I'm sure there's probably

247
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,640
something, but like, yeah, okay. Yeah, but my brother has like a leg issue, so he needs help at

248
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,600
the moment. He's been like walking around with a cane. Oof, yeah, sucks. Him and Tom, I guess.

249
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:23,240
Yeah, he's, I don't know whether I mentioned it, but I don't know if you mentioned it in the chat,

250
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,040
I think. I don't know if you've mentioned it on the show. So one of my brothers,

251
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,080
how long has that been going on? Can we say names? Can I say who it is?

252
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,200
I don't think it matters, but we won't say names, just because.

253
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,800
Oh, sorry, should I cut that? Ellie's are cut that. Cut that, Ellie's are.

254
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,440
Okay, cut out the part right. I mean, they know who my brother's are. Not even that.

255
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,280
Okay, fine, whatever. Leg problem. Basically, the point is leg problem, which cannot be seen by

256
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,160
doctors because doctors are so busy with COVID. Yeah, really? They're that busy?

257
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,720
Well, I mean, he's tried to get an appointment so many times, and it is just like delay after

258
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:14,120
delay. It's gotten worse, and it's like he's really feeling like. That bad, huh? Yeah, I mean,

259
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,360
it's not like, I don't know exactly what the problem is, but he can't walk very well, it hurts a lot.

260
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,560
He's trying to get medication for it, but that is like, it really sucks, and I need,

261
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,360
if there's a person who needs help right now, it's him, just with physical things,

262
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,240
moving stuff around. I need to get myself busy, and that is a good excuse to do it.

263
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,080
It's not the same for a couple of reasons, because one, it's not like actively hindering me from

264
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,480
doing anything, and two, I haven't really tried. It's not that I have not been able to pursue it,

265
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:53,800
it's that I haven't really tried to pursue it because of COVID, but I really need a dentist

266
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,200
appointment, because I have a couple of things. My teeth are not green, but I have,

267
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,640
this feels like oversharing, but whatever, who gives a fuck? I have one cavity that I can see.

268
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,560
It's minor, but I know where it is, and if I look at it, I can see it, and it's very

269
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,760
distressing for me. Whenever I think about it, it doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt or anything,

270
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,840
but it's like, that looks weird, and there's also, I've talked about it, there's a,

271
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,880
I had a bike accident when I was a kid, a teenager, and I broke my two front teeth, and I had them

272
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,640
partially replaced with false tooth material, and this has been the case for a while, but I think

273
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:47,880
it's gotten worse. There's like a stain on the part between, there's like kind of an ugly line

274
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,960
that has a visible line that has appeared between like the fake part of my tooth and the real part,

275
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,840
and it's, I hate it, I hate it. So, oh, and then of course, there's the fact that I broke it

276
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,360
when I was biting into the poster. I broke the fault, I broke a piece off of the fake part of my

277
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:13,160
tooth when I bit the poster at Rat, not Radcon, RFC Kong K, RFC Readyfuckers con killer, whatever

278
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:19,560
it was called, on the Endless War lecture, which is gone now, but that's fine. And,

279
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,080
You didn't upload that to the Endless War YouTube channel?

280
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:33,800
No. Wow. I mean, okay, I think I have a backup file, but like, so I don't think

281
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,000
God, I hope, I'm sure, I'm, we must have, I'm, I'm almost positive, somebody's got a backup,

282
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,360
maybe I do, or no, it must be Munchy or Ethan. Oh God, there's no way, there's no way Ethan would

283
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,920
have, they would have deleted it. It has to still exist. It has to, I believe that it does, but you

284
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,280
know, it's, it's not on, right now, and it's lost all its views and all that. Okay, that's a tangent,

285
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,600
but like, you know, so I have a chip out of my tooth. It's not very visible, and I can't,

286
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,000
don't even really notice it anymore, but it is there. So, so that's, that's three good reasons

287
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,040
why I really need to see a dentist soon. But I, I don't want to go, I don't, I was like, no,

288
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,120
wait till the pandemic's over, but like, God, what if the pandemic lasts like another year,

289
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,880
you know? Like, what if this cavity gets really, gets worse, like I, it starts to hurt or something?

290
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,240
What if, what if I need a fucking root canal because I wait that long? I don't know.

291
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,240
I haven't been paying too much attention to the recent COVID statistics like I was when it started.

292
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,320
So I don't know whether it's in any way slowing down anywhere.

293
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,840
In, in, in Massachusetts, it has slowed down. It's actually pretty good. The stats are pretty

294
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,640
promising in Massachusetts. Actually, I haven't checked for a few days. Let me see if there's

295
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:57,480
been any reversal. COVID cases in Massachusetts. Yeah, no, since, since the middle of April,

296
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,720
in the middle of April, we were getting like over a thousand new cases, like between one and

297
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:09,000
2000 new cases a day, it has dropped off to like, like maybe two, one to 300 a day. And it's just

298
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,360
kind of there. It doesn't, it doesn't seem to be spiking again. So that's pretty cool, I guess.

299
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:21,000
Pretty cool, man. So that's how, yeah. I guess I should feel good about that.

300
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,320
What were we talking about? What were we saying?

301
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,320
You were saying dentist.

302
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:34,040
Oh yeah. I guess I should, maybe it's coming on time where I need to be like, okay,

303
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:40,600
the risk is managed now. You just go out, wear a mask, go to the fucking dentist.

304
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,720
You may as well if you can.

305
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,120
Yeah. I guess I should start looking into that Lamal.

306
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,520
Because I've been, I mean, when people was first talking about the how long COVID is going to

307
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,680
last, they said that some people were like doom and gloom and saying, oh, this will be a thing

308
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,880
forever now. It's like, don't say that, don't think that, don't be that, but maybe it's true.

309
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,320
Maybe it will just have a like, it'll slow down in the summer and then come back in the winter,

310
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,560
hardcore, and then it will stay for quite a while into the next year.

311
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:22,520
There are states where it is having a second wind, shitty states where they didn't take

312
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:29,000
social distancing seriously, weren't that strict about it, culturally didn't value wearing a mask

313
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,040
and whatever the fuck, thought it was communist or whatever. Some of those states are seeing

314
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:44,120
like a second spike, which I, you know, great. But we're not so, you know, cool. Good for us.

315
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,640
I like Massachusetts a lot. I'm proud of us. I hate everyone else. I hate all the other states.

316
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,800
They suck ass. That's it. That's all I gotta say. That's my useful commentary on America is,

317
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,080
hey guys, Massachusetts is good guys. Everyone else is the bad guys, the end.

318
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,200
What were we talking about? Dentistry sucks. I hate the dentist. I have become,

319
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:18,920
I have become an extremely fearful, cowardly person. I'm terrified of everything.

320
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:27,160
Yeah. Well, I say become. I definitely didn't use to be this bad. I didn't use to be this

321
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:37,080
afraid of planes or the dentist or death in general or any anything. Now I am like,

322
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,720
I was thinking about, thinking about the dentist. I'm like, that's so fucking scary. I'm terrified.

323
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,640
I was thinking about thinking about like, we're at a father's day again, because I think my dad

324
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,640
wants us at some point to go on like a, see as a sailboat, he wants us all to go out on the boat.

325
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,800
And I was thinking about that last night. And I was like, that's, I don't want to do that.

326
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,440
That's scary. What if we drown? It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I'm scared. I'm scared to do

327
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,520
that. I think I'll die if we do that. What do you think this is like a new thing? Why do you think

328
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:24,280
you've become more scared of things? I don't know. I mean, I think, I guess I have a couple

329
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,880
hypotheses and they could all be true to a certain extent. One is that the pandemic has made me more

330
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:38,520
conscious of, of, of death and stuff, of bad things happening. Two, it might just be because I'm

331
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,960
older and like think about, think things through more thoroughly and the logical consequence of

332
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,560
almost anything could be like, yeah, but what if I die and that's bad? I mean, I don't know whether

333
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:58,840
that's thinking things through so much as overthinking things. Is it overthinking things?

334
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,840
I mean, that's all that matters. That's all that matters. All that matters in the end is that I

335
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:10,600
don't die. And what if I die doing anything? Yeah, I mean, I think that sure would be a mistake.

336
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,280
A lot of people know that things can be dangerous, but like they weigh the options and they decide that

337
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,480
most like statistically speaking, there's not much of a risk. So they're not going to worry

338
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:33,240
about it. I mean, I know that like it's so unlikely for you to die in a plane crash,

339
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,080
but I was so scared on the flight. I mean, on the flight to Radcon and especially on the flight home

340
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,160
from Radcon. I mean, the flight home was that was fucked me. I was off to like COVID had started

341
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,360
spreading. I was like, oh, shit. I wasn't scared of the pain. I mean, I was scared of the pandemic,

342
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:58,680
but that's not what I was like thinking about in the in the in the seat. I'm thinking, what if we

343
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:05,560
crash? Which is like, it's almost guaranteed not to happen. That's like as close to guaranteed

344
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,840
not to happen as almost anything in life. You know, to me, this says with my armchair psychology to

345
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:18,440
you know, tints glasses, twists glasses, I don't know what I was going about to say there.

346
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,600
I'm imagining you like gendo gendo aricato pushing your fuck. That's the guy from Eva,

347
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,840
right? The dad pushing your fucking glasses up with your middle finger or whatever.

348
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,720
Well, that's that's the stampede that does that. Never mind, whatever.

349
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:40,680
What this is to me is that you for some reason care about your own life more, like you have some

350
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,120
like these all these things have always been like, like if you were suicidal, for example,

351
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,600
and you're on a plane, you'd be like, man, the plane could crash if only, you know,

352
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,800
that would be a comforting feeling if you wanted to die. But because because you you want to live

353
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:08,440
so much. Yes, that it's extremely scary, the idea that you could die. Yeah. No, you're absolutely

354
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,200
right. I want to live so bad. I want to live forever. Why do you want to live? What's what's

355
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,880
being alive so fucking based being alive is so fucking based. It's not it's nothing. It's not

356
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,880
I'm just here. I'm just here in my fucking room. You know, it's COVID, man. It's quarantine.

357
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:34,040
And that that sucks compared to like it not being like that. But it's so good compared to

358
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,960
being dead. I'll take anything. I'll fucking I'll fucking live in a fucking in like a room.

359
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,880
I'll fucking live through the the drudgery of like the day to day,

360
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,640
every day the same, nothing happens. I don't care. I'll take it. Yes, please.

361
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:59,000
Experiencing anything whatsoever. Based. Thank you, sir. More please. I'll take all you got.

362
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:07,000
I don't know, man. That's I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand the mindset

363
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,160
of like, uh, sorry, I'm not trying to single you out. This is not about you. This is about

364
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:21,400
any any time any time I hear someone like thinking about life is life is shit. Life life share life

365
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:30,200
share is suboptimal. Is it even worth it? I I that's I'm never I never I never think that I am.

366
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm definitely coming at it from a very extreme pessimistic point of view. Like I think of the

367
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,320
things that life could give me in the future. And I'm like, yeah, well, it's not going to happen.

368
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,320
All those things are not going to happen. I'm just going to be sad from now until then may as

369
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,160
well end it quickly. That's just the the mindset I get in when I'm in the worst spaces. The the

370
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,720
thing that makes me the saddest is thinking about how I'll be dead one day. So like, you know,

371
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,880
the the answer to that is clearly not like, oh, might as well just actually once in a while it

372
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,400
does good boy, since it's going to happen anyway, might as well just get it over with now. I mean,

373
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,240
but like I never seriously entertain that thought, because it's like, well, that doesn't make any

374
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:21,480
fucking sense. It does cross my mind occasionally, if only by by happenstance by chance. I was I was

375
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,120
going to say something else. I was going to say something else about that. What did you just say?

376
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:35,000
What was the last point you just made there? When I'm in the the the worst of the worst feelings

377
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,840
that the extreme pessimism says the only time I was thinking like maybe it'd be better to be dead

378
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:47,000
was when I was having was when I was in the throes of my fucking kidney stone episodes

379
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,080
like earlier this year or last year. How long I don't even remember how long ago that I feel

380
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,840
like that was last year. That was it was last year. It was more than a year ago. That's right.

381
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:01,320
And like, you know, that, you know, is considered considered by many to be one of the most painful

382
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:09,960
experiences a human being can undergo akin to, you know, childbirth, say, and it was so bad then

383
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,840
that I there were times and I was like, maybe maybe death, maybe death would be better than this.

384
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,640
That was the that's what it took to get me to really think like is life worth living?

385
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,920
So that's, I think, I think that's what it's so but like, you know, I feel I feel so upset

386
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,000
thinking about mortality that it paralyzes me and it ruins it kind of ruins my life

387
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,880
in a way that it that it upsets me so much. I feel like I feel like I'm just whining now.

388
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:50,520
Ah, well, we're all whiners rule. Yeah, we're all we're all just

389
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:59,720
trying to deal with a really bad time. Yeah. Well, that's the thing I was thinking of like,

390
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:06,280
COVID is not like directly affected me. It has made me scared to like go outside.

391
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,320
Just generally, but aside from that, because I don't go out that much anyway. So it's like,

392
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,560
it hasn't truly personally affected me that much. And I wonder if some part of the pandemic,

393
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:26,200
quote unquote, as a as an idea is just sort of me having some sort of excuse to feel like shit.

394
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,640
Yeah. Yeah, because like, it's really it's like, I don't know.

395
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:42,200
Yeah, I can't imagine that I'm correct on on what I think ever.

396
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,080
What do you mean? Oh, just anything? Yeah, you just doubt yourself all the time.

397
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:54,840
I don't I don't I don't trust myself. I think I know what I'm doing. And then I'm like, oh, yeah.

398
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,640
Oh, okay.

399
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,440
Welcome to the procrastiners podcast. That was the pre show.

400
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:11,640
That's the pre show. Now we're going to be like funny, goofy, funny people that are having fun.

401
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,800
No. Do you do you want to move on from this topic?

402
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,160
I mean, if you've got nothing else to say about it, yeah.

403
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,960
Nothing in particular. I feel like I've feel like I've thoroughly covered everything.

404
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,840
I guess I do want to talk about like the state of the channel.

405
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,120
Last time, I don't know how much I have to say about this might as well touch on it.

406
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,400
Last time, I think we did talk about how, you know, oh, the channel's been terminated.

407
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,840
That sucks. Maybe it'll be back and then now it's back. But like it's videos are still missing.

408
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:59,400
Let's I like I said, in my announcement video, you know, it's you might as well reiterate that

409
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,440
because I don't know if yeah, probably a lot of people didn't click on it. And I

410
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:11,080
I yeah, like we because because we record these so far ahead of when they released, it's like

411
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,800
if you if you had just if you had if you just heard the episode, you wouldn't really understand

412
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,800
what's going on with it. And and who knows, maybe by the time this one comes out,

413
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,760
there the situation will have progressed in some new fashion and who fucking knows what that could

414
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:32,600
be. But like, okay, the a bunch of the latest content is gone. That's the gist of it, including

415
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,960
almost all basically all the rad content, except for that one stream, I don't know. But like,

416
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,040
when when we got the news that channel was terminated for quote unquote, like,

417
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,360
encouraging illegal activities, or violating term or encouraging people to violate terms of

418
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,640
service or something like that. My first thought, and I think a bunch of people's first thought

419
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,760
was that it was the the Black Lives Matter charity stream, which I had insisted on doing.

420
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:09,480
And graciously, a few people who were on board with were wanted wanted to see happen and everyone

421
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:17,320
else didn't seem interested. But whatever. My first thought was, oh, that's it. Oh, because

422
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,760
we're because I said fuck the police a cab like though that's encouraging.

423
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:28,040
Political violence or whatever. I don't I don't think so anymore. And the reason I don't think

424
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,440
that's it is because of the weird fact that all all the videos that were struck it is

425
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:40,600
for terms of service violations. Like I think because all these videos were struck and removed

426
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,960
for terms of service violations, I think that it must be the videos were struck and that triggered

427
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:53,240
an automated response from YouTube to terminate the channel. And the fact that all it is explicitly

428
00:45:53,240 --> 00:46:00,040
all the videos from when the hack occurred onward, it's those videos. So it must have

429
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,160
something to do with the hack. That's too big a coincidence, right? Do you think so?

430
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:11,560
Yeah, I feel like that's pretty, pretty easy to together that something about like,

431
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,920
I don't know, a very delayed reaction from YouTube to like, oh, this hack has been announced,

432
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,600
you know, the team YouTube Twitter people, they dealt with it, but then

433
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,320
the initial flag was maybe still in the system and has only just now got around to

434
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,920
implementing itself. It goes to that date and it says, oh, wrong, wrong, wrong, get rid of,

435
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,360
and then deletes the channel, you know, without without, you know, just a robot looking at it.

436
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:45,160
Yeah. Well, the stated reason given being like encouraging illegal or terms of service violations

437
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,800
is like weird and doesn't really fit that idea. And I don't know why it would be like that.

438
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,800
Well, if you think of it being like the Brad stuff, like would that have been

439
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,040
well, the Brad stuff was just advertising fucking cryptocurrency, right?

440
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,720
Oh, yeah, I guess, I guess that's not technically illegal in any way.

441
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:09,000
I mean, I don't think so. But who knows, since it's an automated response to who fucking knows.

442
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah, still no no actual knowledge about what is what is the reason.

443
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:23,480
No, not really. Okay. Well, so yeah, that's that's what I mean. I mentioned it just because

444
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,840
people are I see comments on like the announcement video saying like, you know, people one of them

445
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,800
one of the more common, you know, probably the most common theory is Brad, which yeah,

446
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,480
I think it's probably Brad. Second, second most common is probably Oh, it was the Black Lives

447
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,960
Matter ACAB thing, which was my initial thought too, but I've changed my mind. Then it's like,

448
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,320
Oh, it was because what about the what times you smoked weed? What about that time you encouraged

449
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,320
someone said you encourage shop? I don't remember encouraging shoplift. Maybe I did. I probably

450
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:01,480
did. I feel like that was a thing like looting is cool in the Black Lives Matter stream.

451
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,000
Like it's looting is cool if it's against target or something was definitely said.

452
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,280
Somebody said shoplifting, which shoplifting is not looting. I don't know. I feel like they were

453
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,560
talking about something else, but it doesn't matter because I don't think that's the reason.

454
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:25,000
I don't know. I guess. I mean, what do you think? Do you think the videos are going to come back?

455
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:32,120
I feel like eventually. I mean, they were responding to you weren't they about like you

456
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,800
gave them a list through the PCP account on Twitter of all the videos and they said,

457
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,760
Okay, we've got the videos now we'll get to work or something. I actually okay. I actually

458
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:48,520
fucked up a little not not very much, but yeah, they responded through Twitter. I did give them

459
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:54,280
the list the list. Okay, I actually I don't know if this is a good idea or not. I felt like I had

460
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,400
to make a split decision in the moment. I told them this is all of them I might have missed some

461
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:08,040
and I deliberately left out the ones with weed in them. So so maybe I shouldn't have done that,

462
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:14,120
but that's what I did because I felt like desperate and I was like, I don't want to do anything risky

463
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:21,000
at all here. So I didn't include like the two streams that are the two videos that the dude

464
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,120
weed them out or whatever, but I told them like this is not all of them. But then accidentally,

465
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:32,680
I forgot because I had looked at the the live stream lists because there's two on your YouTube

466
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,320
studio, you can see your uploads and you can see your live streams and I had looked at the uploads

467
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:44,680
and okay, for some reason on the uploaded videos, the deleted videos are listed as the most recent,

468
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:51,320
but on the live videos, the removed videos are listed as like not recent, they're listed at the

469
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,920
at the end of the chronological list instead of the beginning and I didn't realize that at the time.

470
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,480
So I thought that the ones on the stream were just gone. So I told them these are the uploaded

471
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,760
videos, the streams are simply gone. It turns out they're not gone, they are there. So I went back

472
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,360
and I replied again like a day later to that thread on Twitter and I said, hey, I found the

473
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,480
more URLs here are the streams and I gave them the and I gave them the streams and again,

474
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:22,040
perhaps out of cowardice or whatever, I didn't include the the BLM stream, but I told them I

475
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,960
don't think this is all of them. And like, logically, I don't see why I should have to give them every

476
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,320
single URL for every there's like 50 or more videos, right, that are gone, maybe even more,

477
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,520
maybe there's like 70, I don't even remember, there's a lot, but I gave them at least most of them,

478
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:44,680
almost all of them. I don't see why I should have to feel like they should be able to just look at

479
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:50,440
our fucking channel and see our videos, see which ones are deleted, and be like, oh yeah, these are

480
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,800
wrong. I don't know. But that's what I did. And they did respond to it. But no action has been

481
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:07,000
taken this far. And honestly, what what I'm afraid of is not that they will is not that they do it's

482
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,840
not that they do not intend to restore the videos, it's that there will be something about the process

483
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,560
of removal that like, they will take too long, and they will like, maybe they have the videos

484
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:27,800
stored in some like secondary form right now, and that will like, the timer will run out and they

485
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:33,080
will be like, they will hit some sort of hard limit where it's like our auto remove videos

486
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:38,360
are no longer even stored secondarily, they are gone forever. I don't know if that's the case.

487
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,440
Why would you assume such a system? I'm not assuming such a system, but I don't know that

488
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:51,400
that isn't the case. Right, but I don't know how I wouldn't even have considered the idea that

489
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,520
there's a time limit. I mean, YouTube has taken a long time to bring back a channel before.

490
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,000
And when it does eventually happen, it just happens. It's all back.

491
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:09,640
I feel like, okay, I have I have mixed feelings about this. Sometimes it feels

492
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:19,320
and like, you're not so much a culprit in this, but sometimes it feels like I am the most

493
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,880
worried about this. And everyone else to varying degrees is not taking this seriously,

494
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:35,400
not present in when I like discuss it in the channel or something. And sometimes I feel like,

495
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,240
what is everyone else doing? Like, why is that? Why don't they care? But then sometimes I

496
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:51,800
consider and I'm like, is this just an extension of my semi new tendency to be afraid of everything?

497
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,720
Is this just me being paranoid about yet yet another thing?

498
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,920
I think it is.

499
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,160
Is this just an extension of my, oh, but what if I die though to like, oh, but what if the channel

500
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,200
dies though? What if the what if the I mean, I think it's I think it's fair to be like,

501
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:16,680
you know, paying a close attention to it and doing stuff. But I think the rest of the guys,

502
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,760
then it's not like they don't care. It's that they assume with enough time, it'll come back

503
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,800
because we've already sent the tickets and there's nothing else to do but wait. And, you know,

504
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,960
like, like, I don't think people don't give a shit. I think they just aren't like freaking out

505
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:42,040
about it like you are. Yeah, I am freaking out about it. I'm very upset. I've been very upset

506
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:49,080
constantly. I don't know what's it been like a week now, more than a week now because the channel

507
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:55,160
was terminated before the last time you recorded was a terminated on like a week before Friday or

508
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:07,160
something. I don't know. I don't know. But, you know, that that's a worry. It's just very nerve

509
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:14,680
racking because I don't know. I don't know how it works. I feel like the success rate of YouTube,

510
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:22,440
you know, saving, you know, erroneously destroyed content is not 100%.

511
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:34,520
And who knows? Who knows if Radcon 4 could just become a statistic at any moment,

512
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:41,960
just like me, you know? Things are so fragile, so subject to fucking cruel fate.

513
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:54,440
I mean, yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Strangely, I don't feel as pessimistic about the YouTube channel

514
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:07,720
as I do about life itself. I see. Fair. It's, it's, I expected to come back,

515
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,040
all the videos to come back. I maybe a one or two will be like,

516
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,280
actually, this one is the bad one. So this is the reason and we're not giving you back this one.

517
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:23,240
And we'll be like, ah, fine. They already, they copyright struck and removed the end of YouTube

518
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:29,960
episode for the the Ava footage that I used in that one. So not an illegal activity, not the

519
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:35,720
stated reason for the deletion of the channel, just like a knock on effect of, oh, in addition to

520
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,920
wrong, like as we review the case of your channel that we deleted for no reason,

521
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,440
we found some other shit that we want to inflict upon you. Ha ha, gone dead. Cool.

522
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,600
When's things going to be fucking happy? When's things going to be fucking based again?

523
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,360
How does one escape into the virtual realm anymore when the virtual realm is just as bad as the real

524
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:14,840
realm? Yep. It sure is. Twitter sucks. Everything going on in the world sucks. And Twitter, I don't

525
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:23,160
know, just shows me that. And it's, it's a bummer. I guess, I guess the one thing that I got to say

526
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:30,040
that is good, in spite of everything else, I have started working on slime and punishment again,

527
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:35,400
like in earnest, like I've made actual progress on the finale, which is cool. I put that off for a

528
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,760
long time, couldn't bring myself to look at that for a while, but now I have. And it's good. It's

529
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:46,920
going pretty good. It's not, it's not that bad. It's going to be fine. And that'll be, and I'll feel

530
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,680
better. I'll feel better about life in general once that's done, I think. So that's how I'm,

531
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,440
that's my strategy for improving my own lot in life is that that's the thing that I think will,

532
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:05,400
you know, improve how I feel is getting that done. So I'm getting it done. And it's going to

533
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,440
be pretty cool. I think that what I've got done on it looks pretty cool. And I think it'll sound

534
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,640
pretty cool too. Sixten is going to be, he's, I think, I think he's, he's going to make a track for

535
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:28,760
it and it's going to be pretty sick because he does really good shit. I don't know, man. What else

536
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:35,080
you want to talk about? Oh, the itch.io games. Oh, the bundle a little bit about that. There's a

537
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:44,520
big old bundle with like 1500 itch.io games. I think it's at least over now, right? I think

538
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,600
they've stopped selling it. Yeah. So, but I've been going through those, you know, every so often

539
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,840
I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I sit, I stare out the window and I turn

540
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:00,120
around to my computer and I hunch over on my back, my hunchback back and I click download on some

541
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,520
random one of these games and I play it and I'm like, Hey, you know what? Things are okay.

542
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:14,360
Right. I've really gotten into this trilogy of point and click adventures called forever lost

543
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,480
which is it's like a computer generated 90s looking CG

544
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,960
backgrounds and you click around on things, you know, there's a drawer, you open the drawer,

545
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,440
there's a strange puzzle piece and you've got to find where the puzzle piece fits in another room.

546
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:40,200
There's lots of out of the box thinking puzzles and it's really, it's really good for that,

547
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:46,920
for that sort of thing. They got this great game mechanic where you can take a picture

548
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:55,560
of a clue or a thing so that you can take it with you and reference it later when you think

549
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:03,720
you need it and it's like these games often they have clues that are just given to you as clues

550
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:09,000
like you click on a thing and it's like, oh, I jot that down in my notebook and that is giving

551
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:18,520
you too much information sometimes. Like sometimes you need to, it's really good because you are

552
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,120
tasked with the taking of the picture yourself. The pictures don't need to be taken, they're just

553
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:31,080
for your own reference but by having that automaty, automony, how do you say?

554
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,680
Automonicity.

555
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:46,360
Autonomy. To take the picture, when you think you have found something that can be a clue

556
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:52,360
in another area, it sort of makes it so that you're figuring out everything and there's no,

557
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:59,240
there's like tiny bits of story here and there but there's no characters, it's just like,

558
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:04,920
find your way out of this creepy strange place with these elaborate puzzles that couldn't possibly

559
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:12,120
exist in real life except they kind of could but nobody would build them but forever lost,

560
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:21,320
there's three parts. Right, cool. I haven't played, have you played a lot of the games

561
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:28,040
from the bundle or? I've gone around and I've played, I don't know, like 30 or something.

562
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:33,560
It's more than me. I've played maybe, I've tried out maybe like six or seven, I don't know.

563
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:42,040
There's so many of them that are like tabletop booklets and pixel art asset packs and things.

564
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:47,000
There's a lot of things that are not video games. Yeah, I don't mind that though because

565
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,400
occasionally it's like a Photoshop brush pack, like pixelated something or other and it's like,

566
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:56,600
oh cool, I'll just add that to my things. Yeah, nothing wrong with it.

567
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:04,680
Interesting cool fonts. I usually don't like having to pay for fonts so having it for quote

568
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:14,760
unquote free is pretty cool. It would be funny if there came a sort of almost a baby boom,

569
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:21,400
if you will, of indie games in the next year or so that all had maybe a lot of the same assets

570
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,240
in them and it was like because a lot of people bought this bundle and like a lot of the packs

571
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:33,080
got used by like first time devs or whatever. That would be pretty funny. I don't know if that'll

572
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,800
happen. I don't know if it's that if it was that big of a cultural event. It was a bit of a cultural

573
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:44,600
event, I think, this fucking bundle. I played this one game. There were so many fucking games on the

574
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:51,000
list that I had no idea so I just googled like best games on the racial justice bundle or whatever

575
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,520
and I found a couple of like articles counting down what they thought were some good ones.

576
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:59,160
I played this one called the stillness of the wind which is like a, you seen this one?

577
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:09,240
Oh no, his microphone's muted. Sorry, it's just a thing. Actually, wait, I've got a thing too.

578
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,720
I just got a package. My roommate was just like, hey package for you. I'm going to open it on the

579
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:21,640
podcast. All right, I'll just take a quick break to piss and then I'll be back. Oh, shit. Oh, okay,

580
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:31,720
all right. If you must, if you must. All right, so viewers, this package is some more ingredients

581
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:38,520
that I have gotten for my gummy worm making. I'm trying to branch out into alternative

582
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,400
ingredients in order to achieve the broadest possible range of consistencies because different

583
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:48,360
different kinds of gummies have different consistencies to them and I'm trying to,

584
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:54,440
like the ones I've been making are pretty decent. They have a kind of a fairly similar consistency

585
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:00,040
to like a traditional gummy bear but that's actually not my favorite kind. I actually like the chewier

586
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:07,320
ones better. So I have, okay, I have another bag of erythritol which is an artificial sweetener

587
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:16,040
which is very good. That's fine but I've already been using that. I've got rice, rice flour.

588
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,160
Rice flour I think is a good, I mean it's not keto but you know, you only use a little bit and I

589
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:30,200
think it's fine. Rice flour I think will be good to give a nice sort of mochi like stickiness

590
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:36,360
or thickness to something. I'm actually very excited about experimenting with that.

591
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:46,200
And this stuff called inulin which is, it can be derived from various things. I thought it came

592
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:56,440
from, what was it, chicory root but this is apparently from Jerusalem artichokes. I don't

593
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:02,920
even know what that is but inulin, based on what I know about it, I think it's similar to the main

594
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:10,120
ingredient that I've been using which is soluble fiber from tapioca. I think inulin is just soluble

595
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:18,040
fiber, oh from, from another source. Okay the stuff I've been using is isomolto oligosaccharide.

596
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:24,920
This inulin is apparently fructo oligosaccharide so I think it's similar but it might have, it might,

597
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,640
I don't know how it's different but it is different so I'll be, I'll be fucking around with that.

598
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,880
Probably later today I'll be fucking cooking up another batch and seeing what,

599
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,560
this is very exciting. It's very exciting because the recipe I've been using has gotten a little

600
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,720
stale. They're a little samey, I've sort of gotten bored of the same consistency. I'm glad to have

601
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:47,160
new ingredients, new ingredients to fuck around with and see what happens. Ah boy oh fucking boy.

602
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,240
Right. Did you hear, did you hear any of that? I did, I was listening to most of it. Okay sick.

603
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:59,800
Um I've got more, I've got more shit on the way. The thing I'm most excited about is pectin.

604
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:07,880
Pectin is a normal, is it like a perfectly normal ingredient that normal recipes call for?

605
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:15,080
I thought and yet it's very hard, very difficult to find on like Amazon like almost every,

606
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:23,560
almost every like thing I could buy that was called pectin on Amazon was not pectin. It was

607
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:30,360
a combination of like pectin, dextrose and citric acid which I don't want because that's not keto

608
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:36,760
but that's like overwhelmingly that's the form you can buy it in which I guess most recipes that you

609
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,200
would use it in like it's traditionally used in like jelly and like most recipes would call for

610
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,240
those things um but I don't want that. That's not what I'm looking for. I want the pure, I want the

611
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:53,320
pure shit. I've got my own citric acid, I've got my own acids, I've got my own fucking sweeteners,

612
01:05:53,320 --> 01:06:03,480
thank you very much. No need, no need. Um anyway the uh yeah the stillness of the wind is about

613
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:12,120
being an old woman on a farm and getting letters from your family and I don't know having nightmares

614
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:21,880
cool. It's very, it's pretty good. I like a lot of the weird like non-tradition, not

615
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:30,600
unusual concepts that these itchio games go with. Yeah stillness of the wind is like you're on a farm

616
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:36,440
so it sort of feels like a farming game um because like you know you can, you milk your goats,

617
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:43,640
you make cheese out of the goat milk, you like pick mushrooms, you collect eggs from your fucking

618
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:51,320
chicken coop, you have to cook, you have to cook food and eat it so you don't get exhausted uh or

619
01:06:51,320 --> 01:07:00,680
whatever um but I'm pretty sure that other than eating I'm not sure you can actually lose like um

620
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:07,720
I kind of think the farming is it like that like it's not like uh like that's not really what it's

621
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,200
about it's just kind of there to add like texture to the experience of being this woman and getting

622
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:20,440
these letters um but I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that you can't actually like fail uh I but you

623
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:28,520
could probably like you could probably arrive at a point where like your farm sucks sooner and maybe

624
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:35,240
that would change your experience a little bit uh but uh yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know it was a

625
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:41,960
very sad game oh this looks cool it was it was a big it was a bummer I like I like this sort of um

626
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:48,840
sunsetty orange glow it looks it reminds me maybe it's just the way she's dressed but it

627
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:55,080
reminds me of journey a little bit yeah um it kind of looks like that it's got that sort of minimal

628
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:04,200
minimalist realists aesthetic I guess it's like a it's like a sort of mundane world rendered in

629
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:10,520
this kind of cartoon style I don't know anyway you just you just make cheese and the mailman

630
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:18,440
comes by and is like got any cheese oh no cheese oof sucks see you later bro yeah cring yeah you

631
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:25,240
literally it's like oh great the mailman will like the mailman will give will sell you these like

632
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,760
treasures he'll sell you these like fucking like far off like magical treasures from like

633
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,080
ancient times or whatever that have these big like highfalutin descriptions I think they're all

634
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:41,640
worthless I think there's no point to any of them uh and I I don't know why they're a thing in the

635
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:49,720
game I feel like it's maybe it's just another thing to like distract you from the point and I

636
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:56,600
don't know what the point is the point is I don't know I don't I don't know what the point of the

637
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,960
game is but I but I guess I would recommend it anyway there's another game that I thought looked

638
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,560
cool and I fucked around with only for a few minutes and I was like maybe I'll get back to this

639
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:11,400
and fuck around more and I haven't yet it's called Mendel as in Gregor Mendel and it's like

640
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:18,120
you land on an alien planet I guess and there are these different plants and you can go around

641
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:23,880
and discover plants and name them you give them whatever name you want and then you can like

642
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:30,200
take samples of them and like combine them and I guess it's sort of combines their genes I guess

643
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:35,400
the game has some sort of like genetic modeling component somewhere in its code and you combine

644
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:40,840
their genes and it produces a new plant that like combines their traits in some way and then you can

645
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,080
name the new plant that you've made by combining them and stuff and I guess it's just sort of a

646
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:50,280
fuck around and make weird plants kind of thing which is cool and the kind of thing that I could

647
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:56,440
get into if I was in the right mood but I didn't I didn't get that far into it uh

648
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,680
what else did I play I haven't I haven't I've never played night in the woods but now I guess

649
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:09,880
I own it because I got the bundle um I think I've probably already mentioned uh a short hike which

650
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:14,760
is great yes I played that on this I played that on a stream one time well like a year ago

651
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:21,000
and it's a really cool video game and uh the the I think I mentioned this too but the dev the dev

652
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,600
of the game like showed up to my stream one time because I tweeted I was streaming it and I guess

653
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:31,080
he saw and that was pretty that was pretty based that was you you play as Reginald you play as

654
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:39,800
Reginald from Beartato you know who that is no there's a webcomic called Reginald and Beartato

655
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:47,560
and it it's the the main Reginald okay the the website is called Nedroid but um yeah the

656
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:54,040
character the character in in um a short hike looks exactly like the stupid bird Reginald from

657
01:10:54,040 --> 01:11:01,400
Nedroid and it's very funny it's like ha ha there he is that's it that's my observation

658
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:09,560
hey uh uh Ben I think yeah I might need to leave quite soon because there's a thing that we're

659
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:16,360
gonna do uh and it requires it is uh like light sensitive like the sunset happening

660
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:23,480
oh do you might do you want to can I know what it is oh yeah yeah we're just gonna do a bonfire

661
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,720
but it was like a fireless day thing oh okay uh all right fair enough well do you want to do you

662
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:36,520
want to start voicemails or if you got to leave soon I can just do voicemails I'll just fucking do

663
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:44,440
it myself man I don't I don't give a fuck you can you uh what do you want to do that I don't know um

664
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:53,160
how how soon are the are the okay I have not gone I have not gone through them uh but there are

665
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,680
have you not prepared them to play no I have not prepared them to play I I was just gonna play them

666
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:06,840
on uh a speak pipe oh and you personally would okay yeah in that case uh that's gonna take too

667
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,320
long so I will do and then you can do the voice unless I mean the only other way if you did want

668
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:15,320
to do them is if you just logged on to speak pipe and we both just hit play at the same time

669
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:23,240
um but if you gotta go then it's fine yeah sorry I genuinely I genuinely don't mind doing it

670
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:33,880
okay well happy father's day uh I will do I will I will soldier on um and I'm uh good good good talk

671
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,920
uh yeah yeah cool I didn't didn't really feel like didn't really feel that much like recording

672
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:48,920
an episode but that's okay no but I mean that's fine I don't care it's it's weird doing a two man

673
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:59,560
it sure is I wonder why I wonder why it's come to this why is it like this what's everyone

674
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:06,600
fucking doing what's so goddamn important uh sorry sorry sorry for my emotional literally

675
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:16,040
anything else yeah I guess I guess so um all right well I will see you all right man

676
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:21,400
oh put your fucking audio wait we gotta sync oh shit let's yeah we didn't think it okay I guess

677
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:26,040
we'll do this right now Ellie is our I don't care if you cut this do not use your own discretion

679
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:42,680
it's just me everyone hey it's time for the it's time I guess this we've returned to the part of

680
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:51,320
the episode that's just the Ben solo cast similar perhaps to what you might get monthly if you were

681
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:58,120
a five-dollar patron haha I'm doing it I'm fucking doing it at patreon.com slash ben saint where I do

682
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:03,960
the month I do the same thing that hippo does I stole the idea from him where I do the monthly

683
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:09,160
roundup Q&A kind of thing I do a little question and answer thing or you ask me whatever and then

684
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:16,040
I answer them and then it's just me and I talk about stuff um but you know I feel like I touched

685
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:21,240
I feel like in talking to hippo I touched on everything that I might have wanted to bring up

686
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:31,240
had it been the true solo Ben cast um so I guess it's time to go to voicemails yes um

687
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:41,080
let's let's hear let's hear from our good friend and I have not I have not uh edited these at all

688
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,760
I haven't listened to them beforehand so this is totally unfiltered and maybe if they really are

689
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:51,720
bad let's let's see let's see what Nate has to deal with every every time when he when he's like

690
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:57,320
going through them and picking let's have a raw uncut experience I will I guess I'll tell Ellie

691
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:04,760
is already cut any that I feel are not appropriate or good enough anyway this is from Pokemon's

692
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:11,000
greatest nemesis one thing I find especially funny about the traders of america list is that

693
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:18,520
there's pokemon listed uh and then there's pedo which is listed parentheses pokemon's greatest

694
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:28,120
nemesis um is so co context this this guy on twitter who I think was just doing it for attention

695
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:33,880
one that one angry gamer or one angry gamer he made this list that made the rounds of traders of

696
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:39,080
america and it was just have a god I hope I haven't talked about this before whatever it

697
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:45,800
and it was basically just like brands and celebrities or people who basically is just

698
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:51,240
supported black lives matter that's basically all you needed to do uh to to get on to get on this

699
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:58,920
traders of america this is people who are have betrayed the united states and uh oh god the

700
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:06,280
state of the world and um I got on it long story short I've said this before where where am I what's

701
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:13,000
what's happening um and uh so I guess pokemon's on it that's really funny uh and pita yeah you get it

702
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,080
you get the iron I don't have to explain but that's why this is happening that's why this is all

703
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:22,440
happening problem solved riddle answered okay next one from tom I love a zoomie please focus

704
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:27,800
all your effort into a zoomie I think he is doing that but whatever let's let's go

705
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,840
you know tom I just played a zoomie in the vertical slice for the first time

706
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,800
this is the same god a big fan of the character but I couldn't play the official game because

707
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:43,000
like my pc was shit and I had to fix it and then finally a zoomie I can finally do it

708
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:50,920
and I did it I beat the game basically like what is of that exists so far absolutely brilliant

709
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,720
the only problem that I have with it is that the jump button is C and the spacebar is like

710
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:02,360
literally right there and it would be so much more intuitive for me to use the spacebar maybe

711
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:08,040
like include a thing to map the controls to whatever you want you know like a menu to do that

712
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:15,240
so it would be uh very based anyways good game bro uh that's it

713
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:29,880
cool tom please respond uh I personally um I have only the only I have I have seen tom's

714
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,840
a zoomie updates I haven't played it since that first like vertical slice came out

715
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,240
so I don't know what the current I don't really know what the current state of it is

716
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:47,000
but uh I'm sure I'm sure it's looking good because it was looking good before and seems

717
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,600
like things have only progressed upward from there that's what I think here we go summoning

718
01:17:52,600 --> 01:18:01,720
sponge what do you fucking have to say for yourself first 100% shower through just two minutes and

719
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:08,440
47 seconds that's a four yes good no towel separate shampoo conditioner and body wash

720
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:15,160
long curly hair external objects you should stream it just a sponge I used warm water

721
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:21,480
but data mining suggests that the torment that cold water brings might actually help save some frames

722
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:27,480
we just have to see how the history of the shower speed on the wall the music

723
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:35,800
I get it I get it summoning sponge summoning salt that's the joke cool good good I mean

724
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,840
we what we need is like a comparison of like who who brought the record down what were their

725
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,680
strats what were the what was the new tech that allowed for new breakthroughs to be made

726
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:55,080
obviously that would take more than 31 seconds um okay uh next up we got margar here we go

727
01:18:55,160 --> 01:19:00,760
hey bcp members um I just have a really quick question I think it's been on a lot of people's

728
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:06,440
minds lately but no one seems to really be talking about it um where the fuck is brad

729
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:12,200
garling house and what have you done with them uh and if you haven't done anything with them then

730
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:25,880
what is the situation is he safe uh thanks uh I mean you know not to not to spoil anything but

731
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:34,040
but you know in spite of in spite of appearances now future rad content is coming that elaborates on

734
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:58,280
it seemed as though the threat has been neutral had been neutralized uh but um I won't comment on

735
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,880
I won't comment on matters of his personal safety but uh uh apparently I was mistaken so I guess at

736
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:15,480
this point in time margar your guess is as good as mine uh gulp okay uh this next one is from
