00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome everyone to PCP Destructive Criticism.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Just whenever there's someone who is a PCP viewer, or any other correspondent of any of us, or potentially even one of us, who has made a thing that isn't a video, especially a video game that can be played.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a series now, even though this is just an impromptu idea we just had.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hypothetically, it may happen again in the future, so we have to make it a series now. We have to capitalize on the future potential.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So this is Nemesis.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're playing Nemesis, a game by what's his name?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't remember. Well, I think on social media he's just called Nemesis Admins. We'll just call him Nemesis Admins.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, this game is on Newgrounds, but it's also at www.nemesis-game.com.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He sent a message to Digi saying, yo, I've been listening to the PCP.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Of course he messaged Digi. What a fucking pleb.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A pleb tier PCP viewer.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And he said that listening to your show gave me the motivation to finish it, or to really finish working on his project.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
To not be one of those average suck boys who just sits around and doesn't actually do the work to make the shit happen.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's fair.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Actually, this is the third weapon.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I won't get into specifics about what we can talk about.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Right now, Ben is playing, and I'm just here next to the microphone.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're too lazy to actually record the video. This is mostly for the guy who made the game.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you want to experience the game while we talk, you can just go play it.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Go visit the website if you would.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We figure the guy who made the game knows the game well enough that he can just feel in the blanks.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He'll know what we're talking about.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The reason why I wanted to give this guy direct feedback, or open letter feedback, is because it's professionally presented enough.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And the guy seems like professionally in his dialogue.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Seems like he's pretty serious about it, which is cool.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And will be accepting to people talking about it and giving notes.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So fucking...

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How do I begin?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This game is very similar to a Lambria game.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The designer himself said, like, yes, this is basically a Luftraus.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was annoyed because in his messages, the one that I saw you quoting, he didn't say anything about Luftraus.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I was like, well, this is just Luftraus.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's fine. Whatever.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Gotta start somewhere.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I would totally advise that if you're making games, just rip one off completely.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, sure, that's fine.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you're gonna make a guitar song, you gotta play someone else's song 5,000 times so you can get an idea of how it works.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Absolutely, of course.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If it's a game thrown up for free, then you're essentially ripping off Lambria.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So that's two birds one stone, right?

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So for someone who hasn't played Luftrausers, I immediately jump in and I'm like, this is fucking impossible.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, of course it's impossible. It's a game where you just go until you die.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So you always die.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's just a question of how long.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's the tricky point for me is that I'm not into games like that.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's just sort of fundamentally.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So basically there's two goals for me, which is talk about what the game is like from the perspective of someone like me,

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and then talk about trying to hone in on what I think the dev is going for.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't fucking know.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I think it's gonna be a super annoying demographic and just know what I think, right?

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, just completely not the target audience for this game.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Not completely not. I don't hate these kinds of games. I just don't get that into them.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are much more the target demographic for this game.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, I never went crazy for Luftrausers or anything.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't buy the final version, but yeah, it is the sort of game that I'm generally into.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The fact that you didn't immediately...

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Holy shit!

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We just got to a giant fucking...

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A new fucking thing has appeared.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We just got to a giant flail? We didn't see that before.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's just getting intense now.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Like I said, I have not really played Luftrausers.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know if this thing is just taken from Luftrausers or not.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What? This is like...

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They keep fading in and out, too.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is an interesting enemy. I'm sure it's taken from something.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is two out of nowhere.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's too much like Luftrausers.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know. I didn't see anything like that in Luftrausers, but I'm sure.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just like that one time where the main character in one piece was picking out pants, that was Luftrausers.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Gotcha.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So the fact that you didn't immediately gawk at how weak your weapon was like I did?

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No, yeah, I did.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is too fucking...

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No, I did. That was my first thing.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The first plane has a main weapon that is completely worthless.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But I don't know. Maybe that's intentional.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Probably not.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, this is one of those games where you've got 15 minutes to get in and get out because it's on new grounds.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're going to lose interest immediately.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That doesn't make any sense.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That has nothing to do with whether the main weapon is too weak or not.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What I thought was like...

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He was saying that just in relation to the difficulty in general.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I get that it's supposed to be hard.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
For me personally, I generally prefer video games where the first time you dive into the mechanics

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
everything just sort of pre-scripted works correctly.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So that you know how things are supposed to go.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Because when I first played it and I immediately died, I was like wait, did I do something wrong?

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I wasn't sure.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's just you not getting it.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, I did get it. It took me two extra minutes to get it.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Again, this is different.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Me personally, I do have the patience if I decide to sit down with a game.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So consider the giant swathes of people who will in fact click away after 30 seconds, right?

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
To make that really great first impression.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, this game is not for that.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, well, this video is not for that.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But if it is, then there you go, right?

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Because I don't think there'd be any harm in just like you have this starting wave of enemies

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that shows up that are obviously super easy and weak.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And then they get knocked out in one hit by your thing.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then the actual challenge begins.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit poking me with your thing.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sorry, totally unrelated.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I wasn't fucking...

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I just wasn't sure what to do at first.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Because I wasn't sure if it was going to be one of those games you got to get to an objective goal.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you got to shoot down a certain number of dudes.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because there's no score either.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
At least not on the screen, right?

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You only see the number of enemies you kill at the end.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I just didn't know what to do.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Which also brings me to the fact that the screen is very barren.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's not barren.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, look, there's nothing on the screen right now.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, because it just started.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Soon there will be huge swarms of planes and bullets and shit all flying around.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know, man. Some of your criticisms seem a little weird so far.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I like density. I'm far of hashtag density core.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are you talking about?

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Give me one minute and you will see the screen will become dense with shit.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, and I'm just saying that you have rounds of this game,

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
sessions of this game that last three minutes,

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and the first minute is going to be mostly empty.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So that's 30% of the game that's mostly empty.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's like an RPG with 30% empty corridors.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The better you get at the game, the longer you'll last,

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and proportionally the less time you'll spend in the boring first 30 seconds.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I guess.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't really see what the advantage is though of having sort of a barren first 30 seconds.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's the alternative?

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Just having more interesting shit go on.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Just have it start immediately?

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I guess it could get going faster.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, probably there's nothing...

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, I get hurt if I go out into space.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, it would probably be fine if it started up faster.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Because once you've played a little bit, you don't really need to fuck around with the first...

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But really, it's like 30 of them at once.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This third plane has a really good weapon for that.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We'll get to that in a bit.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, I guess in principle I agree that the faster it gets going, the better.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But whatever, it's really not that bad.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, I guess you're right.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now that I'm seeing how far we're able to get in, and now there's just a bunch of shit,

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
then that's pretty reasonable.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But my point is, compared to Loot Browsers, that game has more stuff going on immediately.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Or at least it's got a smaller screen.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's got a smaller field of view.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's also hung up on the barrenness of the screen.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The size of the screen is an advantage.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I like that better than Loot Browsers because it just lets you concede more and you can play smarter.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I guess I'm not trying to propose the idea that it's bad.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I just want it to be something that is considered.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I want to know how much was it intentional.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think it is a good design choice to make the screen proportionally bigger.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I guess my point is, I just want it to be something that is kept in mind.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because barrenness and too small a screen was the number one pitfall that I fell into when I made an RPG.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Where everything was so fucking small.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is not an RPG. This was working totally differently.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I just thought, was the dev keeping that in mind when making it?

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's why I'm bringing it up.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So let's talk about the second weapon for the second plane.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hang on, there's three planes.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Before we get into that, I want to say that I do really like the opening screen.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's like a pilot console and you have to hit all the buttons that the game requires you to use.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That unlocks the console and then you can get started.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know, it's just neat.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's neat because you just gotta press the buttons and now you know the buttons.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
For me, that was also confusing. It gave me this first 30 seconds.

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wait, how does this thing work?

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was awesome. It was unequivocally great and I love that.

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If I'm going into a video game and I know for a fact I'm going to give it a really long trial period.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's say everyone in my circle is saying it's amazing.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Then something like that is great because I've been given the promise that extra effort is going to be worth it.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's not extra effort to press four buttons to start the game.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're just not sure what the buttons are going to mean, right?

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's what the point of it is, is that it shows you the buttons and it prompts you like these are the buttons and these are what they do.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now hit them in order to start the game up.

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It feels like powering on a console.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I like it. I like it. I like it. I do.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You see the screen you're on right now? You're on the main screen.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It took me a while to realize that those blue lights in the middle don't do anything.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They're just denoting the different volume levels.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
In fact, they're lined up symmetrically right next to the level selection buttons.

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It made me think that they were inherently coupled somehow.

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then a little bit later, I was like, oh, okay, so there we go.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Over there is basically unrelated.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Those buttons over there is the volume choices.

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The stuff on the right is the level options, right?

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Once again, I guess I'm basically framing these problems, but more queries or more statements, I guess,

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
where obviously leading players into confusion or forcing them to get outside of their comfort zone

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
to do an old thing in a new way has a lot of value,

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but it should be done very consciously, and you know exactly what kind of misconstruions

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and confusions you're going to put the player on, right?

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So you can manipulate them better.

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You don't necessarily want to send them into a confused tizzy unintentionally,

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
because then that might not be a good experience, right?

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, I suppose not. I don't think that's what's happening here.

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm just saying that, like, I don't know.

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I guess as a general principle, I would agree with you,

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that you're confusing the players bad and you shouldn't do this.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, I'm just saying that, like, just know what will cause confusion.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay.

210
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because I remember, like...

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I eat nothing in this game. Nothing in this game would do that, but okay.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, like, you know, 10 seconds of, hmm, what's this, right?

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Which, you know, in a game that, like, as he says, you'd play for 15 minutes,

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that comprises, like, 5% of the whole game experience.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So it is very relevant, you know?

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No, it isn't. You're totally out of line and you're totally off base.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You just flip through games, like, in the span of minutes, you know?

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It very much happens.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
People could, like, watch a Let's Play and they might click away in 2 minutes,

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
based on the experience the Let's Player has.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a really tight market, you know?

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You have to really, really work and manipulate the player to command their attention.

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I... I guess.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah. So...

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You know, it may as well if you're gonna put lots of work into it.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So what would you...

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, if you could change something, if you could change something about this game

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and deviate this issue, what would you do?

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Uh, I would probably put, like, a little graphical separation line

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
between the volume options and then the level selections

231
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and maybe I'd make them a slightly different color.

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right?

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I remember in the Art of Game design, the Book of Lenses,

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
there's one part where the author talks about how he was making, like, an Aladdin game,

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
where you're riding off flying carpet.

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And, like, there's a part where you get up into, like, a big chamber

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and you're supposed to go straight to, like, a throne area in this throne room.

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Now, the players would always go up into that room

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and just wander around not knowing where to go.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And so he put a fucking line on the floor that leads to the throne

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and everyone will always go to the throne immediately, right?

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Sure.

245
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But then in co-op mode, uh, they wanted to make it to where people wouldn't all go to the throne

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
because only one person can grab the scepter,

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
so they wanted everyone to just sort of...

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They wanted one person to go to the throne and everyone else to hang out, right?

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So they drew a line that goes to the throne

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and then splits off into three random directions.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The three players in co-op would always split off into random directions

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
with those lines on the floor that none of them consciously noticed, you know?

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So it's all about manipulation of the player.

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah.

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Um, you know, just stuff to keep in mind.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay.

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But so, for ref, we're just talking about the opening menu.

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We're just talking about the menu screen right now.

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, man.

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay.

261
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If the menu feels good, the game feels good.

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's not...

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wait, I don't... Who said that?

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That guy who remixes everything that we say into weird shitpost videos.

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, was that Steve?

266
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah.

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So anyway, uh...

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, yeah, we were going to talk about the weapons.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So the opening weapon of the game.

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
See, I just feel so demoralized when I start up the game for the first minute

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
because I feel like the weapon isn't even doing shit, right?

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, my...

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, my first...

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
My first criticism of the game is that it is Luth Trousers,

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
which I think is a comprehensive...

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
which I think says all I need to say.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But...

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay, but I know that I'm seen as some sort of pariah

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
because I believe in originality and I think that it's valuable.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Like I'm some kind of moron or something.

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But...

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay, so I'm just going to leave that one.

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm just going to leave that where it lies.

285
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My only other criticism...

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, my second criticism is that, yeah,

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the first plane has two weapons.

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's like a spread fire shotgun machine gun,

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
although it doesn't fire that fast,

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and a laser beam.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And they're both underpowered,

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but the first one is underpowered to the point.

293
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The main weapon is useless and I never used it.

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's unbelievably terrible.

295
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like I did not kill anything with it.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah, and then you basically...

297
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think if you just play one round with the first plane,

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
you can then go back to the main menu and unlock the second plane

299
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and then the third plane,

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and they each have in turn more powerful weapons than the last.

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I liked the second plane better than the first,

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and I liked the third plane better than the second.

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Although the third plane is like...

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Overpowered almost.

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, I think it's probably a little overpowered,

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and also it just feels really different.

307
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's a totally different kind of game.

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The third plane does not feel...

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm not actually shooting anything.

310
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
All I'm doing is leading planes behind me

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and then sort of leaving this mine in the air

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
that they just run into.

313
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's like a buzzsaw boomerang.

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It is.

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's really cool.

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's pretty cool, I like it.

317
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I love fucking games where you have a variety of weapons,

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
each with their own totally different mechanic, right?

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's a good game I like,

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
so I like it when things get outside of the general zone

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
of shooting on a straight vector, right?

322
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, but it kind of makes me wonder

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
why this game is a game about flying a plane around and shooting,

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but by far the best time I'm having with it,

325
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm not actually shooting.

326
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I feel like a game about that boomerang

327
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
would be much better.

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think if there's one thing...

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
If this is an experimental game,

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
just kind of made, oh fuck, I ran into a deadly thing.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, if this game is an experiment

332
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and this guy is, I assume, a pretty new dev

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and he's probably just trying things out

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and figuring out what works,

335
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think what really works is that boomerang,

336
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I think, is the lesson that he might want to take away from this.

337
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Indeed.

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's my opinion.

339
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah.

340
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh yeah, another tricky thing

341
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
about the game's design that misled me

342
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
is that I didn't realize that if you went back to the main menu

343
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you'd unlock more weapons, right?

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, the new planes.

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Right, you'd unlock the new planes,

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
because you have to go back to the main menu to do that.

347
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And for me personally,

348
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I would have probably just been stuck in a loop

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
playing with the first plane.

350
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I would have too.

351
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Over and over again if Digi hadn't mentioned it, right?

352
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

353
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So my thought is...

354
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, I think it should notify you when you unlock a new plane.

355
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Which is really the reason why

356
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I felt like I was a little bit too misled

357
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
by the confusion of the menu,

358
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
because you have to kind of know what that menu means

359
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
in order to understand this immediately.

360
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, I think that a notification

361
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
when you unlock a new plane would be pretty good.

362
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Right.

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And for me it's like,

364
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
especially when you're on browser game level,

365
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
notifications basically should be translated

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
to shove something right in your fucking face.

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah, like why do you think all those mobile games

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
always have like a mascot character

369
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
on the bottom right corner of the screen

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that like tells you everything,

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
just to make sure that you're not fucking missing it, right?

372
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

373
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So I would say like have,

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
like in the middle of the screen,

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
like you got a new fucking plane, you know?

376
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

377
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Especially because the game only really gets

378
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
more good and interesting when you get to the third one.

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

380
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So you want to talk about the aesthetic of the game?

381
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Well, the aesthetic of the game is just Luftrasse.

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I guess.

383
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But smaller.

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, I guess I will say I like the cityscape.

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I like the cityscape underneath.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I like the parallax scrolling and I like the sun.

387
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I like how the higher you go,

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
like there's this red sun in the background

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and it like illuminates more of the city

390
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
because like it's shining on it more.

391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The dev here clearly has a grip on how to synthesize

392
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the different multimedia elements, you know?

393
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Like he's able to put the different graphics together

394
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and they weave around in an interesting way.

395
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I mean, I guess I would say that differently.

396
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I would say that he's just got a reasonably good sense

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
of aesthetic design.

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, just how to make the fucking,

399
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
because none of the individual graphics

400
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
are that impressive, right?

401
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They're really consistent too.

402
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Although, you know, I, well,

403
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
okay, I was going to say that it's a bit odd,

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
like the sun, it's odd, like the sun

405
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
really calls attention to itself.

406
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Like I find myself looking at the sun

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
whenever I go up high because...

408
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think it's fucking cool, but it looks...

409
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It is cool, but it commands so much of my attention

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
even though it's irrelevant to the actual gameplay.

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't hate it, but I think it's odd.

412
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Every element of the graphics,

413
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
they all look like a different art style.

414
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like the sun itself is like a perfectly circular,

415
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
like it's probably not even like a graphic,

416
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
it's probably just like in whatever language

417
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
they're programmed in, like they probably just use,

418
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
like straight up the program to make a circle.

419
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's what it looks like to me.

420
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Could be.

421
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because it's so like anti-aliased.

422
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And like the graphics of the weapons

423
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and the enemies and you,

424
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
they all look like...

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They look like loot browsers.

426
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Then the cityscape looks sort of MS Paint-like.

427
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You know, it looks a little sloppy and like unprofessional.

428
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It looks cool, but it doesn't look like it was made

429
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
by an artist, if you know what I mean, right?

430
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It doesn't...

431
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I guess I would say that it's...

432
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Well, you know what I don't like about it?

433
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't like how it just cuts to black underneath.

434
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, that's the water.

435
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I know, I know.

436
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Like the tops...

437
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay, well, here's what I don't like.

438
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The tops of the buildings, they feel...

439
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, the perspective feels off because

440
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the tops of the buildings are tilted down

441
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
as though you're looking at them from slightly above.

442
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And yet the waterline is a perfect horizontal line

443
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
implying that you are looking at it exactly from the sideways.

444
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So I feel like that doesn't quite work.

445
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, and I think that the fucking battle ships

446
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
in particular have a lot of precise detail on them.

447
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Like the way that they're lit up,

448
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
which I don't know if you're able to have the...

449
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Fuck.

450
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Being able to pay attention to even notice.

451
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But see those ships, how much cool little details are on them?

452
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The little lights on the side.

453
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
They kind of looked like they were drawn by a different person,

454
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
but probably just that the methodology he went into drawing

455
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that was very different, where he probably modeled

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the ships after photos of ships,

457
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and he probably just drew some fucking buildings

458
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to make it look like buildings, right?

459
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

460
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I assume he probably wasn't looking at a cityscape

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
when he drew it.

462
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, that's just what it comes off like, right?

463
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It just feels like a different art style.

464
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And particularly the clouds look like a cartoony

465
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
with a thick black outline.

466
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So each element has a different art style, basically.

467
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Which again, if you want to go for art style fusion,

468
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
again, not good, not bad, not great, not terrible,

469
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
not mediocre, just not a value judgment,

470
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
just a point, right?

471
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah.

472
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
To keep in mind the different cohesion,

473
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the different art styles, you know,

474
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
how they can work off one another.

475
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You know what?

476
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I hate the second plane.

477
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's stupid.

478
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's stupid.

479
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's special.

480
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's got a machine gun, and its special ability

481
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
is that you can like,

482
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Spin it around.

483
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can instantly reverse direction.

484
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And if you do that, you die.

485
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So it's just a kill me button.

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Because you always have like a horde of planes

487
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
flying behind you.

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know.

489
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Maybe there's some tricky strategy to use with it.

490
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I thought that maybe it would be good for like,

491
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
flying down into ships,

492
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
because it's really hard to kill the ships.

493
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The ships are positioned in a way that it's just,

494
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
it's just not natural to shoot them.

495
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I thought maybe that like,

496
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
this would be a good plane for killing ships.

497
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay, that kind of worked,

498
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
but then I got hit and almost died.

499
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I kind of thought that maybe you could like,

500
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
swoop down at them firing,

501
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and then like, before colliding with the ground,

502
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
you can like, immediately reverse your direction

503
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and fly back up into the ship.

504
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Oh, you got to kill the ship.

505
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That actually worked.

506
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Okay, I'm going to keep trying this.

507
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's still really awkward,

508
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and I feel like I'm going to die every time I do it,

509
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
but okay.

510
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Maybe I've hit on something here.

511
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh man, didn't do it that time.

512
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay, I'm going to try again.

513
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm going back.

514
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Fuck.

515
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, well, you got it.

516
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, I got the ship, but I died,

517
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
because reversing direction

518
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
just puts you right in the path of death.

519
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So my point is, I think this guy's got,

520
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
he definitely got all the baseline talent

521
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to make a really good game.

522
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't agree with that.

523
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't agree with that.

524
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He's got the baseline talent

525
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to copy a really good game.

526
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't know.

527
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Look at that fucking skull.

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's exactly from Lufthrausers.

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Lufthrausers does that exact thing.

530
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
When you die, it puts a skull on the screen.

531
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What?

532
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah.

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I told you this game is Lufthrausers.

534
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's basically all you need to say.

535
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm sorry, man.

536
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm sorry, Dev, but you know it's true.

537
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm not crazy here.

538
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You just made Lufthrausers again,

539
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and you did a competent job.

540
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sorry.

541
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I was annoyed, because I looked at you

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and Digi in the chat

543
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
talking about this game,

544
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
arguing about its merits,

545
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and they're just discussing the merits

546
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
of Lufthrausers.

547
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
This game doesn't really merit discussion of its own.

548
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He immediately said it's like Lufthrausers.

549
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, okay.

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Fair enough.

551
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Fair enough.

552
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't know if he said it is Lufthrausers,

553
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but that is like Lufthrausers.

554
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay, but you and Digi,

555
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
without actually having played Lufthrausers,

556
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
you can't appreciate the true depth

557
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
of just how much simply Lufthrausers it is.

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, that just means

559
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
he's one of a very exclusive group of people.

560
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
There's only three people in this world

561
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
who've made Lufthrausers,

562
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and it's the two people of Lambeer and him.

563
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So that puts him in a pretty special position.

564
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I guess you got a point there.

565
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So from that position,

566
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
he can just rip off every game in the world

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and eventually do whatever he wants with his unlimited power.

568
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

569
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Sure.

570
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Sure.

571
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
All right.

572
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You got anything else to say about Nemesis?

573
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh, yeah.

574
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I forgot that's what it was called.

575
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I mean, yeah.

576
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Well, just kidding.

577
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, I don't know.

578
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I mean, the title's right up there.

579
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Lufthrausers 2 Electric Boogaloo.

580
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah, Lufthrausers 2 Return of Jafar.

581
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Return of Jafar.

582
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
All right.

583
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I guess that's it.

584
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, that's it.

585
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's it for the first episode of PCP Destructive Criticism.

586
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah.

587
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We're going to be, we'll be back.

588
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Just anyone who's a PCP viewer, make something,

589
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and then maybe we'll criticism it.

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Make something a little good.

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Don't be a piece of shit.

592
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I mean, this is good.

593
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This is fine.

594
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
This is the level.

595
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This is a good baseline to shoot for,

596
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
to share your work with us

597
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and have us give a fuck about it.

598
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, indeed.

599
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So good luck, everybody.

600
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
All right.

601
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
See ya.
