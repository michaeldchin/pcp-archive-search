1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Come on everyone sit down at this end, so that you can procrastinate along with me. You know I'm supposed to be working, but instead I'm watching PC.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's make this the mean cast. Let's get mean this episode.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, I know.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's bully Mage.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Munchy, what are you fucking dissenting? You want to be the next bullied? You want to be bullied?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You want to be on the end of my Roth?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're Roth.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm fucking Roth Munchy. I am fucking Roth and you're gonna know about it.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There's that movie 7 with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, I don't like it.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Remember at the end how Brad Pitt became Roth? That was pretty cool.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh yeah.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's Ben.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Munchy killed his wife and put his wife's head in a box.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I became Roth by being Roth.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I really love the word Roth by the way.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is it different from Roth?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, it's like the adjective.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh yeah.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you have Roth then you are Roth.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've always had an issue with the end of that movie but I'll save it for the podcast.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, let's get into it.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here we go. The 7 casts.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, I'm interested. I just watched that the other day. It's a great movie.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
God damn it.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now we're waiting for Mage to get her shit together.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is why Penalty. Bam.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Munchy opened the floodgates by informing her that we hadn't started yet.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is why I was opposed to saying I think the penalty should have been we just don't inform her that we're all here.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You know she's not even going to say anything. She's going to be a typical Mage, typical Tom.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She's going to get in here.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's why we shouldn't have said anything.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She's going to get in.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
God damn it.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I mean we should just penalize people that don't talk.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That opens the floodgates to some complicated stuff.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What is the line between not talking enough and where is the line drawn there?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We just got to feel it out.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, here's the thing.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If someone's there and they're present and they're engaged but they happen to be someone who doesn't talk that much

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
like Hippo sometimes is.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mage literally sits and draws during the podcast.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, see the thing like drawing or I think on occasion like Tom has like been programming

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
well that right there is not a full commitment to being on the episode.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't think that's cool.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't want to pick on the guy. God rest his soul because of the current complications

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but there's been numerous times where Tom like has said literally nothing on a podcast.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well again if he's there and he just doesn't have anything to say.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's just showing up to siphon off some PCP panties.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Frankly, frankly, I think the quote-unquote flugger.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Not every time.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Not every time but there's been a few times.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Of course not.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Some of us talk more than others obviously but I can't believe someone.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What it really comes down to is

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hippo is fully engaged.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We need to decide is this a friendship cast or is this a like produce the best podcast possible cast?

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because you know there's a difference there.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well I don't think there's a difference.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't think that makes a difference.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I think there's a balance there.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It can be a clusterfuck but obviously we all want it to be good.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes, I mean that's totally true.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But like if Mage, let's just say for example,

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
introduce yourself at the beginning and then just for example,

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
literally said nothing the whole episode and at the end said,

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
look what I draw while you guys were doing the podcast essentially.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It'd be like well how is that fair that this is like an equal share of the work?

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because it's clearly not.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, I don't disagree there.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I just wouldn't use the same language.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I mean it's never been to that extent.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well that's true.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So it's a bit of a dare I call that a straw man argument.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But if we started docking pay for people who aren't talking enough,

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that would encourage more of a clusterfuck to like interrupt and stuff?

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, and I don't know about all that.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well I think people should be interrupting each other.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's fine.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's fine for people to interrupt each other.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's fine.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, interrupting is to an extent.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Interrupting sucks.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, to an extent.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's bad for the podcast.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey Mage, we have not started yet.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well actually we are technically recording and I encourage you to start doing so as well.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I am not recording.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But we will not actually start.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, sick.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So here's a thought.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What we could do is just take this audio and just make it like a secret link on the thing.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's like the secret precast cast or something.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But that would require extra work maybe.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hold on.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't have any reservations.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have no reservations.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's fine.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, I don't know.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Me neither.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Me neither.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well I guess we're all here now.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We can sync at this point and then start.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wait, should we talk about what we were talking about before?

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I mean, I don't think we have much to say.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Mage, we are currently riffing and raffin on the subject of how first of all, like is

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it fair to dock someone's pay if the episode has not yet begun but like they show up before

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the recording starts or they are late past the 10 minute thing.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You know what?

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've actually revised my position because I think in the past we've said that like

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
technically there's a quality.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I think technically they qualify for a penalty but I think in the past we've said, okay,

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
we didn't actually start yet so it doesn't matter.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I basically agree with that personally.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Absolutely agree.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
All right.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
All right.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right.

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I've changed my mind.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The reason to have a penalty is so that like you did not contribute as much as the others.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's how I think about it as well.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I mean, like the greatest penalty of all I think should be if the others are organized

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and they start the episode on time then you just don't get to join or if you do you're late.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I mean, I think that it's worth letting people join late as long as they know what they're

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
doing.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I actually kind of like when people join.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I just think, you know, if you weren't there when you were supposed to be and you joined

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
late, you know, you shouldn't get the full PC penny load for it.

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I agree.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, on the larger subject of like divvying up pay based on contributions, that's a whole

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
can of worms.

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That is a whole can of worms.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,500
So I'm not even prepared to get into that in a serious way here.

140
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,000
Although, Mage, do you feel that sometimes, I'm curious what your opinion would be on

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
this.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There have been occasions where you, you know, you generally don't talk as much as other

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
people in the podcast sometimes.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You and Tom.

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You and Tom are the offenders.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And then at the end, you in particular have done this where you just, hey, like, hey guys,

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
look at the picture I drew, which kind of implies as opposed to being engaged in the

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
podcast.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Now I don't find this hugely offensive or anything, but it's like, it shows a distraction

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and a deep prioritization of, you know, contributing to the show.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, that's not how I do it.

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I usually draw things to keep myself focused.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I do, I do listen to what you guys say is just sometimes I don't have anything to say

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
or it's hard to interject, especially when you guys are very...

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There is a lot, there is a lot as, I noticed this editing, there is a lot of Mage trying

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to interject and getting cut off and...

157
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay.

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, that's fair.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I got two, I got two things to say about that.

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
One, I don't think the fact that you're drawing is necessarily a problem as long as you're

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
engaged.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You do try to interject.

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've seen this criticism in the comments and I'm going to echo it.

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Instead of trying to interject with a, let me like, hey, I have something to say.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just interject with the thing you have to say.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then it won't be heard though.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you do it loud enough.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Just keep doing it.

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't fucking take no for an answer.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, I'd have to agree that that would be better, but you know, I get it.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I get it.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is a sort of like social Darwinism, but I will say it's absolutely terrible when you're

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
like speaking and then someone like interrupts you and then like the conversation is completely

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
unsalvageable.

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We've all got to deal with that.

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It is like a Darwin.

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's like that.

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It happens to everyone.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When you're talking and someone else is talking and you know that one of you has to give up

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and stop talking and it's like a battle of wills for a little while.

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think once in a while, two people will be like so dead set on saying whatever they're

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
saying that they both talking and they can both clearly hear the other person talking,

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
but they're just going to keep going because it's like, no, fuck that.

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And when that happens, like it's up to the editor to decide who is more important to

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the conversation.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't think so.

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I mean, if I'm the editor of that, just leave them both in.

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's the honest truth.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's what happens.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Or at least cut it so that like it's one after the other.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I do a lot of like, I do a lot of fucking editing to make the podcast less terrible.

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I mean, yeah.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Fuck that.

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's not just about recapturing it.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It is like a product we're producing here.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So if you can make it like improved by spacing that, I think that's all fine and well.

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I mean, I guess.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think it legitimately impacts the like the quality of the show to have constant interruptions

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and to have it be like talking over one another.

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You can't really tell what's happening.

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't think it's that bad.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't think it's where that talking over each other.

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I mean, you see people complain about it, but every voice.

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's the main thing about the show.

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's core.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's core to the show.

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That happens every episode.

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Wait, what's core?

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Talking over other people?

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Talking over each other.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

220
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, it's core to the show, but like, I mean, I'm really thinking that this is a product

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
if it can be improved by like de-overlapping people.

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The product.

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's like a good thing to do.

224
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know.

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
To me, the product is we record ourselves talking for two hours.

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's not.

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I mean.

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There's probably an artistry there between balancing like friendly banter and then like

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
listenability.

230
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I think there is something to be, there is probably a reason.

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm fucking going to say.

232
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Because like if we were talking in person.

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is all going to the show.

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If we were talking.

235
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, this is all going to the show.

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, this is all going to the show.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If we were all in a room together talking in person, there would be less interrupting

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and the conversation would flow better.

239
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's true.

240
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's definitely true.

241
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
So talking over discord, a little lag in the interrupting that comes with this, there

242
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,000
has to be some kind of editing to sort of fix it to where it would be if we were actually

243
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
in a room together.

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey, here's a question.

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is a phenomenon.

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It seems like Jesse gets talked over more than anyone else.

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I've yet to figure out exactly why I might be, I mean, it might be because of lag because

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
he doesn't have like the worst connection.

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, let me, let me, let me propose, let me propose a reversal of causality and cause

250
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
or causation cause and effect here.

251
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Maybe he gets talked over more because he tries to interrupt more.

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Could that be the case?

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He went robo.

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not.

255
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not.

256
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm not.

257
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not.

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not calling Jesse an interrupting mean man or anything, but maybe he could be getting

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
talked over more because he's attempting to interrupt more.

260
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't, I suppose it's possible.

261
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I mean, I feel like I, if two people are talking about something, I try to stay out of it unless

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I really have something.

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't think I interrupt more than anyone else.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Again, that's not me saying Jesse, stop interrupting.

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't think that's a problem at all.

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I do, and if I am interrupting, then I do hate myself and I will lash myself with

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
the fucking cat and nine tails.

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Maybe it's that you're more courteous than like someone like me where I will just, I

270
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
don't give a fuck and I'll keep going, but you're like, well, I'm going to let this person

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
speak and I'll let them go first.

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Maybe you're just nicer in conversation.

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's possible.

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know.

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm a little known badass.

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You might call me a badass.

277
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's what I am.

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Can I get the Urban Dictionary definition of a conversation, please?

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Let me pull that up.

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I feel kind of lost right now.

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Should we start recording?

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh my God, Ben!

283
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You motherfucker!

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No, no, no, no, no.

285
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I didn't mean recording.

286
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I mean, like, start the actual episode.

287
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean, this is, we should put this in.

288
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We should, we just haven't synced yet.

289
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, is this going in?

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, this is going in.

291
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah.

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's fucking put it in.

293
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey, here's the thing.

294
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay.

295
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Conversation, Urban Dictionary.

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We're doing it, people.

297
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The act of hooking up with one, usually in a sexual fashion.

298
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's the definition of a conversation.

299
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Whoa, wait.

300
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What the fuck?

301
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's what we're just doing this whole time?

302
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, no!

303
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No!

304
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Listen to these examples.

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
One, man, did I get some good conversation last night?

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And then, leave us alone.

307
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We're having a deep conversation, Nate says, as Munchy burst into his sex dungeon.

308
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Gross.

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think the ideal podcast format is where people can have a thought and then say that

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
thought to completion and then have it be discussed instead of saying like a quarter

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
of the thought, having people interrupt and then say another quarter of the thought.

312
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And then the conversation completely derail and you go into another topic before the

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
other one can even be finished.

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think that interruptions are not a great thing in general, but when two people are

315
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
clashing and they're trying to argue each other and shouting over each other, I think

316
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that that, you know, in a way, I almost see it as like a historical record.

317
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,500
That sounds a little grandiose, but it's like this is a record of what the conversation

318
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,000
was and how it happened.

319
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
Yeah, but it does get hard to listen to.

320
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,640
When people are talking to each other and like stuttering and like trying to interjecting

321
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,720
and failing, like all that stuff I think should, some effort should be put into having it all

322
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
cut out.

323
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,800
And that's one of the things that we should be looking for in an editor is that kind

324
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,160
of audio engineering, making it all so unclean and, you know, making sure that we don't sound

325
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,040
like inarticulate fucking baboons.

326
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
What I think is really interesting learning like, like, like, like, like, like, like,

327
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
like, for example, when you start a sentence and you have to say the same word over and

328
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,880
over again because you don't know what the fuck your brain is doing yet.

329
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,680
Like when you do that, you just, I would like cut all the likes prior to the first to the

330
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,080
end like, you know what I'm saying, that's high level shit there.

331
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,840
Make it sound like I'm not stuttering like an electrocuted retard.

332
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,920
I might have a slightly lower threshold of stuff I'd cut with something like that, but

333
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,040
I get the idea.

334
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,720
It's all about, you know, what you want to do with it and how you want it to come out

335
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
in the end.

336
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,200
Other podcasts record for so fucking long and it's really strange.

337
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,880
I recorded a podcast with this guy low art on YouTube.

338
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,760
I recorded that like maybe two months ago and the guy is still like, I mean, yeah,

339
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
looking on it.

340
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,480
Other people, other people like edit their podcasts and like, I don't, I kind of don't

341
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
get it.

342
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
No, that's good.

343
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay.

344
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Okay.

345
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Other people who report podcasts for like a living.

346
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Well, no, no, no.

347
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
For so long.

348
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,440
I listened to the Penny Arcade DLC podcast and they don't edit that at all.

349
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,880
Just a conversation between them and it's fine.

350
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Like there's no pauses.

351
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
There's no gaps.

352
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Are you sure though that there's literally no improvements made in the editing process?

353
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,040
I guess I can't be a hundred percent sure because I know that like, for example, Sam

354
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,920
Harris and his waking up podcast, like he treats it like a product that they like curate

355
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,600
to like make better and remove like to try to keep all the content.

356
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,760
Some podcasts are highly like there's one called the relentless picnic that it has like

357
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,040
musical interludes that are definitely like points where they like broke the conversation

358
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,600
and restarted and stuff.

359
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,040
And others just, I don't know, others just aren't like that.

360
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,720
And we are far on the other end of the spectrum.

361
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,920
You know, Ben, when you and I did T-Bap originally, like that was something that I went through

362
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,240
and I did like improve the audio by cutting out like ums and us and pauses to make it

363
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,240
into like, but that was essentially podcast format.

364
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
We just would put the animation.

365
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Okay.

366
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,040
So guys would be shocked if you saw like my biggest timeline of like how I, cause I mean

367
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,080
it takes me in probably Thursday night to finish these things.

368
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,520
And I fully admit, it probably takes me too long.

369
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,920
Like if we were paying an editor and they did it the way I do it, we wouldn't be paying

370
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,960
them enough and we would never pay them enough and I would never want to.

371
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,000
Who's working too hard?

372
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,920
I don't win T-Bap, but like I'm proud of it.

373
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,280
Like when I'm done, even if it takes me all week to make it how I want it to sound, I'm

374
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,880
proud of it at the end.

375
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,080
But it's, it's a weird thing because we're looking for an editor.

376
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,200
It's a weird thing to say like, I want you to edit it good.

377
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,680
And if it's not good enough, I'll fucking kill you.

378
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,200
But don't think that we're paying you more if you edit it good because we're too cheap

379
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
to do that.

380
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Well, you know what I mean?

381
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
We want them to take pride in their work, you know.

382
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I want to say, I want to say about T-Bap, about T-Bap.

383
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,880
I want to say good, but the better it is the more we have to pay them.

384
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,680
We would break T-Bap up with like scripted segments.

385
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,520
Like we would, we would come up with jokes as we were going to be like, hold on, stop

386
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,000
the recording and then let's, let's, let's read these lines to make a joke in the middle

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
of it.

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or whatever.

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We did it in a good way.

390
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So it was okay.

391
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Fair enough.

392
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,120
I think a lot of the time, good podcasting is a lot like good writing where most of

393
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,640
it is like recording for like hours on end and then in the editing room just cutting

394
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,440
out swabs of other interesting motion.

395
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,960
It's made in the editing.

396
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,680
We got to, we got to find the podcast in the editing guys.

397
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,840
You know, I agree.

398
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,280
This is, this is, you know, when I'm working with like Digi on like our Shearles, Shield

399
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,360
Hero podcast or whatever, Digi's a guy who I, I have a lot of admiration for this aspect

400
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,800
that he just doesn't give a fuck.

401
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,160
He just throws in the editing bay, puts one image, it's done.

402
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,000
And frankly, he does it in an unbelievably short amount of time and I'm huge, I have

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,880
a small degree of admiration for that, but mostly fear and disgust of that.

404
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
That's fair.

405
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Wait, fear of what?

406
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
The jealousy of what now?

407
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,640
Fear of Digi not giving a fuck what goes up.

408
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Like his output, his output rate is like can, can absolutely be through the roof and on

409
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
something like that.

410
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,840
Like the other day I finished recording, I walk in to like see Michelle, I'm like, Hey,

411
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
just finish this Shield Hero.

412
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,080
And like before I said like one fucking word, the podcast was up and we're like, what the

413
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Digi, how did you do it?

414
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,640
Well, I mean, if the conversation doesn't have like a bunch of breaks and things you

415
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,840
have to edit around, then you don't have to edit it.

416
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,440
You just put it on the video and render it and put it on the internet.

417
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,320
Well, any of them can be improved if you like wanted, like there's gonna be one bad breath

418
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,600
that you could cut out to like, you know, make it a little bit better.

419
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Oh, I don't know.

420
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
That's, that's sort of persnickety.

421
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
That's so persnickety.

422
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,320
Like I, I mean, I don't know if it's better, it's better.

423
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
I listen.

424
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,880
I, I mean, I'll just, I'll just say it.

425
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,600
I did not do hardly any like audio editing person other than like getting the volume

426
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,000
equal on what I, on the episodes that I edited.

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,040
And I don't think they were that worse for it.

428
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,440
I don't think they were that worth it for it.

429
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
What's that?

430
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Say to Jesse.

431
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
Well, Ben's episodes look good at least cause he can draw.

432
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I did do it.

433
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
I did do.

434
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Man, I really like the, I really like the outline sort of what you've been doing on

435
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,280
the recent ones, like the light sort of wire frame versions of us.

436
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,920
I don't know what you, you, you, you mean like with the mouths moving and everything?

437
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Yeah.

438
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Just like the different colored outline.

439
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah.

440
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,200
I thought those looked pretty cool.

441
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,000
And I got to say, like I knew, okay, after a while, after I'd done a few of those, I

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,960
knew how to get the mouths moving.

443
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,640
And it was, it was a long process to like figure out the method to do it.

444
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,360
Once I figured it out, it was not that hard, but it was extremely like, it was extremely

445
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,720
time intensive because I would have to render each individual mouth with its own video track

446
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,800
overlaid over the thing.

447
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,000
And then I would have to put them all in and then render it in, not in Vegas, but I would

448
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,160
have to render each one as like a fucking high res, like not an MP4, like a T2F or whatever.

449
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,160
And like something, something would always go wrong.

450
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,400
And it would always take me like days and days of rendering, seeing a what fucked up

451
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
this time.

452
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Okay.

453
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Got to do it again.

454
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,520
It would like, like I could explain how to do the mouth matching up thing pretty simply.

455
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,200
It's not, there's not that many steps to it.

456
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,400
It would just take forever, every time I would be enraged every single time.

457
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,880
I was like, oh, I should be done by now.

458
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm getting flustered just thinking about making those.

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,080
And there that's what I have to say about that.

460
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Fair enough.

461
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Hey, how about we sync?

462
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Why don't we sync?

463
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Oh yeah.

464
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Let's sync on the count of three.

465
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Wait, wait, wait.

466
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Is Hippo joining?

467
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
He's in the call.

468
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,240
No, he said now he'll just listen.

469
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
All right.

470
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
Okay.

471
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
On the count of three, let's say sync.

472
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Here we go.

473
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
One, two, three.

474
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Sync.

475
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
One more time.

476
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,480
One, two, three.

477
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Sync.

478
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
I remember.

479
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,080
I don't know if we're going to cut this part out or should we, I think we should just upload

480
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,280
the whole thing of this.

481
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Yeah.

482
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
This has to be the first part of the podcast.

483
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Have it cold open for us.

484
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I'm working to save up podcasts.

485
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Well, there's a point of the pre-rambled.

486
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Well, the point was it was a candid conversation that was relatively entertaining.

487
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,600
Hey, if you like what you heard so far, give us $5 on procrastinators.com slash Patreon

488
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,080
to hear the bonus episode where we do the same thing.

489
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Yeah, that's true.

490
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Donate to our PayPal.

491
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah, that's true.

492
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Appropriate plug.

493
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
I remember.

494
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,600
I had a sort of digi-style editing process when I, back when I did Armory Triple and

495
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,480
stuff like that and like Jimmy Blockets and stuff, where like most of the editing was

496
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,680
creating the image that would be on the screen.

497
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,480
And then basically like that was it, like for Armory Triple editing, here's like all

498
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,280
I did, like for like the audio editing and stuff like that was I sunk up everyone and

499
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,160
then I like I compressed the IA levels, but I probably didn't even do that right.

500
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,120
I just did it like to ear and then I exported it all in one big audio file, put that like

501
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,840
I did that on audacity, then I just put it into like a video editing thing.

502
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,320
And then I spent like two hours making an image and then just put that in there and

503
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
then it was done.

504
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Like that's all I did.

505
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,640
Like the actual like assembly and everything took maybe five minutes, maybe.

506
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
That's me.

507
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
That's me editing.

508
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Yeah, that's good.

509
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
That's good.

510
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,400
Hey, speaking of editing that took forever, you want to talk about 10 paces?

511
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Hell yeah.

512
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,120
Do you want to chat about 10 paces?

513
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Because I do it.

514
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
It was a lot of fun.

515
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
Was chipping away on that for like months.

516
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
It came out.

517
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
It was good.

518
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
You know what?

519
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Okay.

520
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I want to say it was good.

521
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Yeah, we all know that.

522
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
But I want to say how it was.

523
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Red country!

524
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
But it was pretty good.

525
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
But.

526
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Okay.

527
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
No, no, no.

528
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
That's actually the opposite.

529
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm actually just saying it was pretty good and more on top of that, actually.

530
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,120
It was actually fantastic and way better than what we recorded, I feel.

531
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,240
This was the Star Wars of our generation.

532
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,760
This made it funny, something that wasn't really funny and kind of a cluster.

533
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
When?

534
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Okay.

535
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
It really came off to me.

536
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
It felt like a real, like a TV show almost.

537
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
That's, yeah.

538
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
For sure.

539
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
When?

540
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Okay.

541
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
When?

542
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
I like the digi in the background when you guys were talking.

543
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Just slinking into the fridge and then slinking back.

544
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,720
There's a bunch of us, other people lurking in the background because we were all just

545
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,600
in the same room all the time.

546
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Okay.

547
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,520
Munchy, you and I both came up with the idea, right, Munchy?

548
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Of course.

549
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Yeah.

550
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
We like.

551
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,200
I approached you with an idea for a draw cast where we fought each other.

552
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,320
It was like a round-based thing where it's like a companion tournament thing.

553
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Yeah.

554
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,800
And then me and you just spent the first couple days of Recon 3 being like, what if, like,

555
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,240
what if, like, dude, like, what if, and then they just sprouted out of that.

556
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Good times.

557
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Good times.

558
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Yeah.

559
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,000
I remember when we were thinking of it, I wanted it to be, I just, I wanted it to be

560
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,080
like strip search.

561
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,760
I just, I wanted, I wish so hard that I could have been in strip search that I just had.

562
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,680
Strip search came up many times in the conversation.

563
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,720
That I just, I had to make my own strip search, but with me in it.

564
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,880
So I was thinking like, how, how could I make this like look and feel like strip search

565
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
felt?

566
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,440
And, and the answer was like, spend a ton of effort like trying to edit it as professionally

567
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
as possible.

568
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,200
Like I learned, I learned the master class technique of the, letting the audio lead the

569
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
cut.

570
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I learned.

571
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
That's Ben.

572
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
That's the thing I've wanted to do.

573
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,120
I've never actually done that.

574
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,080
And I was very impressed that you use that.

575
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,560
It's a pretty basic technique, but I was like, there he goes, being a real edit boy.

576
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,560
I learned that from a, oh God, in not innuendo studios, um, uh, oh fuck.

577
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Who's that?

578
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Dan Olson.

579
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
No, fuck.

580
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
There's some guy.

581
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Acroid?

582
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
No.

583
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,200
There's some fucking guy on YouTube whose videos I watch and he talks about editing

584
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,880
somewhat, um, uh, folding ideas, folding ideas, talked about letting the,

585
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Oh yes.

586
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Three arrows?

587
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
No.

588
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
The German alt left YouTuber?

589
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
No.

590
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
But he's cool too.

591
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
Um, anyway.

592
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Yeah.

593
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
So that was, yeah, that's, that's just like one weird trick.

594
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,040
That's like letting the audio leave the cut is like one weird trick that I completely abused

595
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
in like so many shots.

596
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,880
I just did the same thing over and over again.

597
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,640
I learned one weird old trick to obliterate the YouTube algorithm and shoot to the top

598
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
of the charts.

599
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,520
I'm Google searching like hot tips and tricks, how to make sexy YouTube video right now.

600
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,680
Give me 10 tips right now.

601
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,360
Let the audio leave the cut.

602
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,720
Um, you know what's embarrassing?

603
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
That's nothing else.

604
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
That's all you got.

605
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,920
You know what I just figured out about editing?

606
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,880
It's really embarrassing that it took me this many years of editing professionally to realize

607
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
this.

608
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,520
But, uh, when the, when the sound peaks and it has the red number, like the, the red

609
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:02,000
decimal number, that the decimal number is exactly as many decimals as you have to turn

610
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,160
it down to make it not peak anymore.

611
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,640
I had no idea.

612
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,840
I'm glad that, that other people besides me hadn't figured that out yet.

613
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
I don't know.

614
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,160
I know when it's red, you got to lower it to make it not peak, but.

615
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,360
I knew that when it's red, you have to lower it, but I always like just kind of did it

616
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
like blindly like an idiot.

617
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Wait, are you talking about it in Vegas?

618
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Yeah, in Vegas.

619
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Yeah, in Vegas.

620
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
Huh.

621
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,120
Like I would always, like my whole career, I've been like, ah, it's red.

622
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,800
I got to turn it down some, you know, it was always turn it down some, but like I actually

623
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,840
looked at it one day and I'm like, wait a minute.

624
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,560
There's a, there's a decimal number there.

625
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,640
I wonder if I turn it down exactly to that amount of decimal and like sure enough, it

626
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,520
tells you exactly how much you need to turn it down.

627
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,480
Maybe, maybe, maybe we're all dumb as fuck for not noticing that earlier, but.

628
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,320
I noticed the numbers.

629
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,280
I just also didn't, you know, didn't put two and two together.

630
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
That's so weird.

631
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,560
I want to continue going up to bat for, for fucking 10 bases and draw by last week.

632
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Yeah.

633
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,880
I wanted to keep coveching about how much work it was.

634
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Okay.

635
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,480
That, that right there.

636
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,440
Like sure, we can all like joke like, ha ha, it took so long, but like the actual editing

637
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,840
of it, I feel was most likely well-spent, you know.

638
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,600
It was straight up professional level editing, basically, um, unironically.

639
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,640
It's not, okay, it's not as though Ben was working on 10 paces draw for a year in the

640
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,600
sense that every day would clock in.

641
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
No.

642
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Sure.

643
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,000
How long would you say it was of actual work time?

644
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,360
Um, like combined actual work time?

645
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,960
Yeah, it might have been a hundred, a hundred, I don't know, somewhere in that ballpark.

646
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Yeah, right.

647
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
All right.

648
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,440
I put it, I put it all, I put off even starting it for a long time.

649
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Right.

650
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
That's the main thing right there.

651
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,480
I think a lot of people in the audience and just abroad may not realize this about like

652
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,160
being like an online, you know, free flowing, free form kind of guy that projects are extremely

653
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:04,720
fluid and you can, you can like be working on something for a really long time and not

654
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
drop it.

655
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,040
Just have more things take up the priority queue of your mind and therefore, and when

656
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,800
you come back to it in like two months after where people have like forgot about or think

657
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,960
you're not releasing it, but it's just you're doing other things and like, are you supposed

658
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,440
to make a Twitter post that like, hey guys, switch over to this also in the next day and

659
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,480
then I switch over to this and then I switch over to this and then, and then I came back

660
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,200
to this for a little while, you know, it's a slow grind to do some of these long, you

661
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
know, effortless projects.

662
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Yeah.

663
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,600
A lot of the time people will say like, oh, I've been working on this for years and

664
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,120
like, you know, a lot of the time it's like, well, you weren't, you weren't literally working

665
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
on it for years.

666
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,440
You like, maybe you started it years ago or you had the idea years ago and maybe you

667
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,880
worked on it some of the time and then other times you had other things that had to take

668
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,040
priority over it.

669
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,320
That being said, I just came out of a particularly grueling process making something for endless

670
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,760
war, which will be out by the time, I mean, it'll be out like, oh, was it, was it World

671
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
Famous Comic Nuts the beginning?

672
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,720
Yes, it was actually.

673
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Did you like it?

674
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,240
I made it, I made it for you.

675
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
I didn't, I was very, I wasn't very impressed.

676
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,800
It was kind of fucked up that you put that on the Patreon actually, it kind of fucked

677
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,360
up that you put that on your Patreon.

678
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, I don't, I mean, I just thought my patrons might appreciate your hard work on that one.

679
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,920
But that's the same, that's similar because, because someone, someone made, or I made the

680
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,320
joke like a month ago or more about the whole like, the difference between the timelines

681
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,600
is that real Ben St. likes salted almonds and cop, and the cop killer likes unsalted

682
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
cashews.

683
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,200
And I was like, that'd be really funny to turn into a comic where that's the joke.

684
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,320
Oh, that was the genesis, okay.

685
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,600
And so I started it like back then, and then I did a bit of it, had dropped it for some

686
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,280
other stuff, forgot about it a little bit until someone brought it.

687
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,400
And I was like, I got to finish that.

688
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,120
And then I stayed up for like two days, like a day and a half straight, like yesterday,

689
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,600
I didn't sleep, just like worked on it for the whole time, because I was, I was like,

690
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm so close.

691
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm so close to it.

692
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,120
I just got to keep going.

693
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,280
And I did, and I banged it out, and I made sweet gifts, and the art is rad at point.

694
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,120
Sometimes it's terrible, and other times it's great.

695
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,080
And I was like, job well done, and it felt good.

696
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,080
I have just gotten out of creating an update, which is fairly big.

697
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,680
I mean, there's no reason to be candid about it since they will know.

698
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
You mean a code update?

699
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah, a code update to Endless War.

700
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:28,080
It took such a frankly, like embarrassing time, it took maybe like four, no, three weeks

701
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,000
of making where I added a ton of shit, not most interesting of which, the fairy in three

702
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,880
new districts, and rebalancing and adding a lot of new flavor text for whatever, doesn't

703
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
matter.

704
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Specifics.

705
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm saying, is that-

706
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Finally, the coveted fairy.

707
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
All that is good.

708
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Finally, the fairy is running.

709
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
That is good.

710
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,080
It's been out of commission for so long.

711
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,480
But, okay, and the most weird thing about it is that I was working on it, like every

712
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,360
single day, this update ruined my latest trip to Boston, which we'll get into later.

713
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,520
Every single day, I was sick trying to work on this, just plowing through fucking dozens

714
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,760
upon dozens of flavor texts, which I didn't need to do.

715
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
This is the thing.

716
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,360
I was working hard, but I wasn't being productive.

717
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,520
What I was doing didn't fucking matter at all.

718
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm sure people will go around the district, collect on the new flavor texts, and they'll

719
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,560
be like, ha, ha, cool, does not matter at all, did not need to happen.

720
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,880
I made the actual code for everything, like first couple days, changed a little bit of

721
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
it here and there.

722
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:47,480
But actually, making the majority of every fucking, for the past five days, since I got

723
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,080
back, since I fucking got back on the 12th, literally every single day, I would get up,

724
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,800
just like work literally all day, and then turn in at night, just constantly rewriting

725
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,880
fucking, yeah, like literally five days.

726
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
It's only five days.

727
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Well, what?

728
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
Well, okay, I'll tell you what.

729
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
That's a long time.

730
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
In my mind.

731
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
This is very interesting, because I just...

732
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,880
That's a long time to be on like a 12 hour a day work schedule.

733
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Yeah.

734
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,520
Well, I mean, okay, that's interesting that you say, because I actually too, just finished.

735
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,600
It's coming out at 5 p.m. the day of recording.

736
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,080
This is my longest edited video ever that's not a lecture, and it's the Kingdom Hearts

737
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:34,920
3 Weagawa, and I put in such an absolutely unnecessary amount of effort and work into

738
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
it.

739
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,720
And the reason was because in my mind, it was easier to just go along with the tide

740
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,160
of like, look, it's already there, just like add stuff here, make a little edit there.

741
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,400
And no way was I fighting against my just desire to just add things to it.

742
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,960
For the common sense approach of like, Nate, you do not need to do all this.

743
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,480
Just make a shorter video and get it out, talk about less things.

744
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
It's fine.

745
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
You can make another video later.

746
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,720
You will make more money.

747
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,880
You will get more views.

748
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,160
People will like that better.

749
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,000
No one or less people will sit through a long video anyway, probably.

750
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,440
So just do all these good things.

751
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,680
And I even made a fucking trailer for it, which was just for fun and was dope.

752
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:22,040
But what it is, it was the capstone to the Nate Power Creep arc when it comes to Weagawa,

753
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
as I was saying before the show.

754
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,440
So you leaned into the power, wait, you mean feature creep?

755
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Well, both.

756
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,600
It's both the power creep and feature creep arc.

757
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,680
The power level has never been higher, but it needs to go back down because the bosses

758
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,520
are, we're in Dragon Ball Z levels, we're like, okay, we already know they can blow

759
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
up a planet.

760
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,320
How much more visually can you convey that this guy's way double, triple stronger than

761
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,880
the last guy was?

762
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
That's what Weagawa's become.

763
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,760
Okay, so I know what a power creep is.

764
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,920
What's that other creep?

765
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Feature creep.

766
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:56,600
It's in a game when like, it's when development just goes, just balloons out to be longer

767
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,320
and longer and longer because they just keep adding stuff, bells and whistles.

768
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,000
So you played Terraria, right?

769
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You played Terraria, right, Mage?

770
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,880
Uh, a little bit, not much.

771
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,520
Everything after hard mode is feature creep.

772
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
People will understand that.

773
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,920
I haven't played that much, but yeah.

774
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,840
Well, okay, hey, okay.

775
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,000
On the subject of Nate's power creep arc, let me just say that since, you know, this

776
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,320
is where people come and make fun of me for, you know, saying it's going to be done and

777
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
I fail.

778
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,160
I want everyone to know that I'm always telling the truth that I think that it will be done

779
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
at a certain time.

780
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,800
I'm just so fucking bad at it.

781
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,640
I'm unbelievably terrible at judging time and distance and I'm so sorry, everyone.

782
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,120
But the good news is, the good news is, this is the end of the feature creep arc of Weagua.

783
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,560
I have a new plan.

784
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:45,000
It will begin shortly and it will be, it's actually going to be bi-weekly videos is the

785
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,520
plan, not actually weekly.

786
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,880
So they'll continue to roast me for that.

787
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
But that's fine.

788
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:56,360
The point is, regular content, not like this, uh, Radcom pre-stuff, Weagabwa, but that just

789
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
doesn't sound as good.

790
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,200
I'll, maybe I'll make like a meme at it where I just put like a B before the W or something.

791
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I don't know.

792
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Weagabwa.

793
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Weagabwa.

794
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Weagabwa.

795
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
All right.

796
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Not bad.

797
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Not bad.

798
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,040
You know, I have a criticism about the 10 paces and draw and I brought this up in the

799
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,640
chat, but I guess I'll bring it up on the show so people can hear it and weigh in on

800
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,120
it or whatever the fuck.

801
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,720
And I can, I can criticize it because I wasn't in the video, so it's worthless to me indeed.

802
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,320
And this is a direct result of how well it's edited.

803
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,280
Um, I noticed that when you have it, please don't say the music's too loud, please don't

804
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
say the music's too loud.

805
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,720
The music was a bit loud there, Ben.

806
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Wait, was it actually though?

807
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
It was a little bit.

808
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
A little bit.

809
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
A little bit.

810
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I tried to watch it on my phone, but I couldn't hear it.

811
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
I don't get it.

812
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
I don't fucking get it.

813
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,840
It does not sound too loud to me at all.

814
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,000
And some, what did you use to, Ben, what were you listening to when you listened to it

815
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,200
on headphones and on speakers, both?

816
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,680
You might have bad headphones.

817
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,040
Also, your, your judgment might have been off because you were like in it and you weren't

818
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,720
seeing it from the perspective of a, I mean, I tried turning the volume down and like,

819
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,400
I didn't want it to be too quiet because if it's too quiet, then it doesn't contribute

820
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
to the atmosphere.

821
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,720
Like the point of the music is to build atmosphere.

822
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,840
I know the struggle, Ben.

823
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
I know the struggle.

824
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
I understand.

825
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,120
But anyway, we interrupted Jesse, but yeah, please continue.

826
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:21,240
My actual criticism was is that because you have a show with the, the really good lighting,

827
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,600
the really good house set that we had, Victor's camera work, everything looks great and the

828
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
editing was so professional.

829
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, I think I know what you're going to say.

830
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,160
And it looked like a real show and because everything about it was so good and clean

831
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,480
and nice looking, it only makes it all the more jarring that half the cast is dressed

832
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,880
like complete slobs in bathrooms and pajamas.

833
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,600
I'm wearing pajama pants, Digi's in his like robe.

834
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
I mean, Nate looks fine.

835
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Ben, did you see?

836
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
I think the pajamas.

837
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,680
The pajamas and bathrobe arc needs to end for the PCP.

838
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,080
Oh, I want to quickly say, I liked, I liked, I liked Hippo's sweater so much, I forgot

839
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,840
to comment, but I liked his sweater so much, he's such a cute sweater.

840
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Hippo looked fine.

841
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Well, okay.

842
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Hippo looked fine.

843
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Tom looked fine.

844
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Nate looked okay.

845
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Everyone else.

846
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
I was looking good.

847
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
I was, I was in my, Ben, were you?

848
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Are you aware?

849
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Come on.

850
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Okay.

851
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
That's iconic.

852
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Everyone loves that.

853
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Are you aware of the emergence of the dye, like the diverged timeline character that

854
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:22,480
is the, the, the earth shattering meta rebalancing character that is fat Ben.

855
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,840
The people love fat Ben, they want fat Ben from sea to shining sea.

856
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,480
And frankly, we want this current Ben out the window, we want fat Ben back.

857
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,000
I fucking killed fat Ben.

858
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,640
I look so, I hate how I look in that video so bad.

859
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
I'm so fat.

860
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,600
My hair is like, my hair looks shit and only accentuates my giant forehead to an embarrassing

861
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
degree.

862
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,920
I've got like, I've got jowls.

863
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,680
I'm like, I'm not clean, I'm not clean shaven, but I don't have the beard.

864
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,920
So I just, my face just looks like, I look like pale and like jaundiced and just, just

865
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,560
scruffy, but not in a cool, scruffy way.

866
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,880
I don't remember why I clicked on it, but the other day I happened to be watching the,

867
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,280
the old, uh, TBAP Q and A video.

868
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Oh, the, where were you?

869
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
That was great.

870
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
What a beautiful voice.

871
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,560
And I was just thinking, who is this beautiful man?

872
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Yeah.

873
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
And where did his beard go?

874
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,640
When was he killed and replaced by the monster Ben saint?

875
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,480
TBAP, TBAP, TBAP Q and A Ben, he's coming back.

876
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm actually better.

877
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,960
He's actually, he's coming back, but better cause now I look, I look handsome, but I also

878
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
look like a freak now.

879
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Oh yeah.

880
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
I was going to ask about the haircut.

881
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Yeah.

882
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Yeah.

883
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
I was going to ask about the haircut.

884
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,280
It has the hair grown in a little bit.

885
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
It's, yeah.

886
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,000
I mean, it's still short on the side, but it's not like, you look older now.

887
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,360
You look older and less like an adult paradoxically now.

888
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
That's, you know.

889
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,760
Well, you mean in the, in the, in the 10 paces?

890
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,320
Uh, no, now.

891
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Just in general.

892
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,760
Just in older and let, yeah.

893
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Okay.

894
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
I'll take that.

895
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I mean, that was funny.

896
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Oh my God.

897
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
I take it back.

898
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,280
Your beard is so full and your hair is so kimp and you're wearing that plaid.

899
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Isn't he a handsome boy though?

900
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Yeah.

901
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
My beard is not back.

902
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,360
It's not as long as it was in that one, but it's, it's getting there.

903
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
I straight up think.

904
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,920
Ben and I will look back.

905
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,800
Uh, and I mean, you can right now, that Q and A video is what changed everything for

906
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
us.

907
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,760
If we had not made that one video, we probably never would have met like the rest of you

908
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
guys.

909
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
It changed everything.

910
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
It did.

911
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
It straight up changed everything.

912
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
And you know what it comes down to?

913
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,040
It's the fact that we were hot guys, work on your parents, it matters.

914
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,520
Being attractive goes so far in life.

915
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Don't give up on yourself.

916
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Look how far we've all fallen.

917
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I know.

918
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Look how I used to look.

919
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
I love myself.

920
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,760
I love myself too, but I'm back on track now.

921
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
I'm back right before I came on this podcast.

922
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,600
I was at, I've got a new gym membership, 10 minutes down the street from my current apartment.

923
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,520
I was there and because I worked out first thing in the morning, this is the secret

924
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,440
to life because I worked out before I did anything else.

925
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,000
I come home and I'm like, well, I'm not wasting this.

926
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,240
This day is going to be perfect.

927
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,320
So I get my fuel.

928
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
I get my protein powder.

929
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,800
I'm going to go have a fucking salad when we're done here.

930
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,080
Start your day off right people and you'll do no wrong.

931
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,720
Hey, I'm eating a salad right now.

932
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,920
You can probably hear me munching on this fucking rabbit food in an American phone.

933
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Hell yeah.

934
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
I just, that's what I like to hear.

935
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
I feel good.

936
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
I feel good knowing.

937
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm very confident in this that like you look at T-Bab Q&A Ben, you look at Radcon 3

938
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,360
Ben, basically a complete 180.

939
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Fat Ben.

940
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Please call him by his proper name.

941
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Fat Ben.

942
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Yeah.

943
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Well, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm happy to say.

944
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Old Fish Ben.

945
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Present Ben.

946
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Modern Day Ben.

947
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,040
Current Ben that sits before you right now is much closer to T-Bab Q&A Ben than to Fat

948
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Ben.

949
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
That's pretty cool.

950
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,160
T-Bab Q&A aesthetic is what I want for 10 paces in draw and all future professional

951
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
production.

952
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,200
I actually, I actually fit into that shirt once more.

953
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Finally.

954
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Congratulations.

955
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Thank you.

956
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
God yeah.

957
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:59,640
It is, it is so emotionally painful for me to watch videos of myself from like 2012

958
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,640
or like 2011 and just seeing like, like I watch videos of me from that time period and think

959
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,800
I have never seen a more handsome man in my fucking life.

960
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Where did he go?

961
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
What happened?

962
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
That's how I felt.

963
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
That's how I felt looking at T-Bab Q&A Ben.

964
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
And I know what happened.

965
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
I met you guys.

966
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
The PCP was created.

967
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,960
This, this coalition came together and sucked the life out of every one of us individually

968
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,720
to add to the hideous collective like an Akira blob destroying all in its path growing more

969
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,440
and more grotesque by the minute.

970
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Can I just make a quick point?

971
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
I've reversed the trend.

972
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Ben's.

973
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
Ben's.

974
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,520
I just want to point out the shirt that I'm wearing into T-Bab Q&A is the same shirt that

975
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,360
I'm wearing in 10 paces in draw though like gray and black striped horizontal stripes.

976
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
It's the same shirt.

977
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Glowing, aren't you?

978
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
I'm, I'm a perfect man.

979
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
That's my point.

980
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
That's what I'm trying to say.

981
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:00,240
Oh, speaking, speaking of you, in my enemy group, we watched Zambieland Saga.

982
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,480
We finished Zambieland Saga and we, we, we, we, we dubbed, yeah, we, we dubbed that guy

983
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,560
Anonite because it's literally just you.

984
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
You should watch it.

985
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Haven't watched it?

986
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
You should watch it.

987
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
I, I, I certainly intend to.

988
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
I certainly intend to.

989
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

990
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
We love that guy.

991
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
He's a good guy.

992
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
He's better than you.

993
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
But it is you.

994
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
So it's like.

995
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Doubtful.

996
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Oh, is he the guy in like the suit?

997
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Yeah, he wears like the glasses and shit.

998
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,120
I mean, I haven't seen Zambieland Saga, but I think I've seen the character posted with

999
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Nate comparisons.

1000
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Yes.

1001
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Um, yeah.

1002
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,040
Um, I wish I watched television shows.

1003
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,560
I only watch YouTube videos now.

1004
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
I've been thinking.

1005
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Oh, you're missing out.

1006
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
TV rules.

1007
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
I've been thinking about this.

1008
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,060
I've been thinking about that.

1009
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,200
And yeah, for, sometimes I think, man, I don't watch Netflix.

1010
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,800
I don't watch Marvel movies.

1011
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,960
I don't watch Disney movies.

1012
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,560
I don't, I'm like, I'm like a, I like, I like, don't participate in the culture and

1013
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,520
it's hamstringing my social life.

1014
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,840
But then I was like, wait, maybe I should just lean into it and be like, I don't watch

1015
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,560
Disney shit because corporations control our lives and I won't fucking be subject to

1016
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,840
their, to their whims.

1017
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
I won't fucking let them.

1018
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,240
I want to think that hard about the Shiki Watch though.

1019
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,400
But well, I mean, it's okay because I'm not naturally inclined to watch any of these things.

1020
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,280
So maybe I should just lean into, maybe I should just lean into that tendency.

1021
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Disney's going to own every entertainment property before too long because that's straight

1022
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
up the way they're going.

1023
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,840
There's just absorbing everything.

1024
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Yeah.

1025
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,440
I mean, there's a, there's a couple others that they get their, that they get their

1026
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,640
mitts on will be the procrastinators and the whole thing that they'll never get their

1027
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
hands on.

1028
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,240
We will stand against the, we will be David fighting against that Goliath.

1029
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,040
And in that day, our one ally will be the one podcast that cannot be found, the pizza

1030
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
party podcast.

1031
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,480
And if we will be able to fall, we'll be unwilling allies.

1032
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
Where's the podcast?

1033
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Cause we need to team up.

1034
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,240
We need to find them and team up against Disney.

1035
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
Exactly.

1036
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
We need, we need allies.

1037
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,840
Ben, I want to team up this weird meme is going to end with Ben loving the pizza party

1038
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
podcast.

1039
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,640
If only I could find them, maybe I would love them.

1040
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Who knows.

1041
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,040
I was saying that I want to watch more like topical shows and get on that rich deep fandom.

1042
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:22,160
I just meant that, uh, anime is, you know, honestly through through my travels with Chibi

1043
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,240
Baka's, you know, they're actually, it's, it means kind of good, you know, you're a

1044
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,040
guy, you're a guy that I think I'm in the generally the same category of maybe a little

1045
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,840
bit less these days, but like, uh, there's like most anime is trash.

1046
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,000
So just watch the good ones and people will tell you what the good ones are.

1047
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,040
And that's what Chibi Baka should be in, you know, I mean, that's what I've been doing

1048
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
for years.

1049
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Classics.

1050
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Yeah.

1051
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
I've never seen cowboy bbop.

1052
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
I've never seen.

1053
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
It's worth it.

1054
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
Efficio.

1055
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Or it's sequel cowboy rock study.

1056
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
Yeah.

1057
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
Woo.

1058
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,040
That's for the, that's for the, that's for the millennial.

1059
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
Oh, no, no.

1060
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
I mean, Nate's not millennial.

1061
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
He doesn't seem Doug.

1062
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,040
He doesn't know about Bluffington.

1063
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
I know Doug and I know Bluffington.

1064
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
No.

1065
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,040
Well, obviously not.

1066
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
Cause you're about Don Tello.

1067
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Don Tello.

1068
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Look, I'm crazy for this fucking pizza.

1069
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,040
Hey, hey, let me just take a moment to wish everybody a happy St. Patrick's Day.

1070
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody.

1071
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Today's St. Patrick's Day.

1072
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Today, the day of recording is St. Patrick's Day.

1073
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Oh yeah.

1074
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,040
For us, for people, it's been like a week now.

1075
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,040
Does England care about St. Patrick at all?

1076
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
Or is he an Irish rebel?

1077
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,040
It's a bad man.

1078
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,040
I don't know.

1079
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
I stay at home every day.

1080
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,040
They do.

1081
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
What do I must say?

1082
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Well, hey, let me tell you a story.

1083
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,040
I was in, I was in Ireland for St. Patrick's Day.

1084
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,040
Oh shit.

1085
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,040
God, maybe like.

1086
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,040
Don't they turn the rivers green?

1087
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,040
Oh wait, that's Boston.

1088
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,040
Like six years ago or something?

1089
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,040
I don't know.

1090
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,040
It was however many years ago I was over there.

1091
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,040
You know, it's different.

1092
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,040
The funny thing about St. Patrick's Day in Ireland is it's a much more, it's more, well,

1093
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,040
it's kind of split in two.

1094
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,040
The natives.

1095
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,040
It's spiritual or something.

1096
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,040
It's more laid back and it's more of like a religious holiday.

1097
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
I mean, it's not like super, but somewhat.

1098
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,040
And like the natives, you know, they'll go out to a bar, they'll be with their friends

1099
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,040
and family.

1100
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,040
The tourists, the tourists in fucking Dublin in like the tourist section of, did you know

1101
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,040
that like the like quote unquote like historical district of Dublin is like a construction.

1102
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,040
Like it was built like relatively recently, but built in like an old timey looking cobblestone

1103
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,040
way to like look like what people imagine when they think of like jolly old Dublin or whatever.

1104
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
I was unaware of that.

1105
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,040
It's like a tourist construction.

1106
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,040
Ireland is like, it's driven by the tourism industry.

1107
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
They got like fucking tour buses running around.

1108
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
They got with leprechauns on the side.

1109
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:49,040
Everything's owned by Guinness confirms in the chat that St. Patrick's Day is a quirky

1110
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,040
thing in England.

1111
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
But everyone likes bear.

1112
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Okay.

1113
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
So there you go.

1114
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,040
It's the English perspective.

1115
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,040
Yeah.

1116
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,040
It's it's it's not like in America.

1117
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,040
I think it's bigger in America.

1118
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
Isn't it?

1119
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,040
People go nuts.

1120
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,040
Well, I mean, it's more of like, I mean, it's like a party holiday for adults.

1121
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,040
It's like a party holiday in America.

1122
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah.

1123
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
See, I don't, I don't drink alcohol.

1124
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,040
So it's not a, it's not a big deal for me.

1125
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Yeah.

1126
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
That's, that's, that's, that's how we do it.

1127
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
I do like a raucous atmosphere, though.

1128
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
I like people having a good time.

1129
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
I do too.

1130
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,040
I feel like a raucous caucus.

1131
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,040
Yeah.

1132
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
That's why we're going to the Capitol, baby.

1133
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
Gonna shoot up the Senate.

1134
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
Wait.

1135
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Whoa.

1136
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
That's not what I meant to say.

1137
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
Head on over to the PCP store.

1138
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,040
Buy your I'm the reason people are dying shirt.

1139
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
Link links below.

1140
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
No math shootings.

1141
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,040
That's not what I actually meant to say.

1142
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,040
I meant to say, well, I go have fun with the Senate.

1143
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
I love my elected representatives.

1144
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,040
No one's going to believe that you were trying to say,

1145
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,040
let's have fun with the Senate.

1146
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,040
But you said, let's shoot up the Capitol.

1147
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
Those are not the same thing.

1148
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
People are on edge these days.

1149
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,040
It's like one letters difference.

1150
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
Take Donald Trump on a night out.

1151
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
I'd, I'd chill with Donald Trump.

1152
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,040
I'd get blasted on ghetto blasters with the DT boy.

1153
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
This is a perfect segue.

1154
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
Because.

1155
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,040
Yeah.

1156
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Yeah.

1157
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,040
And then I'll segue.

1158
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,040
Okay.

1159
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,040
Okay.

1160
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,040
Just real quick.

1161
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,040
Cause I don't want to ruin your segue.

1162
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,040
Just ruin my fucking segue.

1163
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,040
I'll stop between two worlds, a world of darkness and light.

1164
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,040
And I'm calm between my ethnic father and my peer,

1165
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,040
Boston Irish mother.

1166
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,040
So whenever she, if I'm around,

1167
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,040
she flips on the Irish accent and incredibly raciously and pretends

1168
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
that we are Irish even though,

1169
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,040
is that true?

1170
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,040
Yeah.

1171
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Yeah.

1172
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
Okay, listen, we are Irish,

1173
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
but that does not matter.

1174
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
And Irish people aren't distinct or like,

1175
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:44,880
Or like different in real life. So like like guys, we're so fucking Irish. Let's go to the pub

1176
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:51,040
Let's go in Irish. Let's get some corned beef and cabbage. That's that's the American way to do it

1177
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,760
I don't know if Irish people aren't distinctive enough

1178
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,800
Maybe you're just not Irish. I mean cuz my family is pretty stereotypically Irish in every conceivable way

1179
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,320
Well, what do you got you got drunkenness?

1180
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,640
You got I don't know. I have blue collar. I don't know. I have ten aunts and uncles. They're all alcoholics

1181
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,520
They're all rage-fueled maniacs. Most of them are deeply religious so far so good in in in Ireland. I I

1182
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,160
Was at a pub. I was in an Irish pub and I talked to a girl

1183
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
and

1184
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:30,360
She was a native and I remember asking her if she spoke Irish and she said no and she seemed annoyed

1185
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,720
I think she seemed annoyed by the question like maybe there's Irish isn't a fucking language

1186
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,320
It is a fucking language. Yeah, then there's the Celtic that there's Celtic

1187
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,880
I think you're supposed to call it Irish called Gaelic

1188
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,760
But it's there's that'd be fucking gay though

1189
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,560
When I was there people told me don't call it, you know Celtic or Gaelic just call it Irish

1190
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,760
Yeah, and I so I was like, okay

1191
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,960
And I asked someone if they spoke Irish and she said no and I think she was annoyed

1192
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,080
I didn't mean to imply this but I think maybe she thought that it was like sort of derogatory to even ask the question because the answer

1193
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,120
Is no because it was like implicitly saying like oh, you're not real Irish

1194
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,560
I wasn't trying to imply that at all, but I think she was annoyed by it anyway

1195
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:16,520
Fair enough. It might also be because she gets asked the question a lot, and it's just annoying after a while

1196
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,640
Maybe yeah, maybe probably or it could be that right after that you asked her where she keeps her lucky charms

1197
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,400
I'm always after those lucky charms

1198
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:40,420
So I'm entitled to a quarter of the pot the Welsh and the Irish make you so fucking upset trying to pretend like England like

1199
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:45,280
Isn't there like their hegemon and trying to pretend like they're their own distinct countries?

1200
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:54,480
I know I know listen the troubles are coming back, and I'm clearly on the fucking Union inside right fucking

1201
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,960
Okay, so here's so I'm imagining that like in England

1202
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:04,320
You probably you got you got Wales you got Scotland you got I don't know fucking Denmark or whatever the fuck else they got

1203
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:11,480
And and like every single one of those is their Texas like always like griping and

1204
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:20,920
They're gonna see one of these days. Oh my god. That's okay. I really like England for England. Just has like four Texas's

1205
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:29,400
Ireland has enough to that I get it that they you know don't want to be in the best you know empire in the world for some reason

1206
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,360
Wait, wait, but Ireland actually is Ireland is its own country. No, yeah, I know Northern Ireland is part of the UK

1207
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:41,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right anyway, but the Welsh have no excuse and it makes me so fucking mad

1208
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,800
And pretend like they're different they try they are different goddamn, but they've got a dude

1209
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,320
They've got a Welsh accent. It's totally unique and different and I don't know

1210
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,680
They were literally part of England for like like like like hundreds of years

1211
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,600
They were literally okay

1212
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,040
Listen to this though the best thing that ever happened for the Welsh identity was in Xenoblade Chronicles 2

1213
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,760
many of the characters have Welsh accents specifically and

1214
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,600
Minj posting minj posting will save the Welsh identity and what Minj posting is

1215
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:19,960
There is a character named Nia in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 who is a cat girl with a Welsh accent as many of the characters do but especially her and

1216
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,760
In one of her costumes. She has okay

1217
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,600
Stick with me here

1218
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,280
She's wearing a pretty revealing outfit. Does she have the dragon? Does she have the Welsh dragon on our no what she has?

1219
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,040
What she has is a it's a patch of like it's like mesh or something

1220
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,880
Directly above her crotch where you can like you can see her belly button

1221
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,840
So you know it's flesh and you can see her skin and you can see the like lack of pubic hair

1222
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,760
And this is what's known as minj posting to draw attention to the fact that you can see so closely

1223
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,680
To where her pubic hair would be visible and you can almost get a glimpse of that minj

1224
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:02,120
So I'm just saying this horrible work has saved the Welsh identity for generations to come

1225
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,000
I need to clarify something I need to clarify something

1226
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:12,760
This is not me saying that all like European or like English-speaking Europeans are the same

1227
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:18,400
I'm just saying that England is the best one. So you should try and gravitate towards it culturally

1228
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,360
Okay, listen, all right, okay

1229
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,760
I take back what I originally I take back what I originally said the troubles not coming back, you know, Ireland sure

1230
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,760
I just hate the Welsh is what I'm trying to say

1231
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:37,720
Cuz they fucking don't cuz they fucking don't not trying to say anything controversial here. I just fuck fuck those guys

1232
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:44,440
Can we get some Welsh voice mails, please? I want to hear the where Welsh defend their I don't know ethnic or cultural

1233
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,680
Identity they have language well Welsh like is a language and it's fucking

1234
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,360
It's literally stupid

1235
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,400
This I mean I mean last episode we had maids tell those hateful bigoted jokes and this

1236
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,840
Luckily at the same time a Jesse clarified that racism is in fact over so there's no need to worry about it anymore

1237
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,840
The list of countries and people who I hate unequivocally and you can't become cool if you're from them

1238
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,760
If you're if you're Welsh or if you're Spanish, I will fucking obliterate you your countries are shit

1239
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,560
And I hate them Mexico cool Spain toilet. Yeah

1240
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,680
That's yeah

1241
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,760
But what about what about Catalonia, what about Barcelona that place is cool

1242
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:07,200
I want to mix in with the local color the ruffians and the rowdies, you know, it's it's rowdy central in Barcelona

1243
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
That's not true

1244
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,200
By the way

1245
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,680
Yeah, okay, go on I'm saying is that your Welsh go back to Argentina

1246
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,920
Fair and as always munchy so

1247
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,960
Okay, back to my perfect segue an hour ago. Wait. Let me first before you say it

1248
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, we've got new t-shirts people buy the group piss t-shirt because it's dope is I made I made the group this t-shirt because I need more

1249
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:43,760
This was a you know, I mean I made I made the group piss image for a banner and I thought I'd make a pretty dope shirt

1250
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,120
And I was right. He was so right. We all love it. I want one

1251
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,680
I might get one. I know what people should do

1252
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,000
I have a p.o. Box open people buy me the group piss shirt and send it to my p.o. Box

1253
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,260
I'd really appreciate what size shirt you wear medium medium. Yeah, yeah

1254
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,800
There you go. I actually made a shirt

1255
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,920
I made a shirt. I'm not selling it because I would have felt weird selling it

1256
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,280
But I made a shirt to celebrate my new meme

1257
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,440
And my new meme is yang gang. I am yang gang now

1258
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,920
Yeah, no, I own it listen that invented

1259
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,920
Yang is stealing other people's jokes and memes for his t-shirt scam. Yeah

1260
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,200
Yang yang is my new keto is what I'm saying

1261
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,240
This is my new thing that I will talk interminably about and ruin everyone's good time

1262
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,560
Okay, I'm about to start a fucking wildfire right now because I'm literally gonna ask this question

1263
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,880
I mean like I literally don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah is Andrew. Yeah

1264
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,640
You don't even want to know

1265
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,780
I was I was waiting for I've been waiting for this

1266
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,540
Can I just say can I just say I knew you were gonna bring this up and in preparation

1267
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:56,720
I went and listened excuse me to large segments of the Joe Rogan podcast with Andrew Yang

1268
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,000
In preparation to discuss this topic. Okay. Okay. I I listen to that. I listen to that podcast

1269
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,880
I listen to I spent literally hours. I spent out. I was like all night. I had like yang shit on in the

1270
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,120
I had yang shit playing in the back. I listen intently. I'm a yang scholar now

1271
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,600
Okay, Benza yang man. Benza

1272
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:22,240
I am a yang man hashtag. Yeah, I'm I'm with I mean I'm a yang man in the yang gang. Okay, please start like that

1273
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:30,480
I don't know anything about I could not I could could not possibly have wished for for more

1274
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,880
Well, he's a he's an entrepreneur

1275
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240
He he worked with the Obama

1276
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,240
He was recognized, okay, he was recognized by the Obama administration

1277
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,280
He wasn't like a cabinet member, but he was like involved with with the the

1278
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:52,400
Advisor, I think yeah, he was he was named like a an ambassador like a technology or an entrepreneurial ambassador or something like that

1279
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:02,880
So well his yeah, well his thing is automation his he like he's he's with like Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and

1280
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:08,200
Other technocrats and saying that like automation is like it's you know, it's replacing the need for work

1281
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,280
It's replacing the need for workers. It's taking jobs

1282
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:16,400
And the solution to it the solution to automation taking jobs is

1283
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,960
What he calls the freedom dividend or a universal basic income for American citizens

1284
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:29,240
So this is the meme everyone ever if he's president every American regardless of how rich or poor you are will get a thousand dollars

1285
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,880
Every month and the way that it's paid for is with it with something called a value-added tax

1286
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,400
Which like most country including all of the EU already have a value-added tax and we don't

1287
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,880
And by their cucks and by and by the way

1288
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,800
Amazon paid zero dollars in taxes last year Amazon made 11 billion dollars and paid nothing in taxes

1289
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,080
But do you know why that is because they're criminals?

1290
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,720
What incorrect then because yeah, yeah, I know it's legal

1291
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:02,920
I know it's legal, but that means but that means that the law but I know it's legal, but that means the laws are broken

1292
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:09,360
But if you if you start if you start a political debate, I'll start talking about dreams and I ain't gonna stop

1293
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,720
Hey, I solved politics on the last episode

1294
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,480
I just I just want to get to the end I want to get to the end of it

1295
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,320
So the idea is that like automation and stuff takes you know, it's taking a lot of jobs

1296
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,920
It's generating huge amount of wealth for people like

1297
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,120
Bezos for example, so those corporations that are benefiting from

1298
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,800
Automation they'll pay a value-added tax less than what Europe charges for a similar thing like half of what Europe already imposes

1299
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,880
But that will pay for this freedom dividend

1300
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,640
So as these like, you know technocrats and tech companies are making huge amounts of money

1301
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,480
They'll be taxed on their profits derived largely from automation and it'll be shared with you know

1302
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:57,360
The American people including workers that are displaced by said animation and the idea is that automation should like make life better

1303
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,560
For everyone so like as automation is is implemented, you know

1304
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,200
The need for work decreases because robots are fucking taking on the workload

1305
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,920
So everyone, you know shares in the benefits that automation brings to our lives and so

1306
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,920
One second one second. So wait

1307
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,840
What the only proposed way to

1308
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:24,400
Pay for this universal basic income is to add more taxes and not to remove anything else. It's about well

1309
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,400
I don't recommend it's not replacing any like current social welfare systems

1310
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,960
But like people shut up

1311
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,640
But like people that are already getting like welfare and stuff like they won't they won't get a thousand dollars on top of what they're

1312
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,600
Already getting it'll be like you can get the thousand dollars or you can get what you're currently getting from welfare system

1313
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,080
So just that that's true Ben

1314
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,960
But I because I just listened to it as well. It is actually it's true that he he doesn't think this should

1315
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,320
I don't believe he thinks that just that is enough to cover the entire okay, so he said right so right now

1316
00:59:54,320 --> 01:00:01,200
There's three hundred million so that makes the basically if you just round off the extra people or whatever the UBI total payment per year

1317
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,200
Would be three trillion dollars, but not really

1318
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,440
That was it's actually more like so much money. It's 1.8 trillion would be the cost

1319
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,560
Oh, I remember him saying 1.5. So so fair enough and that's because munchie. What he was saying was that like

1320
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:21,120
Every every the we currently pay about 1.5 trillion is what I heard

1321
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:27,440
Maybe it's less or whatever in current like subsidies for like welfare and I don't know like food stamps like that that kind of stuff

1322
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,840
Yeah, so that the unemployment all that stuff. So so that's fair

1323
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:38,480
And so it's all about you got to make up that oh right and so as Ben was saying if you currently get benefits that are that exceed or

1324
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:45,560
Equal the thousand dollars if this is implemented and you just keep those you're currently if you're currently getting 500 a month from benefits

1325
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,600
Then you can get an extra 500 to make up the different like like the floor is a thousand

1326
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,960
And you you can get more if you're currently getting more then they'll just leave it at that is what he said

1327
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,400
So the idea is not it's yeah

1328
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,760
It's it's not as expensive as it seems on the face

1329
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,600
But because not because lots of people are already getting benefits

1330
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:09,440
So like the the actual cost for it will be about the I heard him quote like it's somewhere between

1331
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,000
Sometimes he said like less than two sometimes it's one and one and a half

1332
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:19,440
I think it's somewhere around 1.8 trillion to be the total cost current American like the the spending of America per year is like

1333
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,880
20 trillion so this is not like

1334
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,640
Outlandish increase, but like the difference is gonna get made up in this value added tax is the now

1335
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,920
Let me say this Ben

1336
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,560
Because I think you'll find me more warm to this idea than that then people might have expected

1337
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,160
Yeah, cuz UBI has a lot of benefits and when I really think about

1338
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:44,960
Okay, okay, so like automation is coming and the the predictors that like many many people are doing because Yang seems to be correct about this

1339
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,280
That's in I believe they said by 2030

1340
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:55,600
This number varies a lot, but the kind of jobs that like 50% of Americans do will be gone

1341
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:01,760
Yeah, by 2030 like like I mean he has like a list that he goes through. It's like truckers

1342
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,080
food service workers

1343
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,800
Retail workers like just just for the sake of people call center worker call center workers

1344
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:14,760
Yeah, like these like 15% of jobs in America are automatable and they might just go away anytime for people to

1345
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,400
latch on to in 29 states in America being a trucker is the most common job and those when we

1346
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,160
Automated I know it's shocking isn't that insane, but by the time

1347
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:33,480
And when those all get automated automated away those people will be out of luck and they'll be out of jobs and people

1348
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,320
Like to lean into the whole retraining thing. Yeah, that is that is a very low success rate

1349
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:44,420
It has been it's a low success rate and people say learn to code like all these truckers are gonna get they're just gonna

1350
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,720
You know become software programmers like only only 8% of job

1351
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,120
I'm just quoting a lot of shit that he says in interviews

1352
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,360
He repeats a lot of these talking points a lot as any politician has to it's like

1353
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:02,720
8% of the jobs in America are like in STEM fields and like so you can't you can't re-educate

1354
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,740
92% of

1355
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:11,100
Americans to do what 8% of Americans are currently have it's like it just does and where were those jobs even come from

1356
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:19,020
You don't really got to learn to code you can just write it in the back of your hand up up down down left right left

1357
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,220
Yang will give every American 30 extra lives

1358
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,580
I'll find this meme and I'll post it

1359
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:34,020
But there's a good meme of the guy with his girl looking over his shoulder at another girl

1360
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:40,660
And it's he's with his girl that's Donald Trump face and it says America going to shit looking over a shoulder at hot girl

1361
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:45,340
With Yang's face that says America going to shit. I'm conflicted plus one thousand dollars these memes now

1362
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:53,580
Comparing Yang with Trump. He's really no similarity or almost actually so there's a couple with like their arbitrary like yeah

1363
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,420
They're both entrepreneurs. I guess okay

1364
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:59,380
Well, the reason why this is here is the like how I first heard about Yang

1365
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,980
Yeah, okay first time on Joe Rogan

1366
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:06,980
but the Yang meme has been popularized by people on the far right who believed in Donald Trump and

1367
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:12,180
Currently think that the world is going to shit. Maybe not even a far right. I don't whatever people can speak for themselves

1368
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,940
it seems to be a right-wing thing though and

1369
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:20,860
They think that the world is going to shit Trump has not solved the issue that they hoped would solve and so imagine that and

1370
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:24,620
So so they say Yang obviously he's the opposite of Trump in a lot of ways

1371
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,780
So they it's accelerationism. They want to vote for Yang

1372
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:33,620
I just fuck up America so we can just get this whole like that makes me so

1373
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:42,100
Mad by the way that that acceleration is so funny Ben. It's so funny laugh every time accelerationists are I

1374
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:49,260
There's I mean, they're the ultimate black pill. It's so fucking. It's such like fucking high school nihilism bullshit

1375
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,740
I mean, we don't need to get into this too much

1376
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:56,900
But that black like accelerationism was absolutely the motivation of the New Zealand shooter guy. It's that kind of thought process

1377
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,460
That's why it makes me fucking mad

1378
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,460
Sorry, so accelerationists. Yeah

1379
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,260
It's the idea that like the world is fucked so we need to fuck it more

1380
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:15,300
We need to fuck it as much as possible and faster to lead to like the cataclysm that will like just lead to be rebuilding

1381
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:20,660
Everything from the ground up. Yeah. Yeah, and so people like the people who are on the on the right or whatever

1382
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:25,380
They think that the world is drifting hopelessly into like a spiral of leftism whether you believe they're not whatever like

1383
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,940
Let's just make that happen really fast because they believe the world will collapse under that and then they can rebuild

1384
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:36,660
You know, maybe some right-wing conservative or objectivist utopia. Whatever. I want to say one more thing about the UBI Alaska already does it

1385
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,980
Did you hear that?

1386
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,100
Yeah, because they've got those oil riches

1387
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,820
But you know what citizens in Alaska already get free money, okay

1388
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:50,100
Here's the government for the the oil that they're coming so like the idea. It's like we are we're already doing it to a second

1389
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:55,740
I haven't a collusion about this. Okay, and here's what it is. Look. I still unironically think taxationist theft

1390
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:59,840
I just we should do it anyway. We should do it anyway

1391
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:05,020
All right, and I guess I agree. I'm on your side. Okay. Here's that well

1392
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,000
Here's the thing. I'm on your side when it comes to this automation issue

1393
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,380
I see no alternative, but to basically do what Yang's proposing. Yeah, but the caveats I have are I

1394
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,980
Don't think we should okay

1395
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:22,960
I need I need real facts and logic to show me that like the rates that we're talking about now like

1396
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,720
To have it in 2030 when we're in that world that makes a lot of sense to do it at that

1397
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:33,640
But we don't but it's already happening like people we should ease into it just as it's people are already

1398
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,480
I mean we might we might do more we'll probably have to do more in the future

1399
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,440
But like it's already happening. So why do we not all right? We should all right? We should start correcting for it now

1400
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,020
Okay

1401
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:47,520
Well, that's if we do it too late then like that's terrible. I'm with you

1402
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,080
I'm with you

1403
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:54,080
We should probably lean a little bit more into doing it than to not and just like let the people suffer because I think that could

1404
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,880
Cause serious fucking collapse of so this guy's like 50% of America had no job

1405
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,680
We so this guy is like the opposite of Trump is what you're saying. Yeah

1406
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,880
So in a sense this is made you in a sense Donald Trump is the yin to his yang

1407
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,440
Damn damn. That's good. Um, have you seen the meme? This is my I like

1408
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,520
Have mixed feelings about the Trump comparisons

1409
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,200
But there's a mean of like it's four panels and it's a guy in a met

1410
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,640
It's the what's that like sad face guy, you know the one that I know

1411
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,760
Yeah, it's feel it's feel guy

1412
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,680
But like yeah, he's red and his eyes are bulging and he's crying angry tears

1413
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,320
Yes, and he's got the MAGA hat on and in four panels

1414
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:42,920
He just fades into his MAGA hat fades into the yang gang 2020 hat and he just just smiling gently

1415
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,000
And then in the last panel, it's a little thousand dollar bill. It's like, yeah

1416
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,960
That one makes me that one cracks me the fuck up. By the way, so I mean I made a shirt

1417
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,280
I made it. I made a shirt

1418
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,720
It's not I'm not selling it because I feel like that would be weird because it didn't make the design

1419
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:01,080
But I took the I took the vaporwave aesthetic yang symbol and I put it on a purple t-shirt

1420
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,640
And I just bought one for myself and I'm gonna wear that thing

1421
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:09,240
Everywhere, that's cool. Okay. Here's the thing though. I have one commentary on this. Okay, so

1422
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,600
the basically so yang's proposal is for like

1423
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:20,400
Deplaced workers who will be excuse me out of a job due to automation or whatnot. Okay. Here's my thought on this Ben

1424
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,840
I think it's fair to say you have a relatively

1425
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:30,960
Parasitic attitude toward life. I think that's fair to say. I don't think that's fair to say you Ben you Ben are able body

1426
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,920
I'm sure Ben would call it educated college graduates with no excuse to not get a job that puts you above

1427
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:43,200
What these 50% of people who will be deplaced get there is no excuse

1428
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,480
You know what for you to not do that. I'll answer this. I'll answer this. Okay. I mean, I've had

1429
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,800
I've had quote-unquote real jobs in the past and

1430
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,320
I just admit you want the thousand bucks Ben. Just tell me you want me nice. I mean, I won't lie

1431
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,920
I do want it, but I was think I was I was literally I was anticipating this criticism

1432
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,920
And I was thinking about it as I was taking a piss before the show and I thought about it

1433
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:12,880
I decided that I can honestly say that I think I would support yang even if for whatever reason it was like everyone

1434
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,320
But you gets it like I would still think it's a good thing like I still think it makes sense

1435
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,560
I do want the thousand dollars. I won't lie. Of course. I

1436
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,360
Mean I I mean I've worked real jobs before and you know, I hated them

1437
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:33,080
I always felt like I was just wait it was just a waste of time for the most part like I was spent

1438
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:38,440
I was spending like most of my time right going to this job at this job

1439
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:47,120
I didn't even work anywhere close to the nine-to-five the nine-to-five is like a fake made-up arbitrary number that like some

1440
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:53,360
Inherited boomer mentality says that we should all do regardless of whether or not it makes any sense

1441
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,160
Nobody works eight hours a day at their nine-to-five. It doesn't happen. Everyone is like I mean

1442
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:04,200
It's think about Dilbert everyone everyone relates to Dilbert Dilbert's all about people pretending to work people you go to your job

1443
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,160
And you pretend to work for most of your nine-to-five. That's like that's like the experience

1444
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:14,840
That's what that's so common. Well, I'm surprised you're supporting communism after saying all that. I'm it's not communism

1445
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,780
By the way, yeah, this is I mean this is this is capitalism with a floor

1446
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,200
Is no, no, no, I just didn't regard to see your previous statements in the previous part

1447
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,800
That was sort of a meme. It's not literally communism

1448
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:35,760
But well, but Ben I have a nine-to-five and while it's true. I don't necessarily okay. This is the

1449
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:42,440
We approach this definitely from two perspectives. I lead basically my whole existence. I prioritize

1450
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:50,120
it's my job to get myself through life and I don't even want to depend on anyone else now with the automation shit

1451
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,440
I get that I'm not in that position right now. So like I haven't been replaced by a robot and

1452
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,600
And I mean, okay, this this isn't even an argument

1453
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,480
But it's like let's just say this happens this automation stuff happens and you know 50% of

1454
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:10,120
All Americans and I suppose it'll probably mostly men, but I don't know whatever will be replaced with

1455
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:16,480
Robots and they just will give them the freedom to end or whatever and they can do that. I worry massively

1456
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:23,200
First of all that I think a lot of people derive much of their like life purpose and happiness

1457
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:30,000
Yeah from their gainful employment and like their sense of like feeding their family and you know being in charge of their life

1458
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,040
And you know it might be inevitable

1459
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,200
But I have deep worries that just like they're being no place for people

1460
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:42,480
Society's just gonna be like fuck. Well, I mean get depressed and do drugs and sure, but that's I mean

1461
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:48,720
I mean are you criticizing Yang? No, that's not doing this Yang's not replacing the jobs with robots

1462
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:54,760
He's he's I'm away. This is not a criticism of Yang stuff at all. I just it's just a general fear about automation

1463
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,440
Okay, yeah, I agree

1464
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:02,680
I mean, you know like a trucker probably derives a lot of his self identity and his pride in himself from his you know

1465
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,080
His ability to provide for his family and from his sense of you know

1466
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,840
Accomplishment and like this is this is what he does and that's who he is

1467
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:16,960
But you know automation can make that job obsolete and I don't think it's right

1468
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,840
I don't think it makes sense to be like well, we should protect that because that's to be in like anti-progress

1469
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:28,120
I'm not in favor of anti-progress at all. I hate that shit. Yeah, like like I heard Tucker Colerson arguing against like

1470
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,520
Like advancing automation to protect jobs. Yeah, I can't imagine anything

1471
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:40,520
That's horrible. Let's talk. Yeah, let's not protect. No, although although if like let's just say theoretically what I'm talking about here

1472
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:46,640
Is true then like we might literally doom the human race by just continuing the advancement of technology

1473
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,280
It's not gonna do just take it to its logical conclusion where we're all like Wally

1474
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,840
Literal it like technology just takes care of itself and we are just okay

1475
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,720
You know, I mean obviously everyone's fat and gross and Wally so you don't want to be like that

1476
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,880
But like of course the purpose like like automation replacing the need for workers. That should be a good thing

1477
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:10,080
Right. We that should that should make us happy because suddenly I want star trek. He's hard. Yeah. Yeah, exactly

1478
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,820
We were these hard and difficult things that are like dangerous and time-consuming and boring and like

1479
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:21,020
Just labor they're just labor for humans and this and we can we can make those things obsolete

1480
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:27,460
We can liberate people to like have control of their lives and do what they want to do and not be slaves to an economic system

1481
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:33,140
That demands that they I don't know mine for shit in fucking dangerous conditions. I hear you Ben. Yeah, I hear you

1482
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:42,220
It's just I'm just saying it's possible that humanity is not properly equipped to handle that lifestyle and that it will all just fall apart

1483
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:47,620
That you might you I mean you're not necessarily wrong, but it's coming no matter what I agree

1484
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,900
Yeah, I mean it depends on how fast it goes humanity might

1485
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:55,100
Manage to adapt and you know what let me just say like when it comes

1486
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,940
I mean you're right mage humanity might manage to adapt like they did in Star Trek

1487
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,740
But frankly in Star Trek even like that show was originally made in the 60s and shit

1488
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:08,020
They didn't even know the technology that we have right now. That's radically changed how humanity interacts and stuff

1489
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,460
So frankly, we can't even use that as a great predictor to begin with

1490
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,720
But like but I mean the idea behind

1491
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:20,220
Star Trek we're like, you know, technology is sufficiently advanced scarcity is gone

1492
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:26,180
Everyone is provided for you know easily. It's not even a challenge and like just true those concerns

1493
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:33,500
Are just gone. We don't have to worry about providing for ourselves. We can we can worry about like, you know, real shit

1494
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:40,260
I do like the idea of not having to worry about your own self-worth in towards society like

1495
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:47,120
It's pretty good right if everyone else is like, you know, like you and you know, you're just sit there and get a thousand bucks

1496
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,220
And it's like

1497
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:53,380
It'll it'll definitely reduce the stress caused by like oh am I am I of worth to society?

1498
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:59,580
Am I am I being a letdown? Am I useless? Well, you know, you guys can I mean you probably have some insight on this all of us here

1499
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:03,700
Because you know for the most part we're all off the grid workers at least in one of our jobs

1500
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,140
Or you know as like a youtuber online person or whatever

1501
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:13,860
It's like, you know, don't isn't it? Don't you think sometimes it would be easy to just like kind of lean back and like let's say that

1502
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:17,620
You know, you just get money and you know, you could be working on your next YouTube video

1503
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,340
You could be working on your comic you could be working on your commission

1504
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,780
But like, you know now you don't need to well

1505
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,260
I mean you're gonna be fine for me

1506
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:28,860
And so you maybe you can just lean back and not go to the gym today and you can just like watch that new you know

1507
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:34,820
VR sex doll simulation thing that just got downloaded to the main frame and you know fucking

1508
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:42,540
Sorry go on yeah, I can tell you for a fact that for me personally just me just speaking about myself

1509
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,340
Things would not change at all

1510
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:51,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah same the reason say that now, but

1511
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,780
Wait, well mage talk and then I'll go after yeah

1512
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,780
I am I am

1513
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:04,020
fortunate enough to be living with my boyfriend and he takes care of the bills and what I'm doing is mostly as a hobby and I'm

1514
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:08,020
Earning for my own expenses like you know, if I want to buy some shit for myself

1515
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:12,220
I you know, I have to earn it so if I got a thousand bucks, you know

1516
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:15,460
He doesn't gonna change except I'll be able to buy more shit

1517
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:21,820
I guess okay, but now but now let's say he also gets the thousand bucks and I mean, okay the thing about a thousand bucks

1518
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:26,740
It's not enough to like live baby. It's enough to live. It's enough to like survive

1519
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:32,900
So I imagine a lot of people will try to do things beyond that to like, you know, keep

1520
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:38,700
I want to I want to say that like data has been collected and tests have been done and it seems like

1521
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:44,540
The results of tests with programs like this is not that work like work does not decrease

1522
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:49,220
I think people would in general like to look at it as to work and give it their all

1523
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,660
To make money

1524
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:56,580
Almost for a complete 100% fact that things with him would probably not change either

1525
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:00,060
I think people people are we all want to think that though

1526
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:05,660
We all want to think listen. I don't want to get into details because his life is his own. I don't really sure you know

1527
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:13,100
Like knowing him things would not change people. I mean, but eventually, you know, the robots will do all the jobs

1528
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,460
Well, no, all right here and not everyone. Hey, the the the

1529
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:23,720
Here's my problem with what you're recording. Yeah. Yeah, this little bit. I'm recording

1530
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,140
You're looking at it from the perspective of like work being

1531
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:35,100
Something that you have to do to make the money so that you can survive and if you don't have to work

1532
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,220
Therefore you will never do anything but like

1533
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:44,820
Not yeah, I mean what I mean will become pleasure. See everybody has a hobby on top of their work

1534
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:50,660
I mean everybody like whether it be like something that doesn't really improve your life too much like collecting

1535
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:54,480
You know a certain thing or whether it's a creative thing like like

1536
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:01,080
animating or making music or just fucking around with stuff like I think

1537
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:08,160
These things aren't always work and a lot of people don't do them for profit. Oh, you know a lot of the stuff

1538
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,760
I do I don't do it with the expectation of making it big with the stuff

1539
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,320
I'm doing I would just like to survive while doing it

1540
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:23,600
So I think if I get the money to survive the only thing that's gonna change with me is that I won't have to worry as much

1541
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:29,000
And I would continue to make the things that I make for the people that enjoy looking at them and myself

1542
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,120
But you basically said everything I want to say

1543
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:37,000
I just want to also add upon that that you bi doesn't mean that you won't work ever

1544
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:44,400
That like humans want to work. I just fucking with humans motivations to do things. I've never tried it

1545
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:48,720
No, we haven't tried well actually we have in a couple cases. There is there is a couple cases

1546
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:56,120
That working in the traditional sense is not like also at Alaska has been doing it for 30 years

1547
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,720
Humans are like a program to do

1548
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:06,720
Natural level people want have the will and motivation to work people yeah to work and they will do it

1549
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:11,600
Anyway, they can whether or not it's like literally like no not everybody guys

1550
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:17,800
Okay, not everybody we have to think outside of our bubbles because not everybody in the fucking country in the world

1551
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:27,120
Like is a patreon creator who is filled by motivation to go create stuff. Yes, it is you're talking about I'm like like collect the stamps

1552
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:34,040
That that I'm talking about hobbies in general people are motivated. You can't this is literally people are motivated to mow their lawn

1553
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:42,080
That's yeah, like what's your point my micro goals exist and people will work towards those goals everyone has goals

1554
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:50,040
Outside their work. I don't see how getting an extra thousand dollars every month could possibly lower someone's motivation to do anything

1555
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:54,240
I think people would be more motivated to follow their passions and their dreams and do shit

1556
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:03,400
Okay, people are I mean this is a yanks to tell me it's not it he didn't make us up

1557
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,360
But this is something he says all the time like like what is it like like

1558
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:12,920
57 or 70 it's like a big portion of the population like like tons of the population is living paycheck to paycheck

1559
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,440
Most people cannot afford a sudden

1560
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:22,800
$500 bill and yeah, these people are trapped these people have no choice

1561
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,840
But to do the work they're currently doing or they will be destroyed even if that work is something that is

1562
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:35,560
They hate or it's something that is not contributing to society. This is my thing every job every job

1563
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,000
I've ever had I've never gotten the feeling that I'm contributing to society

1564
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:46,160
I've gotten the feeling that I am just lining the pocket of I'm lining I'm lining the pocket of someone richer than me for

1565
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:50,640
No, actual benefit to anyone but that person. I don't like that framing, but I get your

1566
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,840
I'm gonna say I'm gonna go on a limb and I think that's what most jobs are

1567
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,360
Okay, I get your point

1568
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,920
But let me even bolster your argument even more with personally my favorite argument here

1569
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,320
Which is similar to yours, but it's that like a yang said I think he was talking to like some

1570
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:13,480
Like a correctional officer or police officer who like proposed like he said like yo, yo my dude yang

1571
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:18,960
Why don't we just straight up pay criminals to stay out of jail?

1572
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,320
And if we did that we would save money and then people wouldn't be in jail

1573
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,920
And that's because and we would literally be doing that because okay, that's one argument

1574
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,240
Money but if you go to jail, you don't get it anymore

1575
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:39,000
I mean, yeah, I'd be something like that seems reasonable and I'm totally not against that idea because if there's one thing I hate I

1576
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:45,080
Realize this just the other day. I am fundamentally opposed to the idea of redemptive justice period

1577
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:51,140
I only believe in correctional justice. You mean you mean you mean like just punishing someone out of like vengeance

1578
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:58,720
Yes, even like if someone murders someone it is I don't think it is moral to just harm them because they harmed

1579
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,240
I think the only moral thing to do is to correct their behavior

1580
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,840
And if it can't be corrected then you got to put them away in some way

1581
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:10,520
I agree that the point of the justice system should be a correction and

1582
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,800
Imagine someone killed your son though. I know it's hard. Yeah

1583
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:21,200
I know it's hard to like see that objectively and I don't I don't blame anyone for wanting murderers to be killed because they're bad

1584
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,680
I mean, I get it. Yeah

1585
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,840
Do you think that the that the guy who shot up that mosque shouldn't have just been shot in the fucking head?

1586
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,240
immediately well, I mean, I would I think he does

1587
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:39,960
Right now he's going to go sit comfy in a jail, which is exactly what he wanted and he's gonna sit there

1588
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:45,280
Happy as a pig and shit basically getting away with it. He that's not true

1589
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,480
He's gonna feel proud because he accomplished what he said out to so

1590
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,000
Shouldn't he just instead have a fucking I'm going for the death penalty

1591
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,240
I'm absolutely for the death penalty for guys like that. Yeah, kill that guy 100% for I mean

1592
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,400
I mean, how does that jive with what you were just saying?

1593
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,560
No, no, no, they did say it and he can't get it can be corrected

1594
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:09,780
You know, but what if we could what if what if you we had a team of psychologists evaluate this guy and they came

1595
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:14,240
They should be surprised not this guy's not completely insane and with like, you know

1596
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:18,280
Maybe five years in the correctional facility and whatever treatment we can give him this guy could be

1597
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:23,760
Rehabilitated and made a productive member of society. What if okay, you know what you're right. I contradict myself a little bit there

1598
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:29,160
I didn't mean to do that. It's yeah, go and I'm torn. I'm honest. I'm torn about that

1599
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,760
I mean, maybe the right thing to do is let that happen if it's possible

1600
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,760
I don't know if you got rehabilitated

1601
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:40,000
Do you not think that the guilt of what he felt did would weigh him down like severely?

1602
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,600
I don't care about him like like I'm more concerned about like

1603
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,000
The like he killed so many people a lot of people hate him

1604
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,520
Like if we're talking about like yeah, you've mentioned in the past like overall like

1605
01:23:54,360 --> 01:24:00,020
happiness of like the the people like on a mean scale ever a general scale like

1606
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:07,860
They would be a lot happier if he was put to death rather than rehabilitated and out in the world living when the people they love

1607
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:13,900
Didn't have a chance for like a bunch of doctors to come around and fix them because they died and that was it

1608
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,100
Yeah

1609
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:20,540
Clarify what I meant is it's not that I am concerned about him and his welfare

1610
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,540
I meant like if he did they get rehabilitated and

1611
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:28,060
Then you know the realization of what he did hits him

1612
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:32,860
He'll probably just go back to being mentally unstable because like that sort of guilt

1613
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,860
I would imagine it would break

1614
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:40,220
You can't so it would be willing to be pointless. I think that's my

1615
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:48,060
Okay, I get what you're saying and you're probably right, but I'm positing what if we could reasonably rehabilitate this person

1616
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:52,100
Should we do it right? No, right? I'm willing to be a little savage. Yeah, right here

1617
01:24:52,740 --> 01:25:00,420
Some people are monsters, you know like the like the great American patriot Rorschach once said men go to jail dogs get put down

1618
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:07,420
We could turn this person into a real person again

1619
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:11,540
Then people then other people will go and kill him because they hate him so much like well

1620
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,500
I don't know about you guys that's their moral failing. That's their moral

1621
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:22,820
Ignoring the premise of my thought experiment and it's annoying. I'm not you're not you're not Nate. I only you're one of the good ones

1622
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:30,340
No, I'm not it's not black and white like I get that if somebody like acts in a crime of passion and like murders a person

1623
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,420
Maybe that guy could be rehabilitated

1624
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:36,180
But I mean when we're talking about this this recent mass killer

1625
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:42,140
I mean I I watched the video it was really creepy and unsettling and kind of horrifying and it made me feel really bad

1626
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:46,420
But like the dude gunned down 50 innocent fucking people

1627
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:53,460
Because it was funny. He's a monster. I mean he deserves to be fucking killed. You're not you're just not accepting the premise

1628
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:58,700
I'm saying just imagine a world where we have definitive proof that yes

1629
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:05,220
We can fix this person and he will I think why would you want to fix them? We already have enough decent normal people why?

1630
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:12,580
Either hippo or manchi said

1631
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:18,300
People will come after him regardless if he's a normal human being now we then we should stop all right

1632
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:22,380
He's been cured because it's not good to kill people period

1633
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,780
and so people

1634
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:28,520
Maybe justified in wanting to kill him if he if say he's really

1635
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:32,420
Rehabilitated perfectly and he's just a good person now and

1636
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:38,500
I suppose like the ideal is that when you go to jail and you serve your time

1637
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:44,060
Then that's your time and when you get out then you're a free man and it shouldn't be a problem

1638
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:49,780
Like so I get it. I guess I guess I'm just like in in my head

1639
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:53,900
I'm like he's rehabilitated in like a month and then he's back out on the streets

1640
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,860
I guess he would be also in jail for like 40 years or something

1641
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:02,980
Even if this guy can be rehabilitated fucking. What's his name? Bobby fuck nuts. I'll call him

1642
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:07,820
Mm-hmm. If like why does he deserve the chance to be rehabilitated?

1643
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,420
Well, I okay

1644
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:21,540
I don't think that this is the world we're living in I think he probably can't be fixed and this probably is a

1645
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:23,660
Pointless thought experiment that doesn't reflect reality

1646
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:29,860
But you know, yeah, Nate. I'm I mean I come kind of with you. I think I'm totally with you actually

1647
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:32,900
I think that everything is deterministic

1648
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,580
This guy is the way he is because this is the environment

1649
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:40,220
He was born into and it made him into the monster that he is and I think that yeah

1650
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:47,820
Like from just like a purely rational like theoretical perspective. Yeah, I think I would say if we could give into the motion

1651
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,060
Emotional howling mobs

1652
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:56,180
And I think that just from a baseline everyone deserves the the human right

1653
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:02,500
This sound this sound I just want to say this sounds like I'm defending this person. Yeah

1654
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:09,140
Yeah, yeah, I get I get where you coming from, but I'm afraid people will interpret that's what we're saying

1655
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:12,060
I think also I do I'm coming from is like

1656
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,460
It's it's far more attractive

1657
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:17,300
The idea of pre-habilitation like

1658
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:22,700
To make them so that they didn't do it in the first place rather than fixing them afterwards

1659
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,700
I feel like fixing them afterwards is

1660
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:28,300
It like even if it's a good thing

1661
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:33,380
It feels like it's a wasted effort because this person already did this horrible thing and these people are dead

1662
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:39,260
And also like there's also never like like because he already did a thing who says he won't do it again

1663
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:41,260
Even if he's repealed

1664
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,500
Have a world where he was fully rehabilitated

1665
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:53,820
Even so no not even so that's okay major's arguing just that you can't that it's impossible

1666
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,360
I mean if I'm acknowledging. She's almost definitely right

1667
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:04,940
Is that repentance is a privilege of the remorseful if you're what if he had

1668
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:11,160
Genuine remorse he doesn't he doesn't have it now he killed for the people

1669
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:17,920
Can we please just substitute forget the masher let's substitute with him Timmy who stole the cookie from the cookie jar

1670
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,240
Can he be made to redeem himself? Can he be forgiven for his deeds?

1671
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:27,040
He committed a sin what if we could fix him so he never steals another cookie from this cookie jar

1672
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,880
I mean does he deserve another chance? I mean, yes, should we restore his cookie privileges?

1673
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,560
I mean, yeah, if he feels bad about it. Yeah, but if you sit in there in the corner all smug like hey

1674
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,200
Hey, I stole a fucking cookie. You can't do anything about it. Yeah, he never like you again return to the premise

1675
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,400
What if he was fixed for real

1676
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,400
Okay

1677
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,520
But I'm

1678
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,400
Talking about a mass killer. All right doesn't deserve the chance

1679
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,160
I'll I'll I'll bite right the cookie jar

1680
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:10,280
People the people other kids who would have got cookies. They're mad at this guy who's eaten all the cookies and he's been perfectly

1681
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:16,200
Rehabilitated he's never gonna have another cookie again, and he's really sorry. He's like man. I can't believe what a shitbag

1682
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:21,600
I was still I've deprived others of their cookies and it was wrong and I'm so yeah

1683
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,160
So like I can never make up for what I've done, but I'll spend the rest of my life trying

1684
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:32,320
Yeah, so like he's he's remorseful. He's in the playground all the other kids still remember I think like

1685
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,240
The I I know what the problem is I know what the like like I

1686
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,240
See like in the hypothetical situation where he is perfectly redeemed and in the future like you can only know through hindsight

1687
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,800
But whether or not he steals a cookie again

1688
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,640
So we have a future machine

1689
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,160
But like overall people are more annoyed

1690
01:30:54,160 --> 01:31:00,960
I think if he like if he got like a face change and like a name change and you just like nobody even knew that he was the same guy

1691
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:06,720
Then I guess yeah, it'll be a little different. Yeah, it's like well that cookie guy. I did it. That's it

1692
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:10,560
It was all a trick. This was all a trick to get you to agree to let the mask off and I did it

1693
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:19,480
Let me speak there is a difference though in here like in this situation this hypothetical

1694
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:24,560
It's not equivalent because what the damage he did it can be sort of like

1695
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,680
Repaired with the fact that you just get him by more cookies

1696
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,080
But what you know what the guy did well, I'll never get those eyes back

1697
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,880
Well, no, no, what I was thinking is like the cookies is

1698
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,000
And the people who love them like family members and friends those the kids who are annoyed

1699
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,680
That they cookie got eaten listen, okay

1700
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:47,440
Here's the problem. The problem is that other the the problem actually in this instance

1701
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:52,160
Let's say we can perfectly cure this person. So they know we like the we have a future machine

1702
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,840
We know they would never do it again, but the problem is

1703
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,340
Everyone else because everyone else we would have to cure them of their

1704
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:06,040
Emotionality and their irrationality because they just won't accept or believe that this is true

1705
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:11,840
Even if we know it's true people are too emotional. Yeah, so the problem actually lies outside that one person

1706
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,400
It's with the rest of us human beings. What I don't I don't care if you're that

1707
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,800
I don't think that his right to be rehabilitated this hypothetical person doesn't have to be a mass killer

1708
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,880
But I don't think that a person's right to be rehabilitated outweighs the other people's right to live who died

1709
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,480
You're just not doing any good at that point

1710
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:33,720
You're only getting revenge is because it makes you feel better and this person, you know in this instance in this metaphor

1711
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,840
They've been redeemed and they won't do it again

1712
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:42,680
Resources wasted on like recalculating that guy and then like all the other people who want him dead

1713
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:47,960
Now you're bringing in this whole deviation of resources. Let's say we're in the future and there's machines and we've got infinite

1714
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:54,740
We're in the game at this point the hypothetical is so unrealistic that it's sort of it's no

1715
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,880
He's never gonna be like I in a perfect situation

1716
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:07,240
Yes, it is good to rehabilitate something if everything lines up and it's we got to me

1717
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:13,400
We got we got hippo on board. We got on there. Yeah, but in reality, it's so much further from that than well. Yeah

1718
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:17,080
Yeah, I don't think we should actually do this in reality

1719
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:22,600
And that situation where everything is perfect and it lines up perfectly and you can rehabilitate a person with a snap of a button

1720
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,600
Then this shit wouldn't even happen

1721
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:31,160
Okay, well, hey, that's that's a fair but what if I guess but what if it but just in the I mean let's add to the metaphor

1722
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,160
What if it did just one time?

1723
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,160
Stupidly unrealistic

1724
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,960
Okay, I guess my only point is that yeah

1725
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:45,480
I think you know in an ideal world where we could do this if your goal was to do the best good for the maximum

1726
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:49,200
Yeah, then then yeah, I think the right thing to do would be yes

1727
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:54,640
Let's let's hit our rehabilitation button fix this person give him a face change give him a new name send him out somewhere to be a

1728
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,520
Citizen no more problems ever happen. Yeah, that's probably what I would do

1729
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:03,720
I don't like it because this person is a monster and deserves retribution or but red yet true

1730
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:11,360
But retribution does not I'm not arguing from emotion here. I mean don't underestimate my true blackpilled apathy on all things

1731
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,520
I'm not saying that killing him would make me feel better

1732
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,520
I'm approaching this from a purely logical

1733
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:23,040
Vulcan standpoint where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one if you kill one person

1734
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,240
Maybe you can be rehabilitated

1735
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:29,520
But if you kill two people then I think that those two people's rate to live outweigh your right to be rehabilitated

1736
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:34,720
And it exponentially grows the more people you kill so if you kill 50 people and that's so you're saying then that's like

1737
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:40,600
50 times zero the zero is your right to be rehabilitated 50 times. Oh you're saying oh you go to

1738
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:47,080
So you kill so you kill these people and then they get you in the in their chamber in their rehabilitation chamber and we like

1739
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,440
We this person's fucked up

1740
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:52,480
We should definitely press this button to fix him and make him good and send him out again

1741
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,960
And you'd be you'd be there in the in the in the the department in the oh god

1742
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:03,280
What do they call them in in in 1984 the the building like the Department of Love the Department of Plenty

1743
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:09,320
But yeah, the fuck there's so it's not department, but whatever you're in there in the whatever of love and you're like

1744
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:16,600
Okay, sir or madam madam president. Don't push that button. He does not deserve to have the button pushed

1745
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,560
He deserves the death button push which is right next to us

1746
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:28,080
We couldn't we shouldn't we shouldn't fix him that we should kill him. I'm saying everybody gets one

1747
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,080
Okay, you get one murder one

1748
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:37,840
You can be rehabilitated that's a life for a life if you murder more than one person then you then you're done. You're dead

1749
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,280
We kill you

1750
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:43,040
Hmm. I I don't I see where you're coming from. I see it

1751
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,440
Yeah

1752
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,760
I think as a as a young man as a yang man in the yang gang

1753
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,440
I appreciate numbers and your numbers are adding up and making sense to him and watch out jessior. You'll see his yang fang

1754
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,880
It's like christian when he said that you'll see my fangs. No, I gotta bear my fangs. Yeah

1755
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,600
By the way, see my oh don't even we don't talk about the yang wang

1756
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,560
First of all agree with Ben

1757
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,080
second of all

1758
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:20,400
What do you guys think is more cruel the death penalty or life in prison because I this could go either way

1759
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,800
Um, I think I think death penalty is cruel. I think death penalty is cruel

1760
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,080
I think life in prison if it were me. I would much prefer a life in prison to the death penalty, but that's just me

1761
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:39,040
I'm just I'm just sitting here reflecting on the on the flawless perfect utopia that I just accidentally created in this argument because think about this

1762
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:45,040
If you were only allowed to kill one person then you would only kill the people who really deserve it

1763
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:49,680
You'd only kill someone you really hate. I guess so that's like Dave chappelle's bullet control argument

1764
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,520
Yeah, like what if like what if each bullet cost $10,000 you would only use them if they really

1765
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,640
That's right. Was that chris rock? Oh, I think you're racist. Yeah, I think you're right actually

1766
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,640
Damn it. That's okay. You get one murder and you get one being racist

1767
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,360
Okay

1768
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,240
I'm in deep deep racism debt

1769
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,480
Uh, yeah, all right. Well, I think we got a lot done here today. That was yeah, this is good

1770
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:26,000
We were exacerbated. Well, wait. No, we've excised our demons not exacerbated them. Tommy Wayne sure has a funny name. That's what I learned today

1771
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:33,200
Hey, hey guys. Do you want to change your topic very quickly to something else? Hell? Yeah, go for it

1772
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,360
Did you know that there are pigs that are fluffy?

1773
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,400
No, I knew that there are they make pig. Do they make pig? Do they make pig wool?

1774
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:48,080
Whoa, no, but look at it. That's that's like um one of those images that like combines two things and with an outline

1775
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,680
It's just it's just like human beings both a swine and a sheep

1776
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,720
Hey, uh

1777
01:37:54,720 --> 01:38:00,080
Hell, yeah, I have I have one I have one thing to say. Uh, this is not directly F too much hip of saying this

1778
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:05,200
I know this is this is not this is not directly this is not directly related to yang per se

1779
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,560
But it's sort of in line with my whole, you know, my whole like radical

1780
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,920
I guess am I a radical lefty now? I might be I'm not sure

1781
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:18,240
Um, possibly but I was I was rewatching some videos and there was one that I thought was really great and really thought provoking

1782
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,640
And uh, it's it's by this guy

1783
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:27,360
I I found him because I was on the rfck twitter and I just saw a link to this guy called thought slime

1784
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:31,680
And I thought that's a cool name and I thought and I followed him on the rfck

1785
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,240
He's like one of the like four people that the rfck twitter follows because he has slime in his name

1786
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:42,560
But he but he is like a radical anarcho communist. So he's like he's as bad as far left as you can get

1787
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:47,920
Um, I see a video of his called all cops are bad. He sounds sounds balanced

1788
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,440
He does have one called all cops are bad

1789
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:54,400
He doesn't like the institution of the police and he thinks it should be like radically restructured is the idea

1790
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,880
But he's got one video called um capitalist entitlement

1791
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,920
And uh, and I think that one's really great

1792
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:05,840
And I would encourage anyone to watch it and let me know what you think in the comment

1793
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,040
Could you give me the general synopsis?

1794
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:12,480
The general synopsis is that people say that like lefties are entitled because they want government benefits

1795
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,440
They want you know, they don't even want to work for it

1796
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,120
um

1797
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:24,000
And his basically his argument is that like the like the way that capitalism allows certain individuals to amass

1798
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:30,480
Insane wealth on the backs of like a system that they did not build themselves that was created communally by

1799
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:35,600
You know americans and by people large and by workers, but like all like all the um

1800
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,800
You know the the wealth and the talent and stuff like the the benefits of like the people

1801
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,360
That they should be profiting from themselves get siphoned into the pockets of like, you know

1802
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:50,720
Like the rich oligarchs and technocrats just based on how capitalism operates as intended

1803
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:56,240
And and the idea is that like this is why capitalism is flawed and why it is like an inherently exploitative

1804
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:00,480
System and anyway, I really like that video and I think it makes a lot of good points in a short time

1805
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,440
And I don't want to just directly quote it all so I don't know

1806
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,200
I thought maybe people should check it if you feel like it check that one out

1807
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:11,600
And I don't know let me know what you think in the comments, uh, because I am a big fan of all that

1808
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,280
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to I'll have to think okay. You know what I have to counter that uh go listen to

1809
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,240
I don't know any video by rucka rucka ali. I don't fully agree with all his ideas

1810
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:29,120
But he is the purest objectivist. I've ever seen um, and he really straight up believes in that stuff

1811
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,240
And I am not a hundred percent on his side and all those things

1812
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,720
But we overlap in the majority of our ideas

1813
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:39,920
So I don't I don't have a specific video, but I'm just countering this leftist indoctrination that ben's attempting to do

1814
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,760
It's not an indoctrination

1815
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,000
I just think that maybe because like a lot of I don't know because like on youtube

1816
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,600
You are way more likely to get recommended like anti sjw. Shit like you're like like

1817
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,280
YouTube will send you down this fucking rabbit. I have to stop you there

1818
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,600
YouTube will send you down this fucking rabbit hole of like of like sargon of a cod and like armoured skeptic and all this

1819
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:05,680
And all this weird like crypto right wing youtube will send you down whatever passage is related videos

1820
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,920
But which okay, but which one is more like there is which one happens to more people

1821
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:16,400
Which rabbit hole do more people get sent down by the youtube algorithm. The answer to that question is left wing

1822
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,320
Because tim cool just did a video on this. Okay. This was a couple weeks ago

1823
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:25,120
I think where he summarized and he's on the left. So this is his team. I know people mean about him being

1824
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:29,040
I mean, this sounds like one data point and an anecdotal argument that's coming up

1825
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:34,560
Okay, he cited a study and I don't know how comprehensive it was but but the the gist of that was

1826
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:38,160
I'm just saying there was some evidence to the contrary that was a study

1827
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,040
And I don't know what video it was but he references a couple times

1828
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:45,280
Uh, so I'm just saying I've heard points and this wasn't just him making it up

1829
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:50,960
He was citing a study by I don't even remember who but it was real and I saw the chart and it's out there somewhere

1830
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:56,560
So I just think it's more of an open question. Well, that's interesting. That's interesting. Okay. I guess my only point

1831
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:04,160
Oh, I'm trying to say is I think that probably our audience just from what I've observed probably skews a little bit in the anti

1832
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,520
SJW

1833
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:10,880
Direction and you know, I wonder about that. I really do. I mean, I don't know. I don't know it. I don't know for sure

1834
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,120
I guess we do

1835
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,520
Like digi's audience would be like, you know

1836
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:21,440
Lefty guys because digi dabbles a lot and like lgbtq stuff and uh, I don't know

1837
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:26,160
I mean a little bit the anime culture to me seems more lefty in general

1838
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,840
I um

1839
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,640
I'm not sure about that. I think digi was just a source of a lot of viewership

1840
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:34,720
I get a mix of both. I don't know. I mean time to time because I listen to

1841
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,680
Well, what is it?

1842
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:41,600
Every viewer of ours is transsexual and also gay or something like that. I mean transgender. I think right

1843
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:47,440
It seems to me that a good 90% of our audience or if there is a difference of our audience girls with dicks

1844
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:53,520
Um, I don't know but I don't know. I just want to point this out because thought slime is not a huge channel

1845
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:58,160
I think he's only got like less than 100k. Oh, he's got less than me. Oh, thank god. I don't pay attention

1846
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,960
Thank god, I think

1847
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,720
Specifically the stuff he says in the video called capitalist entitlement is not

1848
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,600
Stuff that I've heard repeated a lot around and I think it's interesting. So that's my recommendation

1849
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,520
Ben, I suspect put it in the show notes. Okay. Would you willingly call yourself?

1850
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,320
Someone like a leftist like someone on the left. I would call myself a leftist. Yeah

1851
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:23,040
I would call it. I would definitely call myself left leaning for sure if it is anyone that would consider themselves

1852
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
on the right here

1853
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:31,200
In terms of economics, I definitely am on the right. That's specifically economics people

1854
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:35,200
I definitely lean left in terms of like a social policy. So

1855
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,960
Just saying I don't think I'm not sure any of us would call ourselves right leaning

1856
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,800
But I mean, I think maybe some of our audience think we are

1857
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,320
I think that's very because I wouldn't because we've said the n-word

1858
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:50,000
All I know is that I'm real right and I don't believe in it

1859
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:54,880
Left and right is totally arbitrary. Okay. Well, again, you need the four quadrant spectrum

1860
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:01,760
You need the four point of liberal uh and authoritarian versus, you know, uh, not leftist and rightist, but you know

1861
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:05,280
That's a concern. I'm definitely in a flushed quadrant. Yeah, whatever

1862
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:12,640
So, I mean, I think most of us if not all are pretty much very high on the like liberal side as opposed to authoritarian

1863
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,720
I mean to me, that's the most important one. I mean, I'm not sure. I I generally don't know

1864
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:24,240
I struggle every single day with looking myself in the mirror and not being the perfect

1865
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,400
Centrist god that I know I want to be and I'll pretend to be

1866
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,120
But knowing that I just have that smidge of devil that smidge of left-wing politics in me

1867
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:38,160
Makes me so genuinely upset that I can't fucking like grapple with it. You should embrace it

1868
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:44,000
You should embrace your devil munchie. No, I shouldn't it's not fucking right. It's it's so fucking

1869
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:50,400
It's not right. It's it's not right. It's left. It's so disgusting to lean in to be on the left or on the right

1870
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:56,080
It's fucking like that's horrible. It's really important. It's I I don't I I'm are you serious?

1871
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,920
I really hate that attitude. You know why you say that

1872
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,840
No, I really I really really hate the attitude that you have to be on like the far-flung edges of society

1873
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,280
I didn't say that. I just think I think centrism is like a non-position a lot of the time

1874
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:16,080
I hate when people say that that makes absolutely no fucking sense

1875
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,800
You one should never okay

1876
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:24,160
You should never come into life thinking I'm going to be a leftist or I'm going to be on the right

1877
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:28,320
You should obviously like think about the arguments one by one

1878
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:34,640
And then as a result of those positions on arguments the rest of the world will conclude in response to them

1879
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:41,360
They find you on the left. I'm not saying you should pick a side and then and then align yourself with whatever that side believes

1880
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:45,680
I know I'm just I'm just and I understand how someone could have a mix of opinions that brings

1881
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,680
Here's why this conversation

1882
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:54,080
Here's why it's totally circular and worthless. Sure. The term centrist is a fucking straw man

1883
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,560
There is no such fucking thing as a centrist

1884
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:02,560
And when people try to like shame centrist like oh centrist are just fence sitters. No, they're not

1885
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,040
Nobody is exactly in the middle on everything

1886
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:09,680
Everybody feels one way about one thing and another way about another thing and that's how you should fucking be

1887
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,800
You should tackle problems in your own brain on an individual fucking basis not according to what your fucking team is

1888
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:20,000
Okay, okay. Okay. I don't think ben was arguing. I agree. Okay, but what munchie is saying is that he wishes

1889
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,680
He were a centrist and what is that if not picking an alignment and trying to align your values with that? That's what i'm saying

1890
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,600
I don't know that was munchie

1891
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:32,400
That seems like exactly what you're arguing against what what what i'm saying is okay

1892
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:39,040
I I believe what jesse said that everyone has opinions. I don't think anyone is actually going

1893
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,760
I'm gonna be a centrist and i'm gonna be in the center of all positions. I think they are

1894
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
What about boogie boogie is literally that

1895
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:52,720
Well, I think he's trying to fucking have empathy and dismiss and denounce people who won't be on the extremes

1896
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,160
I'm sorry

1897
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,800
When I say I want to be more of a centrist

1898
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,080
I mean that I think that I easily dismiss people

1899
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,760
Of more often than not like a right-wing perspective

1900
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,240
And I wish that I were not so biased in that way and I wish that I was able to more

1901
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:15,200
Accurately engage with them and and I wish that I had more of a balanced perspective in life and in politics

1902
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:19,280
I feel it's too easy for me to just completely like align a lot

1903
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:24,720
Well, that doesn't that doesn't make any sense if you if you okay if you feel a way about the issues

1904
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:29,440
How does it make sense? That's not what i'm saying. I'm sorry. I'm saying that I

1905
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,320
wish that I could

1906
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,800
Not not I'm not saying that I want to have different opinions than what I have

1907
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,480
I'm saying I want to be able to engage with people who have different opinions

1908
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,920
In a more balanced way than I currently do where it's it's easy for me to dismiss people out of hand

1909
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,360
I mean you could

1910
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:52,800
Well, I mean you can engage with someone with right-leaning opinions even if you don't share them right or left or whatever

1911
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,880
Well, that's what i'm saying

1912
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:59,280
Well, okay guys on the same thing as being a centrist and we can all agree that whether you want

1913
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:04,800
The acceleration of the degeneracy of the world to happen or you're a communist hack

1914
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:09,520
We are all in the yang gang and we can all be united on this point, you know

1915
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:14,320
And we could move forward. I feel I feel conflicted. You know, I think the yang gang is funny

1916
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:20,080
But I also feel weird like am I undermining it by by leaning into the meme of it. I wonder what but

1917
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:24,800
I mean all you're doing is saying the word yang gang. That's not all I'm saying is saying the word yang gang

1918
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,400
But other people are out there making memes that are really like, you know, you know

1919
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,920
Like yang is the new trump and yang is uh, is uh, yo listen to this

1920
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:37,440
I saw a tweet from uh, okay. I hate doing this, but like, okay. I saw um

1921
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:45,520
Contra points make a tweet that was just it was the shooter from the new zealand thing and he was doing the okay sign

1922
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,960
Which we all know has the right wing dog whistle

1923
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:53,600
Okay, that yes, that's the thing but but just in response to this

1924
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:59,040
Yeah, the the the conclusion found by contra points was we got him all along

1925
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:05,040
Everyone who's been doing the okay sign has in fact been a right wing evil racist monster

1926
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:10,320
And I just thought that seems unreasonable a position to take you can't that's a bit of a that's a bit of a jump

1927
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:14,000
There's so many people we're like we're on board. We we agree

1928
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,680
I don't I don't think the right thing to do is crack down on the okay sign

1929
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,440
Right and look it's fine

1930
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:28,080
If you want to say that like I don't know if you see a person who seems spouting a lot of right wing things

1931
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,440
And they're doing the okay sign

1932
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:35,120
I think it's reasonable to develop a conclusion that looks like this person's leaning into this possibly racist meme

1933
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:37,600
And sure enjoying it, but just what do you get from that?

1934
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:43,760
I don't think that gives you anything. Hold on the okay symbol is like a racist thing. I thought it was like

1935
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,720
Someone unfortunate. I thought it meant okay much

1936
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:52,000
That's the thing a lot of people don't even know that it but yeah, like it is kind of it's sort of like pepe

1937
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:56,640
You know like like pepe is some people use it as like a right wing dog whistle thing

1938
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:03,040
Like like that's what I'm here to sound pepe back. It doesn't really mean that to everyone as a as a should post in 4chan

1939
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,200
Let me just clarify the okay symbol

1940
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:10,480
This is a fact the okay symbol was co-op if you make your fingers in a circle with the three

1941
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,880
Whatever fingers up and you hold it upside down

1942
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,560
It looks kind of like a w and a p which they say is white power

1943
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:24,960
This was a made up thing on 4chan. They it was it's confirmed they made it up to confuse and like

1944
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:30,800
Fuck people up because everyone uses the okay. I thought it was just because I thought it was just because trump does the okay sign

1945
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,720
Sometimes they that may have been why they showed that it's such a tangled web

1946
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,560
That the solution is just stop. This is the word renter stop caring

1947
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,760
I just want to say a lot of people have made the okay

1948
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,880
Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's the thing but yeah, they co-opted it

1949
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:51,600
But that's why it's such a great weapon that so many people do it and of course they don't know that it's being

1950
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:56,640
You know interpreted this way and like people that don't know about it might still do the okay sign

1951
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:01,280
Um, with like and it's like oh the dog whistling even though they don't mean to on the other hand

1952
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:07,040
I mean like even if it was like a fake made like like people that are in on the meme would do it like genuinely like

1953
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:10,640
Yeah, I know I am right wing. I know we've co-opted this sign

1954
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,800
I'm going to do it as like legitimately like

1955
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:17,680
Exactly. It's just that you need more evidence than just the okay sign to conclude

1956
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,840
Well, I mean I think I think we can conclude that about this guy

1957
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,080
This shooter guy was definitely in on the the meme or whatever. I mean, I true

1958
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:31,520
I mean, he also said subscribed to PewDiePie. I really think it's which I did immediately after that

1959
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,840
There you go because he's trying and he said in his manifesto. That was a joke by the way trying to fuck up the world

1960
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:44,880
Yeah, um and just he just did all the all the things and honestly, I can say I can just say like don't let him win

1961
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:48,320
But that doesn't mean anything like how do we prevent him from winning?

1962
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:52,960
The answer is there is no way because they're just fucking up speech and information

1963
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:56,960
And uh, it is worrying and I am concerned about it. I'm really annoyed

1964
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:02,160
Just then when Ben did the funny joke and then he had he felt the need to clarify that it was a joke

1965
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:07,120
That he that he didn't actually subscribe. Oh, thank god. Ben would never subscribe

1966
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,560
The subscribe to PewDiePie meme before that point was like one of the nicest things on the internet

1967
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:17,840
That's why it's so fucked up with that guy. Look, obviously, okay, the worst thing to do is kill people obviously

1968
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:23,120
I'm just saying to see people corrupt information like that. There's there's nothing that can be done

1969
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:29,040
Honestly, I might have some eventually subscribed to PewDiePie and now I can't now I just can't bring myself to do it

1970
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,520
I can't ring that bell

1971
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:39,680
I would like to submit to the court that for some reason I had left a youtube video playing and then I have autoplay on

1972
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,840
And I come back after this intense yang-gang

1973
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,280
This this this mass shooting

1974
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,400
Yang-gang bang you this yang-gang bang

1975
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:56,640
This yang-gang bae I come back to minecraft new versus pro sky block in minecraft as much when am v shorts animation

1976
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,360
Well, cool. That says a lot. Oh god. They're rat. They're radicalizing you

1977
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:08,320
Look at look at this anime boy made just posted doing the the okay symbol. We've got another one. We bagged another one

1978
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,480
I'll bet you boy though. He probably didn't even know I don't know. He's looking pretty white

1979
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,360
Honestly, I look at this guy and I think this guy's definitely subscribed to PewDiePie

1980
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:24,960
So fucked up would have okay, you know what let's just move past this let's get some voicemails guys

1981
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,560
We gotta we gotta

01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,080
Go on okay, but before we do voicemail voicemails

1983
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:34,960

2013
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,600
But I don't fucking know any of them

01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,400
But now like

01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:42,320
Literally who watches the pcp? There's a few people in the patreon lounge who I hate and then that's it

01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:58,400
Yeah, I mean this is a pop didn't briefly uh to

2032
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:46,480
If you're an if you're an endless friend out there in the patron lounge

2033
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:51,840
Make sure that you support the real shit by downvoting every episode in which we talk about politics at all

2034
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,160
Yeah, I'd appreciate that and up voting every episode where we talk about video games and shit

2035
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:02,800
Uh video games are the best everyone everyone in the pcp patreon is post yang memes, but only the good ones

2036
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:04,640
Only the nice ones

2037
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:08,160
There are some there's some black pilled ones out there. Okay. Well, hey, you know what I think

2038
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,600
Maybe we should like take the patient lounge because we can be there

2039
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:15,680
This is an unprecedented a lot of people do this where we have like the patron section

2040
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:19,200
And then we just release like the discord like I have a general section for the public

2041
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:24,880
That's how the uh, that's how the podcast one works and it's pretty great. It works. Well, do we not have do we not have that for the pc?

2042
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:31,200
Wait, is the pcp discord only patron only patron only yes, there's no there's no non patron section. Yeah, that's correct

2043
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:37,440
I mean there was there was a non patron pcp discord and it quickly devolved into shit

2044
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:42,800
Well after we made the patron only one like that changed a lot

2045
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,320
You know

2046
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,920
Whatever like some of the people

2047
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:51,200
Microwaved over and so it just kind of weathled out after a long time because the most devoted fans were mostly patrons

2048
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:57,920
So they all left that one in uh, you know, you know, it's kind of a scary thought that like what I maybe like the

2049
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:01,680
audience is like it has like changed to the point where like

2050
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:06,960
I wouldn't resonate because like I think about like old pcp fans. I think about steve

2051
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:11,680
I think about steel. I mean you were you were in the you were in that group at the time

2052
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:16,240
Yeah, me and like I feel like I resonate with those people a lot to the point where it was like

2053
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,160
I don't know like very fast friends

2054
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:24,320
But I feel like maybe like I wouldn't like what if I don't resonate with the people who are like fans of the pcp now

2055
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:27,600
That's just a really scary thought that I haven't really considered before

2056
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:32,400
I think it's just that you were friends with them now and the you know, it's changed

2057
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:36,880
So you just don't know and so you're comparing the good thing that you knew to the unknown thing

2058
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,960
Yeah, might be bad and you know, yeah

2059
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,120
I mean it's been going anywhere

2060
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:43,120
I mean a lot of your a lot of your um

2061
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,680
Let's do a lot of a lot of people you were friends with

2062
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:48,320
In the pre you being on the pcp days

2063
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:53,280
I mean a lot of those people are like pretty like people know their names now because you talk about them

2064
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:57,280
That's true. So, I mean they're they're kind of a sort of

2065
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:05,280
Click within the group, I guess. Hey guys, it's me the pizza party podcast. Oh my god

2092
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,280
Ben when you

When you came out of the closet and said that you were gay

2094
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Well, it was difficult for me, but

We knew you were gay the the minute you came out of the closet

2099
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,960
It was

2100
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,800
It was it was frankly fabulous and we weren't

2101
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,800
Boys we weren't uh

2102
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:40,480
Exactly thrilled when you stated your intention to get married to each other as well

2103
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,760
Oh, right. That's Jewish brother on brother

2104
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,400
marriage, but you know

2105
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,560
We love y'all. You can't control me. You know, what are you gonna do?

2106
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:54,080
Oh, what are you gonna do? I should be supportive of everything else. Mm-hmm, but your mother and I recently found this podcast

2107
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,960
And it is it is just awful

2108
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:08,320
Yeah, he's he's not wrong. So, uh, this christmas, um, just just don't come over

Nice, I'll save money on presents

2110
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:19,120
All right, I respect that dad. Love you too dad. The ever-disappointed gold standard finally calls into the pcp

2111
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,920
Gold standard that's deep lore

2112
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:27,040
Uh, did people even know about gold standard? Do they know about gold standard and angel food?

2113
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,480
Uh, they might if you have an angel food cake the tea vap

2114
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:37,840
Well, I mean we'll we'll get into that. Well, they're not gonna be at it anymore because we've been disowned. Um, that well, that's fair

2115
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,400
Yeah, sorry guys gold standard and angel food are out

2116
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:45,520
Um, scrubbed from the workloads. Well, that was well, that was heartwarming. That was nice

2117
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,560
We're ready to sour your

2118
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:57,120
Attitude and drawers because we've got uh, the perfect digi bro impress impersonation. Wait impression impression. Let's let's hear it go

2119
02:02:57,600 --> 02:03:04,400
Hey, so I don't have anything really insightful to ask all I want to do is my digi bro impression. So, uh, uh, yeah

2120
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,200
Here I go

2121
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:13,040
Anime is a japanese colopilism for smoking dank weed

2122
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:20,320
Disconnect that's all you get. Yeah, that's it. You're over. Yeah

2123
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,760
That was terrible. Why did you put that in?

2124
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:31,680
Because it's fucking funny is why dude. He said like weed. That's like not what you supposed to be. You're fucking fired

2125
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:37,600
I really I'm I'm quite happy with the hatred for that man. That was immediately a risen

2126
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:41,440
Nate that's cruel

2127
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,440
Well, how was that cruel? That was just fucking funny

2128
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:46,320
I liked it writing him to laugh at him and then

2129
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:50,320
And I didn't I was laughing with you guys. Well, I'm curious

2130
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:57,600
I like dumb voicemails. What do you want from me? Does the impression get more elaborate or is it just that basic all the way through? No

2131
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:00,560
I think he mentions lollies, but like that's basically it

2132
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:06,160
I put that in solely for the anime is a japanese colopilism about smoking weed

2133
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,880
Jesus

2134
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,680
His impression that's my impression that everybody stole

2135
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,040
questionable

2136
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:17,120
That's that was a questionable voicemail inclusion. Uh-oh my position is on the road

2137
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:21,040
Someone else might have to do the extra unpaid work. We're gonna finding the voicemail

2138
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:24,880
We're gonna impeach you four percent. You get four percent, Nate

2139
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:32,080
Okay, I got paid the same amount before and after I started doing the voicemail. He didn't get any more administrative fees for the voicemail

2140
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:38,400
And we appreciate it. You fucking hack. I thank you everyone. Okay. Uh, let's move on next one is from

2141
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:43,440
Okay, this is from like f1m. I get I think is the name. Okay, uh, go friendship

2142
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:49,440
So I listened to the pokemon podcast and I do not understand how people even took this long to talk about the pokemon match up

2143
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:53,200
Communism versus capitalism when capitalism is just better pokemon

2144
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:57,040
Now granted in all the high level replays of pokemon battles that you can watch

2145
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,520
Communism always chaos capitalism

2146
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:05,360
But that's only because communism uses the move self destruct. In fact, that's what makes communism such a weak pokemon

2147
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,680
Because it only knows the attack self destruct

2148
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:12,000
So even when capitalism is knocked out communism still dies on the other hand

2149
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:18,320
Capitalism is a great pokemon with an extremely high attack stat and great bulk. There's only one big problem

2150
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:20,560
It's only attacking move is false swipe

2151
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:24,880
That means when your opponent sends out a pokemon mass starvation or widespread poverty

2152
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:28,640
Capitalism can only be a large part of it, but we'll never KO them

2153
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:33,120
But that is so much better than communism which can always kill its opponent

2154
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:37,760
But will always kill itself and as stated by the official rule set of the pokemon vgc

2155
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:45,200
Also known as lock theory of economics if the move explosion or self destruct leads to a double ko the move user will be declared the loser

2156
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:50,560
Also a quick message to jesse. The reason why anarchy is banned is because it's a dragon type pokemon

2157
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,160
That only knows a move outrage

2158
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:56,880
It resists everything and we all know that the only good fairy type pokemon good virtues of the people

2159
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:00,640
Has too low of a base attacks that fight it despite the type advantage

2160
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:05,600
Leading to this boring ass meta where the only pokemon that can beat anarchy is another anarchy

2161
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,320
Hell yeah, I appreciate that was smart

2162
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:13,200
That was way too high brow

2163
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,880
We are clearly lit. I think we're living in the brightest timeline right now

2164
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:21,200
I'm trying to laugh about fucking dude smoking weed

2165
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:26,560
Yeah, I know I love I love that like the meta, you know the meta is just so rich and so strategic

2166
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:28,480
There's so many options that clever shit out of here

2167
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:35,040
We're dumb dumb on this podcast. Well, okay. I've got good. I understood everything guys

02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:11,120
Yeah, way to go dude. I love about dreams. I'll fucking let's fucking make that the opening. Yeah. Yeah new theme for the next episode. Yeah

2200
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:13,600
Yeah, no, no, it's great

2201
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:17,520
Especially the turn we get a cleaner recording tyranny of the majority

2202
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,120
Uh mage is out there. I will definitely talk about dreams, son

2203
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:27,440
No, do it. I'll fucking do it. I don't care. I'm an accelerationist. I just want to watch the world burn

2204
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:33,280
Let me talk about by trying to keep me down. You guys have given me a power that no one can oppose

2205
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:39,280
That's the super powers will just devour each other and we'll just we'll feast on the scraps

2206
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:45,600
Okay, okay next one. This is from uh apparently you've forgot to eat your greens

2207
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:50,880
How many more do we have a question? What's that? It's the sound of you forgetting to eat your greens

2208
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,520
What the fuck is that?

2209
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,120
Why does that sound like my chi?

2210
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:59,440
It does sound like my chi. Oh, no. Yay

2211
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,680
You've got to eat your greens

2212
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:12,400
It doesn't have lyrics. You've got to, you've got to

2213
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:17,680
You've got to eat your greens

2214
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:21,360
I'll let my greens but I won't set it.

2215
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,080
Fuckers

2216
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:32,800
Guys, I've literally been eating my greens this entire duration of this podcast. Oh, yeah, the rapid food. I've been eating this

2217
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:38,000
I've been eating with a fork just this giant plastic bin of lettuce and nothing else

2218
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,360
There was like one tomato in it

2219
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:44,960
But mostly just lettuce and I've just been just devouring it the whole time people come up to me and they're like

2220
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:50,000
Nate, why don't you ever eat salad dressing on your salad and I'm like because it's gay, bro

2221
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:57,200
I don't need that extra garbage. I just want to chow down. Nate on my name. What what salad dressings keto

2222
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:01,120
Not not ranch dressing. It is. It's all fat

2223
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,480
Well, okay, but I'm not on keto. So I don't I'd have to analyze whether or not that's keto

2224
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,640
Like you know, just necessarily better

2225
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:17,440
Is part of gang gang gang gang gang gang is part of keto eating things that are keto even if you're not hungry

2226
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:24,480
Uh, no, not really. I mean not really. It depends. No, actually a lot of people fast on keto

2227
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:31,680
Yeah, is there any benefit to keto if you're like underweight and you're trying to gain weight as some people are?

2228
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:36,640
No, I don't think so. Okay. Just curious. All right. Uh, I'm not I'm not sure, but I don't think so

2229
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:42,800
All right. All right. The next one's uh, the voicemail from chillin chocolate our old buddy. Uh, get get get it going get it going

2230
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:45,680
Nate you

2231
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:51,120
I took beans to school a can of beans like you recommend. Yeah, and I made fun of me

2232
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:58,960
I told them the bean juice, you know the stuff in the can. It's delicious. It gives texture. Wait. No, it's weird

2233
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:02,240
Why didn't you warn me about this chugging the bean juice?

2234
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:09,200
What are you talking about? I specifically told you you have to drain the gunk from the can you don't eat it in the soup

2235
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:16,480
That's pretty gross. That is gross. I think you're gross too and weird and you deserve to be rid of your bean juice

2236
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:25,200
Um, do not drink your beans. I'm I'm imagining him just just scooping out the beans thrown away and just chugging it right out of the can

2237
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:31,360
Just chug that juice if you if you like the texture with all its nasty beans all its nasty collected beans sediment at the bottom

2238
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,720
And it is a problem

2239
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:35,840
I can't help you with that my dude. This is on you. This is on you

2240
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:42,000
Okay, you know what? I was gonna play this one that was this guy called in his gimmick was it was the pth

2241
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,840
wsep

2242
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,840
Which is the something like

2243
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,840
podcast on someone else's podcast episode one, but you know what it wasn't that funny

2244
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:55,520
Is it is it the is it the one about did you didn't did you mention a podcast where they review other podcasts?

2245
02:12:56,560 --> 02:13:01,680
And people and people in the comment I on the episode I was like I want to hear that and people in the comments said don't it's shit

2246
02:13:02,640 --> 02:13:04,160
Well, okay, I don't know if that was this or not

2247
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:09,440
I I mentioned because I that guy I respect your effort, but it wasn't that funny. So I'm skipping it. So there you know

2248
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:14,240
You've been addressed. Okay. I appreciate that. Yeah, I thought you would I thought you okay. So next one is from

2249
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:19,600
Oh semi normie guy semi normie guy. Okay commence, please

2250
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,080
Any day now

2251
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:26,720
Is it I spelled I spelled play wrong I spelled

2252
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,880
Pally as but Pally in the thing. I'm so sorry everyone. Okay

2253
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:37,840
So a lot of young people struggling to find a purpose in life join the military because they think it's a good way to contribute to something

2254
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,680
That's bigger than themselves

2255
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:42,640
I'm 17 now and I've begun to consider doing the same

2256
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:47,200
It's not that I don't think I can find purpose outside of the military

2257
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:53,200
More that I recognize that it's the most apparent option for me to have the largest net benefit in the world

2258
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:57,840
And because it's hard and I think it would make me a better person

2259
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:01,200
What are y'all's thoughts and do you have any advice for me?

2260
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:07,440
Don't first of all he sounds american right, so I'm uh some of that my connection died

2261
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:09,840
Yeah, I missed a little I missed a little bit of the middle of it

2262
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:13,760
So did I but I I think I'd get the gist of it and my advice is

2263
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:17,920
Don't join the military to be part of something because that's a crack of shit

2264
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:22,000
Join the military to have a comfy cushy job with benefits and a lot of pay

2265
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:28,080
It sounds particularly get a job in the military that doesn't involve actual shooting and getting killed

2266
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:32,400
It sounds like he thinks that the military would be good for him personally

2267
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:37,040
Which you know a lot of people say because like it teaches discipline or whatever, uh, which I mean

2268
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:43,440
Could be true. I mean it's work. It's it pays really well and it has tons of like benefits and stuff

2269
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:48,800
So yeah everybody joined the military. I mean selfishly don't do it for anyone else. Don't do it for your country

2270
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:54,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no don't I mean because that's that's what he let he didn't say I'm trying to find a good paying job

2271
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:57,040
He said I'm trying to join something like a movement or whatever

2272
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:02,080
Uh, wait, did he because I missed the middle. So did he say just I I want to be part of something?

2273
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:04,800
So yeah, that was just gist. Okay. Well, I don't I don't like I mean

2274
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,880
unless you

2275
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:11,040
Really passionately believe that like american foreign policy is great

2276
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:15,840
And you want to like personally put your life on the line to enforce it because you believe in it that strongly

2277
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:19,600
I guess in that case. Yeah, join the military to be part of something

2278
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:26,240
But you know, I don't know what the reason I don't love the military particularly. I'm not I I'm very anti interventionist

2279
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:33,920
But uh, like what what about someone who like like they they recognize that there's flaws with I mean you could argue massive flaws

2280
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,320
I get it uh with the way the american military does stuff

2281
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:40,960
What if you think that like I want to make a positive change to some degree in the military?

2282
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:45,280
Yes, you have to take orders, but like if you're out into shit, perhaps you can you know

2283
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:50,240
Make changes from within. I do you think is that uh, okay? Here's the thing

2284
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:56,000
I mean, I think to do that you would need to be an officer and I think without a college education

2285
02:15:56,240 --> 02:16:01,520
You have a cap on how high you can rise. So like I mean, I I think if you join the military

2286
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:06,000
They will at some point like pay you to go to college and get a degree which will probably allow you to advance

2287
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:11,040
I think probably if you want to be a high-ranking like guy making decisions in the military

2288
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:16,320
Your goal should be to go to college and then join the military and I mean, you know, there's different ways to do that

2289
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,560
military and otherwise

2290
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:24,560
But like just joining the military as like a you know a base recruit is probably not the way to do that

2291
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:31,360
You know what this you know this brings to mind though the lack of community in I don't know America in general

2292
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:35,360
And how I don't know with the death of religion nothing has replaced

2293
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:39,440
I don't know what you mean by that the I mean, yeah, there are more

2294
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:43,680
There are more people that are identifying as non-religious that number is growing

2295
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:49,760
But the number of people that are identifying as like devoutly religious and evangelical christians is also growing

2296
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:54,080
Okay, that's fine. That's fine. That's not really what I mean scary by the way

2297
02:16:54,560 --> 02:16:58,320
Well, I mean, I hate religion more than anyone in the world. So I'm totally it's not even just that it's religion

2298
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:03,360
It's that it's evangelicals which are I mean, am I crazy? Are they scary? I think they're scary

2299
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Um, uh, well, I find religion pretty terrifying. These are these are the millets

2300
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:10,560
These are the militant ones that are gaining traction

2301
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:14,960
Well, okay. Okay, sure. That's we're becoming we're becoming more just like in politics

2302
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:19,040
We're as a nation we're becoming more divided organizing more. Yeah more people are not

2303
02:17:19,680 --> 02:17:25,040
Centrist or not send more people are not moderate christians more people are either atheists or fucking

2304
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:31,280
The pray the gay away ones. Okay fair and that's a that's an issue that should be addressed

2305
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:37,440
However, I got on the subject of thinking about it fair enough on the subject though. Oh, I just pray the gay is not religious

2306
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:39,760
Yeah

2307
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:47,200
Indeed in in relation to this guy's comment though. I think the relevant thing to me is that uh, uh, I do feel that like as

2308
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:51,680
Uh, a larger population a larger amount of the population gets less religious

2309
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:56,480
Even if you know whatever they polarize more and some people get more like I do think that those people

2310
02:17:56,880 --> 02:18:03,440
Like there's a strength in a collective belief structure or whatever of like, you know christianity or judaism or you know

2311
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:08,640
Whatever it is. Uh, and I do like this guy's saying he he he wants to be a part of something

2312
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:12,480
And I think that is a very common thing that a lot of people are lacking

2313
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:17,840
And I do not have an answer what I personally believe in I don't think is actually good enough

2314
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:20,720
But it's this like starfleet like humanism

2315
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:24,160
Kind of I mean, I guess we know we have a name for it

2316
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:29,760
What's that? It's weird utilitarianism. Obviously. Oh, right. Yeah, of course weird utilitarian. Yeah, I forgot

2317
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:33,440
Uh, uh, but like I the the problem with that

2318
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:35,360
I think is that it's very impersonal

2319
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:40,400
And I don't think human beings get much value out of particularly abstract concepts like that

2320
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:43,840
Including me include like on a day to day. Do I feel more fulfilled?

2321
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:45,040
Think about that

2322
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:49,200
Not really because my actions aren't like if you're in a church group and you can go like hang out with your peeps

2323
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:55,040
And you can go have a personal relationship with god as they lie and say is the thing that you're doing

2324
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:58,240
That probably is very good. And you would appreciate that

2325
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:00,400
um

2326
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:02,400
I and I don't but good answer

2327
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,400
But I mean form a community somehow you

2328
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:10,080
I mean, I think you would agree that uh church is not the only way to get that sense of community

2329
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:14,560
Uh, but you know what though? I think it's like in practical terms. I don't know

2330
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:17,200
What your average like, uh

2331
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:25,360
Non-religious person will replace the thing that is lost. How about uh, I mean, how about like a volunteer organization?

2332
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:30,960
Yeah, how about competitive gaming, bro? Why not? Why not?

2333
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:36,960
Sounds great. That sounds awesome. Well, that doesn't sound bad a fandom on tumblr. That was me

2334
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:38,160
Sure

2335
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:44,320
For you know what it become become a furry become a furry. You know what it is though. I become a fucking juggler whoop whoo

2336
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:48,320
Yeah, they have a community tight. They have a community tight community

2337
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:52,000

2340
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:07,040
Um, I don't know. Uh, okay. I'd say you got to form a community somehow. Um

2341
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:11,200
Meet people with like-minded ideas in your community

2342
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:18,240
Maybe join clubs in your area like being part of the anime club was actually helpful and good for me in college

2343
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:23,440
And having something like that. It's just like a good thing to do. So I guess what we're saying is like, um

2344
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:27,200
If you want it this guy wants to join the military things, it would be good for him

2345
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:27,760
Do it

2346
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:33,360
I think we are in agreement that it's not a good idea just to be just because he wants to be a part of something comma

2347
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:36,800
Anything in all caps, you know on on a practical level

2348
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:41,040
Like if someone's just desperate for meaning in their life and they don't have a solution

2349
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:46,160
I I would never say this is like a great idea, but like if you really need something

2350
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:51,200
I don't know. I mean, that's I think of worse ideas. I just don't want to leave him with like no

2351
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:56,400
I don't know no answer. My answer is don't do it for that reason alone

2352
02:20:56,640 --> 02:21:00,160
Do it if you do it if you think it will benefit you in

2353
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:04,000
Whatever that means like yeah learning discipline the fact

2354
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,880
Yeah, just the fact that it's a secure job if you joining any group just for the practical benefits

2355
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:14,800
That's like that's like being religious because like you're scared of hell. I mean, that's why most that's why most people join

2356
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,880
Have jobs just for the practical benefits

2357
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:24,480
Right. Uh, I mean job. Yeah, you know being in the military offers relatively like the you know, best pay most most security

2358
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:29,120
Most benefits. Maybe it's just pragmatically the best thing to do. I don't know brotherhood. I mean if you're in like the marines

2359
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:33,840
I don't know how the army's like, uh, I don't know that probably goes a long way to make you feel like you're part of something

2360
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:38,080
I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it's tough. No, it's tough. It wouldn't be it wouldn't be my choice

2361
02:21:38,480 --> 02:21:39,680
I feel like

2362
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:44,400
Yeah, work is work if you can make money doing something do it make your money and get out

2363
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:50,160
Yeah, but he wants to but like belonging to joining the military. I mean, you know, that's gonna come with

2364
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:54,080
You're gonna be you're gonna be the product of your circumstances. You're gonna

2365
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:59,040
I don't know. I don't I'm not trying to shit on veterans. I'm not trying to shit on veterans

2366
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:02,000
But there's like there's a military mindset like people have a

2367
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:09,040
If you know, it changes what you believe it changes what you how you see the world that experience is gonna affect who you are

2368
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:13,600
I don't know. I mean, so I have to think about like if you think I feel like I feel like I feel like

2369
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:20,720
Military people they come out like they they tend to come out, you know, more nationalistic. Maybe more right wing. I don't know

2370
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:25,920
Oh, well, okay. Is that necessarily bad? I can't claim it. It's necessarily bad. I think that's a generalization

2371
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:31,040
It's not it's not my favorite, but whatever. I think you're the military people I know of

2372
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:36,240
That's not everyone, but I think that's the trend and and like responsible people

2373
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:41,520
So like if you're looking for something to make you a responsible adult being in the militaries

2374
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:46,720
It seems to work a lot of the time. I haven't I haven't ever met a military man

2375
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:51,360
Or woman who was like a slob and a lazy piece of shit. Sure

2376
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:56,480
Actually, I mean, it's so there's some military my mom told me like so there was this guy

2377
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,200
back in the thing. Yeah, he

2378
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:05,040
Currently lives above my apartment and before he went to military. He was

2379
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:09,600
Kind of rude and a bit disrespectful and he was a bit of a hassle

2380
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:14,560
And he made a lot of noise and and was a bit of a slob, but then he went to military and when he returned

2381
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:18,480
He he was like a completely changed person. He was more nicer to my mom than he

2382
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:24,720
Discipline can be a valuable thing in life. Sure. Sure. He became more responsible, you know, I I have

2383
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:31,920
Thought previously about joining the mill. I've never seriously entertained, but I have dabbled with like man, wouldn't that be

2384
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:36,160
Nice to just go through a process might be really hard might be terrible

2385
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:41,760
But you come out on the end like it just seems to happen that you like if you make it you're now like organized

2386
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
You're more like goal oriented

2387
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:49,200
It can give you like some companionship and I've met, you know, again, these are just the practical benefits. I don't

2388
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,840
I'm not a military guy for sure

2389
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:56,080
But I don't know so I've kind of thought along the same lines a little bit as this guy

2390
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:57,840
Let's talk about the community more about just the practical better

2391
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,840
There's nothing that can possibly be wrong about getting as much money as you can while you're young

2392
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:05,680
That's fair. That's just don't be one of those

2393
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,240
Just don't just don't become one of those fucking

2394
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:15,520
Manga-loids who goes and does basic training and then washes out and comes home and struts around town with their fatigues on like

2395
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:20,000
They think they're hot shit and everyone should bow down to them when they didn't do shit and they ain't shit and they never

2396
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,400
Going to be shit. I don't like that guy. Agreed Jordan. I don't like I don't like my friend from high school Jordan

2397
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:31,680
Specific person I'm talking about. I hate you. You cock-sucking piece of shit. I hope you're dead

2398
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:39,280
Excellent, okay, let's let's switch it up and go from discipline to raw pleasure

2399
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:44,800
Because let's check in with our boy center point who's reporting back from his he was in cancun

2400
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:50,400
Last week and was asking us for advice on what to do and we all resoundingly told him

2401
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:56,800
Fuck some island pussy my dude. Smash that shit wide open. I did uh, I did

2402
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
And let's find out but mage did not fair

2403
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:02,880
Okay, mage was the conscientious objector

2404
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:12,000
Uh, I actually don't know where it is. No, it's in mexico, isn't it? Yeah, okay. I'm wrong. Oh, is it in mexico?

2405
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:16,080
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right, but he was talking about being on the sea and enjoying the sun

2406
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:20,240
So, okay, it's it's like I was actually imagining it was in spain, uh, but whatever. Oh, yeah

2407
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:24,560
Okay, I thought I don't know why I thought I was not anyway. Let's hear center point. What do you got for us?

2408
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,080
Go

2409
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:27,840
Hey guys

2410
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:32,800
I'm back from oh, yeah, cancun man and I gotta say I

2411
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:36,560
Fucked some my soul for right on over

2412
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:41,360
Oh god. All right, so no whores were involved in the story

2413
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:48,000
Oh, okay. I didn't hear your advice. I don't limit our whores center point. He didn't hear it in time. I know morning

2414
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:54,800
I went out and uh got myself on a fucking water jet pack and water jet packs are pretty like in mario sunshine

2415
02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:00,480
But they're also impossible to control and I may or may not have crashed directly into the water

2416
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:03,520
Uh three times, uh, and by the time I heard

2417
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:07,680
The podcast and this great sage advice that you've given me

2418
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:10,880
Yeah, correct. I was in pain

2419
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Oh, so much pain

2420
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,520
Uh, so I appreciate the advice, uh, sorry that I completely and totally failed

2421
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:23,120
Hey, man. Yeah

2422
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:29,120
Whoops, he didn't let us down. He won't you let god down that one if only we'd released it sooner

2423
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:32,640
Well, you know, this is a great life lesson. Never trust a jet pack

2424
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:39,680
When when he says jet pack does he mean like a fucking mario sunshine ass? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they got water jet packs

2425
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:44,480
Wait, is that real? Yeah, they're real Ben. They're fucking real. I never heard of that. That's awesome

2426
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:48,400
There's mario powell. I'm gonna go try it now and end up in a hospital bed next to that

2427
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:53,520
No, that's fucking cool. What the fuck? Yeah, I'm fucking jealous. I'm gonna do that shit. That's dope as hell

2428
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:59,280

But just prioritize the puss. That's you know, yeah, it's about balancing life. Not not similar even

They left a second voicemail too, but it was basically the same information

Yeah, I checked this out on twitter at pcp dating is the original guys. This is at pcp dating sim

2447
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,920
These are a separate organization

2448

Wait, wait, didn't didn't he say it was at real pcp dating sim?

Yeah, it's real. They're like green instead of pink like the other one

2451
02:28:56,160 --> 02:29:01,280
So I guess there's two competing dating sims and this one's and this one's coming out a day earlier

2455
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:22,240
I this is great. Now we get to compare and contrast. Mark has to always use competition. So I like this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2456
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:24,240
I'm

2457
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:26,240
I'm I'm titillated

2458
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:31,520
I like that when you go to pcp dating and you look at the promo image pin tweet

2459
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:34,560
There's a quote says the pcp dating sim is a fake project

2460
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:40,080
Which isn't actually happening which is a quote from me which I still stand by and I don't believe will release on that day

2461
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:44,720
I mean, we'll just see what happens. We'll see what happens on april fools day

2462
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:49,120
I mean, it's a suspicious day to release your game, right? It gave me my

2463
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:55,920
Did my doubts, but I talked to a lemon tart who's on the project and he assures me that it is real despite its

2464
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:58,480
questionable launch date

2465
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:00,000

Commence the plan has been set. Thanks to my dank rimes. You're in for a bad time

2485
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:26,400
And I have devised the most cool

2486
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:33,840
Even as I record this I have mobilized my many snake bodies into action

2487
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:37,520
Oh my god

2488
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:40,080
And you will never see it

2489
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:42,080

2497
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:23,600
You hold them. You hold them up on him. My urethra isn't snake proof. I didn't foresee this

02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:27,600
Get him get him

2499
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:32,560

2503
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:55,680
This is just like

2504
02:32:56,160 --> 02:33:01,840
In new york city at the nintendo store back in like 2002 when you could go there

2505
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:05,760
And charles marnay would be behind like a fucking wall and you could talk tomorrow

2506
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,280
And he would say yahoo and then you'd be like wait mario. Are you actually there and he would say yeah

2507
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:13,840
And then he would say like you're wearing a hat

2508
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:18,640
That's red and then you would piss your pants and die them snakes

2509
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:23,520
You got a little bit of a charles marnay red hat thing going on right here

2510
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:25,840
We're not even swearing me

02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,960
We're doing so much damage. I wear 600 pairs of sunglasses and still have my eyes to spare

2512
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:37,360
You know, you know at them snakes, I think we can get along. Do you want do you want to do you want to hang out after this?

2516
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:54,320
You can try and drive them snakes out of ireland and I'm just gonna

2517
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:12,880
I'm not gonna celebrate st. Patrick's day. I'm gonna keep the united kingdom together brexit where we're feeling it

2522
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:35,680
We've got a progressive snake policy. Um, all right. That's that's my combo attack

2523
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:39,440
That's my combo attack them snakes. We really did some massive damage here today

2524
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:44,720
There is more damage to be done for I have written a diss track to be performed alive

2525
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:47,200
Oh my god. Whoa. Whoa

2526
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:53,520

2527
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:56,080

02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:58,880
How does it feel how does it feel to be savagely owned by a snake collective?

2541
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:06,080
Like I say the arc that uh them snakes hates me uh and is my enemy has been well built up across the show

2542
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:11,680
And I'm glad that we finally have some payoff to this uh character arc, which I knew was happening

2560
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:26,480
Is canonically the the bunch of snakes from my webcomic bail jpe, which you can read on aksadventures.site

2561
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:32,640
I've been animating during the podcast and I'm I'm getting I'm it's gonna be done. It's gonna be cool. It's gonna be cool

2562
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:38,480
It's gonna be a real thing. Oh, is it ending? Are you finishing the finale? I'm I'm animating the finale and it's

2563
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:43,440
I don't know when it'll be done. What's like the eta. Oh, okay. Okay. Eta is like april

2564
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:48,480
The middle of april maybe that's only a month. It's only a month away. How exciting nice

2565
02:37:49,120 --> 02:37:55,360
Uh, I'm stoked. I'm fucking stoked. I got I gotta catch up or should I should I just wait until the finale and then binge the whole thing

2566
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:59,920
I mean, maybe I'm tempted to do that. So you gotta finish soon so I can do that

2567
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:04,000
You know, I don't know about you guys, but I feel like a great weight

2568
02:38:04,480 --> 02:38:08,000
Relatively speaking is off my shoulders. I've got a couple more that I'm gonna be finishing soon

2569
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:13,120
I feel like I really am turning the page that I've unburdened myself of a lot of problems

2570
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:14,160
I feel good

2571
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,200
I feel like I've completed a bunch of projects and I'm almost down to the bunch more

2572
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:22,480
And then I'm really gonna be launching into some new shit and doing good. Dude. I gotta say I feel the exact same way

2573
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:25,200
You know, I finally finished that great bugbear

2574
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:29,200
10 paces and draw and then just like a couple days later. I bang out

2575
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:33,040
Nuts the beginning, which was pretty fun. I feel

2576
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:40,720
Like I like a little bit before 10 paces. I posted a new vapor's page for the first time in a while. Yeah, I'm I'm with you

2577
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:46,080
Uh, you know what? Let me just say on 10 paces. I think we all got a little bit of the rad con bug

2578
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:51,200
Or the the bite just a little bit because I'm not gonna overburden myself again the same way that I was

2579
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:56,800
With rad con 3 and stuff. But but and you know more than that watching rad con

2580
02:38:57,520 --> 02:38:59,520
Rather watching 10 bases and draw live

2581
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:05,040
Which like the structure of that show was absolutely perfect for a premiere. There was an arc

2582
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:10,080
There was a narrative like live as in like everyone in the chat for the premiere and stuff. Yeah, exactly

2583
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:16,400
People were there was great. People were fucking dope and like like every round people were like screaming like who they were like

2584
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:19,520
It's gonna be munchy. It's gonna be ben. No tom gang. Tom gang

2585
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:23,280
Yeah, and people went nuts every time there was a there was an elimination

2586
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:28,000
That was like the perfect show to be doing a premiere. Yeah, it was so good. It was the best

2587
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:28,960
It was such a good time

2588
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:35,120
So I don't know about you guys, but I'm feeling great about a lot of things going on with me and with the pcp and rad con 4 when

2589
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:43,120
Uh, I I perpetually I perpetually feel like uh, I don't get to work on the projects that I want to and I'm bogged down

2590
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:47,760
Do you know what you mean? I want to uh, and so I I've felt like that for half a year now and I continue to do

2591
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:51,520
Yeah, yeah when you see any light at the end of that tunnel anytime soon. No

2592
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:57,120
No, okay. I I was feeling that way for a long time like maybe the better part of a year

2593
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:03,520
Um, but I mean, I guess I guess hindsight will tell if it's over or if this is a false light

2594
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:09,440
But I'm trying you know, I want to capitalize on this feeling now. I feel like I finally have a chance to get to get back

2595
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:12,400
To uh, you got to ride good vibes while you got it

2596
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:18,320
Exactly and I've got I've got my big ass biggest we had whatever coming out in 43 minutes

2597
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:21,600
And I'm pretty stoked about that. Oh my god, and I've got a video

2598
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:25,440
I've got a big video coming out and it's gonna be fucking terrible

2599
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:33,200
You guys ever you you're right a thing like a thing and then because you're editing it

2600
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:36,080
You have to listen back to it and while you're listening back to it and editing it

2601
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:38,560
You realize that you don't agree with yourself at all

2602
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:43,120
And everything you say is fucking stupid and you're going to rightfully get crucified

2603
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:49,040
And you're going to have to make alt accounts to crucify yourself because you fucking deserve it

2604
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:54,560
It's that's justice to down go down vote. You're on video for that. Stay. I'm looking forward to it

2605
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:59,520
We gotta protect this from getting into the algorithm. Were you saying something mage? No

2606
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:06,240
No, my life my life my life is perpetually like that one terrible joke character from disney's the hunt back at

2607
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:09,440
Notre Dame where he gets full. Oh, you mean the hush back of Notre Dame

2608
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:15,280
He gets freed from his place like his like I don't even know what you call it

2609
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:19,280
This is like old timey prison where you just like stand in the middle of town with your hands and your head

2610
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:23,200
Locked inside a bar that he gets the stock the stockades right the stockade

2611
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:29,280
And then he walks a little bit and then he gets trapped inside of another prison cell after rejoicing that he was free

2612
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:32,400
That's what my life is continuously. Are you are you like I know what you mean?

2613
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:36,880
Are you like sideshow bob in cape fear just stepping on rakes over and over again?

2614
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:41,920
Just an infant just a whole field of rakes. You just keep stepping on them. Yeah, I I'm like, oh my god

2615
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,760
I'm done with the district thing now. I can do all the way. I have to edit that show

2616
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:52,960
Okay, you know guys, uh, I mean I I the reason I'm feeling good is because I've made some hard choices and I've cut certain things

2617
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:57,600
I've come to conclusions about certain things and uh, it hasn't been easy

2618
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,120
I've had to made some hard

2619
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:00,800
Basically cuts of things I wanted to do

2620
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:04,320
But I've just got a I've got to prioritize not even just the stuff that I want to do

2621
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:08,880
But that the audience wants to see that will be good financially and you know what?

2622
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:13,200
I don't know. I feel like I've arrived at a pretty good place with what I'm going to be doing next. So

2623
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:16,080
Sick. We'll see fucking see. Yeah fucking sick

2624
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:19,680
And I guess that's it. Are we have we come to the end?

2625
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:23,280
Of this this is like a two and a half hour episode

2626
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:27,520
Yeah, two hour 40. Awesome. Yeah, awesome. Oh god. It was good

2627
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:30,400
