00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
Hello, everybody, and welcome to yet another Pro Crastinators Podcast interview.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:12,800
It's me, Digibro, once again interviewing a fellow member of the PCP. Today we have The Davoo.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Hi.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,300
Or The Davoo Collective, as the meme has become. Thanks to Jesse.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,300
Yeah.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,500
How do you feel about that meme? I've never gotten an impression of whether you are indifferent towards it or what.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm on don't acknowledge policy because that makes it funnier. That's how you do it.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If I did anything that gets in on the joke, then that doesn't work, right?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Alright, so Davoo, in the last interview I did with Jesse, I talked about how the PCP sort of formed

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,500
out of what was originally the horseshoe crew with me, Jesse, the T-Bap, and Hippo, all becoming friends

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,500
because we all admired one another's work. I didn't mention in there that the reason Tom came in,

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,000
which was sometime later, was because me and him had been longtime friends, he came down.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,500
And by longtime you mean like about one year prior.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, before Jesse though. I met Tom first. He was my first Brony friend back then.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now it's longtime. It's been well over three years.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Tom came to BronyCon the second time with Nate and Ben, or maybe it was the first time they came.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They brought him with them. They drove down with Tom. He talked to them the whole ride down, became pals with them.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
After BronyCon we threw him in the chat, so that's sort of how he got there.

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,500
But you were up until very recently with the addition of Jeff. You were the most recent addition.

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:05,500
So I want you to tell me about your experience with us from the outside, because you're the ascended fanboy, essentially.

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,500
You're the guy who was just a fan of everybody else and eventually became a part of the group.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well you know, I kind of think that Hippo was also an ascended fanboy, although he ascended very very quickly.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Obviously he has more talent than I do and he was doing the right things in the right time.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's better at manipulating people, I think.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He puts it that way himself, that he started making videos that he was trying to get the attention of the people he was a fan of.

28
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
And when he said that in podcasts, I'm like, oh, I need to do that.

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:03:00,500
But the funny thing is that we had all, or at least I had heard of him long beforehand because of the fact that the reason his give and take channel has so many subscribers is that he did these compilation videos where he would take every single time that a certain word was said in MLP and make a video of that.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So like he would have the Twilight Twilight Twilight collection where it's just every time someone said the word Twilight in the entire show, he'd compile it all into one video.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And those would always get their own posts on Equestria Daily and stuff, so I had heard of him way before he started doing the analysis compilation videos.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But that was what got everyone's attention and, you know, like when he started doing the stuff that addressed us, that's when we were like, oh, this guy knows who we all are, that's cool, you know.

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,500
You, my first exposure to you was that you were a commenter and a big fan.

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Yeah, man, duple do.

35
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
So how'd it happen when all went down?

36
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Okay, so let's see here.

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I found out about you first.

38
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,500
I mean, everyone in the TPC found out about you first when you think about it.

39
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Yeah, probably.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I posted a My Little Pony video and I wanted to see how the views were going.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,500
So I checked it on my phone when I was at work and your videos kept appearing as the suggested videos.

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,000
And I just had this moment of, you know, I want to get into new things.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will look at this Digibroni with his analysis.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So I put some of those videos on and then I thought this is pretty, pretty cool guy.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's like, analyzing and I like that and he's making a distinction from reviews.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
I like that too.

47
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
And I thought, yeah, but just wait, you know, he's all intellectual sounding.

48
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Like I'm just going to prepare for the moment.

49
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
I don't know if this is going to happen.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,000
I just need to emotionally prepare for when he's going to make videos about how the

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Broni community is homophobic and racist and how we all need to shape up or something.

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I just been burned by that experience, won too many movie bobs in the past.

53
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
And so I had to prepare myself.

54
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,500
But then my perception of you started to clear up when you came out with this vlog with you and your brother.

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,000
It was just an audio log talking about why it's totally fucking okay to cutting square guy.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Damn it.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I thought, wow, that was really cool.

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Like you were like totally being in favor of swearing and it was, it was all, it was just nice.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was like, this guy is pretty cool.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And then you came out with a video saying, all right, guys, I know how you say that Twilight Princess,

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the Twilight Princess has become an unrelatable character now to the character of Twilight because

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
now she's a princess and now she's perfect.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But I think she's very relatable because I'm a princess and I'm perfect.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,500
And I just had this incredible moment of ascension like Twilight did.

65
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,000
So she's totally relatable to me.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,500
What are you guys talking about?

67
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,000
And I'm like, oh my God, this guy, I can't believe you can get away with being this egotistical on the internet.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,500
I want to be like that.

69
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
So yeah, that's when I became like a fan of you.

70
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,500
And then through just sheer chance or something.

71
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I happened to look at my YouTube feed of like, I don't know.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,500
I somehow looked at the videos that you had recently liked at one point a few months into being a fan of you.

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:09,500
And one video that you had liked was a podcast you had done with Drowning and Footwear.

75
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,000
And so I just so happened to find out about Jesse before anyone else did.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I just so happened to see that you would.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,500
So I knew about Jesse before the horse shoe saga ever began.

79
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,000
What was the podcast I did with him before the horse cast?

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,500
You did three podcasts with him before he became a full time pony guy.

81
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What were they called?

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Um, the first one was called Footwear and Digi Brony.

84
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,000
No foot.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,500
I don't know whatever.

86
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,000
I remember the second one was called Footwear and Digi Brony ride again.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
And that was the first one I listened to.

88
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I just thought because I knew there were three before, but I thought they were all called horse cast.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Like I just thought that that was the name before our podcast.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Now that name, that name showed up as the first.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
After he made his horse shoe saga beginning.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And, uh, yeah, so I listened to that second one first.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Uh, that podcast made me a huge fan of you.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And then also at the same time introduced me to and made me a huge fan of Jesse.

97
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Uh, within 30 seconds, he had me sold when you were talking about equestria girls.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And he said, Oh yeah, but you love that shallow, shill, shit fest.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And like the way he said it, which obviously I can't imitate at all.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It was like, Oh man, I love this guy.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's like, uh, he's like that quirky drunken uncle character, you know?

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's such a cool.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Especially because that's what his, his avatar looked like at the time.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And these, these podcasts I'm talking about are deleted.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Uh, I mean, I have them on my computer, but I don't think Jesse would allow me transmitting them to anyone.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So, you know, we're going to have to like, we'll have to like forge it into his will or something.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So, yeah.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So like you just, the things you talked about in that podcast, I just had never, I take for granted now that whenever anyone in this group opens their mouth, something interesting is spoken.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I really take that for granted.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Like, you know, there was a time when I listened to this podcast three years ago where that was really astounding to me.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That podcast I listened to, I was like, every single thing that is being said is like changing my life forever.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The most interesting inspirational thing.

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And, you know, I really have to step back and remember how, um, a hundred, like statistically a hundred percent of podcasts are meaningless and boring, right?

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And like, there's just, none of them are good except for biggest problem.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And I guess the two offshoots that they have now, you know, that kind of stuff.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But yeah, I was just like, you talked about how doing YouTube videos just got you laid a week before recording the podcast.

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm like, whoa, that's really cool.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You told Jesse, yeah, I lost my virginity 20 times.

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I was like, dang.

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So I think that I was probably the first fan of the procrastinators of this affiliation.

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I was probably the first huge fan of it.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Maybe. I mean, there may have been a couple of people, but yeah.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So that's what I would say.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And so I witnessed the whole, the whole rise and fall of the horseshoe saga.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I would say I would agree with the idea of you being the first, the first fan of it as a collective, I think.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, because I was like, oh man, these guys are great.

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I hope they do more podcasts.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And you guys did not make this whole chat.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You guys didn't start talking all the time until a while after that.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I had this burning desire in my heart for you to become friends and to do all that stuff.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And then that ended up happening.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And I was like, yeah.

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, it was an exciting time.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So you found out about us before we even started this chat.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But you didn't come into it until much, much later, like a year and a half later.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So you were like a, like a long time fan, essentially, before joining in.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's why I like to think of you as the Ascended Fan Boy, just because it was such a long, long period.

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And what you just described with that first podcast is something that you don't do this nearly as much now,

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
but for a very long time, you were kind of infamous among all of us for your constant revelations,

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
where it seemed like every video you watched changed your life in some, like, definitively...

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It was true.

145
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Taboo had messaged me with these, like, emails that are, like...

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It would be like, I'd put out a video and you'd send me, like, a seven paragraph email about how everything in the world was different now

147
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and everything, you looked at everything completely differently.

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I think that maybe only happened a couple of times, but okay.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It felt frequent. Like, it would be comments or emails and stuff like that.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hmm. Well, it didn't feel frequent to me, but whatever.

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You know, so this is like the narrative that I want to clear up about the TPC and, like, where it came from.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Because I feel like a lot of people, if their introduction to it is this channel and these podcasts,

153
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
they might kind of subconsciously think of Nate as, like, the headmaster of it, and I don't know.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's obviously the one who talks the most, and maybe if that's your definition, then fine.

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But I do think of, like, if you were to, like, write the band Wiki, the founding members were you and Jesse.

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Right.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And, like, the fact that all of us found out about you, and even Jeff, like, all of us, like, whether it was in the pony community

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
or the anime community, they all found about you first, because you've always been the most popular one.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Right.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So, you know, like, that's...

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So, at the time Jesse found me, he was more popular than me.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It was just that he happened to find me...

163
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, for, like, a couple of weeks.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, he happened to be...

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Because I think he found me straight from the R My Little Pony subreddit, because he's, you know, a Reddit perruser.

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Not so much comment or anything, but he...

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, and actually, at that time, I even had more subs than Jesse did when I listened to that podcast,

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
because I had just done a couple of pony videos that had a lot of views that people subscribed for.

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's worth mentioning that you had...

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You have a few...

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This has continued even past the pony videos, but you're a person who...

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Not unlike Jesse, has a few videos that way exceed your sub count and what is typical of your channel.

175
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

176
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What are these videos, and why are they like this?

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Um, we'll see.

178
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Back when I got into My Little Pony, I was like, I gotta make some sort of content out of this, right?

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Right.

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I gotta make something, because that's what pony does to you at the time when it's new.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You have to make something, and I'm like, what can I make that's different?

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not enough of an art to do art, can't do music, I wouldn't do fan fiction.

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I was on the MLP board on 4chan, and someone was like, hey, what's your predictions for season three?

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And I'm like, predictions.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Predictions could be a YouTube video.

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I can do YouTube videos competently, so I'll do that.

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And so I did a video of My Little Pony season three predictions, you know, pretty crappy video,

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
but I just kind of wanted to do it, just to do a pony thing.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And YouTube fucked me over by not giving me a thumbnail for it.

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It was just a gray with like three gray circles inside.

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So no one watched it at the time until custom thumbnails became a thing later.

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And so eventually that one got like 50,000 views.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But yeah, that did become the most viewed video on my channel.

195
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Are you still there?

196
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah.

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And then I made one for season four predictions, and it ended up getting like a total of 400,000 views.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah.

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Which was more views than any video you've ever made up until like last summer, I think.

201
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah.

202
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Like that was, it had more views than any video that you had ever done.

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I would like to say more views than anyone in this chat had ever done,

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
other than that one Jesse video that has like three million views now.

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Because if you want to talk about, if you want to talk about videos with an anomalous view count,

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
look any further than horseshoe review bats.

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah.

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Which was the most, I have no idea what happened with that one, but anyway.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Fluttershy's ass.

210
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's all that happened.

211
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Fluttershy's ass.

212
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But he put more asses on more thumbnails after that, and it didn't have the same Fluttershy effect.

213
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, it was also bats.

214
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It was something about that episode, dude.

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't know what it was.

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Something about bats, everyone's bats video got more fucking views.

217
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't get it.

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's such a weird anomaly.

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Maybe it was Batman that it got all these, like YouTube algorithms got fucked up or something.

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The streams got crossed.

221
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

222
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So then, so that was my My Little Pony season four predictions video.

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That was how I was looking for views on it, and that's how I found about you.

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So very worthwhile making that video just to find out about you.

225
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And so then I made a season five predictions video, and by the time season four was ending,

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I was like, okay, it's time for me to become YouTube.

228
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So I thought, well, I might as well do a season five predictions and have actual production value or something this time.

229
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And I'll use that to kickstart my channel, because everyone's going to watch that, and I'll promote myself afterward.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Everyone watched it, 200,000 views, tons of people subscribed as usual, and then none of them watched my videos.

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh well, you know.

232
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So yeah.

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And then, as I was doing YouTube videos, talking about stuff, I'm like, well, time to talk about, time to do the thing that every YouTuber does and talk about something that's really important to you in your own personal history.

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So I made Roller Crooks to Tycoon videos.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The first one is sitting at 40,000 views right now, and the second one has about 150,000 views, which is nice.

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And again, this is like-

238
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
A constant stream of terrible comments that eventually led you to finally close them.

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And which then have led to some people going to my discussion tab and commenting there instead.

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You know, but whatever.

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And keep in mind, we're talking less than 1,000 views a video, then a video that ultimately got 150,000 views, and then a bunch of videos with less than 1,000 views after that.

242
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Right.

243
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then I did an Undertale video, and that got 350,000 views, and was the eternal-

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And it seems like it's going to forever haunt Nate, because, you know, his Undertale video is the huge, perfect one, got no views.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But it's the inverse for me, too, because his Undertale video got him $100 of patronage, and mine got me none!

246
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
300,000 views!

247
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I promoted my Patreon at the end.

248
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No one thought it was that good, apparently.

249
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah.

250
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Because it wasn't written in a way that anyone could really get the point, I guess.

251
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

252
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Your Undertale video has all the views, because it was both timely and had a great title.

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Whereas Nate's-

254
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Or a provocative title.

255
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Nate's was-

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Apparently.

257
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That's what a great title is. It's a provocative title.

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Nate's has a- came out six months late, and has a title that just makes people pissed off when they read it.

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So, yeah, it wasn't the best competition there.

260
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

261
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But, alright, so that's-

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's it. That's all the videos I've done that have gotten a substantial amount of views.

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Actually, you know what? Let me see.

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think my- what is it called? Nuclear Throne video has gotten up to 20,000 views, I think.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay, that's not good.

266
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Let me just check.

267
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This is, like, weird. The sheer lack of middle ground that my videos have.

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's see.

269
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And I ended up hiding the Season 4 predictions and Season 3 predictions, along with most of my old videos.

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I kept the Season 5 predictions one just because it, like, advertises my channel, so I feel like it's part of the narrative.

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But let's see here.

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
366,287,000. I'm going in backwards order.

273
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
185,000. Then it shoots down to 49,000. Then it shoots down to 13,000, which is my Gravity Falls video.

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And the Nuclear Throne one has less than 9,000. So, yeah, there's just, like, I have a grand total of- of two videos that are in the tens of thousands of views.

275
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Only two videos are in that status.

276
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Very messed up.

277
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Very- very large.

278
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But I deserved it. Didn't ever make content that was consistent and, like, made sense to people and was frequent, you know.

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't care anymore, um, because I decided to put my channel into whatever I want to do whenever I happen to get around it with status,

280
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
because now I'm just an editor for you.

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

282
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And, uh, it was a really hard decision to make, but once I made it, uh, it's not hard to live with that decision at all.

283
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But I will say, it's probably- it was probably the only hard decision I've ever had to make in my life so far.

284
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It was deciding whether or not to work on my channel or work on yours.

285
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Every other decision I've ever made in my life was pretty straightforward.

286
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It was- that was the only complicated one I've ever had to do.

287
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But now that I've made it, I'm definitely glad that I did.

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
All right.

289
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So continue the- oh, god.

290
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
To continue the narrative that I was sort of building towards there, um, about getting to know you, so to say.

291
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Um, so you had these- these big pony videos. I never actually watched them, uh, the predicted ones.

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Good.

293
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Um, and-

294
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm glad.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think- I don't- like, when was the first time that one of us acknowledged you?

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Like, because I remember that you appeared as a commentator.

297
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I remember, like, responding to a comment.

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Responding to a comment or, like, saying my name.

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Uh...

300
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You know, because that was, um, I actually recorded it.

301
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, my god.

302
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It was on the, uh, so- well, I mean, I downloaded the, uh-

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, the pump call. That's right. That's how I started talking to you more.

304
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Actually, no, no, I downloaded that episode when it came out and then I isolated the specific spot where it happens, you know.

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Right.

306
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah, I was gonna keep this.

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah, so, um, how I- I guess how I was trying to, like-

308
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was trying to convince you that I was a huge fan of you, so I would-

309
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah.

310
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
In the pub crawl, I would be making weird references to things that only I would know because I'd listed all your old podcasts.

311
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah, see, that's-

312
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I could've done better if- I could've done better if I'd actually, like, read all of your blog, but I haven't done that yet.

313
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, nobody has, but, uh, unless they've been around since back then.

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But, yeah, it was because-

315
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Because I get a lot of comments, you know, and I have a lot of frequent commenters.

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
There's- like, anyone who comments enough of my videos, I will eventually recognize them.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And I get a lot of emails and stuff, but it's not usual for me to, like, you know, end up talking to those people in any capacity other than, uh, comments and- and emails.

318
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So, like, I forgot that it was because of the pub crawl, because pub crawl, for those who don't know, in the audience of this podcast, which is probably not too many people, um,

319
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the pub crawl is a show that I still do, go search DJ Cider's pub crawl on YouTube.

320
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Um, that's been going since, like, I've been on it since early 2013.

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Originally, it was a radio show for a My Little Pony radio, like, internet radio station called Celestial Radio.

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes, guys, that was a thing. I think some of them are still around. 24 hours of Pony stuff.

323
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Uh, I think.

324
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah.

325
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But yeah, we had a show on there. It was run by DJ Cider, and, like, at our height, we had probably close to 100 listeners.

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
By the end, we had, like, less than 30.

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But, um-

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And you may be like, hey, why doesn't Digi ever promote the pub crawl? Why have I never heard of it? Why is that, actually?

329
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Uh, well, before it was because it was on a My Little Pony radio station.

330
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Right.

331
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
At the time, it was impossible to find out about, to figure out how to even listen to.

332
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, and it air- I mean, it runs late night. It was always, like, 2 a.m. to 4 a.m., like, in Eastern Standard Time,

333
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
because Cider's an Australian, so for him, it was, like, the middle of the day.

334
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Um, but yeah, like, even after- because after I stopped doing Pony, we kept doing the show, and it wasn't about ponies anymore.

335
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It was just still on that radio station.

336
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The slogan was Celestial Radio, All Pony All the Time.

337
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But then, as season four of Pony was going on, and everyone was losing interest, it became mostly ponies some of the time.

338
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Then it became No Ponies, None of the Time.

339
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Right.

340
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And it became Die Horse Fags, Get Outta Here, something like that.

341
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You know, it just, like, the slogan deteriorated, and eventually they left, and then- and they left the network,

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and then it just became a 45-minute YouTube podcast that you uploaded.

343
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Now, here's the thing about, like, the pub crawl, right?

344
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Because another thing I take for granted is the fact that you're- you always upload a lot of your- of talking of you on the internet all the time.

345
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You got Digi Bros that's been going on for a year.

346
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's like, like, 20 minutes of you talking every day, and then the PCP, 2 hours of you talking every week,

347
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and then you do other podcasts, you do interviews with me, um, or this one.

348
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But the thing is, like, not too long ago, that wasn't the case.

349
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Right.

350
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
All I had to go on were these- these podcasts you did with Jesse.

351
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Like, the horse cast, which came out, like, every couple of months, just whenever you happened to feel like doing a podcast with Jesse.

352
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
This was before Nate organized it into a weekly thing.

353
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And then you had this old podcast that you did mostly with your offline friends, mostly Brandon Tolentino,

354
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and I listened to that, like, 50 times, because it was like- it was like a comfort blanket,

355
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
because I was all stressed out at work and making videos, and I just listened to that over and over again,

356
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
because it was the only thing in my life that was consistent.

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

358
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Um, so I was, like, desperate.

359
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I- I remember, I think, like, asking you on Tumblr or wherever, like, please do more podcasts.

360
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Right.

361
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So I was so desperate for your voice that-

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You've answered your own question of why I don't promote the pub crawl, because, uh, cause, yeah, like you just said,

363
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
for a long time, that was the main way to get two hours of me, uh, you know, twice a week.

364
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And then because of the fact that I started doing Digi Bros and started doing the procrastinator's podcast,

365
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I started doing all this other stuff that, like, cause the pub crawl is probably the best now that it's been in a long time,

366
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
where it's now- it's almost always just me and Cider and, like, maybe one other person, cause most people have lost interest,

367
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and it's only 45 minutes, and it's only once a week.

368
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And so we've gotten to the point where now it's like, we get in, we really get everything we have to say out,

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and then we get out, you know, and it's not as meandering and pointless as it used to be,

370
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
cause the thing about the pub crawl is that-

371
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It was pretty bad.

372
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah.

373
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It was pretty bad.

374
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's- it was just a show where we'd get really drunk, um, talk about alcohol, and then whatever came to mind.

375
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And so for-

376
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I mean, like, if you just- if you imagine just a normal Skype chat that, like, people do regularly without recording it,

377
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it was a lot closer to that on the spectrum than it was to a podcast on the spectrum.

378
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I guess so.

379
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And even in your- I mean, at its worst, I guess.

380
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
At its best, there would be plenty of great discussion, but, like, there'd be so much empty space,

381
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and, like, I don't know, a lot of things Cider talks about aren't that interesting,

382
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and then all the other people weren't that interesting, but whatever, and I don't know.

383
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Um, so, but even in the pony times, you didn't promote it, like, very much at all.

384
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You never, like, here's a link to the pub crawl, guys, so I had to figure out where to listen to it.

385
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I had to, like, read the schedule of when it even came on.

386
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I had to adjust for the time zones.

387
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I had to, like, figure out how to listen to it at work if I needed to.

388
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It wouldn't ever-

389
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Well, I had advertised it in a few videos, um, but it just- it never seemed to help,

390
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
because it was so esoteric to find.

391
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's, like, you have to go to a radio station, which, even just going to Celestia Radio,

392
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
like, understanding how to listen to it is, like, a thing in itself,

393
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
because you go there and there's, like, a weird play button that's not that big off to the side,

394
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and it's playing a whole fucking radio network.

395
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's just- it's a very antiquated way of doing things,

396
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
that unless you're familiar with the concept of internet radio, people have no idea what to do.

397
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But it did make for a great atmosphere where you could say whatever you want with, like, almost no consequences,

398
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
like, no one- I mean, like, the only way for there to be any consequences is if there-

399
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
is if, like, a co-host on the show deliberately liked creating drama with people you talked shit about on the show.

400
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Which was sometimes true.

401
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So as long as- so as long as there wasn't anyone who- anyone on the show who would, for no good reason,

402
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
start a lot of drama for no good reason, then everything would be fine on the Celestia Radio pub crawl,

403
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and you could say whatever you want with no consequences.

404
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So I- I wanted to listen to it because I wanted to hear more of your voice,

405
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
even though it was shitty, but it was a nice way to relax as well, even though I didn't have any beer or whatever.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And obviously I- obviously I think it's a fun show, or else I wouldn't still be doing it, you know, after three and a half years,

407
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
or- we'll say three years.

408
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But, um, yeah, like-

409
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So on there, you were, um, I believe you were talking about how you had been doing-

410
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You were- on that- on one time when I was listening early on,

411
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
you were talking about how you had done pen and paper roll RPG playing with your friends.

412
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And I remember you talking about that in depth, in like your Q&As and stuff, and in like, like other places.

413
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So I was able to remember that, and so then I was making really obscure references to those pen and paper RPs in the chat.

414
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And you were reading a chat, and then you said on the show like,

415
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh hey, I see DaVoo over here, like, knows all about Snoop Lion, and how he got his dick cut off or whatever.

416
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Or no, that was someone else. I don't know, I can't remember all the characters now, but, uh, yeah, DaVoo, he's-

417
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh yeah, so yeah, DaVoo, uh, he, you know, he's a stalker of me.

418
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This is how I know I have stalkers, but, you know, but- and you said,

419
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But that's the DaVoo for you.

420
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And I just made that like its own separate sound bite.

421
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But that's the DaVoo for you.

422
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That was really nice.

423
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You know, what's interesting is that, in that moment, you solidified how to pronounce that name.

424
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Because I had never really considered that before, because I never- the name was never uttered verbally, right?

425
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I always thought of it as DaVoo, but that doesn't make any sense, you can't say that, that's really awkward.

426
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So, you were the responsible one for this pronunciation.

427
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Well, DaVoo makes sense for the origins of the name. Do you want to reveal that to our audience?

428
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
My name is David, and I don't like having usernames, but I have to have something distinct.

429
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So I'm just like, uh, DaVoo, I don't know, I don't even know how the heck I came up with that.

430
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Turns out it's a terrible name for, uh, for search engine optimization.

431
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Because it seems like a lot of, like, I don't know, I think like a lot of Spanish people get that as a nickname or something.

432
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So you got to search the DaVoo in order to get anywhere with my name, I think.

433
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I did not know that.

434
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I think so. I mean, I think now I'm big enough that you can just search DaVoo and you'll get me, but not for a while.

435
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So David became DaVoo, but then I pronounced it DaVoo, and at one point,

436
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Which is way better.

437
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
In one specific song, DaVoo, just because it sounded better with the song.

438
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh yeah, the song, yeah.

439
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Which is the song Three Hams, which you can find on my SoundCloud.

440
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Indeed.

441
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah, the first song that mentions me, and, well, let's see, there's been two songs that mention me now.

442
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The other one is Jesse talking about me talking about The Force Awakens.

443
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But I don't know if that counts as a song.

444
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I didn't remember that you were mentioned by David then.

445
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah, anyway, okay, so back on topic.

446
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So basically, I just proved that I'm a big fan of you.

447
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah, because as you know, my ego is enormous, since that's part of how you got into watching me.

448
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh man, yeah, what happened was another particular fan of you who has since disowned everyone,

449
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and we've disowned this person, at the time was like, oh, I'm the biggest Digi Bro fan,

450
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and I'm like, we'll do a trivia off.

451
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And apparently that really blew up your ego, but whatever.

452
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, I love it when people know too much about me.

453
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Because to me, that's the ultimate evidence that they're really into it.

454
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's like that they know all these obscure things.

455
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Because that's the kind of stuff that I know about the people I'm a fan of.

456
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You know, like, I'm the type of guy who when I become a fan of somebody,

457
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I watch all their stuff and I learn everything.

458
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Just now, I just got into Monkey Jones, the YouTuber, and I've already watched all his stuff.

459
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Everything he's made other than his Elliot Roger autobiography reading,

460
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
which I might listen to anyways, just because I'm fucking curious about it.

461
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But I'm sure I could mention things that he's forgotten he's said before in a video.

462
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So, although he hasn't been around that long, so I don't think he's forgotten anything that quick.

463
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But yeah, when other people can do that for me, then it's always something special.

464
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's like, oh, wow, you know that, you know, and you're still around?

465
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You heard those shitty things I did and you're still here?

466
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah, I see, yeah.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, I think that's how I came to acknowledge you.

468
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And that was a big deal because now explain to me, because I don't know how it's possible.

469
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I don't remember this because I typically have a great memory for most things,

470
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
but I legit don't remember how you became my editor.

471
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
What did you do?

472
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You posted on Twitter, you made a tweet saying,

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I have eight videos in the works right now.

474
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Seven of them could be released right now, this very moment, if it weren't for the editing process.

475
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And I was very familiar with how much you didn't like editing at this point.

476
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Like you had made that very clear in podcasts, you hate editing and you said,

477
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I can't wait to one day just ship it off to someone.

478
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I believe even at this time that was already a Patreon tier, a creator goal.

479
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
If I get to like $500 or whatever, I can have someone to edit this shit.

480
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So at this time when you made that tweet, I had already been making my own videos for a couple of months,

481
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
so I knew how to make videos at this point.

482
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I didn't know if you'd seen any of them because they weren't that good, whatever.

483
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I know you've seen a lot of them since then, at least.

484
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But they at least proved I could make videos competently.

485
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And so I said, I'll make one, I'll make one, I'll make one.

486
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I make videos, I know how to edit with like exclamation marks.

487
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And then as I was at work on the way home, on the commute home,

488
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I got an email from you saying, okay, here's one.

489
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And you gave me some instructions on how to do it.

490
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And I was like, oh my gosh.

491
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Dang, sweet, yeah, okay then.

492
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It never would have happened if not for the fact that you had proven that you knew my stuff so well because...

493
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The fact that I knew to install blue highway fonts immediately.

494
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Right, yeah, stuff like that because...

495
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Do you guys even know that everything that Digibro does has blue highway font?

496
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's always the same font.

497
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's either blue highway, blue highway bold, or blue highway condensed, or blue highway linocut.

498
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't know if you've ever used condensed, but...

499
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I don't know if I've ever used bold, maybe just, I don't know.

500
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I almost exclusively used bold.

501
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It looks way better than regular, but I've never used linocut actually because it looks dumb, but...

502
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, well I only used it for a few videos.

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So you gave me some basic instructions, don't have any black backgrounds, do lots of fades, do lots of stuff.

504
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And so I did, I spent like a day and a half doing nothing but making that video and got it out to you.

505
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Which one was the first one?

506
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Why Nostalgia is good and does not blind.

507
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So that was the first one.

508
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah.

509
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So yeah, that...

510
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes, indeed.

511
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Because I was trying to think what era I would have had eight videos stocked up and it was indeed because I broke my foot.

512
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Oh, yeah.

513
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Because it was August 2014 and I broke my foot at Otacon and then...

514
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Singing database.

515
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah.

516
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And then I had moved a bunch of my stuff downstairs and just because I didn't feel like being at the computer all the time,

517
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I had started writing out videos, like writing scripts in a notebook.

518
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And so I wrote a bunch of scripts out in a notebook and then I just didn't want to edit them.

519
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Some of these are just too much of a pain in the ass.

520
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
There's a few of those that never got made just because they never made it out of the notebook.

521
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I wrote a review of...

522
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Because I wrote two videos that were supposed to be in Jesse and Hippo's style.

523
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
One was...

524
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh yeah, I'm re-talking about those little podcast ones.

525
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah, Jesse's...

526
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The video I wrote that's in the style of Jesse, I've sent to you before, it was a weird anime sex.

527
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And it's just like, why liking weird anime porn is okay, essentially.

528
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Which is actually not that original of a sentiment.

529
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I think most people are either...

530
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Anyone who still thinks it's not okay is never going to be convinced.

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So what's the point of making this video?

532
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Well, I think you're absolutely wrong about that.

533
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I think most people haven't heard that message yet.

534
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Particularly in an audience as big as mine.

535
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I don't think most people have heard that message yet.

536
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And I think there's a lot of people who would be convinced just because it's me saying it.

537
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I mean, for me, I guess my very tainted perspective, I've been eminently familiar with weird anime sex much longer than anime.

538
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So my perspective is pretty off-kilter.

539
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I think a pretty sizable portion of my fan base is 16-year-old casual anime fans who still think Lolli's kind of weird and don't understand how someone like me can be into it.

540
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So if I made a video like that, I think it could convince a lot of those people.

541
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And also, a lot of the point of it was just to be a stylistic parody of Jesse.

542
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It's written in his very fun linguistic style where there's lots of alliteration and little fun sentences and stuff.

543
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
He loved it when I sent it to him, but I never got it made.

544
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And the reason I never got it made was because I wanted to stand in front of a camera and deliver it the way Jesse does, but I had a broken foot.

545
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And so the prospect of standing was just too much and I never made it.

546
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I remember you did send that one to me saying, hey, I might have you edit this one later.

547
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I didn't have you do it just because you expressed such disinterest in it.

548
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And I was like, I will fuck you.

549
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Like what you just said to me is exactly what you said at the time.

550
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You were like, this isn't that original sentiment and I don't give a fuck.

551
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So I said, well, I'm throwing it away.

552
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
This is before I was like, because I made the first video that first editing because I had to.

553
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I had the opportunity to.

554
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Then you said, hey, so you want to do more?

555
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And I was super tired and I was like, I got to focus on my own videos, so I'm going to have to not do it.

556
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Then the next day I was like, no, don't listen to me.

557
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I want to do more.

558
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And the other video that never got transferred to the notebook was a review of Reciteer,

559
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
which I only played a couple hours of, but I wrote a hippo style analysis of it.

560
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But then I just I literally never copied it to the computer because it was too much of a hassle.

561
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So I didn't do it.

562
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But then yeah, I gave you the nostalgia one was one of the ones I wrote in that notebook.

563
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So I gave that to you.

564
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And I remember just being like, like the idea I had was just you seemed to know my video so well that no one else could possibly be better for the job.

565
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Like, because that's all I what I wanted out of an editor was not someone who could do super advanced stuff.

566
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I wanted someone who would do what I was already doing, you know, someone who could emulate my style and do it just as well as I could and not put in anything that would seem unnatural to me.

567
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You know, like nothing that would that would that would feel like this no longer is my voice.

568
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Right.

569
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And I've always put a lot of I've always put a lot of focus into that intuitively just knowing that that's how I should do it.

570
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Right.

571
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Genius that editing your videos.

572
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I was always like, well, obviously I'm not going to put anything in here that doesn't represent your opinion, you know.

573
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And so like really the only time that was in the Astroscore sucks part 10, I believe, where I broke where the writing voice.

574
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
No, wait, no, no, no, no, no, what am I trying to say here?

575
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
There's only one time where the right where like the voice of the video responded to you.

576
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And that was in 10 best things happening in anime this decade where it says you forgot this one.

577
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Roll eyes.

578
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah.

579
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Because I didn't know how else to do it.

580
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I didn't know how else to convey that that message that you forgot one of the moment of God trees.

581
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, I think you might have done it another time before that, but usually with my direction, like I'll say, oh, I fucked this line up.

582
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So put something in there to notify the audience that I fucked this line up.

583
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah, but I never did it in a way that like broke away from the writing voice, you know, like that.

584
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
In other words, making it you talking to me.

585
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah.

586
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah.

587
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But yeah, that's like I was always afraid because I knew other people who had editors in the pony community, especially.

588
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And there were people who had offered to do it for me.

589
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But like when I see someone who sends me like a like their sample video, they're like, hey, here's a flashy video I edited.

590
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And I'm like, yeah, but I would never make something like this, you know, like if someone's got like typo, like I think there was one guy who sent me a video example.

591
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And it had the like typography thing where it's like the words appearing on screen as the person says them like, oh my like Holden reviews does.

592
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And I don't like that style at all.

593
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I think it's just don't get the point of it like remotely.

594
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I saw that and I was like the last thing I want is one of my videos to have like a fucking typography thing going on at it, you know.

595
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Right.

596
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So yeah, I took you on.

597
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And the thing is, like at the time, my perspective on you was that you were this commenter who would leave these incredibly verbose comments had a sort of strong political opinions.

598
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It seemed to be at least at the time, which you would clarify now that they're not that strong, right?

599
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Right.

600
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah.

601
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You have political opinions and you get frustrated when other people don't understand your perspective, but it's not that you feel super strongly about them.

602
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, I guess I would say so.

603
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah, I don't know.

604
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I just, um, I don't know.

605
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Okay.

606
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So, and then I think you had around this time, you had gotten Jesse on Skype somehow.

607
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah, so what happened was right after, like right after listening to that one podcast and made me a fan of him, I watched or listened to a bunch of his videos.

608
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I was a big fan of him and I'm like, well, hey, I currently, thanks to ponies, have more subs than this guy slightly.

609
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So that makes it okay to talk to him.

610
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And I was like, hey, man, like, you ever want to like do videos together?

611
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Like I can like edit videos for you or whatever, blah, blah, blah, you know.

612
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I have gotten close or almost close to editing Jesse videos for like three years now.

613
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah.

614
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's just that he's too, um, auteur to like ship it off to someone wirelessly.

615
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So at some point, if we're ever doing analysis HQ, then that'll probably be the final, finally the time where I can like do videos for him too.

616
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So that he can chug through that massive backlog of videos he has because he can direct me or like, you know, like punch me in person.

617
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
There have been no shortage of times where he's been like, I'm finally going to get DeVoo to do this one.

618
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Like, I can't take it.

619
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
There's been like a lot of times where it's like, I can't fucking take it anymore.

620
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I hate this.

621
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't want to.

622
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
He's never said he's never said that for as long as I've been in the chat.

623
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think he did once.

624
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I think there was one time he was like, DeVoo edit this for me.

625
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And then you kind of just were like, oh yeah, I did.

626
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Like he obviously was going to take it back though.

627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But like, yeah, there was a time where like I would I had like almost like slated it onto my calendar for me to edit for him.

628
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And then he like pulled back on it.

629
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Yeah.

630
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Um, so what the heck were we talking about of like, yeah, well, the thing is, I had Jesse on Skype.

631
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah.

632
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And you know, I guess I said, I was just barely able to not be too annoying to him on Skype to the point that like he didn't remove me.

633
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So I was like, oh good.

634
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I figured out how to, um, I was able to pretty decently understand Jesse's Skype voice at least.

635
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Like I was able to figure out how to not annoy him, I think, before a lot of other people were because I was able to practice on Skype there.

636
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So yeah.

637
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Well, he kind of apparently he apparently he said to you that, oh, DeVue talks a whole lot and you know, long-winded stuff.

638
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And then you said, and you thought to yourself, well, I better not add DeVue on Skype because then I'll end up talking to him a bunch or whatever.

639
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And that's for the best because then I would have wasted a bunch of time myself back when I really needed to make videos much more quickly.

640
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So yeah.

641
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It was at a time where I was trying to like really scale back internet communication like all together.

642
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Because, you know, after post-pony, like I stopped talking to a lot of people because like back in the pony days, I had like a huge circle of people I talked to in that community.

643
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And you had post-pony stress disorder.

644
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah.

645
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And so I kind of had put a large distance between myself and most of the internet and we had started the horseshoe crew.

646
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So I really had those like ever since this thing started, ever since the procrastinators chat started, like I think for all of us, we largely stopped talking to most other people online.

647
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Like it became, it became like, well, there's no reason to talk to anybody else about this stuff because we have this group.

648
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So, you know, unless it's something that I, there's only one person I could talk to about something that's not a member of this group, there's no reason to leave it.

649
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So like, you know, it got to a point where anybody who wasn't in the procrastinators, it was like, I don't really want to talk to them because I have to repeat myself to multiple people, you know, like something I've already talked about with my friends.

650
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I now have to describe to the next guy, you know, or get into the same conversation with five different people and stuff like that.

651
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And yeah, I kind of had, like Jesse had told me that he was like, oh, Davoo will, you know, he'll really talk your ear off kind of thing.

652
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It was just like one comment he said to that effect.

653
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:42,000
But I was like, yeah, I don't know like how long me and you are going to be friends, how long we're going to be working together because I've had a lot of people who like tried to work with me and then just kind of flaked off over the years.

654
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You know, like I had a lot of co bloggers back in my blogging days who would get really excited and want to work on my stuff with me.

655
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And they were always big fans.

656
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
They're always people who love my content and want to be like me.

657
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And then they, you know, would be around for a little while and then they disappear, you know, like a lot of them literally disappear.

658
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Like this is one dude.

659
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I don't remember what username he was using at the time.

660
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
He changed it a few times.

661
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
But like he got into gets into blogging and is like, dude, your content is the greatest thing ever.

662
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm so passionate.

663
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I want to become the biggest otaku in the world.

664
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I want to be just like you.

665
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Right.

666
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So I'm like, all right, cool.

667
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Right for my blog, you know, he writes a couple posts and then just literally disappears off the face of the earth.

668
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like I didn't hear from him again for like a year.

669
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Then he started his own blog, made two posts and disappeared again.

670
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So like that's the kind of experiences I've had.

671
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And so I'm like, I don't want to talk to this guy who's going to have super long conversations with me, which is inevitably what happened anyway.

672
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's what's now we do talk.

673
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And of course, it's exactly what I was afraid of.

674
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
But we're friends now, so it's okay.

675
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But we do talk exactly as much as I was always afraid we would talk.

676
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But so for the longest time, we were communicating solely through email.

677
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
All of our video work was only done through email.

678
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Discussed through email.

679
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yes.

680
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And again, you know, I do agree with that whole policy of not talking to me at the time because if I'd spend that much time talking,

681
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
well, it had no time to make videos.

682
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I mean, think about it, making videos all the time, being at work all the time and talking to people in a chat.

683
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That's the situation dates in and it takes him forever to get videos out.

684
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So yeah, you know, clearly I'm glad I wasn't subjected to that.

685
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yeah.

686
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, it was it was interesting too, because I liked the emailing stuff just because it felt it felt so much more professional than anything else I'd done before.

687
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Because like, you know, I'm used to that, like casual, we're all in a chat, we're all like hanging out and stuff.

688
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And I thought it was cool that, like, you know, my editor was someone who because it seemed like you were really trying your hardest to present yourself as professionally as possible.

689
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And so, I guess, like, you know, we would only communicate through email and we'd have like,

690
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
they'd be very detailed and it'd be like, you know, oh, is this exactly what we want to do? Yeah, okay.

691
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Well, I mean, I just didn't want to annoy you. I didn't want to talk unnecessarily.

692
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Well, that's what professionalism is, not being annoying.

693
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And then of course, you had like already dozens of podcasts talking about how you don't like it when people talk to you unnecessarily.

694
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So I just sort of got the idea, you know.

695
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But so then at some point it got to where you were editing, like, because at first I was only giving you scripts that like the first few I gave you were like things that I didn't really care that much about.

696
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So it was like, even if he fucks it up, I can just throw it away remorselessly.

697
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That's good planning. And I definitely did not get that sent at the time and all those videos are pretty good.

698
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So like the nostalgia one, I wrote it and then I kind of like reread it and wasn't sure I got the point anymore.

699
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So I sent it to you. I was like, well, if it's any good, he'll find the good in it and make it worthwhile.

700
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And I thought it was good. So I posted it and then, you know, sent a few more your way and then finally gave you the big sword on online series.

701
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And that was when it was like, okay, this guy's now my guy, you know.

702
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And then particularly with Psycho Pass. That was the first one where it was just like you had complete reign over it.

703
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I didn't do anything. I just sent you scripts and you you did this like huge epic series.

704
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And then of course, that was also the end for the time because I was like, okay, I'm never getting I'm not getting out any of my own videos.

705
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I'm never going to I'm never going to get the I'm never going to get the algorithms if I'm making videos in between making yours.

706
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It just takes too long. It took me months to make the Psycho Pass videos because I was still slow.

707
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So I was using slower software. I didn't know how to optimize the editing process.

708
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Tell us about your software. You used. Oh, yeah.

709
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I went to get the software. I was just like, well, did you says to use Sony Vegas, but I don't really trust Digi when it comes to which software to use.

710
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So I just like so back when I first got my software, I just Googled best editing software and I the top result on there's like this chart saying like which are overall the best softwares.

711
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And the number one was on power director. And so I got that and it's fine.

712
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But it's obviously for like plebs who aren't doing videos professionally, I think, and it's like really slow, at least on my computer, like everything just takes way too long to move the clips.

713
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
There's just too much delay. So editing was really tedious.

714
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And at the time, I didn't know how to optimize files using handbrake. So it was even slower.

715
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So yeah, it was just kind of long and slow and hard. And I was also trying to make my own videos at the time, like you had started working on the psychopaths videos.

716
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And I'm like, great, I'm going to quickly finish up this roller coaster tycoon one versus three video, which turned out to be the hardest video I've ever made.

717
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So, you know, like, you I think you had finished like both the script and the audio, all your work was done.

718
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And I was still making this roller coaster three video and I'm like, oh, this is going to take like weeks more to finish.

719
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm going to put this on hold. So then I had to watch psychopaths. And at the time I was really bad at watching shows.

720
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I just could not focus, could not sit still and pay attention. I just was not trained for that.

721
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I was trained for being a blue collar worker, someone who like just watches something for like 20 minutes when you get home, you know, so I just couldn't get into it.

722
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I had to watch all the psychopaths psychopaths too. Then I wanted to because I wasn't as you know, wasn't a very good editor at the time.

723
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I had to watch all of it again and make extensive notes of everything that was in it so that I wouldn't know exactly what to put in every spot.

724
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Don't do that anymore. I could just do it from memory. But at the time that was the only way I was able to like guide myself through because prior to this, I made a Gravity Falls video for myself.

725
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And it was torture trying to figure out like which clips of which episode to put where I'm like, oh, torture, torture.

726
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm going to make a guide for myself. But that ended up basically it was like a month and a half before the first psychopaths video came out after you were done with it.

727
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And then like after that, I'm like, oh man, I need to like play video games because what happens is I'll spend like a week making one of your videos.

728
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And then I have to come up with a new video idea for my own channel and it's suddenly been two weeks since I've played any video games.

729
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So then I had to start from square one when it comes to the conceptual phase.

730
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So I'm like, I need to play video games while working on videos that did not work at all.

731
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
When you have a full time job, you cannot do anything else on the side.

732
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So like there just be like weeks where I didn't get any progress done and I'm like, so when I was done with the psychopaths videos,

733
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
a very long drawn out tedious process, but very satisfying.

734
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And then no one watched them, but whatever I got paid.

735
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'm like, okay, time to finish the roller coaster video.

736
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Sorry, Digi, but I got to make my own videos, you know, because you're at the time you weren't making enough money to pay me enough to live off of it full time, not by a long shot.

737
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
You only got paid like $60 apiece for the psychopaths videos, I think.

738
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah, yeah, that is true.

739
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I mean, the first couple of videos, the nostalgia one, I think you paid me like $50.

740
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
But then after that, you were like, hey, I can't make you do any more of these because I can't pay you at all.

741
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And I'm like, oh, you can just pay me five bucks.

742
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So I accepted that because guess what?

743
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That was more than I was getting paid at the time because I was getting paid zero because, you know,

744
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I didn't want to make a Patreon campaign until I had some people watching my content.

745
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And I had built up like $89.

746
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I had built up like $50 of ad revenue from my season five predictions video.

747
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
But after I got 50K views, it got demonetized.

748
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,000
So it's that $50 sat there for like a year before it finally spilled over into 100 to pay me.

749
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It's worth mentioning that because when we first, when you first started working for me, you were offering to do them for free.

750
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
You were like, I won't be able to do them often if they're free.

751
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But I just want to edit your videos was kind of like what you proposed to me.

752
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Oh, yeah. And I was thinking also, I could get some exposure from it.

753
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And this is what like really messed me up a little bit more is because like in the psychopaths videos in the like the redirect videos where like you'd promote the video.

754
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
At the last one, you promoted me.

755
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And I think that gave me a little bit of a bump, right?

756
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So that gave me just a little bit more money.

757
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Like you had been linking some of my videos on Twitter and I finally got like a couple of patrons after the roller coaster video.

758
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So at this time, I'm like, I don't know if I'm going to do any more Digi videos.

759
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I love doing it, but I'm not making any money from it.

760
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So I got to work on my own channel, which I'm also not making any money from.

761
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Like it's a big decision.

762
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Like, and again, I'm working full time and it's tedious and torture and hell and I hate it.

763
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And I'm going to do a podcast with Nate someday, which is just us talking about how horrible it is to have a full time job when you're trying to do videos.

764
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:41,000
The worst thing in all in all of time, like the YouTuber schedule is to be awake and asleep whenever you believe me.

765
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I was there briefly.

766
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah, but with a blue with a blue with a regular job, you got to be awake at a certain time every day.

767
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah.

768
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
That's death.

769
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
That's death.

770
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
True death.

771
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
My time was 4am that I went to that my job started for and 2am for actually a lot of the time.

772
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So the point is all I wanted to do was just do whatever it takes to make enough money to do it full time.

773
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Right.

774
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So I'm like, well, which one is going to get me there faster?

775
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
My channel or yours?

776
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And at the time, your channel hadn't really taken off yet.

777
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
You were already one of the leading anime channels around because they're worth that many.

778
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We didn't have a lot of faith in the idea that you could get super far with anime.

779
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
That was the thing.

780
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I had kind of hit what I thought was a cap with Pony where I had the most subs that if anyone doing the kind of videos I was doing.

781
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And then there was a sort of upper limit to what the biggest pony channels were.

782
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And it was like 300,000 for the guys who were doing parody animations and shit.

783
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And it was like that to me was the cap.

784
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And then when I got into anime, I was very aware of that.

785
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And the guy with the most subs was Misty Kronexia with like 450,000 at the time, which he's actually grown a lot more than that now.

786
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But it was like that to me looked like anime can't get bigger than that.

787
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,000
You know, so I thought maybe maybe I would never like, you know, unless I eventually expanded into stuff beyond anime.

788
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Maybe there was like a limit to how big this would ever get.

789
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Got to build the Otaku Land theme park thing that they were trying to build in the future.

790
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
How did that feel when you watched Otaku no Video where you like, oh, this is what Digi's been trying to do all this time.

791
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
This is his life story.

792
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I kind of relate to that character guy, you know, who's like already an adult kind of knowing anime, having seen a little bit of it.

793
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And then getting into, of course, I wasn't a normal person.

794
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I was just into other stuff adjacent to anime and like video games and stuff.

795
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It's not quite the same trajectory, but you know, anyway.

796
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But the feeling of those two guys like starting their company together is a lot like me and you being like, yeah.

797
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:59,000
The way that it is now with you literally being my employee at this point, which I guess we'll just build up to that since we're still in the middle of the story.

798
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
We should have opened with that.

799
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So I definitely proved after leaving my editing role for you.

800
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I proved that I can make a pretty good channel because I got a video out every week after that, like a little bit extra than every week.

801
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
All in a different style, all interesting at least.

802
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
My voiceover was getting progressively less annoying.

803
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I was getting faster.

804
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I was getting slicker and I was getting no views, no money.

805
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I was getting nowhere.

806
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And you know, I have the patience to make videos all the time with no results, but I don't have the patience to go to work all the time with no results.

807
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So I'm like, oh geez.

808
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And what really killed it was the Donkey Kong video.

809
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm like, it's a Donkey Kong country video.

810
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It has the word analysis.

811
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I was surprised that didn't figure.

812
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And you even emailed me about that.

813
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I'm like, finally, this is my big hit video.

814
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
This is going to get me views.

815
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And it got like 600 views, you know.

816
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Now it's sitting at a few thousand, but at the time, like a week had passed, less than a thousand views.

817
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And I was so bummed out and then you sent me an email saying, bro, it's pissing me off how few views your videos are getting.

818
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And that was like a really impactful moment for me.

819
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Since that email, I've never been frustrated about my view counts ever again, just knowing that you were also frustrated.

820
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It's like I allocated my burden on to you.

821
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And so now when I see Nate coming out with videos, all of his masterpieces and then fretting about how few views they get,

822
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'm like, when's he going to have his Donkey Kong country moment?

823
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Like when it just like, you just realize you're never going to get the views until at some point there's no logic or order to it.

824
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
So I'm like, OK, I'm not making any views, not getting any money, not getting any patrons.

825
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Digi, I'm going to come back to you.

826
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I think what Nate is currently misunderstanding is like, I keep telling him he has to make a video every week.

827
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And I think he's in the mindset that you have to do that because having regular content means more people will care about your stuff.

828
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:06,000
No, you have to have a video every week because you're trying to get the video that'll get big and you don't know what it'll be.

829
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
That was one of the reasons you did your Oktoberfest 2014.

830
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Like, let's make 30 videos. Some of them got to be big.

831
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And it worked. Two of them got unbelievably huge.

832
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And those two out of 30, but it's just playing the odds.

833
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It's like, if you only have one video every six months and you don't know, let's say only one in 30 gets really big,

834
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
then it's going to take a long time for you to hit 30.

835
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You'll be having heart disease by the time you're making any money.

836
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Some people have one video, their first video explodes and gets fucking huge.

837
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So you would even come out with a vlog. I had been telling you about how I wanted to get back into editing your videos, maybe.

838
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And at one point you were having this creative drought and you made a video of vlog on your after dark channel talking about how it's so hard to come out with a video

839
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
and do all the work on it because by the time you're done with all the editing, where's your inspiration?

840
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I just hate them by the time I'm done with them.

841
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And I have a little bit of that with making my own videos.

842
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,000
To some extent, I'm tired of it by then, which is why it's nice to have not been involved with the writing process if it's a video I didn't write.

843
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So neither of us get the frustration as much. We share the load.

844
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's almost as if most art is made by more than one person.

845
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That's the funniest thing to me. We've had to argue about this.

846
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I was re-listening to one of the old PCPs where we get into this argument where those guys were making fun of me for having an editor.

847
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And they were like, oh, it's not all your vision.

848
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And I was like, yeah, you listened to any music. It's almost always a band of four guys.

849
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
No one of them, it's all their vision. Everyone fucking puts in something into it.

850
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It's completely fucking normal to have a crew to make your art.

851
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Just because we have gotten ourselves cornered in an industry where it's all bedroom production and it's harder to have a team.

852
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But I didn't hire you because you were some editor.

853
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I hired you because you were the fucking devout who had seen all my fucking videos and knew what to do.

854
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I mean, I've never seen all your videos because you have so many and I've always been so busy.

855
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
If I had been not having a job, I definitely would have read your blog or something like that.

856
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You're like my favorite internet guy, man. You're like my favorite internet dude guy.

857
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So you had this vlog saying, oh yeah, I sure wish I had an editor.

858
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,000
The devout said he might be editing for me again, but it's so hard. I can't pay him enough.

859
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I'm working on this video about the Nanoha franchise and devout would have to watch all of Nanoha.

860
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I can't pay him enough to watch all of Nanoha and make a video about all of Nanoha.

861
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So then after that, I watched and made a video about all of Nanoha with you.

862
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So that was cool.

863
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I want to clarify because I was saying earlier that you said you would do the work for free back at the very beginning.

864
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
And I didn't let you do it for free because I don't believe in that.

865
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I've been following a lot of random posts from random websites and stuff about culture and shit.

866
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I would always hear about this phenomenon where people would promise artists exposure in exchange for work.

867
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's a very common thing where they'll be like, let's say there's a festival going to happen, like a music festival.

868
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And they'll get young artists who are desperate, who don't have anything.

869
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And they'll be like, oh, if you perform at this festival for free, it'll get you lots of exposure.

870
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So they'll get people to do shows and then not pay them for their work under the guise that it's going to get them exposure, which it's not.

871
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Because nobody knows who they are and nobody cares, so it's not going to get them exposure.

872
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I mean, it is true that for a YouTuber, you can get some exposure and you did, but obviously it didn't launch a career for you in the short time.

873
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Well, it did make things a lot harder, right? Because here's what happened, right?

874
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So I'm like, hmm, maybe my channel isn't going to go anywhere because I was getting like $5 of patronage, a video, less than a thousand views, a video.

875
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So I made the Nanahu video, part one of three. Most people probably haven't seen your Nanahu video.

876
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Like, you know, I'm sure all your big fans have, but those don't have a ton of views.

877
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So you did the three part Nanahu retrospective.

878
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So this was sort of like me returning to your channel and I was thinking, hmm, maybe, you know, you were able to pay me a little bit more money because you were making a little bit more money.

879
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I believe this may have been like during the summer where your channel got bigger.

880
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So like your channel had gotten bigger at this time. This was around the time where some of your videos were finally really blowing up.

881
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
There was like three waves to your channel getting bigger.

882
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
The end of like October or November 2014, the summer of 2015, and then the winter of 2016.

883
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Those were like the three waves of your channel getting big.

884
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
The third one finally did it in, of course.

885
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,000
But yeah, Nanahu part one. At the end of Nanahu part one, you say, hey everyone, this was edited by the DeVoo.

886
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
He did a good job obviously because he's amazing.

887
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
But also he has his own videos and they're also great and he's criminally under recognized.

888
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You should all go watch him.

889
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So then a lot of people did and made this decision about which channel to work on a whole lot more complicated.

890
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:52,000
There's one patron in particular who like patrons a lot of came to, I got a $35 patron.

891
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I was like, I'm just like, I'm just laying in my bed one day waking up.

892
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh, I got a $10 patron. Oh, I got a $5 patron. Oh, the $10 patron.

893
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Like I got a $1 patron who changed to a $10 patron.

894
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Oh, the $30 patron became a $35 patron.

895
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Well, okay then, you know, and then I started getting 1000 video views of video then.

896
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'm like, this is suddenly even more complicated.

897
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:27,000
So I did the other Nanoha videos and I'm like, okay, you know, like, what do I do?

898
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And then what happened was you went for a couple of months not being able to come up with anything for me to do.

899
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Like you were like, DeVoo, I might be doing a video about Full Metal Alchemist.

900
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I'm like, okay, I watched all of Full Metal Alchemist and then at the end you were like, DeVoo,

901
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I think I might not want to make a video.

902
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
No, that wasn't really how it happened.

903
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
What happened was I just thought, hmm, you know what would be really awkward for Digi

904
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
is if he decided he didn't want to make a video about Full Metal Alchemist

905
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
and so I told you, hey, if you don't want to make a video about Full Metal Alchemist,

906
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
that's fine because I'm as Full Metal Alchemist.

907
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I'm glad I watched it.

908
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I'm glad I watched FMAB anyway because it's a great important cultural reference point

909
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
and I was even able to talk about it in a video that I did immediately afterwards briefly.

910
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
So I was able to use it as a reference point.

911
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I got my money's worth, obviously, but yeah, you bailed on the FMAB video.

912
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Pretty much the second you said that.

913
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Like the second you said, hey, don't worry about it.

914
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I'm glad I watched it.

915
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I was like, okay, because I had quickly lost desire to do it.

916
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
That was important in me being able to figure out how to marathon things again.

917
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Like I was when I was younger and I had nothing to do,

918
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
you know, marathoning things is like a state of mind you got to hype yourself up for

919
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
when you have a job, you know.

920
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So yeah, it didn't, it went a couple months without knowing what to give to me.

921
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
You're like, hey, Davoo, edit one of the Ava videos.

922
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Everyone is badass in even going on episodes six and seven.

923
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So I did that one.

924
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And then it was like another couple of months.

925
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And then after that was the asterisk war.

926
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Oh my gosh, I didn't, there's no thing in between that.

927
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Yeah.

928
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
It was a slow period for my channel altogether.

929
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But yeah.

930
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
But the asterisk war, that's when I was like, hey, we're fucking Davoo, we're doing this.

931
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Like we're going great.

932
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
We're going big.

933
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Well, it wasn't quite, it wasn't actually all the way yet.

934
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
You had been making more money.

935
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You were able to give me like a hundred dollars per video, which is like cool.

936
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
But you know, at this point, I was losing my mind.

937
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Like, I mean, I'd been losing my mind since.

938
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Yeah.

939
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
The post asterisk period was like unbelievably tumultuous.

940
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Like in terms of what?

941
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah.

942
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So yeah, we're all built to that.

943
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So at this point, I've been like, I'd already lost my mind like a year plus ago.

944
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And now I'm just like, my soul is shredding in half.

945
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm just like, I can't break out of the cycle of work.

946
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Actually, it wasn't too bad because my, I got into an arrangement where I could like

947
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
pay some money and work part-time.

948
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But man, doing it part-time is almost worse in its own way because like you get used to

949
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
not having to work and you have to anyway and blah, blah, blah.

950
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So I was thinking, man, the asterisk war videos, they're getting a lot of views.

951
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
They're great.

952
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Like it's 12 parts long.

953
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
They're all getting views.

954
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Your Patreon is going to hopefully explode because these are great videos and everyone

955
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
loves them.

956
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And like, you know, parts four and five went along and your Patreon went up a little bit.

957
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And then, so like part four or so came out at the beginning of the year of 2016.

958
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Now that border of the year was really big for me because December 31st, 2015, I was

959
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
headed to the TPC chat.

960
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I had managed to Paula take my way in by getting everyone else on Skype.

961
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
What I did was like, I got you and I already had Jesse and I, because I had, I had added

962
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you on Skype back in September by saying like, Hey, you know, just let you know.

963
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
If you do want to add me on Skype, that'd be great.

964
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Well, is that the point where we were doing more and more work together and it was like,

965
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
this will be smart, you know, like, we've been talking for long enough that I was comfortable

966
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
with you and I didn't think it was going to be weird.

967
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And I was like, we're clearly working together for the long run.

968
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So let's do it.

969
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Right.

970
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah.

971
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
In fact, we may have, I may have added you on Skype like slightly before the Ava video

972
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
even.

973
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So then I was like, okay, my plan was then to add Hippo and then Nate and then Ben.

974
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And that's like the five main members, I would say, like, you know, Tom and Jeff wasn't even

975
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
there, but Tom and major kind of like side members in a way, because they're not that

976
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
active, you know.

977
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Yeah.

978
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So I went to them all on Skype and then I just made sure that everything I said to them

979
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
was funny and interesting to prove that I'm good.

980
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And then I waited a week and created my own Skype group called the DeVoo Association, which

981
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I guess was a proto collective, I guess, where it was a chat of just all of us, but with

982
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
me in it to prove that I could be funny and interesting in a group, I guess.

983
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I think it was my plan.

984
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And then it worked.

985
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
You guys kept talking in it to where you added me to the chat.

986
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So I went, I did it.

987
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I forgot it was that recent because you said December, right?

988
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Because I very distinctly remember exactly what you did.

989
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
You pulled everyone in and you said, ha, you idiots.

990
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I was doing a flowy impersonation by the way.

991
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
You did a flowy.

992
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Just by the text.

993
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yeah.

994
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Because we were all super into Undertale at the time and I think you were aware of that.

995
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yes.

996
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You flowied us all.

997
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And then I was just like, because we were all, you know, we were all like, oh, DeVoo,

998
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
you card.

999
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And then back in the other chat, we were just kind of like, is there any reason not to have

1000
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
because like at this point, I think, because Ben was already a fan of your videos.

1001
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
He liked them.

1002
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I think Hippo was vaguely aware of them.

1003
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You know, me and Jesse were both talking to you already.

1004
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
So it was really.

1005
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I was mostly worried about Hippo because I had never heard anything that he had as

1006
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
an opinion on any of my videos and I was afraid that he didn't like me.

1007
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Like Nate, I don't care if Nate likes me or not.

1008
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I don't care about that fags opinion.

1009
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But Hippo was like, oh man, I hope Hippo.

1010
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And I know that he was the one who like bitches about my old avatar from my old videos the

1011
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
most and has the most problems with my videos, whatever, you know.

1012
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Well, Nate had never seen any of them and that was the thing.

1013
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Right.

1014
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That was like what, he was the last person who hadn't seen any because he had always

1015
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
just been out of the impression that you were like some weird guy who like, who just edits

1016
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
my videos and was just like.

1017
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Right.

1018
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And then it was actually, I believe he watched my roller coaster three video and that's the

1019
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
kind of video that he likes.

1020
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Huge, way too elaborate, way too drawn out.

1021
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
The opposite of Ben because Ben liked you because of your short videos and he thought

1022
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
they were really smart and funny.

1023
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And it was just kind of like, I guess Nate just literally hadn't gotten the memo that

1024
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
we liked your videos.

1025
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
He literally had only seen the trampolines one, which he did like, but then he was like,

1026
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
oh, I just assumed he was dumb or something.

1027
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
We were like, no, do you watch his stuff?

1028
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And he was like, oh, okay, this is good.

1029
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yeah.

1030
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And you know, like the first thing he said to me on Skype after what's up, you black

1031
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
nigger was, now dude, I got to say, I've never really watched any of your videos and it's

1032
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
because of your icon.

1033
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It's so shit.

1034
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
You got to fix that man.

1035
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And that did eventually compel me into changing my avatar, you know.

1036
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But yeah, anyway, to the one I have now.

1037
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But yeah, so that's how I got in the chat December 31st, 2015.

1038
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I was like, yeah, cool, awesome.

1039
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And then that turn of the year was also a big deal for me because that's how I was finally

1040
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
able to get out of work.

1041
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
So just to let you all know just how privileged I am.

1042
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I work for a family business that my dad created.

1043
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So it's not really a job.

1044
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
It's just eight hours of chores that makes it even more torturous.

1045
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And so it's just like, I can't, it's not like I can quit my job because it's just my dad

1046
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
telling me to do it, right?

1047
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And it's not like he pays me money.

1048
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
He like pays me some, but then most of it is just you get to live here, you know.

1049
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So it's really hard.

1050
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I have to use all just family bonding as negotiating currency.

1051
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So my dad wanted to have a website for his company and I know computers.

1052
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I don't know how to make websites really, but I could learn it.

1053
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:18,000
So he's like, Hey, David, if you make a website for our company, I'll give you the winter off.

1054
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And I'm like, okay, you know, this is after like a straight year of me making it abundantly clear

1055
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
that doing the job was making my soul split in half.

1056
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And so like, I guess I was, I sufficiently guilted him into it.

1057
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So he, he came up with this contract.

1058
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I had the winter off, right?

1059
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Cause that's an off season for our business anyway.

1060
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So I'm like, this had better be my escape, right?

1061
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Yeah.

1062
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Um, I even named my computer ticket out of here.

1063
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Back when I, man, I'd never even told anyone that before.

1064
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
That's great.

1065
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Um, yeah.

1066
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
So that's what I wanted to have.

1067
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Um, so the Astroscore was going on this series.

1068
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And I was like, good, this series has like eight more parts to go.

1069
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
It's going to get even bigger.

1070
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It's going to get Digi all of these patronages.

1071
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And I've been doing an impersonation of your impersonation of monkey Jones.

1072
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yeah.

1073
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I could tell actually.

1074
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It's just, it's just most of my impersonations are impersonations of impersonations.

1075
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Those are the ones I can understand better.

1076
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So anyway, um, and I'm like, good, great, awesome.

1077
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Your Patreon will go up and then I can make enough money to like just go full time.

1078
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Hopefully.

1079
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So part six and seven came out, part eight and nine came out.

1080
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And it was like the Patreon wasn't going up that much.

1081
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And I was like freaking out and you were like, well, what were you expecting?

1082
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It always goes up slowly.

1083
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And I'm like, just, just no, it's got to go up.

1084
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
The winter is winter is leaving the opposite.

1085
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Yeah.

1086
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I have it, you know, I've gotten used to this rhythm of like, I put out a video, I

1087
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,000
might gain five to $10 on there, you know, and the thing is it, it adds up quick, you

1088
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
know, like it's not quick enough, not that much time left.

1089
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And of course I had to devote like a week of that winter to learning how to do HTML

1090
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
and then another week to make the website and like, can I even do all of it?

1091
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Incidentally, I didn't make the website, but I've never even posted it because my dad

1092
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
had to like approve of it and read it.

1093
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And as he, as I would know, it's impossible to do anything internet related when you have

1094
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
to clean windows.

1095
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So he's never gotten around to it.

1096
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The website still hasn't been posted hilariously enough.

1097
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Yeah.

1098
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
So anyway, so I want to, I want to be able to, I want to talk about what happened at the

1099
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
very end of this, of the asterisk, because it's fucking hilarious.

1100
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So part nine came out and I was like, this has got to be the big one.

1101
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
This is the best one.

1102
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
This is the nerd writer one.

1103
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
This is where it's got to go get big, but it still didn't happen.

1104
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I'm like, so I'm over here calmly.

1105
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Every video is coming out.

1106
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It's great.

1107
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Every video is a masterpiece.

1108
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
They're getting lots of views.

1109
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I'm gaining, you know, a decent amount of patrons, but not an amount that is like changing

1110
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
the game immediately, right?

1111
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And so like after the last asterisk was done, like you sent it to me and you're like, it's

1112
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
done.

1113
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I have like, I can't edit for you for a while.

1114
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Like I need to go soul search and do all this other stuff.

1115
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And you literally said that.

1116
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I think you said it was like the rest of the month you were going to be off doing something

1117
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
else.

1118
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And I had given you this script for myriad colors phantom world that I wanted you to

1119
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
edit.

1120
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And I wanted it to be done before the month was over.

1121
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,500
But you were like, I got to go do other stuff because, you know, like this, the channel's

1122
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,000
not growing fast enough and you were super stressed out.

1123
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And what happened was I had saved up, I had saved up a bunch of my money, right?

1124
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I saved up a bunch of the money that I'd been making from the asterisk series because I

1125
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
don't have to pay rent this winter.

1126
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I can save up the money and I'm just going to politic my way out of having to work again.

1127
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I don't want to go back.

1128
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
To clarify for the audience, because you had these three months off, exactly what your

1129
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
plan was, make enough money during those three months and become enough of an employee of

1130
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,000
me that when the time came that you had to go back to work, you could tell your dad,

1131
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm already making better money than I would be making working for you, essentially.

1132
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Or enough to pay rent.

1133
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
That's not possible.

1134
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
That's, you know, he is a business.

1135
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I mean, you're not making anything for working for him.

1136
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I never said that.

1137
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
He wasn't even paying.

1138
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Well, I'm making rent.

1139
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I'm technically making, I'm creating the wealth that is paying it.

1140
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Like I'm creating the money.

1141
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
It's, you know, like he wanted me to pay my own expenses.

1142
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
He didn't want to like millennialify me, you know.

1143
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
But the idea was that if you made enough money, you wouldn't have to go back to work.

1144
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Well, actually what happened was I demanded that he create a list of all of my expenses

1145
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and like show it off.

1146
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Like, okay, like what I, one time I just like, okay, I'm just not going to eat this month.

1147
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And so that's how I was able to politic him into me having to pay less rent because he

1148
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
just cannot stand any of his children not eating.

1149
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So I accidentally hunger protested inadvertently.

1150
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
That worked really well.

1151
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
But I gotta, I gotta get to the delivery of this because I want to say this part because

1152
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,000
it's so fucking funny to me because like, yeah, you basically, it wasn't panning out well enough.

1153
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You weren't making enough money that you could bribe your dad.

1154
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
No, I got, I'll, I, this is an important part of setting that up.

1155
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Right.

1156
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
So I like, okay, I decided I was just going to do it and not tell my dad that this was the plan.

1157
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So like, normally I pay him $200 a month and then work two days a week on average.

1158
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Right.

1159
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So what I did was like halfway through March, it's like, oh man, starting April, my dad might

1160
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
make me work in.

1161
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So I pay him $200 for April preemptively.

1162
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Yeah.

1163
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And then I just threw in another $400 and I said, this is the premium.

1164
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
That's all I said, which is, this is the premium.

1165
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Such a fucking thing.

1166
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And then, and then, you know, we're, we're getting home from a Ted Cruz rally and at the, right

1167
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
before we get out of the car, my dad's like, so David, I've been scheduling the work that

1168
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
you'll be doing starting as April.

1169
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And I'm like, what?

1170
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
But I paid you the premium.

1171
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
He's like the premium.

1172
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Like, like you just accepted that money.

1173
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Because he totally knows what the fuck the premium means.

1174
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So I was like, um, and I was like, but I gave you $600 in total.

1175
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And he was like, oh, but that's not anywhere close to finishing off your expenses.

1176
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm like, oh, so I bolted out of the car and then went upstairs and okay, there, I'll leave.

1177
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I went up to my computer, logged into the chat.

1178
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Now I'll throw it back to you.

1179
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So Davoo tells me like, you know, it's not working.

1180
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I don't have enough to bribe my dad.

1181
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1182
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm freaking out.

1183
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You're like, I think you had decided to like completely log off Skype and like log off the internet.

1184
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I uninstalled Skype.

1185
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Uninstalled Skype.

1186
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Just to make sure he wouldn't be on.

1187
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So I've got to make videos right now.

1188
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Like, what am I going to do?

1189
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I'm going to make a video.

1190
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I started playing thief and I just kept, I just played thief all night.

1191
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Got to make a video about thief.

1192
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And I couldn't come up with any ideas.

1193
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I'm like, ah, so, so Davoo's like trying to fucking desperately make videos for his own channel so he can grow it.

1194
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Because mine's not paying him enough.

1195
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Literally the same day that Davoo leaves the internet was the day that we posted the last asterisk war.

1196
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And it just so happens that within like 30 hours of posting the last asterisk war video,

1197
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
my Patreon goes up by a hundred dollars.

1198
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
A hundred dollars!

1199
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It was, it was insanity.

1200
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And I'm sitting there like, where the fuck are you, Davoo?

1201
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
What are you fucking doing?

1202
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
This is the last time you should be leaving.

1203
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I can pay you anything now.

1204
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
What's happening?

1205
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
No, I mean, you couldn't at the time.

1206
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Like, your, your, your patronage had to go up another couple hundred dollars over the course of a month or two.

1207
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Right?

1208
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
But it was, it was a really fucking hilarious time.

1209
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Well, well, here's the thing though, right?

1210
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Because I was there when your channel had that second wave in summer.

1211
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And I remember saying on the pub crawl chat,

1212
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
huh, I made such a good decision to work for your channel.

1213
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I always make great decisions.

1214
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Because I thought, great, you're going to explode now, but you didn't explode enough.

1215
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:19,000
So I'm like, okay, I'm not going to like, lie around and like, bank purely on the hope that you're going to be big enough for me to be able to do full time money on it.

1216
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It was like one day though.

1217
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
No, like, like, no, no, no, no, no.

1218
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
It like, it took a couple more weeks, you know, like, it was just like before it was like,

1219
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
because who knows, maybe it would just be like a hundred dollars and then that's it.

1220
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But it was immediately obvious that this was the worst possible time to not be on the channel.

1221
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I disagree.

1222
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I disagree.

1223
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I think, well, I mean, in terms of my own content, screaming too much.

1224
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Sorry.

1225
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Too loud.

1226
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
You know what?

1227
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Uh, no.

1228
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Anyway, I'm going to be, keep being loud.

1229
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Did somebody just come in and tell you to shut up or something?

1230
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
No, my dad texted me too loud, but you know, whatever.

1231
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Um, so the thing is, I had to make my own videos because like this, this is what offended me in the interview with Ben is how you guys were talking about my videos in present tense.

1232
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Even though I consider all of them before the slipperiness versus tightness video to be my old videos that don't represent my writing style.

1233
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Like, because I had been going through this phase where my writing was too tight, was too concise that no one would understand it.

1234
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Like the Undertale video, which no one got.

1235
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And you were telling me that you should slow down a bit and say things in ways that people are going to understand.

1236
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And so I made like all of two videos that were in that style because I'm like, I know how to write even better now.

1237
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I need to make good videos now.

1238
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So I ended up making like a couple of videos like that to prove that I can be good.

1239
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And I'm glad I have like two videos that are really great, I think almost.

1240
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And that way I can prove to the world that like, you know, you all know now exactly what I am denying you.

1241
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
And that's all I need for my pride.

1242
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Like, like ultimately, um, I am more intro just slightly more invested in the narrative of your channel than I am of mine.

1243
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Like part like the amount of creative satisfaction I get working for your channel just barely edges out my own.

1244
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So as soon as I was able to make those two videos toward the end of March, I believe, or April.

1245
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,000
No, toward the end of March, whenever it was, um, I believe it was March.

1246
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I really remember a quote that stuck with me forever about like, when you started writing for me or editing for me, rather,

1247
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:39,000
and I sent you like I was asking you like if it was like if it was creatively fulfilling for you to edit my videos, like, you know,

1248
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
is it really more fun than doing your own stuff or something like that?

1249
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And you said that whenever you read one of my scripts, you feel like all of the energy of it immediately transfers to you.

1250
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Like something to that effect.

1251
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Like you get like this, like you read it and you get excited as if it was something you wrote yourself, you know,

1252
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
like you want it to exist so badly that you make it.

1253
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I remember saying that in relation to just your videos in general.

1254
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Like I see, I could watch a video and I feel like I'm in the video and stuff, yeah.

1255
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I take that for granted now too.

1256
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Obviously if I was editing for anyone else, which I wouldn't be, I would be able to tell by contrast the sheer lack of enthusiasm I would have.

1257
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Well, I think a big part of what makes me like you as an editor so much is that you'll get one of my scripts

1258
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:39,000
and if you like it enough, you'll say like, I have to make this good because this script needs to be good.

1259
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh yeah, the worst was the 10 best things happening in anime.

1260
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yeah.

1261
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I was just like, stop making it good.

1262
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
No, stop.

1263
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
No effort.

1264
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
No.

1265
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Effort.

1266
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Because for me, like, I mean, that's how I feel when I write it.

1267
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
You know, I reach, like I write the post and in my head, it's the greatest thing in the universe.

1268
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I'm like, I finish, you know, something like the Psycho Pass videos or something and like, when I'm done writing it, I'm like, this is the best thing ever.

1269
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
But then the process of editing just drains me of all giving a fuck and eventually I'm sick of it and I just want it.

1270
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Like in the Three Ham song, I said like, I hope Davoo likes the show and continues with the edit because if I'm doing that shit, I'm fucking setting it to Deus Ex footage.

1271
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:29,000
In the event that you hadn't edited the Psycho Pass videos, I would have just set it to video game footage and been done with it because I just couldn't take it anymore, you know.

1272
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
But for you, it's like you get the script and it's like your first instinct is, well, this is great.

1273
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:44,000
So this obviously has to exist and be good or else, you know, it's going to be a failure on the part of the universe, you know.

1274
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Yeah.

1275
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And I love that about your editing process.

1276
01:24:48,000 --> 01:25:01,000
So the trauma hadn't ended there though because then, so like, because like what had happened is that my Patreon was still growing steadily and I was getting slightly more views.

1277
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And so then it was just like an issue of like, oh yeah, I guess I wasn't sure how did this go.

1278
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I wasn't sure how much money I was going to have to pay my dad for me to ransom myself away from his business.

1279
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And I just wasn't sure what I wanted to do more.

1280
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
My own channel or yours.

1281
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And there was just like a million variables to consider.

1282
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And I don't remember how I just ended up deciding on your channel.

1283
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Yeah.

1284
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Yeah.

1285
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So then that's the end of the story.

1286
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
How has that been going by the way?

1287
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Like, because here's the thing, like I was saying earlier, you used to be infamous for the way that you'd have all these revelations, that everything would be this life altering, crazy thing.

1288
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And all these things you're describing to me with this fervor that you're describing it, that fervor was even more intense in the moments that these things were happening.

1289
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:04,000
You would email me like the entire world had just come to an end, you know, on like a daily basis about how your finances and your situation with your dad was going and stuff.

1290
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
And it was like overwhelming.

1291
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
It was true though.

1292
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And it was always like, it was always like this madness that you were emailing me and I'm like, all right.

1293
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I remember especially a couple of times I'm like, I need to definitely get across how insane I'm going.

1294
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
You need to know.

1295
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And it was well communicated.

1296
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:31,000
But finally, after the Myriad Colors fandom world video that it wasn't.

1297
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah, it was.

1298
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
No, it was immediately after Astroscore that I hired you full time because we hit the benchmark.

1299
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And that's when I sent you the doc where it was like, we're professionals now.

1300
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
You're now my employee.

1301
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And oh yeah, you sent me that.

1302
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Here's the videos we're going to do in April of 2016.

1303
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And it was like five videos and they all had a schedule and they all came out ahead of schedule.

1304
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Well, one of them came out on schedule.

1305
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
The rest came out ahead of schedule.

1306
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And it was like, whoa, I'm glad that you made the schedule so easy.

1307
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But well, we made a great, cool schedule.

1308
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And I was like, you're now my full time employee.

1309
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
You're going to do all the main series content, all the main videos on my channel.

1310
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You're now the editor.

1311
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,000
And I can pick, like, because the way you had said it was that you needed to make,

1312
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
because I asked you, like, how much do you need to make to keep your dad off your back?

1313
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And you said probably like $900 a month.

1314
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And I was like, cool, I'm going to write enough videos that I can pay you $900 a month

1315
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and I still will have enough money to get myself through.

1316
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That's been my goal ever since.

1317
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
So with that month, it was five videos is enough that I'll have enough money and you'll have enough money.

1318
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And then the next month, we only needed four videos for us to both have enough money.

1319
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
And then this month, hopefully three will be enough.

1320
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Well, okay, here's the thing.

1321
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Let's get to the month.

1322
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Once again, the inadvertent hunger protests have been taking effect where it was like,

1323
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I was like, hmm, dad, you know, like, I can pay you $900,

1324
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
but I think I'm just going to pay you $600 and not eat much this month.

1325
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Like I just, that's what I just said.

1326
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
And my mom was like, how about you just pay $600?

1327
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
They just can't, they cannot live with the thought.

1328
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I swear I'm not doing this deliberately.

1329
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I'm not that evil, but just how it happened.

1330
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Because like my dad grew up poor and not always fed.

1331
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So I guess he just can't deal with that.

1332
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
My dad is the exact same.

1333
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
My dad will not stand for anybody like being hungry at any time.

1334
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I just love how like both of our dads had such similar upbringings

1335
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
and but then like went on to have such different personalities.

1336
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
But they're both very super hardworking and entrepreneurial.

1337
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Well, I guess your dad's not entrepreneurial.

1338
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Anyway, but better.

1339
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
If it was, my dad was a hardcore Christian for a brief time,

1340
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:47,000
just later in life, he became disillusioned very quickly.

1341
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Fakers.

1342
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
You're not a real Christian.

1343
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You're a faker.

1344
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
So anyway, let's see what happens then.

1345
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Then I, yeah, it's been great doing, oh, where are we?

1346
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
All right, I'll pick up for you.

1347
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Yeah, we're essentially, you're full time now.

1348
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And now the goal is move you up here to Virginia.

1349
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Right.

1350
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Because your internet sucks.

1351
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It always has.

1352
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
It's like a fact of life.

1353
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
The internet sucks if you're the debut.

1354
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So indeed.

1355
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
So we want to make.

1356
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I'm really hoping that I won't bring the curse over.

1357
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
We're trying to get you over here.

1358
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And you also just don't want to live at home because you don't

1359
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
like that feeling of describe what your revelation was after the

1360
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
biggest problem of the universe episode about.

1361
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Oh, yeah.

1362
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Well, it wasn't really a revelation.

1363
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It was just like a logical conclusion.

1364
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Dick brought in the problem of adults living with their families.

1365
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Because before this, I'm like, you know, the only reason to move

1366
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
out is just to say that I moved out.

1367
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Like it's not necessarily that important.

1368
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And then, but like Dick was like, you know, like whenever I go

1369
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
home to my parents, like whenever I like visit my parents, you know,

1370
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
there's a part of my brain that like becomes 13.

1371
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And it's like, I can't, if people are just like that all the time,

1372
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
they can't mentally develop.

1373
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Yeah.

1374
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Now I think that to an extent it's like not only that he's living,

1375
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
it's not only that he's staying with his parents,

1376
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
but also he's taking a break from work.

1377
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
If you're working full time in your bedroom,

1378
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I don't think it's the same quite, same quite of an effect.

1379
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
But when I listened to that podcast, I remembered the fact that one

1380
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
time my parents went out of the house for like a couple of days for

1381
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
like an anniversary thing.

1382
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And so I had to kind of be the one to watch over my siblings,

1383
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
although my brother is more equipped for that.

1384
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
But I was suddenly much more aware of my surroundings.

1385
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I could feel the locks on the doors.

1386
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And then when my parents came back, those sensations went away.

1387
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
And I'm like, oh my God, maybe I'm not mentally developing correctly.

1388
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
So as soon as I got in, got it in my head,

1389
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I should probably leave the house just to like have a more dynamic

1390
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
and excited life of like being a little bit more stressed out,

1391
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
a little bit more on edge, but in a productive way, not an anxiety way,

1392
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
but more of a being an adult sort of way.

1393
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Then I started deliberately looking at living at home as negatively as possible.

1394
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
And that was the cause of all of my railings against Christianity

1395
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
that some people who follow me on Twitter can find out about today,

1396
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
where I was praying to Satan and asking that he revokes any prayer

1397
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
that is made upon me by my parents.

1398
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Yeah, it's an interesting prospect.

1399
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
For me, I definitely feel what Dick was saying.

1400
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And I don't feel like I encounter it too much because I don't spend much time around my parents,

1401
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
because our house is fucking enormous, my room is very secluded,

1402
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and there's times where I barely see them for days.

1403
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
They're always just on the couch down there and I'll just pass through and I'll go, hey.

1404
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'm pretty much the same way. I mean, I don't have as much audio distance as you can tell,

1405
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:56,000
but I also just go without seeing them that much for a while.

1406
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Well, it's finally sort of cracked it.

1407
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Because for a long time, when I am around my parents, when we do something as a family,

1408
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
it is exactly that problem Dick was talking about.

1409
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
And as you'll know if you've listened to Digi Bros.,

1410
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
making dinner in my family has always been this weird nightmare.

1411
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Because everyone has different tastes and no one wants to do it.

1412
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And it's the kind of thing where we were kind of forcing ourselves to all eat the same dinner,

1413
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
even though it didn't make any sense.

1414
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And it would always be this ordeal where I'd go downstairs,

1415
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
living my life as a guy with a job and doing all this work and everything,

1416
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,000
and then I'd go downstairs and for 45 minutes just enter this fiasco of trying to organize dinner.

1417
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And my mental age would just plummet down to 14.

1418
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Because it's the same exact stuff we've been doing since 14.

1419
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:56,000
The same arguments, the same indecisions everyone has, the same everyone just being lazy and stupid.

1420
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And finally, like a month or so ago, it's completely cut out.

1421
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
We don't do it anymore.

1422
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Because my dad became a vegetarian, along with my mom, who's been one for a long time.

1423
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
My dad became a vegetarian and Victor and Shader grown now.

1424
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And it was just like, no one wants to do this anymore.

1425
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Let's all just make our own food.

1426
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And ever since then, I haven't had any of those moments of like,

1427
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
wow, I feel like I'm fucking 12 again.

1428
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Because I see my parents in a very...

1429
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I encounter them at random sometimes.

1430
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And I'll hang out for a little bit and talk the business what's going on in my life.

1431
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But it's never like I have to rely on them for us all to make a decision about a food we're going to eat or something,

1432
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
which is a fucking nightmare, you know?

1433
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Yeah, I hate that.

1434
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I don't think my family has done that for a while.

1435
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Actually, we just all have the same tastes.

1436
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I guess I take that for granted.

1437
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,000
My mom is able to make something that all of us like 85% of the time, I would say.

1438
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Yeah, that would be zero.

1439
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Yeah, so she doesn't make stuff.

1440
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
That's how it happens.

1441
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
She eats it, and then my dad and my brother eat it when they get home from work.

1442
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And my sister eats it.

1443
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And then I eat it three hours later out of the fridge.

1444
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Because I never eat it at the same time everyone else does, like most of the time.

1445
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
So that's not as much of an issue for us.

1446
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Although outside of dinner, we do always just cook our own meals.

1447
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
And then that causes dishes to go out of whack.

1448
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And my mom actually said, hey, David, how about you don't pay any rent.

1449
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
You just wash the dishes.

1450
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And my dad is not sure about that.

1451
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
But I'm going to accept the proposition from my mom.

1452
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I'll just wash the dishes.

1453
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Great deals.

1454
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
So all right.

1455
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:40,000
We ended up talking about me and you's relationship for way longer than I thought we would.

1456
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
But you kept getting so excited about it and going on and on.

1457
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Yeah, if you want to hear this stuff really in depth, go to patreon.com.

1458
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Did you bro?

1459
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Pledge five dollars.

1460
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Get access to our massively long commentaries where we will be commentating on all of his videos.

1461
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
We started with the sword art online ones and then we went back all the way to his pre pony days.

1462
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
We sped through all of his pre anime stuff just kind of showing you the highlights.

1463
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Then we're going through all of his anime.

1464
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Yeah.

1465
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Okay.

1466
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And then we're going to be going through every single one of his main videos since then.

1467
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And we don't just like let the video play and then like talk over the video.

1468
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
No, we like let five seconds of the video play and talk for a long time.

1469
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Some videos we talk about for one hour or more we talk about.

1470
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:35,000
So it is definitely the final statements on all of your work.

1471
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Yeah.

1472
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Like it just it will exhaust everything I want to say about this video.

1473
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,000
So if you want to hear every little minutiae of how he writes and how I've been doing the editing, you got to pay money.

1474
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Yeah.

1475
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But there are a lot like this discussion we've been having.

1476
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
This is almost like a, as soon as we started getting like way deep into it.

1477
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I had to kind of like remind myself that we're not doing a commentary that we're doing an interview with you.

1478
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
But I don't know.

1479
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I mean that's what, that's kind of what your life has been for the last couple years, right?

1480
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Like have you been doing much of anything other than work and editing my videos?

1481
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Like work, editing your videos, making my videos, making NesQuest.

1482
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Which is your videos.

1483
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Every once in a while I write like a chapter of erotic fiction for myself.

1484
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
That's about the only other art I think that no one knows about.

1485
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Well not just art, but like is there anything you do as like a hobby or out of the house or anywhere you go?

1486
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
How are you about eating?

1487
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Because I eat out twice a fucking day.

1488
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Oh yeah, I never eat out.

1489
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I don't want to, I mean for one thing there's not that many restaurants around here.

1490
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
And I don't want to spend the money.

1491
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I don't have the money.

1492
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And I hate leaving the house because, I mean I like leaving the house but time elapses at like 300% as soon as you leave the house.

1493
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And I get home and I'm like where the fuck did Monday go?

1494
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Is that kind of feeling when I get home?

1495
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So I'm like that's why I'll just start, I won't even go to get groceries.

1496
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Even though I desperately need food to get groceries.

1497
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I don't want to leave the house and lose like five hours and twenty minutes.

1498
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
So I just starve instead, you know.

1499
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
You still use your trampoline, right?

1500
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Or didn't it get destroyed by the storm or something?

1501
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Oh we got a new one.

1502
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I couldn't figure out how to make a video about how, hey guys actually we got another one.

1503
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And then my brother bent it slightly but not quite so it still works.

1504
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I'm like, yeah there's a lot of trampoline lore that I haven't been able to translate into videos.

1505
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So I don't really do anything else other than videos.

1506
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I have a basic understanding of your dad is a guy who is a hardcore Christian, works a lot.

1507
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Those are kind of the two most important things.

1508
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,000
When his phone is on he's working because he has a business and he also, along with my brother,

1509
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:01,000
are the only people who do the actual labor of the business because, newsflash, no one wants to clean windows.

1510
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
My dad's business is perfect, the customers are satisfied, the customers don't stop pouring in.

1511
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,000
But no one, he can't grow the business because no one wants to work for it and I would know.

1512
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Because I don't.

1513
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
It's a sad story.

1514
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Yeah, so that's your dad.

1515
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Your mom is a normie.

1516
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
She's just a great mom.

1517
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
What does she do, just hanging around the house?

1518
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
She's just like, yeah she's like a house, I mean most of her days spent driving my sister around

1519
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
because my sister is one of those kids who goes to places to go to a class for a thing.

1520
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
She's like a dancer per person.

1521
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I can't believe I forgot to ask this earlier but we took so long before we got to your personal information.

1522
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
How old are you?

1523
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I am 22.

1524
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
22 debut, when's your birthday?

1525
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
April 30th.

1526
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Okay, so.

1527
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
The same birthday as Tom Fulp, the founder of Newgrounds.

1528
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Okay.

1529
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Yeah, you're 22 so you're the second youngest.

1530
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Are you younger than Hippo or older?

1531
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
No, I'm the youngest TPC person by like nine months, yeah.

1532
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Oh man, I didn't think about you being younger than Hippo.

1533
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
It's true.

1534
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,000
So you're the youngest TPC and you've got two younger siblings.

1535
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Right, my brother who's listening to this is 18 I think.

1536
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Yeah, he was born August 12th, 1997.

1537
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Is he listening to this because he listens to the procrastinators or because you're gonna make it?

1538
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Well, he probably will listen to this and he listens to all of the procrastinators, yes.

1539
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
When I talked about him being epic in the bed, like with the light descending on him at night,

1540
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
he was like, oh man, David, when you talked about me, that was like really weird.

1541
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:56,000
So anyway, yeah, my brother was born August 12th, 1997, one day before the airing of the first episode of South Park.

1542
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
That's how you can remember that.

1543
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
He said April, what day?

1544
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
August 12th, 1997, that's my brother's birthday.

1545
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
He's like 18, he's about a month and a half older than Shade, yeah.

1546
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Yeah, something like that.

1547
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And then my sister, who is 12, was born March 9th, 2004.

1548
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
March 9th, the same day that Smash Brothers Brawl came out.

1549
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Brawl came out on her fourth birthday, so that's whenever...

1550
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I was gonna say, I thought you meant that she was born the same day that Brawl came out.

1551
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:32,000
The reason why that's significant to me is that every time, that's significant to me,

1552
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
especially because I was waiting for Brawl with every bated breath of my life

1553
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
and it got delayed twice to March 9th, and then every time March 9th comes around,

1554
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I'm like, hey Abigail, guess what day it is?

1555
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
The anniversary of Brawl!

1556
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And I leave, you know.

1557
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
So yeah.

1558
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
If you wanna see my sister in action as an actress,

1559
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:04,000
you can go to my channel, go to my dumbness playlist, click on promotion tragedy.

1560
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It's a video that was written by my sister and she stars in it, directed by my brother,

1561
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
and he did the soundtrack, and I did like, some supervising and editing.

1562
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
It's a... oh man.

1563
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I'm getting a call about how loud I'm being from.

1564
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Turn off my phone now.

1565
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
You know.

1566
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
You're not gonna answer the call?

1567
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I'm gonna try and actually be quiet now, maybe.

1568
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Hey baby, I'm gonna turn up the game so I can be quiet, I don't know.

1569
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,000
So, yeah, so those are my siblings, so my sister is 12 and stuff, so yeah.

1570
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I guess that was the end of that.

1571
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Yeah, nothing interesting about them at all, just a couple of brats.

1572
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Um, well my sister, you know, I do greatly respect that she's like a dancer person,

1573
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:04,000
she has a lot of, she's very serious about it, like she's like one of the only people in her dance studio

1574
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
who's like serious about the, about the profession, you know?

1575
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Like she's pretty into it.

1576
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So I do like that, but I can't get into dance at all, I just, I watch it and I'm just bored out of my mind,

1577
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
like I don't know what to do.

1578
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
It's just like, I can't really relate to that art at all, so.

1579
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It is weird though seeing my sister how dancing is such a fulfilling thing to her

1580
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and she got into it when she was four, and I told her once, do you know how weird it is

1581
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
that you got to be like fulfilled in your life, like for as long as you've been alive?

1582
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Because I haven't, and I told her, I only started being fulfilled in my life three months ago, actually.

1583
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Hey Abigail, you notice?

1584
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
She doesn't totally comprehend that being that she's 12.

1585
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
She's smart, I talk to her all the time, so she knows my line of thinking.

1586
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I was able to induct her into this, into this philosophy because I told her like, hey,

1587
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:04,000
you notice how up until a couple of months ago, if anyone stood next to me in the kitchen,

1588
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
like if I was cooking something on a burner and then someone was cooking something next to me,

1589
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I would immediately seem really angry and uncomfortable and want to die.

1590
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That's because I wasn't happy with my life until a couple of months ago.

1591
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Now finally, people can be cooking something on a skillet next to me and it doesn't bother me.

1592
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
And she was like, wow, you're right.

1593
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So yeah, so that's kind of a weird thing that my sister has, is like takes for granted that having a good life,

1594
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
or I don't know, maybe I'm totally wrong, I don't know.

1595
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:39,000
And then my brother is a dude who's very talented, but he doesn't have like, hasn't like yet taken the initiative

1596
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
to like really go full force on making something specific, although he did make one,

1597
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
he is trying to do let's play videos now or something because I told him he could be a great let's play guy.

1598
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
So maybe he'll be doing it, but he doesn't have, this is both, you know, a good and a bad thing.

1599
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
It's like, it's a different way of being an artist.

1600
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:01,000
He doesn't have tireless agonizing, burning passion, like, or more like agony, more like,

1601
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
not, I don't want to say passion, that sounds too positive.

1602
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It's almost, what compels me to make art professionally is like 25% positive and 75% negative reinforcement, you know.

1603
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,000
So, I don't know, my brother just doesn't, he's just more okay with like cleaning windows and stuff.

1604
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
So, you know, he's just like a different kind of dude, but it does make it hard for me to like collaborate with him on stuff

1605
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
because he'll just like lose inspiration more.

1606
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And he might be, he might be really upset right now listening to this like, yeah, David, you told me about this.

1607
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
And I don't know how he feels about that.

1608
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
And I don't know how he feels about the fact that I've acknowledged that he feels that way.

1609
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I don't know how he feels about the fact that I've acknowledged the fact that he's acknowledged.

1610
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I got, we won't talk about your siblings and family anymore.

1611
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:52,000
So, I've gotten the impression, there's a sort of odd duality with you because on the one hand,

1612
01:44:52,000 --> 01:45:00,000
you have been on the internet for a long time, I think, and seem to have a lot of sort of worldly knowledge

1613
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and like understanding of other people around the world because of that,

1614
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:11,000
but that in your actual personal life, it seems like you've been extremely sheltered, would you say so?

1615
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Kind of.

1616
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Because you went to homeschool your whole life, right?

1617
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Yeah.

1618
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And then you worked for your dad.

1619
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Right, my parents triple sheltered me, right?

1620
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
What's the third one?

1621
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Well, just being a regular shelter that like most kids these days get.

1622
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
You know, then homeschooling, then a family business.

1623
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So yeah, it's been like constant exposure to family, mostly only.

1624
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:45,000
But I think that maybe, tell me if this is going to be a revelation for you because I just thought of this.

1625
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And I don't know if I'm going to finally blow your mind for the first time in a few months.

1626
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Alright, so you know, I as a kid had an understanding of other people from school

1627
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and then a different understanding that I kind of got from the internet where I sort of relearned people online.

1628
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Would you say that your understanding of other people is more based on the internet?

1629
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Because you ran into fewer people growing up and you've been online for so long.

1630
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Still there?

1631
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
And also I want to know exactly how long it's been on the internet.

1632
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I'm going to say slightly no.

1633
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Like I do get plenty of social interaction.

1634
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
There's plenty of church stuff like, you know, every week tons of social interaction.

1635
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:54,000
So I'm going to say, I don't know, I'm going to put that on hold.

1636
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
I don't know the answer to that.

1637
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So my history with the internet was I first started using it occasionally on my dad's computer here

1638
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
and there to play games or something in like 2002 probably.

1639
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
And then I got more into like browsing the internet on my own in around 2006

1640
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:13,000
and got into forums in 2007 and that's how I became part of internet communities.

1641
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And I've just been doing it constantly every day ever since.

1642
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
So yeah, that's my internet history.

1643
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
My computer history starts when I was like two.

1644
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I've just been on the computer most of the day, every day, my whole life.

1645
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:33,000
I think everyone in the procrastinators has been a long time internet user.

1646
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I've gotten the impression we all got on before it was normal.

1647
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I know that for some of our audience who are younger, they might not know.

1648
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And maybe even you, do you know that there was a time when it was weird in our lifetime?

1649
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I think 2007 was slightly the...

1650
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Yeah, I'd say that's...

1651
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
It was still slightly the period of it not being normal.

1652
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Like Facebook wasn't like a huge thing yet.

1653
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
My space was still around.

1654
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
That's the era we're talking about.

1655
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I'd say that 2004 and 2005 was when it was like kids at school knew what the internet was.

1656
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And then 2007 was when it was...

1657
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
2007, 2008 was when it was like, oh, your parents are on there.

1658
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Everyone's on there.

1659
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Now it's widespread.

1660
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
But yeah, I've been on the internet since 01.

1661
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,000
So it was significantly before it was super-duper mainstream.

1662
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Although, of course, people who were on in the 90s will still be like,

1663
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,000
2001, you weren't on DOS.

1664
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I'm sure Maddox would scoff at...

1665
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Hey, man, I've been on the internet since the 90s.

1666
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
What, you were on in 2000s?

1667
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Well, what if you were in the 2030s?

1668
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Then you wouldn't be anything, huh?

1669
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
What about that, buddy?

1670
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Yeah.

1671
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
So yeah, you've been on for a long time.

1672
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,000
And I've always gotten the impression that you've been in a lot of...

1673
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Yes.

1674
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I know the rest of your sentence there.

1675
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Yeah, that's where I spent most of my time, I think.

1676
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Like fetish websites, I guess, is what I'm getting towards.

1677
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Yeah, or fetish communities on DeviantArt.

1678
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
That's where I spend a lot of my time.

1679
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I still occasionally do some of that.

1680
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
It's easier to stay motivated with that.

1681
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
But I've also been into...

1682
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
My main thing has always been internet review stuff.

1683
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Dang, your video game nerd was really into nostalgia critic

1684
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
and always wished I could like any of the other hacks that were on that website for a long time.

1685
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Obviously, I'm not into nostalgia critic anymore,

1686
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
because it's not cool anymore, and it's nostalgia critic.

1687
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I've been into YouTube for a long time.

1688
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I mean, I was into YouTube a lot in like 2007, 2008.

1689
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
And then people started migrating away from it, YouTubers anyway,

1690
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
like review people because of copyright.

1691
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
But then they all started coming back in around 2010,

1692
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
and that's when I got big into YouTube more.

1693
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:52,000
So I've never really been someone who spends a huge percentage of my time talking to other people.

1694
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
There weren't a whole lot of people who I stumbled into who were worth talking to for very long.

1695
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:02,000
So I'd never had like really great internet friends until now, really.

1696
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That's interesting.

1697
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
So for you, it was more following content creators and less like Skyping people all day.

1698
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Yeah, kinda.

1699
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Yeah, there were a grand total of two people who I had like long relationships with,

1700
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
one I still talk to, and one I do not at all.

1701
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,000
So yeah, there was only really two people who I really made connections with,

1702
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
and even then it wasn't like a huge deal.

1703
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
There weren't people who like, I would like lie and wait,

1704
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:35,000
waiting to hear what they had to say about something until this, probably, pretty much.

1705
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
That's interesting because that's the opposite for me.

1706
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I did talk to people a lot, just not for very long, you know.

1707
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I don't know what it is about this particular interview,

1708
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:52,000
but this is the one that's making me like look forward to when I get one of you to interview me.

1709
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Maybe it'll be you since you...

1710
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Maybe it'll be you.

1711
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
You'll just be like, hey, Digi.

1712
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I'd rather not.

1713
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I think...

1714
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
No, I'm kidding.

1715
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Yeah, I can interview you.

1716
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I think you would be the best interviewer.

1717
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I'd probably be the best one.

1718
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Only because of the fact that you won't ask me shit that I've already said as much.

1719
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Yeah.

1720
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Because you've heard me repeat myself countless fucking times,

1721
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,000
and I'm sure you're sick of hearing some of those questions, you know.

1722
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Where it's like Nate, who's probably listened to the least of my shit,

1723
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
would probably ask me asinine questions.

1724
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I've answered a thousand fucking times.

1725
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Indeed.

1726
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
So...

1727
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
All right, so you can't...

1728
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I think it's funny, you know, I'm gonna go ahead and play a defense for you here, Dubu.

1729
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Because I think probably the fact that you have kind of weird fetishes

1730
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
compared to, I guess, how people perceive themselves

1731
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
seems to be well known,

1732
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
because we all make fun of you for it all the time.

1733
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:57,000
And I gotta say, I think, I will definitely step up in defense of it,

1734
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
because I think that's A, what the internet's for,

1735
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
and B, I don't get where people draw their line, you know.

1736
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Like, everyone's like, everything up to what I'm into is normal,

1737
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
but as soon as you go past what I'm into, that it's not cool anymore, you know, like...

1738
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Like someone who's only into, like, straight, normal porn

1739
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
is always like, how can you be into lolly,

1740
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
and then people who are into lolly are like, how can you be into guru,

1741
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
and then people who are into guru are like, how can you be into scat, you know,

1742
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
and it's like, guys, look at yourself, you know how you like that thing,

1743
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
you know how you look at it, and your pee-pee goes poo-poo,

1744
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
and then you get your jacket, and it goes swish-poo-poo,

1745
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
that's what all of them are doing, you know.

1746
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I haven't even been into, like, the fetishes that are weird to you that much lately,

1747
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I've just been just going on galburo mostly these days, so, I mean...

1748
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
How long have you known about that, did I introduce you to that, or have you just always...

1749
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I don't know how, probably you, but yeah, the last couple of months I was like,

1750
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
oh, this is a much better source than D on 4chan, you know,

1751
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
but I don't know, like, I don't...

1752
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Like, how D is your go-to porn, like, I feel like that says everything.

1753
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,000
It's not, it's not really, I've never really had much of a go-to before, so, I don't know.

1754
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I'm like an E guy myself, but that's so much a D guy.

1755
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Yeah.

1756
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Yeah, um...

1757
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Yeah, I don't really see...

1758
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I don't know what...

1759
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I don't know, you say you're playing defense for me, I don't know,

1760
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I don't see where the defense is needed, honestly.

1761
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
You say, oh, we make fun of you for it a lot, like, I don't know, like, once a month...

1762
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,000
No, I'm just saying that, like, I'm just saying that, like, you know,

1763
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I have, there's people sometimes who will say things to me, like, just be like,

1764
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,000
wow, Davoo's really into that, like, like, off to the side, like, is he really into that?

1765
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Like, you know, like, in disbelief, I'm like, why is that so hard to imagine, you know,

1766
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,000
like, that people are into weird shit, you're into weird shit,

1767
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
we're all into, like, the person asking me, you know.

1768
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yeah, you know what I think actually is, what I've realized is actually probably my number one thing,

1769
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
is mind control art, that's the hottest thing ever,

1770
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
like, you just get out of, like, a mind control device, then they're mind controlled,

1771
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,000
like, wow, it's like, all of the non-consensuality of rape without any of the screaming,

1772
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
like, that's really cool, you know, so...

1773
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I totally get you, uh...

1774
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Yeah, like, you know how, like, in the sleep cast, how Ben said,

1775
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,000
uh, I'm really into, like, the loss of humanity or whatever, or the loss of identity?

1776
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Uh, and I said, yeah!

1777
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
No, it was, uh...

1778
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Ah, fuck, it was something like that, but it wasn't that phrase.

1779
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Well, okay, well, that kind of stuff, I like that, you know, like, people losing grip on themselves.

1780
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
That's pretty, like, I don't know, it's like, frightening in a way.

1781
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
No, yeah, he said dehumanizing, he likes the dehumanizing.

1782
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Yeah, man, it's like, it's such a frightening concept,

1783
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,000
and it, like, the fright goes into your brain and it, like, forades its way into your libido or something.

1784
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I don't know how that works, but, yeah.

1785
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
So, um...

1786
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Next topic?

1787
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Yeah, um, well, I'm trying to think.

1788
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
We're like two hours in, uh...

1789
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I don't know, it's harder with you, because I don't, like, I know that you've been just, uh, since...

1790
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Well, you didn't really have high school, but I know that since the finish of...

1791
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
whatever you'd call it, you've been cleaning windows.

1792
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Giving up.

1793
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:28,000
You haven't, uh, gone on a pan-Europe trip, or, uh...

1794
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
or sat around in a barn.

1795
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Do you have any, like, super exciting stories about things you've done with your friends?

1796
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Are there any stories you break out every once in a while, when you're like, oh, man.

1797
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Let me tell you about this one.

1798
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:53,000
I can't tell if you're doing that, ironically, or if you're trying to think of something.

1799
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Um, well, it's hard to think of something when I'm doing it, so I guess I should just be quiet.

1800
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Um...

1801
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
We'll see. Does it have to be, like, not internet-related, or...?

1802
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
No, just whatever. Any cool stories you want to share that would make people think,

1803
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,000
wow, Davoo has done some cool things in his life.

1804
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Well, I bought a sheep kigurumi, took some photos of me in it, so...

1805
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Kigurumi.

1806
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Kigurumi.

1807
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I should make that the background of this video.

1808
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Send me that picture, and I'll make that the, uh...

1809
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Well, there's a fanart of it, and I'll send you that. That's much better.

1810
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Someone did a fanart of me in that.

1811
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Those words are pretty adorable, so that's good.

1812
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Um, you have these alt channels, uh, Davoo Goes to Saturn,

1813
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
and, uh, the NesQuest channel.

1814
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
It's called NesQuest, right? Or is it Davoo?

1815
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
It's just called Davoo Plays Games, yeah.

1816
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Um, tell me about NesQuest. How did this happen?

1817
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Well, uh, I always felt like no matter how much I learned about the NES,

1818
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
there's always more to learn, so I needed to just play every game that's on it,

1819
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
and I thought, well, hey, I could make a series out of it by playing all of it and making it a Let's Play show.

1820
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Play all of the NES games that were released in, like, order of release date.

1821
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
And thanks to MobyGames, that wasn't so hard to keep track of.

1822
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
And about 98% of all NES games you can find ROMs for.

1823
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
So I'm not gonna play all of them, but, yeah.

1824
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Got my friends to do it, and my brother got on it, but he's like your brother.

1825
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
He can't be on a Let's Play unless he's playing it, so I haven't played most of them,

1826
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
but I've watched most of them, or up to 1987 or so.

1827
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,000
And then, you know, the whole conflict of which channel to focus on resulted in me not working on it much.

1828
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:43,000
But, uh, now that I'm poised to leave home and abandon my friends,

1829
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
my friends were like, well, what about NESQuest?

1830
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I'm like, well, if you guys can put in the effort to do it every week when you come over for, like, at least an hour,

1831
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
maybe we can finish it before I leave.

1832
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I don't know if there's a lot of NES games to get through.

1833
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Yeah, the first, like, 10 episodes were pretty bad.

1834
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Mostly my commentary is terrible, because I was trying to make it, like, a show where people are talking.

1835
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
You know, like, a Let's Play that I would listen to.

1836
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,000
But it's not a Let's Play for commentary, because it's a new game every five minutes.

1837
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
You gotta focus on the game and just make a bunch of dumb jokes and reactions and occasionally say something.

1838
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,000
And I didn't, and so, like, it gets a little bit better after episode 11 or so, or episode 9.

1839
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:25,000
But, uh, now that we're into, like, episode 45 or so, I think it's finally gotten a little bit better, I don't know.

1840
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000
So, uh, it's definitely not, like, a show that you can, like, put on and have a fun time with.

1841
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
It's more like you sit down and, like, veg out.

1842
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Yeah.

1843
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
And, like, just kind of go insane.

1844
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
It's kind of, it's that feeling.

1845
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
It's that feeling of, like, it's at 2 a.m. and your, like, your friends are playing video games,

1846
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,000
and you're, like, in this limbo of tired and not tired and stuff.

1847
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Yeah.

1848
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And, like, everyone is just dead.

1849
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
That's kind of the atmosphere of this quest.

1850
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
That's fantastic.

1851
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Um, I love the idea, like, because I'm also, I think me and you kind of have a similar mindset towards, like, um,

1852
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
culture that we're interested in, which is, like, I just have to fucking consume all of it.

1853
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Like, I will, I need to know everything, and there's no other way.

1854
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Yeah, well, I became more like that by being influenced by you.

1855
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I didn't, like, ever, like, take to that as a way to do things.

1856
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:23,000
But you are a big fan of, like, epic projects and, like, keeping to something for a long time.

1857
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Like, I know you were a big fan of the Titanic bit on The Biggest Problem in the Universe,

1858
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:33,000
where he was watching all of Titanic in 30 seconds, I want to say,

1859
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
versus, like, every time Maddox lost, he had to watch 30 seconds of Titanic.

1860
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
It's like, wow, if Maddox loses 600 times, we'll get through the whole movie.

1861
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I hope they have a thousand episodes, not even close.

1862
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Didn't even make the bit last that long, whatever.

1863
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Um, yeah, so, like, yeah, the whole commentary thing,

1864
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
commentating on all your videos, uh, that was partly my idea, too.

1865
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Like, I was, yeah, so...

1866
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Yeah, well, yeah, you just tend to like to get into these big locked in things,

1867
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
and I appreciate that, because, again, like I just said, uh, you know,

1868
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I'm currently feeling that way about anime, where I'm like,

1869
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I want to watch every single one, uh, until I can't anymore.

1870
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm doing that right now, like, I want to watch all the anime.

1871
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Probably not all of them, but, like, I'm sure I'll know when it's time to stop watching anime,

1872
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
but it probably won't be anytime soon.

1873
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I think you're doing an amazing job of the marathoning.

1874
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,000
So, to tell our audience what you've been doing since you started working full-time for me,

1875
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:39,000
uh, because you haven't, you stopped cleaning windows for the last, uh, all year, right?

1876
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Right, yeah. That's, yeah, 2016, this huge revolutionary year for me,

1877
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
not ever having cleaned a single window.

1878
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,000
You know how I was naked? Maybe I'll do it one more time, as like, as like a...

1879
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
No, that's how they suck you back in, man.

1880
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Well, well, well, and I was like, I felt like maybe right before I move out,

1881
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I'll clean one more time, but get this, right?

1882
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,000
My ankle still hurts sometimes, because I sprained it one time,

1883
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
getting off a ladder, and the grass was wet, because my dad had hosed there.

1884
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
My ankle still hurts sometimes.

1885
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
So...

1886
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Fuck windows! I don't ever want to clean another one again.

1887
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Yeah, um...

1888
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
So, you haven't been cleaning windows anymore,

1889
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
and you have been editing my videos non-stop, and you've abandoned your own videos,

1890
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
so I don't write that fast.

1891
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
What the hell have you been doing when you're not making my videos?

1892
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Yeah, just been watching anime, man.

1893
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I wanted to just do that, because the more anime I watch,

1894
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,000
the more I can edit for you, because that's the number one deficiency I have as your editor.

1895
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
I haven't been much of an anime guy, especially like a year ago.

1896
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I didn't...almost, like, the vast majority of percentage of everything I know about anime

1897
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
was just things you'd talked about.

1898
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I've just not been a person who just hangs out all day in communities in general,

1899
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,000
so I'm not a person who just knows all the spoilers of anything I'm into.

1900
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:03,000
I got bored of the typical run-of-the-mill boilerplate internet communities a long time ago.

1901
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I stopped even being like that with video games a long time ago,

1902
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
and so I just don't know...I know very few basic things about anime,

1903
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
but I know a bunch of really obscure stuff only because of listening to all of your content.

1904
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Well, at this point, you definitely know more than the average anime fan,

1905
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
even just by watching my videos.

1906
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I mean, a lot of my videos are about a thing that I feel like no one knows,

1907
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,000
and therefore everyone needs to, and I think it's more important than all the knowledge they have.

1908
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Like, the video that was a...what's it called?

1909
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Like, the one about different aspects of visual design and, like, how...

1910
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Oh, yeah, that's a great video.

1911
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
What's that video called? Do you remember?

1912
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
How to define the quote in quotes, best-looking anime.

1913
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:54,000
That's the kind of video that I feel, like, that was born out of years and years of frustration

1914
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
of watching people not know how to talk about visuals in anime,

1915
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
and I still don't think anybody does.

1916
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Hey, just talk about that video for a bit while I go to the bathroom.

1917
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I have headphones that go all the way to the bathroom,

1918
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
so I can hear all of what you say.

1919
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I still don't think anybody fully gets out of talk about visuals

1920
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
because there's so many different elements to it,

1921
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
and I think that people look at anime and they say,

1922
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:23,000
alright, you've got story, characters, animation, sound,

1923
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:28,000
and, you know, the personal enjoyment factor, and that's it.

1924
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
And it's like, no, it's not that because it's not just the visuals,

1925
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
it's the character designs, it's the setting design, it's the backgrounds,

1926
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,000
it's the animation itself, it's the directing, the staging,

1927
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:48,000
like, all of those are all layers that can add something to the story,

1928
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
where if there's a show that has great animation

1929
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
and somehow shitty character designs and backgrounds,

1930
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,000
then it doesn't resonate with you as much as a show that has all of those things good.

1931
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:06,000
So I think that it's a widely misunderstood phenomenon

1932
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
and so many reviews don't get it right,

1933
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
and I've yet to see a channel that I think is good at it,

1934
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
other than myself, at talking about all the different design elements

1935
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
and breaking it all down,

1936
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
which is part of what's been fun about this video that Davoo's editing for me right now,

1937
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
which is the Steins Gate, like, an analysis of the first episode of Steins Gate,

1938
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
where I really do talk about, like, every single element,

1939
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
even if it's only in brief, like, you know, for the character designs, I'm just like, they're gorgeous.

1940
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:42,000
But, you know, I talk about the way that shots are composed, the way the color design is done,

1941
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:48,000
the way that everything feels.

1942
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Actually, I talk more about the character designs than I just said,

1943
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:55,000
because I talk about how they look realistic and how that affects the tone of the series.

1944
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So, yeah, there's so many different little elements that can all contribute,

1945
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:05,000
and by way of Davoo having seen that video and, you know, editing the Steins Gate one,

1946
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:10,000
he now has the capability to talk about all of those same factors,

1947
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:17,000
and so I feel like, for me, I'm waiting for the day

1948
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:23,000
when Davoo watches a show and writes an analysis video

1949
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
that's, like, better than anyone else other than mine,

1950
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,000
because I think that he already has the tools, like, you know,

1951
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:35,000
he has an understanding of what anime can be

1952
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,000
and what makes a good show that is, you know, second only to mine,

1953
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:46,000
but then it's just a matter of having enough context to watch a 10 out of 10

1954
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,000
and know what the difference is because you've seen everything in between, you know.

1955
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Well, hey, you know, context. I watched Pany Pony Dash,

1956
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
and it makes a bunch of references to all sorts of things,

1957
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
including a lot of really obscure NES games,

1958
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,000
of which I recognized all of them because of NES Quest,

1959
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:13,000
and I was like, whoa, context, anomaly, paradox, whoa, it was so cool.

1960
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,000
All these really lame NES games, I only played for five minutes,

1961
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
or watched my brother play for five minutes,

1962
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:24,000
and I recognized all of them in the background of Pany Pony Dash.

1963
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I'm like, whoa, mindfuck.

1964
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Yeah, interesting. I probably didn't get most of those myself.

1965
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Yeah.

1966
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
And now I can give you an extra piece of context,

1967
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:42,000
which is that Pany Pony Dash was, like, co-directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and Shin Onuma,

1968
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,000
you know who both of those guys are from my videos.

1969
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
You do know who they both are, right?

1970
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Well, I know Shinbo. I can't remember which guy Shin Onuma is.

1971
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Which one?

1972
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
One of your best edited videos that you've done.

1973
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Just tell me. Just tell me. I can't remember the name connected with the thing.

1974
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Chivalry of a Filled Knight.

1975
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, cool.

1976
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
The guy who basically runs Silver Link Studio,

1977
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
but before he left to go form Silver Link, he was with Shaft,

1978
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
and he trained under Shinbo, and...

1979
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Yeah, I knew it was a Shinbo thing.

1980
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Yeah, and Pany Pony Dash was like the...

1981
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I think that was like the first show that he was like a full directorial position on with Shinbo.

1982
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
But according to the liner notes that came with the DVDs,

1983
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
all of the video game references are Shin Onuma's thing.

1984
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Like, he's...

1985
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Because Shinbo's old and probably doesn't know shit about video games,

1986
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
but Onuma's a gamer from back in the day.

1987
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I see, yeah, yeah.

1988
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:45,000
I was thinking, watching Hitamara Sketch and Zetsubo Sensei and Pany Pony Dash,

1989
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
all of those I've seen now, and I'm like,

1990
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:54,000
man, you know, this kind of style could totally be like a pop video game review series,

1991
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,000
this style of directing, where you could throw together stuff

1992
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,000
that just is all about having crazy backgrounds and a bunch of weird frames.

1993
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Kind of like a...

1994
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Shinbo-ify Zero Punctuation.

1995
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:11,000
That could be like a new format to talk about all the new big games that come out for five minutes

1996
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
in a memorable, funny way.

1997
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Because the thing about that style is that you can be profound only as much or as little as you need to be.

1998
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Whereas Zetsubo Sensei can sometimes make an interesting point and sometimes be total nonsense,

1999
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:31,000
and it works either way because of the way it's thrown together.

2000
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
That's something I thought was cool.

2001
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
So if I was doing video game videos, I was thinking like,

2002
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
oh man, maybe I should do that, but I'm not.

2003
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
That would be pretty interesting.

2004
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:46,000
And I was just thinking about, to give you context into how much context you have,

2005
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I'm thinking about how when I started anime blogging in 2007,

2006
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
it was at an era when I was starting to care about creators a lot,

2007
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,000
and Shinbo was the first director I became like a big fan of and knew his work.

2008
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:04,000
And I know it was that I had seen like a few episodes of The Soul Taker when I was younger.

2009
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,000
And then Hitamari Sketch, I was watching while it was airing,

2010
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
but I only saw like five or six episodes because it was taking a long time to get subbed.

2011
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Then Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei started and I saw like five episodes because it was taking a fucking year to get subbed.

2012
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And by then I was calling myself a big Akiyuki Shinbo fan and writing about him all the time.

2013
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
And then Pantypony Dash, I watched it not long after that.

2014
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:36,000
So you've already seen more Shinbo than I had seen at a time when I was talking about Shinbo at a level that no one else understood him.

2015
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Like no one knew who he was.

2016
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,000
And I was like a huge fan and I was like, oh Shinbo is like this, this is what his style is like.

2017
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
And you've already seen more of his work than I had at that time.

2018
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:55,000
So that's why I think, you know, it's like you have a funny perspective because you edit for me

2019
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:01,000
and most of your exposure to anime is from me and I know more than almost anybody, you know.

2020
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Like there's, I can count on two hands the number of people who I've heard of who know more than I do about anime, you know.

2021
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,000
And most of them aren't doing YouTube, none of them are doing YouTube.

2022
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Yeah, that was something that I definitely like recognized in you pretty early on.

2023
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Definitely when I listened to your old podcast where like you'd be talking about something unrelated to Brandon Tolentino

2024
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:29,000
and then all of a sudden you'd be talking about anime for 45 minutes non-stop with like perfect mental clarity.

2025
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
And I'm like, I think this guy like knows everything about anime.

2026
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:40,000
You know, like I definitely put a lot of, it seems like a lot, like some people don't necessarily put that much faith in your knowledge immediately

2027
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
or they don't care, but like I feel like I was pretty good at recognizing that immediately.

2028
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Yeah, like everyone like has like anime that they watched when they like, you know, on Adult Swimmer or on like Toonami.

2029
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I didn't, I wasn't watching any of those. Like I don't even have that like rudimentary experience.

2030
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I just watched like a couple of really random stuff before actually trying to watch anime.

2031
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I didn't watch any of the, you know, the Naruto stuff.

2032
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:13,000
But like most of those people who grew up on like, you know, a few Adult Swim shows that they really loved have no breadth of knowledge.

2033
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Like they know those shows and that's it.

2034
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:23,000
And there's a lot of people who, like if I took someone like, let's say the YouTuber Jacksblade, who is a fitness workout guy,

2035
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
who is a die-hard Dragon Ball Z fan, he knows everything you could possibly know about Dragon Ball Z.

2036
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:33,000
And there's probably like 10 shows that he's super into and has seen multiple times.

2037
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Like, you know, Yu-Yu Hakusho, he was big into Attack on Titan when that came out.

2038
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:41,000
He's probably seen all of One Piece, like he's seen all the basic stuff.

2039
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
That guy would definitely call himself a big anime fan.

2040
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
You know, he has a lot of collection, he dresses in the costumes.

2041
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:53,000
But I doubt highly that he's seen as many different shows as you have at this point.

2042
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Because you've watched like, what, 10 shows since this fucking month started?

2043
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And that's more than most people watch in a year or two, like most casual anime fans.

2044
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,000
So I think that you've probably seen more than most of my audience at this point.

2045
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
With the exception of the ones who are the big fans who've probably fucking seen everything, you know.

2046
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,000
And there's really like, there's only so many.

2047
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Like, you've been watching a lot of obscure stuff because I like it.

2048
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
And that, like stuff that I want to eventually talk about.

2049
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Like, Pantypony Dash will never come up in conversation unless I bring it up in conversation, you know.

2050
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
But like, as soon as you watch-

2051
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I brought it up in conversation on NesQuest to talk about how NesQuest allowed me to know all the games on Pantypony Dash.

2052
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I mean, in like a-

2053
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Yeah, actual conversation.

2054
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
In the YouTube sphere, you know.

2055
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:54,000
You're not going to see another YouTuber make a video about it unless it's someone talking about how they found this weird obscure hidden gem that no one talks about, you know.

2056
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Yeah, you definitely talk about anime as though it's like all part of the same narrative.

2057
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Yeah.

2058
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
It's all there.

2059
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
It's all on the same level of existence.

2060
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Oh, you just- thank you.

2061
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
That's the perfect way to put it.

2062
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,000
There's not like this other weird thing that's like different from the rest of the flock.

2063
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,000
It's just like some things that no one's heard of but you and things that people-

2064
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
You know, there's only one video on your channel where you're like,

2065
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Hey guys, I went to FYE and found something I'd never heard of before.

2066
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
But then by the end you're like, oh, so that's show.

2067
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Yeah, okay.

2068
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I guess it's like differences in scale versus differences in kind kind of thing.

2069
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Like where most anime fans, I think they have this perspective of like,

2070
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I think most people don't realize that there's thousands of anime.

2071
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I think that's the first thing that most people don't get is that there are thousands of anime in existence.

2072
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,000
And that's what makes it exciting to watch, to know that there's so many to watch.

2073
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Actually, it's like the daringness of the challenge of watching all the anime is part of what makes me want to do.

2074
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
If there were way fewer anime, I would not have nearly as much inspiration.

2075
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,000
It's the same thing with NesQuest actually, because after we'd played like a couple hundred games,

2076
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,000
my brother was like, so I guess I don't know if I want to finish this project.

2077
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
There's probably only like 50 games left, right?

2078
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I'm like, no, we've gotten about 10% done.

2079
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
He's like, oh dude, we gotta finish this.

2080
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
There's like a thousand NES games to play.

2081
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Exactly.

2082
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Knowing that the challenge is we do things not because they're easy, but because they are hard.

2083
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Yeah.

2084
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Plus it makes it exciting.

2085
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Yeah.

2086
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:31,000
And with anime, it's like, you have to first realize, like let's say, let's just spitball here.

2087
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Let's say that there's 4,000 anime that have ever been subtitled.

2088
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Let's try that as a random number.

2089
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And then let's say that 2,000 of those are definitely worth a look.

2090
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
And that 1,000 of those are definitely worth finishing.

2091
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Then most people's perspective of anime is the ones they've heard of are the ones that exist.

2092
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I don't think most people look at anime and think, oh, well, there's definitely thousands more where that came from.

2093
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
They watch all the shows that are on TUNAMI.

2094
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:06,000
And then when they find out about another show that they hadn't heard talked about, they're like, what is this?

2095
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
What's this treasure?

2096
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I'm just now realizing that I've actually, for a long time, had the perspective that there were 1,000 anime because of one specific event.

2097
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Because whenever I wanted to listen to video game soundtracks, at the time, the best resource was KHInsiderDownloads, right?

2098
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Because it has this pretty, I think even today, the closest to complete list of all video game soundtracks.

2099
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,000
And then at one point, they opened up an anime section like Download Anime.

2100
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
It wasn't even like Torrance.

2101
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
It was just download them from the website.

2102
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
I didn't know how to Torrance.

2103
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
If I had known how to Torrance, I probably would have watched some anime.

2104
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:46,000
If I had had anyone give me anime recommendations that were like, because I wanted to get into anime.

2105
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:51,000
It's just that all the people who watched anime weren't hardcore into it who were going to force it on me.

2106
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
So I just didn't get into it that much.

2107
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Didn't have anyone recommending me stuff in a way that resonated with me.

2108
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:03,000
And of course, most of all, I didn't buy into illegalizing things until a couple of years ago.

2109
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
You always use that word.

2110
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Yeah.

2111
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:15,000
And my dad is like, are you sure you want to get your Adobe products wrong through pirating?

2112
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Don't even want God's blessing on your work.

2113
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
And I'm like, I was like that for up until a couple of years ago and I completely regret it.

2114
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Everyone says you get talent from the devil, not from God.

2115
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:32,000
So yeah, they opened up an anime section.

2116
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
And so I looked at the list.

2117
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
You can just look at all the ones that are on the list.

2118
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:42,000
And I noticed how many flicks of my index finger on the wheel scroller took to get to the bottom of that.

2119
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
I just like, whoa.

2120
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,000
And so I guess I've just always had this idea that there is a million shows.

2121
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
So I guess that was something that I've just always known.

2122
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I didn't know which one to click on.

2123
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I just clicked on, what's this?

2124
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Twinlove.

2125
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I'll click on that.

2126
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Watched four episodes of that and wasn't that interested.

2127
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Yeah, so that's how I've watched four episodes of Food to Koi randomly five years ago.

2128
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
But not Food to Koi alternative.

2129
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Not even the alternative version.

2130
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:17,000
So that's like, I'd say that if there's two things, no.

2131
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Here's the holy trinity of anime knowledge that if everyone had it, they would all see anime the way that me and you now do.

2132
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I've just come up with this.

2133
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
The first one is like I was saying earlier, understanding all the different components of it.

2134
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Because I think so many people, you know, think of it in terms of just like five things, story, animation, whatever.

2135
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Knowing all the components of it, knowing how much of it there is and the fact that it's this big, deep, you know, rabbit hole of media.

2136
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:51,000
And the third one is knowing how incestuous it is and knowing that it's the same fucking people making all of it.

2137
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Because when you have that weird, like because you were saying that I see it all as like kind of equal and like it's all on the same plane.

2138
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
And the reason I see it that way is that the same people are making it.

2139
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Where from my perspective, the reason I've heard of Pantypony Dash or Hitamari Sketch or Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei is because I've heard of Akiyuki Shinbo.

2140
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
And I was a fan of him, so I sought out all his work.

2141
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Now, at some point in 2009 to 2011, this crazy thing happened where he directed a show called Bakemonogatari and then a show called Madoka Magica.

2142
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:30,000
And those became the two highest selling anime of all time when they came out.

2143
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
And everyone's heard of them and everyone knows about them.

2144
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
But none of those people know who Akiyuki Shinbo is.

2145
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:45,000
So none of them went back and watched his previous work and found out about all this other shit that he'd done.

2146
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:51,000
So like from their perspective, like Madoka's this show that everyone knows.

2147
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Yeah, it's Madoka. Everybody knows Madoka.

2148
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,000
And then Pantypony Dash is what's this weird thing I found?

2149
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,000
And it's like it's the same guy. It's just like five years later.

2150
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:05,000
It's like a drop in the bucket of a lifelong career, you know, that he did these two shows.

2151
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
So yeah, I think that's why I see them all as equal.

2152
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
And at this point, this has become a conversation and not an interview, but...

2153
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Yeah, whatever, you know.

2154
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I've just been like looking at Sakugoboro while talking.

2155
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000
You know, I got the, I just hit random.

2156
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I got the building explosion from Zankiyono Terror.

2157
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I don't know why I pronounce all these shows so weirdly.

2158
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
That's how you pronounce it.

2159
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
And I found out that...

2160
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Okay, then I found out there's a tag on Sakugoboro called Seven Years Hand Drawn.

2161
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
And it's just like...

2162
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Is it just Red Line? Like, is that...

2163
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:43,000
It's just Red Line and I think like the Tale of Princess Kaguya and Third Aerial Girls Squad.

2164
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Okay, interesting.

2165
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I love that that's a tag.

2166
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
That's gotta be a meme tag or something.

2167
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
That's fucking hilarious.

2168
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:00,000
So yeah, you've got, you love you some Sakugoboro, yeah?

2169
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Yeah, I've looked at it quite a bit, you know, I need to...

2170
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I don't know, it's just I want to be able to like do...

2171
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
When you need to compulsively click on an internet website,

2172
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:13,000
but you don't want it to be a social media which feels unfulfilling most of the time.

2173
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
You know, you can click on that and get cool animation.

2174
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:24,000
So I made it to where the random page is the page like that I got on my bookmarks.

2175
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
So I clicked on that.

2176
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
That's how I got a much better understanding of what is a good animation.

2177
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Yeah.

2178
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
That was something I did not have a grasp on until recently.

2179
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Yeah, that was one of the harder things in the early editing was I would say something like,

2180
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:44,000
you know, a lot of this episode looks like shit and then you would pick a moment that didn't look that shitty to me or like...

2181
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Yeah.

2182
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
And I'm like, oh no, you gotta like re...

2183
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:52,000
You'll know it, you'll learn one day what shit, like when you've seen enough good,

2184
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:55,000
then the shit starts to really become apparent, you know?

2185
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Yeah.

2186
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Yeah.

2187
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Or the big one was in Astroscore part one when I...

2188
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Yeah, I didn't show it.

2189
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,000
We said like, oh, there's some great stuff from the OVA of Black Rock Shooter.

2190
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:12,000
There's some clip cuts that are really stellar and I just put one in that wasn't stellar.

2191
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
So you're like, here, here's the stellar one.

2192
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Well, just then it happened that part of it was done by my favorite animator, Utaka Nakamura.

2193
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
And I was like, that's the clip I wanted you to show.

2194
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:27,000
And I guess I just thought it would be obvious, but I should have fucking said something.

2195
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,000
But I think I can do it now.

2196
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I think I know what is a good, because I go on looking at the seven years hand drawn tab.

2197
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I wanted to say you seem to be someone who even more so than myself, I think, correct me if I'm wrong,

2198
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:53,000
seems to care a lot about aesthetics or have a deeper appreciation for it than most people.

2199
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Yeah.

2200
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Yeah, most people I'd say.

2201
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
I'm not sure about you.

2202
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Well, because you have this...

2203
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Your favorite anime is Kill Law Kill.

2204
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
And you've watched almost everything else.

2205
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:09,000
I've given a 10 out of 10 and nothing has touched Kill Law Kill

2206
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
because it has this raw aesthetic resonance with you in a way.

2207
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
How are we?

2208
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I stopped caring about the story a while ago or the characters.

2209
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
And then sometimes I'm like, is this my favorite anime?

2210
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I don't know.

2211
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,000
And so I watched part of it and I was like, yes.

2212
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Because there's this one Kill Law Kill video that you wrote and you might make someday

2213
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:42,000
and it's about one particular moment from the show, the part where the ditzy girl shows up with the other half of the scissor blade.

2214
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
How are we new?

2215
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,000
And it's just like, I watched that part of the show and I'm like, oh my god.

2216
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:58,000
The moment when Ryuko witnesses the other half of the scissor blade, the shot that they use is this really weird angle of her

2217
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:04,000
covering up the bottom right corner of the screen and her face is really blown out of proportion.

2218
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:09,000
And you only see her eyes and there's a whole lot of detail on her skin.

2219
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:13,000
And when I was looking at that, I was like, this looks like one of those meme faces.

2220
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:17,000
It's like from 4chan where they put away heavy amount of detail on the face skin.

2221
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
It's like one of those things and it just happens for like half a second.

2222
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:26,000
And every moment in the show has a different thing that adds so much impact.

2223
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I would say I do care a lot about aesthetics.

2224
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:38,000
It's just that what aesthetics I've been focusing on has changed recently because for a while I was really into prettiness.

2225
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
What's a good color palette?

2226
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I spent so much time making color palettes because I made a video game once and I had a lot of color palettes.

2227
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:51,000
So I spent so much time picking colors for things.

2228
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I think I just get colors now.

2229
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,000
There's not a whole lot more to get in my haughty opinion.

2230
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:02,000
If you read Cucumber Quest, that comic has every color palette ever and done really well.

2231
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:09,000
So I got tired of colors and a lot of this is reflected in my editing of your videos.

2232
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
The early stuff was I was trying to make sure that things were always pretty at all times,

2233
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
which is why I sometimes fail at showing shitty scenes.

2234
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Because I just wanted everything to look nice and feel crisp.

2235
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:27,000
But then there was at some point, I think I was definitely influenced a lot by Jesse,

2236
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:33,000
whose editing is never pretty, but a lot of times has a whole lot of impact.

2237
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And that's really the word I've been going for lately is impact.

2238
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:42,000
How can you have something that you can feel with just the right amount of visual information,

2239
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
which is actual directing.

2240
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Once you understand that, you're getting into...

2241
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Wait, hold on. Did you listen to Jesse's interview with me?

2242
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,000
No.

2243
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,000
He describes exactly what you're saying in the same terms.

2244
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I am a Jesse knowledge person.

2245
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Because he was saying how his favorite aspect of doing videos is the directing aspect,

2246
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:09,000
and that his favorite thing is to make a shot that perfectly encompasses the entire idea of the video in one shot.

2247
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Oh yeah, and also every frame, a painting was also really influential.

2248
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:19,000
To everyone, obviously, he's changed the world of people who aren't educated.

2249
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:25,000
And I think the part when he talks about Satoshi Kone,

2250
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:29,000
and how Satoshi Kone will remove visual information, that's why he liked animation,

2251
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:32,000
because you could have a purse hit someone's face in two frames,

2252
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
and you can tell it's a purse because it's drawn.

2253
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
But if it were live action purse, you wouldn't be able to identify it as a purse.

2254
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Oh yeah, and you were talking about this with Ben in his interview,

2255
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
about having less information, creates more impact.

2256
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Obviously, all those old shaft shows I was watching has that,

2257
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:55,000
where it's like, my favorite is in Hitamari's sketch, how they go up and down steps,

2258
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
and the steps are just squares, just rectangles.

2259
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
That's so cool.

2260
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,000
And I'm like, man, if I make a video game, and you go up ladders,

2261
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I'm just going to do that because everyone hates going up ladders, it's so boring.

2262
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,000
So you just click on it, have some rectangles, and then that's it.

2263
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
We don't have a lot of money to animate things,

2264
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:22,000
so how do we communicate everything without needing animation,

2265
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
and they come up with all these really creative solutions?

2266
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
It's genius.

2267
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
It's great.

2268
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Yeah.

2269
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,000
It's funny though, because Pantypony Dash has way more stuff going on than Hitamari's sketch does.

2270
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Hitamari is really minimalist.

2271
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Hitamari takes up in its later seasons.

2272
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I think it was really like, the first season was really like,

2273
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:44,000
this is a show we don't expect anyone to watch, so it's very minimal.

2274
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:48,000
If you watch the show they did before Pantypony Dash, which was Tsukuyomi Moon Phase,

2275
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:53,000
that one is like, there was famously, I think it was episode 16 or something,

2276
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,000
an episode that has literally zero animation in it.

2277
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:04,000
It was so, they boiled it down so much, because they just had so little money and people to go on.

2278
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I've never known, people have always said budget, and of course,

2279
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:13,000
that's the phrase that everyone throws around, and people always say that they quote unquote

2280
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:18,000
blow all their money on the first episode, because usually the first episode of a shaft show will have,

2281
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
especially if it's like a second season, will have way more animation,

2282
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:26,000
and then the rest of it will be way more basic.

2283
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
So what the heck do they do?

2284
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:31,000
They blow their budget by hiring more people for the first episode,

2285
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
or they just put way more of their time on the first episode?

2286
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense, and so I think what it is, because I've heard before...

2287
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Digi, did we blow most of the Astroscore sucks budget on part nine, which was the best part?

2288
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Yeah, we definitely spent more on, well I guess I did, because I bought McDonald's,

2289
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
so I spent the most money on that part.

2290
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Yeah, that is true, oh my gosh, never mind.

2291
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,000
That's fucking great.

2292
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
But yeah, the thing is they're also understaffed.

2293
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:07,000
They've always been criminally understaffed, and I think it's...

2294
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Or maybe they're just lazy.

2295
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Yeah, I think it's just a matter of them not having enough people to get shit done on time,

2296
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,000
and being terrible at scheduling, because with the Monogatari series,

2297
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:21,000
there's two episodes that very infamously were completely unfinished when the show came out.

2298
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:25,000
There's long sections where there's just nothing on screen.

2299
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:30,000
They put up a frame that says missing frame, because they didn't have the frames animated.

2300
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
But then when the Blu-rays came out, it's all there.

2301
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,000
So the way I see it, and all those scenes are animated by the same guy.

2302
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:43,000
So I think that guy just didn't have time to finish those scenes before the show went to air,

2303
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:47,000
and they had no choice but to broadcast an unfinished product.

2304
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:51,000
And then when the DVDs came out, then all this shit was there.

2305
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:55,000
They don't have enough people. They're spreading their few animators thin.

2306
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:59,000
And sure, it could be a budgetary problem that, like, why can't they hire more animators?

2307
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:03,000
But it could also just be that they can't find people.

2308
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Maybe there's studios in a weird location, I don't know.

2309
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Kyoto Animation is like no one who works there works for anything else,

2310
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,000
because they're in fucking Kyoto, and they hire local.

2311
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Yeah, you were saying before how anime is very incestuous.

2312
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
And it's like, that's so cool.

2313
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:27,000
In all of your videos, you'll be like, oh, by the way, this guy worked on that other thing.

2314
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:30,000
And whenever you talk about the history of something or where it came from,

2315
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,000
it's always this really cool revelation that really enhances a video.

2316
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
So I was trying to do that with video games.

2317
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I found out how not true that is with video games.

2318
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:43,000
At least back in the day, the majority of video game careers was a guy who needed a job.

2319
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
And then he made like four games.

2320
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
That's like the majority of people who've worked on video games,

2321
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,000
at least up until the triple A proliferation.

2322
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Video game development cycles are way longer, too.

2323
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:01,000
And they're huge. Yeah, they take the average video game cycle is 50 years.

2324
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:04,000
It's just like, yeah.

2325
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:10,000
It's funny, but yeah, I think, for me, it's always a revelation.

2326
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
And I'm glad you enjoy those elements of the videos.

2327
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
I feel like every time I talk about something like that,

2328
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:22,000
I get the impression that most of the audience doesn't get why it's relevant or care, you know?

2329
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Because again, most people don't have the perspective that all of anime is connected and all that shit.

2330
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:32,000
And that's why, because if it was, if I was watching a channel that's like my channel,

2331
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,000
I would watch every video on that channel.

2332
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
You watch every video on my channel.

2333
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
You don't know what half the fucking shows are.

2334
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:45,000
But there's a reason that some of my videos have 500,000 views and some of them have 5,000 views.

2335
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,000
And it's because people don't care about every anime.

2336
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:57,000
But to me, it enhances your understanding of the one to have seen the other.

2337
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:02,000
The first Sakura compilation you did, which one was the first one?

2338
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
It was the directors who had been animators before.

2339
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Oh yeah. And man, every single one of those, like pretty much, there were things that were similar about them.

2340
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Like one of the directors had a lot of lateral movements.

2341
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Like a character is flying at 50 miles an hour left or right.

2342
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,000
And then like all of like Hiroyuki Imaishi's ones that you showed were like very prominently,

2343
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:29,000
a character in the middle of the frame doing something that dominates all of the attention onto themselves.

2344
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:37,000
And then like Hideyaki Yano overwhelmingly is a big wide-angle shot with like a bunch of stuff in the background,

2345
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:40,000
mostly just background, getting destroyed in some way.

2346
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Either melting or blowing up or freezing over.

2347
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Just like a big background that happens.

2348
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
A lot of animators have specialties, you know?

2349
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Yeah, all these directors have specialties.

2350
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:56,000
And it's just like, every once in a while I'm reminded of the fact that I think animators are the best artists in terms of people.

2351
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Like if you think about like the percentage of artists who are dickholes, I think animators have the best track record.

2352
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Probably because they have no time to have a personality.

2353
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,000
But like think about it, like who are like the asshole animators?

2354
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Hot diggity demon, Ralph Bakshi, but those are like lovable scumbags, right?

2355
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Yeah, I wouldn't say hot diggity demons.

2356
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I wouldn't say he's an asshole, he's just a weirdo, you know?

2357
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Yeah, okay, but like Ralph Bakshi is like this anti-hero guy, right?

2358
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
But like he's also likable.

2359
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:28,000
And it's like there's no one, there's no animators who are like Chris Brown.

2360
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Who are like, you know, even if you like the music, which no one does, like no one likes them as a person.

2361
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Every animator is like a decent person.

2362
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I feel like even like artists who like just draw pictures can sometimes be total dick.

2363
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
What about Animated James? Didn't everybody hate on him for some reason?

2364
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I don't know, I'm not familiar with Animated James.

2365
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,000
But like certainly good, oh yeah, but certainly like good animators.

2366
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I just think, I have a theory that to be able to animate, you have to have an empathy with the world.

2367
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:01,000
And a level of empathy that makes it impossible to also be a bad person.

2368
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
That's my theory, because I just think animators are the best people.

2369
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Interesting you say that, because that's kind of a Miyazaki's whole criticism of the anime industry is that they don't look at the world enough.

2370
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Yeah, they just look at other anime, but like I don't know, they still have to like look at something, you know?

2371
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I don't know, I feel like there's still an amount of understanding how the world is, how it moves.

2372
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:29,000
If you want to be able to draw good, you want to be able to animate good.

2373
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:39,000
I think it's more that the amount of time it takes to become a good animator and to do that job and make no money leaves you no time to do anything else other than animate.

2374
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Yeah, like the amount of dedication that the anime people have, like especially in Japan, where they just tirelessly animate for such low wages.

2375
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,000
And it's like, man, these people just love what they're doing.

2376
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,000
That's the scene in Shirobako episode like 24 when she's asking everybody why they're doing anime.

2377
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:03,000
And they're like, I just kind of started and I like it, so here I am.

2378
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:06,000
That's like almost everyone's answer to why anime.

2379
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:17,000
And it's weird because like I've never heard of, I mean, I wouldn't know I don't look into this stuff myself, but I've never heard you talk about like really vicious, hateful feuds within the anime community.

2380
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Like, oh man, this guy hates that guy because he did the such and such.

2381
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Well, it's hard because there's not a lot of information and it's like I'm sure some of that exists, but also Japanese culture is to not be that way, you know?

2382
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Like probably the guy who's probably the most vicious person in all of anime is fucking Miyazaki, who supposedly like hated Tezuka, the fucking father of anime because of how he ruined animation by making it cheap and easy.

2383
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:59,000
I don't remember where I heard this rumor and I haven't corroborated it with any information I've read elsewhere, but I heard supposedly that he got up at the funeral or the wake of Tezuka.

2384
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:04,000
And like, the game of speech insulting him at his fucking funeral.

2385
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
About ruining anime.

2386
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,000
I don't know if that's true though, but like, yeah, that guy is-

2387
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:15,000
The fact that you aren't sure it's true says a lot about Miyazaki.

2388
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Well, because he's also a man who mailed a samurai sword to fucking Disney that said no cuts on it.

2389
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,000
And you know, constantly rails against it.

2390
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:29,000
And like, is known for the fact that he's like a tyrannical leader of his own studio.

2391
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I know Miyazaki's full name by the way, I just slipped over the tongue because I was thinking about that cool video of him with Hideo Kiyono, like on a bench or in the desert.

2392
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Like, is that what anime directors do? They just go to the desert and just like stand there?

2393
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I've gotten the impression and I did not think this before I started making videos about directors all the time.

2394
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:53,000
But I've come to this realization that anime directors seem to think that they are the fucking coolest people.

2395
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Because-

2396
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Because they're like, well, yeah, like they try to like stand in random directions.

2397
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Did you not notice they all wear sunglasses?

2398
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Every fucking anime director wears sunglasses.

2399
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
And it was when we were putting together-

2400
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Because that's why, you know, in the Cowboy Bebop video, that thumbnail where it was the three faces, it was just like what the video gave us.

2401
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:22,000
But it was the director and then Shoji Kawamori, who was the director of Macross.

2402
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,000
And then Yoko Kano, the music producer, all of them wearing sunglasses.

2403
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
It's a Victor like photoshopped them into like this three-headed monster.

2404
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:36,000
And then like, we were editing that video and every fucking person we would find, the only picture would be them in sunglasses.

2405
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,000
And I'm like, because at first I would find one or two and I'm like, I was like, oh yeah, I'm gonna pick the sunglasses.

2406
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:46,000
When I want to make this guy look cool, then I realize they're all doing it, you know.

2407
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
So I thought it was fucking hilarious.

2408
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
And it's like just the directors, no one else.

2409
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
They all have to wear sunglasses.

2410
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:55,000
They all have to look like badasses, you know.

2411
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:00,000
So I definitely think there's like a huge cult of personality element to it.

2412
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Yeah, they got a direct cool character doing cool things.

2413
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
They got to be in that mindset, you know.

2414
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I remember how like in the days of Atari, the 2600,

2415
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:13,000
a guy who had to make the Indiana Jones game or whatever, or something.

2416
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
And he's like, so he had to become Indiana Jones.

2417
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,000
And so he grabbed a whip and he just started whipping everyone.

2418
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:21,000
He tried to like, he'd like pretend that the hallways were trapped.

2419
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:26,000
So he'd like, like walk along the walls of the hallways without touching the floor, you know.

2420
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Yeah, yeah man.

2421
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
So like, yeah, that's what you got to do to be an artist.

2422
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
You got to like, get in the mindset of like what character you're gonna be, you know.

2423
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:38,000
And like, I remember you saying that like they're, you know, anime is so incestuous.

2424
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:41,000
That's why all the protagonists want to fuck their sisters.

2425
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Yeah.

2426
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I like, I love that logic.

2427
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:49,000
I want to believe that's true.

2428
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Well, we've gotten onto a long tangent about how cool anime is,

2429
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:57,000
but I feel like I've failed at interviewing you properly.

2430
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:01,000
We got like two hours of like interview and then 40 minutes of we've been talking about it.

2431
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,000
I don't know, I feel like, I think that's kind of in my failure too.

2432
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,000
I've kind of not been like leading into talking like,

2433
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I haven't been like leading into talking about myself more.

2434
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Don't mistake me for not being as egotistical as Digi is or more.

2435
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I don't know, like it's debatable.

2436
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Well, I don't want to like, because the thing is with Jesse and Ben,

2437
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
I got into a lot of details of their work.

2438
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:29,000
And aside from your videos that you are deliberately distancing yourself from

2439
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:33,000
and calling your old work, you've mostly been working on my videos.

2440
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:38,000
And we talk about my videos in our long ass fucking commentaries, so...

2441
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Yeah, I guess that's what it is.

2442
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I don't want to start asking you about like the creative decisions you make

2443
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:46,000
in the Astroscore videos or something when we've got a whole...

2444
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Oh yeah, we got a, we got a artificial scarcity of commentary.

2445
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,000
We got to make people pay for that.

2446
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I guess it would be pointless to ask what's your favorite video of mine

2447
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:00,000
because it's probably the Astroscore series.

2448
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
My favorite video that I worked on too.

2449
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:06,000
You cut out in the sentence there for me, so I didn't hear all the questions.

2450
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Yeah, I just said what's your favorite video of mine overall,

2451
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
but it's probably the Astroscore.

2452
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Yeah, I'm going to say so.

2453
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I've completely lost ability to like evaluate it.

2454
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Like I don't like spend time just like rewatching all the stuff

2455
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
and like marathoning it, and I don't spend a whole lot of time watching

2456
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
anyone outside of the TPC anymore.

2457
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
It just takes me forever to watch anyone.

2458
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,000
So I've just, I've really been losing perspective of like how to...

2459
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Yeah, that's been really interesting for me because like, because you don't...

2460
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:42,000
It's, it's, I'd say the biggest discrepancy between me and you at this point

2461
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:48,000
is that I watch tons of YouTube and you seem to watch very little of it these days.

2462
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Yeah.

2463
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Which is interesting.

2464
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
It's been that way.

2465
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Honestly, I've never like been watching a ton of people

2466
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
because there's never been a ton of people that I like, although now there is,

2467
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,000
but now I don't have the time for it, so, you know.

2468
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Well, it's just funny because it'll be like I'll get all inspired by some channel I've been watching

2469
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,000
and then like...

2470
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:06,000
And then you'll watch all of it.

2471
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Yeah, and then I feel like, like you don't even realize

2472
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:14,000
and then I won't really realize like after a while

2473
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
because I fucking forget why I wrote things away.

2474
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Well, I think it first really sank in when I found out about Noah Caldwell-Gervais.

2475
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Yeah.

2476
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
And then I told you about him and I was like,

2477
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:27,000
yeah, you know, I don't know, like I don't really recommend him that much

2478
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
because he's like, he's not that good.

2479
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
His videos are very long.

2480
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I haven't even watched any of his videos that much.

2481
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,000
I've tried to listen to him at work.

2482
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I can't even finish listening to him.

2483
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:40,000
As I described them, but Tosus dwarfingly long.

2484
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,000
And so I told you about him and then like three days later,

2485
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
you were like, so now that I've watched all of his videos,

2486
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I could definitely say it.

2487
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I'm like, well, hold on, what?

2488
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
You know, I was like...

2489
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
In his case, I didn't even really like them.

2490
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
You just watched them.

2491
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:57,000
He's never made one that I would like recommend to other people really.

2492
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
And you just, you just watched all of them.

2493
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
And I'm like, well, although I don't pay any fucking attention now

2494
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
because he stopped being interesting.

2495
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Yeah.

2496
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,000
So I'm just not that interested in watching all the YouTube.

2497
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
You know, like I watch enough to where I know what's going on.

2498
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Like I watch enough nerd writer to know what I need to imitate.

2499
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Obviously, you know, fucking terrible.

2500
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
I bet.

2501
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Um, it was like the kind of, it was bad in a way that made me mad.

2502
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Where I was like, I feel like a, you know, let me, let me just rant.

2503
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Let me just vent about nerd writer for one second.

2504
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Every nerd writer video ends with him saying, uh,

2505
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I had a lot of fun making this video.

2506
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
It was a real blast to edit.

2507
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I got to do all these new techniques and thank you guys

2508
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
for letting me have the opportunity.

2509
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:50,000
And just once I want him to come out and be like,

2510
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
this video was hell to edit.

2511
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Cause like some of it must be, right?

2512
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Cause he puts out a video every week.

2513
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Every week.

2514
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:01,000
And obviously not all the scripts are of equal quality.

2515
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Not all the videos are of equal quality.

2516
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Some of them he has to like write something and realize it's not as good

2517
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:13,000
or edit it and realize that the techniques didn't work as well as he thought they would.

2518
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Like, right?

2519
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,000
There must be something.

2520
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
And so like this week.

2521
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Yeah.

2522
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,000
I've seen a lot of editing decisions in some of these videos that are like really awkward.

2523
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I'm like, huh.

2524
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
And this week things that I probably wouldn't have let.

2525
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,000
He did this video on a Bob Dylan song and it was like seven minutes long

2526
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,000
and didn't sell me on any of the points he was making.

2527
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,000
He was, he made all these grandiose points that, that, that he did.

2528
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Like I shouldn't say he made grandiose points.

2529
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:41,000
He like suggested all these big ideas.

2530
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Yeah.

2531
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:43,000
But.

2532
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Which is like the whole point of his channel is that everything he's saying is grandiose

2533
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:50,000
and whether or not it like is like the only time he has said anything that really blew

2534
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,000
me away with his Game of Thrones one where I was like, wow, that's really a good.

2535
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
That's an amazing point that I love.

2536
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
That's by far my favorite video of his.

2537
02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Yeah.

2538
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,000
That was a, that was a point that he sold me on like because he built it up so well.

2539
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:09,000
He explained the idea of where the story comes from and how historical stuff happened

2540
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
and why it's not happening in this story.

2541
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
That makes sense.

2542
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Okay.

2543
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Cool.

2544
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:15,000
It was about economics.

2545
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,000
I was like the coolest thing.

2546
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
I love that.

2547
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
The Bob Dylan one is more like this.

2548
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:23,000
He'll be like, this song, some people say that this song is an illusion to the Bible.

2549
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
There's a bunch of Bible quotes on the album.

2550
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
So it seems like it's probably true.

2551
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:32,000
And then I'm like, you in no way justified the idea that this is a Bible thing.

2552
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:36,000
And you see this is, that's why like when he first was coming out, he was first getting

2553
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
big and I was like really ripping on him.

2554
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Like you were saying how cool he was.

2555
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
And I was like, oh, this guy really pisses me off.

2556
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:46,000
And I think it was because he didn't have that filter that I was always crippling myself

2557
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
with where I was like, this isn't good enough.

2558
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
This isn't good enough.

2559
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
I've got to throw this out.

2560
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:55,000
You know, and I just got the sense that nerd writer will come up with an idea, right?

2561
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
And then make it like there's not that whole doubt period.

2562
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:01,000
And I know that you are, you've always been way better at not doubting yourself to some

2563
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
extent, but you have the doubt.

2564
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Okay.

2565
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2566
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:08,000
What I mean is you're better at working through the doubt sometimes.

2567
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Like you seem to be better at it.

2568
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Certainly better than me.

2569
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Maybe you're not great, but you're way better than me.

2570
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,000
And so I was really jealous, you know, in a way of nerd writer's ability to just make

2571
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
it anyway.

2572
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:20,000
I definitely throw away way more than fucking nerd writer does.

2573
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Like I throw away lots and lots and lots and lots of concepts.

2574
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Like it's pretty, it's pretty clear that like he writes immediately what he has as an idea

2575
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,000
and immediately starts working on it because how else could he have that kind of early

2576
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
schedule?

2577
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Right.

2578
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Um, so that, that pissed me off at the time, but now that I'm not making my own videos,

2579
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I don't have, I don't have to feel that jealousy.

2580
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Like I'm, I'm, my content is your content and you come out with great stuff.

2581
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
So I don't have to care anymore.

2582
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:48,000
There was something very gratifying I got to do though, because my friend Trevor is a

2583
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:54,000
very big Bob Dylan fan and him and Brandon Tolentino, who's also, you know, well versed

2584
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:58,000
in Dylan, because I don't fucking care about Bob Dylan, but I, I sat them both down and

2585
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I showed them the video and I was like, I don't think this video is any good.

2586
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
And they both ragged on it the whole time.

2587
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Like they were like seriously pissed off at like every point he was making, like refuting

2588
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
some of the things he said and shit like that.

2589
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Um, just making it, like it was funny because they're not people who've like deeply researched

2590
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Bob Dylan, but I'm sure they've, there's like a long ass documentary they've both watched

2591
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,000
on them.

2592
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:24,000
And like there's just stuff in nerd writers video where he just presents something as

2593
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
if it's fact when it's not really that much of a fact.

2594
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Like it's just kind of a suggestion, you know?

2595
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:35,000
So yeah, I wonder if he only has so many ideas before he's going to burn up.

2596
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Hey, maybe he seems like someone who would have the ambition to be like, Hey guys, I'm

2597
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
going to stop doing a video a week.

2598
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:44,000
I'm going to like really work on one each month since I have since I have infinite money

2599
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
right now.

2600
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:49,000
I can just take a year off or something, you know, like, yeah.

2601
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:53,000
And if this nerd writer discussion seems totally out of place in this interview, just know that

2602
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:02,000
like a lot, a lot of what the PCP chat is, is us talking about YouTubers is by far the

2603
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:05,000
biggest slice of the conversation pie.

2604
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Yeah.

2605
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Yeah.

2606
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Probably is the biggest.

2607
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,000
And again, I, yeah, like, you know, and not just the shit talk them, but it's kind of

2608
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:12,000
like talking shop.

2609
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:17,000
It's like, yeah, I mean, I've, I've often made it very clear that I'm like a fucking vulture

2610
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:22,000
when it comes to other people's ideas where I, I want anything I see that's good.

2611
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:26,000
I want to take it into myself and make it a part of my powers.

2612
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:32,000
And anything that's not good, I want to understand what I don't like about it so I can avoid

2613
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
ever being that, you know.

2614
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:39,000
So like nerd writer at his best, it's like, Oh, these editing techniques, like we have

2615
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:40,000
to rip these off.

2616
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Like that was as soon as nerd writer appeared, it was like, we all felt like, Oh, we got to

2617
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,000
step up.

2618
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:48,000
And you know, I think a lot of the stuff that he was doing was stuff I was already doing

2619
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:52,000
to some extent, but he definitely showed that it's a great way to do it.

2620
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:56,000
So I started doing some of those things more often, but, you know, like he definitely,

2621
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:01,000
he convinced me of that certain writing style being a way to go that you can take a detailed

2622
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
image and then zoom into it slowly.

2623
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:06,000
And that's good video for like 15 seconds.

2624
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Sometimes that he convinced me of that, you know.

2625
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Um, yeah.

2626
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,000
So I guess this is, uh, yes.

2627
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Being annoyed by nerd writer's voice was something that I also was at the time, you know, because

2628
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I was just like, I didn't like, I just didn't like his, you know, like everything is so

2629
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
serious.

2630
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:34,000
But the thing you have to remember is that while Bob Dylan was sort of an experimental artist,

2631
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:41,000
his vision pushed the way forward for all of music.

2632
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Hey guys, thanks for, uh, subscribing to my Patreon.

2633
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Oh, right.

2634
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,000
And I was so pissed off at it.

2635
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
I did actually do a parody of his style.

2636
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Oh, yeah.

2637
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Why we, uh, how weird Al is similar to Yoshi, which was.

2638
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Yeah, that was a different writer.

2639
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Yeah.

2640
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:06,000
It was a parody of nerd writer and PBS idea channel simultaneously simultaneously.

2641
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Right.

2642
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:17,000
So, uh, um, you know, uh, in regards to like not like getting mad at other channels, like

2643
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:20,000
a lot of it was because like you'd be like saying how great they were.

2644
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Like two years ago, you were all about PBS idea channel.

2645
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
I'm like, this guy's annoying and he, he sucks.

2646
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
And you were like, uh, no, he's awesome.

2647
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:31,000
And then like two years later, you're like, uh, made a lot of good videos, uh, back in

2648
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
the day.

2649
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I don't know.

2650
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
I mean, it may have just been, I wasn't prepared because his whole stylist at like say something

2651
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:39,000
totally different than, uh, the video title suggests.

2652
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
It wasn't always like that.

2653
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:45,000
There was a time when even in the old videos, even in the videos that I watched like two

2654
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:48,000
years ago, it was like this, this is, I don't know where this is going.

2655
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I don't understand.

2656
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Maybe I clicked all the wrong ones.

2657
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:51,000
I don't know.

2658
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Um, there was definitely a time where he had, he had videos that had a topic and stuck to

2659
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:03,000
the topic and, uh, and the topic wasn't just whatever is the current flavor of the week

2660
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
in the internet.

2661
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Um, yeah.

2662
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Yeah.

2663
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Okay.

2664
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:08,000
So here's the thing.

2665
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:12,000
I was, I was kind of hesitant to talking about this super bunny hop because at some point

2666
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:17,100
I realized that you, I found out that you considered super bunny hop to be like the best guy other

2667
02:49:17,100 --> 02:49:18,100
than you and Jesse.

2668
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:19,100
Right.

2669
02:49:19,100 --> 02:49:20,100
And I was like, really?

2670
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:21,100
Super bunny hop?

2671
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:24,400
Like, I was just like, like, that's like the guy who makes like the most amazing videos.

2672
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:28,000
Like, I know he makes the most good videos outside of you and Jesse, but I was like,

2673
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:29,000
his videos were amazing.

2674
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Like, I just, I just didn't think any of his videos were like, like mind blowing to me.

2675
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Over time it became very frustrating.

2676
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Like why I couldn't see what the heck you see.

2677
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:43,000
And I like, you even like ranked your favorite bunny hop videos, like the top 30.

2678
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:46,000
And number five was the fitness games video.

2679
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,000
And I'm like, what?

2680
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
I just remember thinking that was just like a video.

2681
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:50,000
I didn't think it was like a big deal.

2682
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:53,000
So I watched it again and I was just like, blink, blink.

2683
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I don't know, man.

2684
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:02,000
And something that like bothered me was like, after I had started working for you full time,

2685
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:07,000
I was like, yeah, you know, thanks to my two videos, tightness versus slipperiness and platformers

2686
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:12,000
and my Prince of Persia video, I've proven that if I were to do videos all the time,

2687
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I'd pretty much be the best guy doing video game analysis within half a year or so.

2688
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:21,000
And you said, uh, I don't know.

2689
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
I don't really see you topping bunny hop.

2690
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Do I sound like solid snake?

2691
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Oh, is that, is that a, is that a Digi Bro impression or is that a solid snake impression?

2692
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
I don't know.

2693
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,000
I just, I just wanted to say it very differently so that you, I don't know.

2694
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,000
So that people would know that that's what you said.

2695
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
And I was like, oh really?

2696
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:44,000
What just, what, what does super bunny hop do that I couldn't do?

2697
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Because I also get the same sense from bunny hop that like he'll write something that I would have felt insecure about.

2698
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Like this isn't good enough.

2699
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,000
This isn't right.

2700
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
But he like makes it anyway.

2701
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,000
And, you know, cause he's in the rhythm of making a video every week.

2702
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:58,000
He doesn't have to like constantly doubt himself like I was like, oh man.

2703
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
I just don't think he ever writes something fucking terrible.

2704
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
You know, like we're nerd writers.

2705
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Well, I mean his, his, uh, his, uh, Lisa Undertale and their earthbound connection video was pretty crappy.

2706
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:13,000
I'll say that's one of, that's definitely one of the worst videos he ever did.

2707
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:20,000
And I, I get, I think that video wouldn't have come off so badly if Undertale hadn't become a huge success.

2708
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Like if that had been Undertale's introduction to the world kind of thing, then it would have been like okay.

2709
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:30,000
But, uh, yeah, he said the least about that game.

2710
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
If anyone who talked about it, probably.

2711
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Yes.

2712
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:36,000
That like, but anyway, yeah, other than that, when all of his videos are all right.

2713
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:43,000
And I just, I just don't like his, I am the most picky person about voiceover in the world.

2714
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:46,000
I am the most annoyed by it.

2715
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:51,000
And like him being all monotone really gets to me and makes it hard for me to like keep track of anything he's saying.

2716
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:56,000
I just, it all just kind of, his, just all of his videos are just kind of white noise to me because of that.

2717
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Um, I, I, I mean, I, I have a problem with it sometimes because of the fact that sometimes he'll, he'll read a script about how good a game is in a tone that makes it sound like he wants to die.

2718
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:12,000
And that could bother me sometimes, but I love his voice in general.

2719
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:15,000
And I just, because his, there's like two voices.

2720
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Yeah.

2721
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Like all of my videos, all of my videos, especially old ones, by far, I can't deal with my own voice, like especially in my old videos, I didn't know how to carry my voice.

2722
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I hated it.

2723
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
And I hated it when I was doing it.

2724
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:37,000
It was torture, you know, um, and like a lot of Digi videos, like he has a lot of ones from like around 2015 where like you got really tired of voice acting or something.

2725
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
And like a lot of them came off really stiff.

2726
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:42,000
And I felt like really compromised the quality of a lot of your videos.

2727
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:49,000
And, and like, like, um, some videos, I'm just like, there's no way I could edit with this because you're just going to have to redo the voice, man.

2728
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Or else I'm going to die.

2729
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Yeah.

2730
02:52:51,000 --> 02:53:00,000
And your, uh, details versus flow in manga panels, the original voiceover for that was so awkward for me that I couldn't even get the inspiration to do a good video out of it.

2731
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:06,000
So like, I made this really boring version of the video that for me matched the audio and you were like, oh, this is boring.

2732
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,000
And I'm like, yep.

2733
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
So we redid that one.

2734
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Yeah.

2735
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:17,000
It's worth people who, who are $5 patrons and who read all the behind the scenes posts will know this.

2736
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:28,000
But, um, in the month, like at that video and then three of the ones we did in May were ones that I had written like six months prior.

2737
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And all of them we had, I had to redo the audio because I just did like a run of it and send it to DeVue.

2738
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:40,000
And he was like, eh, and then he would like send me like a demo version of the video.

2739
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
And I'm like, this is, this is fucking terrible.

2740
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,000
I'm going to redo it.

2741
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:53,000
You know, um, it was like details versus flow and the shima nets of video and the Ava 10, um, 10 directing tricks video.

2742
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Yeah.

2743
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:59,000
Well, that one had to be different because like originally we weren't planning on it having all these pauses in the middle.

2744
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:04,000
And, but it's like, if you want to have pauses, you have to read, you have to talk slower to begin with.

2745
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Um, yeah, it was after the details versus flow one where I, I realized I had to like say all of my criticisms of any post going into it.

2746
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Because before I didn't want to like bitch you out.

2747
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
It's like, why not just do the video?

2748
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Like don't complain.

2749
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:23,000
But because I didn't communicate my disc of my lack of enthusiasm, I ended up kind of wasting a bit of time making a boring version.

2750
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:30,000
So ever since then, I've been more open, although since then you've only been writing new posts that are all amazing.

2751
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:36,000
You know, like the, uh, you know, the, uh, the first, the whole Steins Gate video will probably be out by the time this is released.

2752
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Probably.

2753
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:41,000
You think this will be released in six days, seven days?

2754
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,000
I think I, I don't know, maybe I can get it done that time.

2755
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Who knows?

2756
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Let's hope so because then we can try to get two more out before the month is over and make some money.

2757
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Yeah.

2758
02:54:52,000 --> 02:55:01,000
But I was trying to write them already and, uh, instead of doing three hour interviews with, uh, you, um, yeah.

2759
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Yeah.

2760
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:06,000
The bunny hop thing was funny because we really did like, are you over that for days?

2761
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:18,000
And it's like, well, I eventually I was able to get you to say that like you, like if I were doing it full time on my own channel, I was after like a while, I'd probably like be around his level.

2762
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Or like at least make mostly as many interesting points as he does, but like with a slightly better, uh, delivery and presentation.

2763
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:35,000
What I value out of a channel is like an even mix of interesting and frequent.

2764
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Like, like my channel is to me is the ultimate channel.

2765
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Like I want every YouTube channel to be mine because I'm doing everything I want a channel to be.

2766
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Like that's, I don't necessarily work as fast as I'd like to because sometimes I get uninspired.

2767
02:55:54,000 --> 02:56:03,000
But I think I agree with you that it's better to take two weeks to get inspired than it is to put out something shitty at the end of the week.

2768
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:10,000
And in that regard, I am like, I don't think bunny hop releases anything that's outright garbage like what nerd writer just did with that fucking Bob Dylan video.

2769
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:19,000
But I do think that bunny hop has had a lot of like simple reviews that maybe didn't need to come out.

2770
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:22,000
And if he had spent that time working on something bigger, then I'd be happier.

2771
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:27,000
And there's, there's obviously a reason he hasn't made a critical close up in two years because he's been doing weekly video since.

2772
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:39,000
But he does get a lot of good, like he's done two, um, like videos on the Witcher DLC that are both, uh, like, I mean, I haven't played them in the like story discussions,

2773
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:47,000
but they're really well written. There's a lot of like legitimate analysis in there that, uh, you know, it's like, wow, you got this out in a week.

2774
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I'm like impressed.

2775
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:55,000
And as I, and as I said before, I did prove in that one window of time where I wasn't making any of your videos, I got out something every week and then some.

2776
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
So I'm like, yeah, I could have done it.

2777
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:04,000
But now I, once I got you to admit that I could be like, I don't care about like whether or not I'm the best guy.

2778
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:13,000
It's just a matter of at, I just can't be like worse than people who I think I'm better than, you know.

2779
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:19,000
So if I, once I was able to like convince you that I would be able to be at least on bunny hops level, then I'm like, okay, good.

2780
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I could now not do anything on my channel in peace except talk about trampolines and Dow Jones.

2781
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Part of the reason I say that is because you are a person who constantly improves.

2782
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:34,000
You've always made better videos than your previous videos.

2783
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:38,000
So there's no reason to believe that would stop being true.

2784
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:41,000
You know, you're editing for me always gets better.

2785
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:47,000
I'd say the 10, 10 best things happening in this decade was your best editing job to date.

2786
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:48,000
And I'm glad you agree.

2787
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
I didn't want to say that when I was making it.

2788
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
I didn't want to like jinx it.

2789
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:56,000
I'm very glad you felt that way because I did, I did think that like, yeah, I'm like, I've gotten good on the impact.

2790
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Cause what makes what I think, uh, it actually made me realize like just how much value there is in the right clip choice.

2791
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Like, you know, we think of, we tend to think of like, uh, cause historically when I give you a video and it's all just like finding a clip and putting it in place.

2792
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:17,000
You've always had the mentality of like, that's the easier stuff.

2793
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:22,000
It's the stuff when you have to like do the editing that it gets really hard, but there's so much value.

2794
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
It's pretty much the opposite now.

2795
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I'm so good at, it's pretty dang easy to just have images flying in the screen and I try to avoid that now.

2796
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:35,000
You know, if you can just do everything with a full screen clip as much as possible, that's usually better, you know.

2797
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:48,000
And I think it was, it was really the first like, the first like 15 seconds of the video where it's just showing a bunch of clips from new shows that, uh, that I told you to put in there.

2798
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:59,000
But you found like, you chose a clip from Space Dandy where it's like this stylish clip of him like putting his leg up on the dash and like it, it's like all dark and brooding looking and there's like flashing lights on it.

2799
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:02,000
And I was like, whoa, that's a beautiful image from Space Dandy.

2800
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,000
I don't even remember.

2801
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:04,000
I don't know where you got it from.

2802
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:05,000
I don't know what episode that was in.

2803
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:16,000
It looked awesome, you know, and like all the clips you chose for the very beginning where like each one was the most, like the most beauty that you could capture in three seconds for a clip to be on screen.

2804
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:20,000
And that was what impressed me so much about it, uh, like right off the bat.

2805
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:29,000
And I was, and yeah, also in regards to like impact and like trying to get the aesthetic down, I've definitely been putting a lot of focus into finding the exact right frame on which to cut.

2806
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:41,000
I had already been like kind of in that mentality for a while, but then every frame's new video about exactly that subject, like blew the lid open on that for me where I was like, oh my God, you're right.

2807
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Like the exact frame can make a huge world of difference.

2808
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Like, yeah.

2809
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:56,000
So like that I've really been putting a lot of focus into that lately on how to like, and that, and that was like most of the like effect in that cowboy bebop video.

2810
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:08,000
I think it's like cutting at the right moment in between sentences where like, like you cut in between words in between sentences at the beginning of a word, like in the, in the middle of a word, you know, that kind of stuff can really.

2811
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
The video had a lot of flows.

2812
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:19,000
And it was, it was interesting too, because so much of the bebop video was sentences that had no obvious clip to choose.

2813
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:27,000
So the fact that it felt good, even though it was like, what the hell do you show here, you know, but it would always felt right to me.

2814
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:31,000
I was, I never had a moment where I was like, all right, I don't care about the video aspect anymore.

2815
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,000
I'm going to tab over it.

2816
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:36,000
Like I always felt engrossed in it, you know.

2817
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:39,000
So yeah, you've been doing good work.

2818
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:52,000
And so that's why I say, like, you know, I don't necessarily think that if you made a million of the Prince of Persia video, like of that level, I don't think that would necessarily make it exceed bunny hop with him also.

2819
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Yeah, all of one type of video probably would not be as interesting overall.

2820
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
But I think it was all about game feel.

2821
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:05,000
I think you, if you were making videos consistently, they would always be getting better.

2822
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:09,000
And you'd continually find new things to talk about.

2823
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:15,000
And yeah, you could be one of the one of the best gaming YouTubers, but instead you're one of the best editors for an anime YouTuber.

2824
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:20,000
And I still think, like I said earlier, that the day is going to come when you're going to want to write an anime video.

2825
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,000
And I'm just going to put it on my fucking channel and fuck your channel.

2826
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
And I'll just put it on my Patreon.

2827
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:35,000
I know, like, don't care. My channel is just, like, whatever I put up on there, you know, like, debating with a commentary and stuff like that.

2828
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:38,000
Do you remember the time that I offered to host your videos on my channel?

2829
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Yes, I do remember that. Because back when my channel was not getting any attention whatsoever, you were like, hey, you know how the game theory has, like, the editors make some of their own videos sometimes?

2830
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
And yeah, that wouldn't have been a good idea.

2831
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:56,000
Well, I'd still be up for it if you started making stuff that was, like, I don't know.

2832
03:01:56,000 --> 03:02:09,000
I even offered that to Victor at one point, because when he was, like, desperately trying to, like, last month when he had no work and he was like, I might start getting into YouTube and I'm like, hey, man, I got an anime channel.

2833
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:13,000
Like, you make an anime video and I like it, I'll post it here.

2834
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:17,000
Yeah, we'll see how that goes, you know.

2835
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:23,000
So, yeah, but I no longer care about video games. I'm like, okay, no more video games, right?

2836
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Now I just play video games to, like, as a distraction for a bit or, like, to fill time or to, like, relax.

2837
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:29,000
Yeah.

2838
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:36,000
And now I'm just becoming a pure anime. Just pure anime in my face.

2839
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:37,000
Yeah.

2840
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:38,000
Alright.

2841
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:43,000
And then, like, I've just been getting so into that, just become my existence. It's great. I like it a lot.

2842
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Davoo, we're getting up to three hours. I really pushed myself to make it to three hours, so it's gonna be the same length as all the others, even though my eyes are in searing pain.

2843
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:58,000
And I actually, my nose is actually running now. My eyes hurt so much that it's making my nose run.

2844
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:04,000
I don't know how that works. I mean, I was pretty drunk at the start of this. I'm not anymore. I'm just tired and beaten down.

2845
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:12,000
But we made it to three hours, so do you have any closing comments or anything you want our audience to know about you?

2846
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Um...

2847
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:30,000
The Collective will absorb you all Sunday. Be warned.

2848
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:41,000
Alright. Well, that wraps up this interview with the Davoo. I don't know who the next one will be. Depends on who's awake when I decide I want to do it, which is how we decided it this time.

2849
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:47,000
Thanks for being on Davoo, and thanks for listening, everybody.
