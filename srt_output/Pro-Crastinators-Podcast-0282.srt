1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, I was drinking Alkma Hall. It was a Kazi's birthday yesterday.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Shame for having a birthday.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We all got fucked up. We all got twisted, if you know what I'm saying.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That wasn't very Jehovah's Witness of you, having a birthday.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's true. Having a birthday is the... yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I have a bunch of Jehovah's Witnesses in my family.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My mom's side is a bunch of fucking... a bunch of fucking kooks and weirdos and crystal healers and Jehovah's Witnesses and shit.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, God.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I know. I mean, famously, one of them, like a couple years ago at Christmas, I was drinking a diet soda and one of them came up to me and was like, you know that's rat poison, right?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was like, yes, thank you, yes.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It says it on the wall. That's my favorite.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You know it's rat poison, right? What are you talking about?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Fucking old kook. You old fucking bitch.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Leave me alone.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I bet she's not vaccinated. I bet she's dead.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, God, I know. It's probably true.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's probably true.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Almost definitely true. Almost definitely. Who knows what's in it?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, who knows?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Nobody knows.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My mom was on a bit of an anti-vax arc for a while, but I spoke to her yesterday and she was like giving a bunch of pro vaccine arguments.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And I was like, oh, good.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hmm. Okay. Yeah, that's good.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's growth. That's character growth.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Childhood is, I don't know, not getting vaccinated.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Adulthood is getting vaccinated.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know. I don't fucking know, whatever.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's correct.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I can't wait for a booster shot.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't wait for my booster shot.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't wait to get another microchip.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know. I already got the funny microchip once.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, it needs friends. It's lonely in there. It needs friends.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have a friend who's unironically into that.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He believes a microchip is from Satan himself.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you serious?

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, he found a video of a guy that kind of looks like Bill Gates giving a conference on, here's how we can chemically remove religion from the brain.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And, quote unquote, religion is just like fanaticism.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Apparently, they're running experiments that could reduce people's ability to blow themselves up.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Like suicide bomb.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I mean, that sounds kind of good, actually.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If we could actually do that with the microchip, I would kind of appreciate the microchip.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, actually, no, that's not true.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Terrorism is good, actually. I learned that from Final Fantasy VII.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, that is an important lesson.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then his other point of contention was there's a chemical in the vaccine Satan microchip called Luciferis.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Lucifer, oh no.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is that true? Is there a chemical called Luciferis?

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That is a chemical.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, that changes everything.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's called, it has Lucifer in the name because it emits light and Lucifer in Latin means like light or some shit.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What, no, hold on, what are you talking about? Words can only mean one thing.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, words can only mean Satan.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Every, all words.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All words mean, it's Satan or get out.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ugh.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Did they already complain how hungover I am while we were recording? Did I already do that?

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't remember if you did.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I feel so shitty. I feel like complete dog shit right now. Holy fuck, this is the worst. This is the absolute worst.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Man.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I had a back, I have a back problem right now. I've developed a back problem, a consistent back problem.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, God, hopefully not.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Since lifting, so they started lifting again. I developed a pain in my back and it got really bad the other day and I went to the doctor.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I went to fucking urgent care. I was like, because I didn't have a, well, I had to call my insurance and be like, hey, give me a doctor.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't have a doctor. Can I have one? And they were like, yes. Yes, you can have one. Here you go. Let's sign you up.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
They gave me a doctor and I was like, can I go see him? And they were like, you can see them in three weeks.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm in pain now though. And they were like, well, you can go to an urgent care and we'll probably cover that.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I went to one. I had to wait for two, not that urgent because I had to wait for two hours in the waiting room.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then they, and I was like, hey doc, my side hurts. I'm afraid it's my kidney and I'm afraid it's a kidney infection.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And they were like, well, pee in this cup and we'll tell you. And I did. And they were like, no, it's not a kidney thing.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And I was like, okay, well.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's just, the culprit is keto once again.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I think it's just, I pulled something or I strained something. Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday it felt great.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I couldn't even feel it. I was like, I'm recovered. It's over. It's gone.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Today, it sucks. I can't sit. I can't even sit comfortably. And I'm gonna cry.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I entered my back horrifically in like May.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Also, before I tell the story, is this staying in or we didn't even do an intro or are we waiting for people to come on?

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We didn't do an intro, but oh, yeah, we didn't do an intro. Hi everyone, patreon.com.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oblivionfall.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oblivionfall is our guest today.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, the guest is patreon.com slash oblivionfall. Hello.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
True, true.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm doing the thing now.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm just stolen it from you, Ben.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Every draw cast, I plug myself.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you actually?

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's so cringe. That's so cringe.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I know. It's so good.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, no intro.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No normal intro. Fuck it. Nobody else showed up. It's just me and you.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Epic. That's fucking funny.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, sure.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So I have a terrible back. It all started in 2013. Some of my animator friends, including the one who is telling me about the Lucifer chemical.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is before he went off the rails, which is sad because he is one of the people I've known the longest on the internet.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a bummer.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm actually going to move, so I'm going to lie down. I'm actually going to lie down on my...

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm going to move my mattress and lie down.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is this? The sleepy cast? What are you doing?

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
God, I wish. God, I fucking wish.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay. Let me know when you're laid down.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm getting laid down.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, jeez. I'm not. That's great.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you know what I'm saying.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Damn.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm having sexual intercourse if you know what I'm fucking saying.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, God.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So one day...

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've done this before. I remember I've done this before and people complained that my mattress was creaky.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So I hope that happens again and everyone hates it.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Everyone hates your creaky mattress during sexual intercourse.

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Right. All these hot bitches are like, I love your dick, but I hate how creaky your mattress is. I'm afraid it's over.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's over and I go, I don't care.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Go on. Get out of here. Go home and be with your own kind.

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The row rocks at them and they go, ah, they run away.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Damn.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah. Sorry to keep interrupting. Go on.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's all right. I'll resume.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Please, please.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Back in my pivot animation days, I met a lot of cool people.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I was meeting up with some of them in 2013 because a few of them lived in Australia and I was still in New Zealand at this point.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What we did is we went to my fucking high school and we just fucking took pictures of us goofing around.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No one was there. I think it was a weekend.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll throw a couple random pictures in chat of us just being goofy.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll fucking stand up and walk over to my computer.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, you see, you see.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And so we goofed around the high school and then one of the pictures, this third one here, I just put it up on Facebook.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I wasn't thinking anything and someone just said like, what the fuck is wrong if you're back?

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was like, what do you mean? And then I looked and clearly God had used the circle tool in Microsoft Paint to cut a hole in my back.

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Because I don't know what else the fuck is happening there.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I was so confused.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It looks like you're doing it on purpose.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Apparently, but then I noticed that like, huh, I guess my back is kind of fucked up and then it kind of got more fucked up over time.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I started having like really bad back pain and I realized, oh shit, I need to like sort this out.

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So for a while, what I did is I got a bouncy ball chair.

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, what do we call it? It's not called a bouncy ball chair.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's like a chair that is like an exercise ball like on wheels.

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Apparently that's supposed to help with your back or some shit, which it actually did.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was also doing a lot of exercise with my, I had a personal trainer like a few years ago who was helping me out.

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So that was pretty neat.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But then Jim is expensive and the balls kept deflating every time.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I went for like four of those chairs because I kept just fucking deflating on me.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So I gave up and now my back's been in decline again.

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And it's really bad.

147
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So in May, I'm across the room, by the way, I went up to the wall and I d-dag zaggles on Twitter recommended that I get a tennis ball.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I get a tennis ball and I like, and I like use it as a massage tool and I like, like, like something like back against the wall and I roll it around.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm doing that right now.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've been told that too.

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And I didn't do it.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It sometimes sort of helps a bit.

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Sometimes I feel a little better after I do it.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A chiropractor told me to do that.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And being a chiropractor, I did the opposite.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Chiropractors aren't even real.

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Exactly.

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They're not even real scientists.

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah, they're not.

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They don't watch freaking Morty.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's a soft science like economics.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not real.

163
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's all made up.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They're just massage boys.

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean, at the end of the day, it's true.

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, in May, or I think maybe late April, I don't fucking remember exactly when it was.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'd spent like a week with my feet on the desk.

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I was like slouching on my chair, like at the Olympic level, dude.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And it was bad because it started really fucking on my back.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm like, you know, I should do those stretches that my personal trainer taught me.

172
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I haven't done those in like a year.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What could happen?

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And so one morning I was up like super early or something.

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was going to call off my friend and I just started doing one of the stretches.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I did the hip bridge and something fucked up.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Like it wasn't like there was no, there wasn't like a click or there wasn't like a singular

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
moment where something fucked in my back.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But like I was doing it for like 10 seconds and I was like, oh, oh, this hurts.

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This hurts more than it should.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And then I, you know, collapsed down and then I realized I couldn't move.

182
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was stuck on my back and I couldn't actually, I couldn't roll over.

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I couldn't move.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was in extreme pain.

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Wait, you did that?

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And you did that by doing the stretches that like the doctor recommended to you?

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That my personal trainer did.

188
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, yeah, the stretches are designed to help.

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, they designed to help my back and they were really helpful back then.

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But I guess I'd been out of it for so long that I wasn't ready for it or some shit.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And I couldn't move for like 15 minutes.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I was on the floor and I was, and my friend was just on discord because I had my headset on.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I was like trying to like, took me ages to like be able to get back up and talk to him.

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And he was just like, oh, fucking jeez.

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And it didn't get any better throughout the day.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I couldn't even like, like sitting was the most painful thing.

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I could keep my, keep my back straight was fine.

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Standing up was fine.

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Laying down was fine.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Anything else hurt so bad.

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Like request, request.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Why can I speak?

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What the fuck?

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I had to get request.

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I had to get.

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I had to get two weeks off work where pretty much for a whole time I couldn't sit in a chair.

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I had to like mainly lay like, I forget how it was.

208
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's like a specific position that was like really helpful, like laying on my side or something.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And oh yeah, I had to lay on my side with a fucking body pillow like between my knees.

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It was like the ideal thing to recover because I don't have fucking health insurance.

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So I googled like what to do and you injure your back and they're like, yeah, doctors just going to charge you money and just tell you to do this.

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So just do it.

213
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm like, okay.

214
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I did that and it worked and I've been worked on my back since then, but that was fucking.

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That was a fucking time.

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That sounds pretty fucking.

217
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I was really scared I would become Tom.

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, that's what we're all trying to avoid.

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Next thing you know, you're writing for SaverSpark and then it's all over.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's all fucking over for you.

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, I was a bit, I was a little disappointed actually because on the one hand it would be bad to have a kidney infection.

222
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But on the other hand, if I had gone and that she had told me like, yes, you have a kidney infection here or some antibiotics to take, it will go away.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'd be like, cool.

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And then I would do it and then the issue would go away.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But now she's just like, no, it's not a kidney infection.

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's just nothing.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's just whatever.

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's nothing.

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You just got to fucking deal with it.

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And I'm like, oh, okay.

231
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I love it when it's nothing.

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, it's no the problem we're having.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's nothing.

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Just deal with it, loser.

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
My will, I suppose.

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You know, back when there was health insurance in this household, I guess it was before we moved into this apartment.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Good times, good times.

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, my partner used to have health insurance a few years ago and they were going through some kind of medical like catastrophe where they were basically throwing up like everything they ate for like a month.

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Like even water, they would throw, they would vomit, food vomit.

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Like one out of every 10 meals would stay down.

241
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They were blacking out constantly.

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They were losing weight.

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They were in pain.

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It was awful.

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And multiple times we went to the emergency room and they would just, they're just like, sure, here's some fucking saline, I guess.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, nothing's wrong.

247
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Go home.

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Nothing's wrong, go home.

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Also, give us 500 bucks.

250
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Nothing's right, I'm torn.

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And that happened multiple times and they just were fucking around being assholes.

252
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And then eventually, they were like, oh, like five months later, they were like, oh, I guess we got to take your gallbladder out.

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And it was like, oh cool, you couldn't have figured that out five months ago.

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah.

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They just didn't even want to check.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Man, loving that health insurance is really worth the money.

257
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Jesus.

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Didn't Mage have her gallbladder out at some point?

259
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh yeah.

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Didn't she say that she had to go, it wasn't just like they did an operation and they took her gallbladder out.

261
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:01,000
She said she spent several months in Russia or something, or the Ukraine or something, in some sort of health camp, whatever that means.

262
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Wait, I vaguely remember that, yeah.

263
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It was like she did eventually just have surgery and have her gallbladder out.

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But before that, yeah, she spent like, she went away to some health camp where they did alternative medicine shit of kinds I can only imagine.

265
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is just like, oh geez, Lois, this is just like that time in Golden Girls.

266
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This is the reference I always go to when doctors are bad.

267
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is just like the time in Golden Girls when Dorothy has mysterious fatigue and doesn't know why and she keeps going to different doctors and they all go,

268
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
eh, have you considered that you're just like a stupid woman and you don't know what you're talking about?

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And she's like, yes, doctor, I have considered that, but I still don't know what's wrong.

270
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And they're like, well, I think we've cracked the case.

271
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Get out of my office.

272
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh yeah.

273
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There was a bit of that, though, even from female doctors and nurses and shit.

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They'd ask you about, you go in there because you got this pain and you're throwing up constantly.

275
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And they're like, how's your sex life?

276
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And my partner's like, I'm asexual.

277
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't really, I don't do sex.

278
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's a phase.

279
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You'll get over it, says the nurse.

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Wait, that's totally irrelevant.

281
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's totally irrelevant to why I'm here to say that.

282
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You'll want to have kids.

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You better fucking breed, she said.

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You gotta be fucking joking me.

285
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Really?

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They would just take the opportunity.

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let me take this opportunity to tell you, you should be having more sex and more babies.

288
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay, cool.

289
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's pretty weird.

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, the doctor didn't tell me that.

291
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, that's because you're not a woman, Ben.

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, it's true.

293
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes, so who cares what I do?

294
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So who cares?

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Shit, I just remembered I left a portion of a Chipotle burrito down the street in Kazi's house.

296
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

297
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What do I gotta do?

298
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hold on, hold on, give me 10 minutes.

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Give me a 10 minute hiatus as I walk down the street.

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What do you say down the street?

301
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I think you meant on a mailbox somewhere.

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, it's a street burrito.

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Street tacos.

304
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's what we in the biz call a street taco.

305
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I've had some of those.

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Can I switch to my phone?

307
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Maybe you can switch to my phone and just record through Craig.

308
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I walk over there, grab my burrito.

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Eleazar is going to love you.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And walk back eating it.

311
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Fuck Eleazar.

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No, it's not true.

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm sorry Eleazar, I love you.

314
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't care that you're cheating on us with the gamer zone, it's fine.

315
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's okay.

316
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Our draw cast editor is cheating on us with Nate and someone else.

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, is it no need?

318
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It is no need, yeah.

319
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What a slut.

321
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I know, right?

322
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What a fucking slut.

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, I think C.T.A.L. at everyone about a game of draw telephone for the draw cast.

324
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And I didn't look, I was like, I'll look later and I think I may have missed it.

325
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You can still get in.

326
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I kind of wanted to.

327
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We're not even halfway through the list.

328
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We can just add people to the list and move them around who haven't done it yet.

329
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So, you can easily still get in.

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, maybe I should do that then.

331
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, Teleperte is involved in that.

332
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I know, I know.

333
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I want to get in.

334
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I want to be, I want to time it so I'm next to that guy.

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That can be arranged.

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I want to sneakily.

337
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I can find a way to sneak you on to an episode of the draw cast with Teleperte if it means

338
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that much to you.

339
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No way.

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You could actually get me on the draw cast.

341
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
In that no way.

342
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I mean, you are a very, very unknown small artist, but it could happen.

343
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's true.

344
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's sad, but true.

345
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah, I thought it was pretty neat.

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I thought it was pretty neat that I was invited into that server.

347
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I would be on a draw cast sometime.

348
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I think Gib was talking about that she was on a draw cast.

349
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, she was on the animation episode where we did an animation in 45 minutes, which was fucking crazy.

350
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Which is, I mean, it's a bit of a cheat.

351
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I mean, that's not even fair.

352
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's what Teleperte does is makes quick animations.

353
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I know.

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's like his whole thing.

355
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Is Teleperte a guy?

356
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I think he's a guy, right?

357
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He's a guy, yeah.

358
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He destroyed us, but it was pretty cool.

359
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Of course.

360
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The deck was stacked.

361
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Honestly, all of us did pretty fucking well.

362
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Even C.T.O.L. who had never animated before did a pretty cool animation for that.

363
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I mean, the theme was animating an amogus, killing itself.

364
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Which, of course, they've got a very simple character design.

365
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's easy to draw.

366
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We did a stick figure fighting one a bit later.

367
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That should come out in a few weeks.

368
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Teleperte was also on.

369
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, like a Zhao Zhao?

370
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, Xio, Xio, whatever you call it, Zhao Zhao.

371
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't know if I'm saying it right.

372
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I mean, I was in the stick figure community for years.

373
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I was deep in that shit.

374
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh, really?

375
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

376
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Did you make any?

377
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, yeah.

378
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I was legendary in my community.

379
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You were legend?

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Really?

381
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, I think I mentioned before.

382
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I didn't know this.

383
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I got my start as a pivot animator, which is like...

384
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Pivot is like this stick figure program that you...

385
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If you've seen it, you probably saw some kids using it at school.

386
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's typically how...

387
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
People I know who've heard of it say they've seen it before.

388
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It was specifically a stick figure animation program.

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah.

390
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The way it works is really cool, actually.

391
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let me see if I can get a picture of it.

392
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So it's kind of hard to explain without a visual aid.

393
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Here we go.

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
This image should work.

395
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Sorry about my creaky mattress.

396
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I can't hear the creaky mattress.

397
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But Pivot basically looks like this.

398
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You have a stick figure and he has these little red joints.

399
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You just click on them with the mouse and move them around.

400
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then you hit the next frame button and it saves the pose.

401
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You can just position him.

402
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There's no drawing required.

403
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can create custom figures and shit.

404
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's very simple.

405
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It has less features than Microsoft Paint.

406
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But it's really good for learning the basics.

407
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
There's no shortcuts.

408
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
There's no tweens.

409
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There's no nothing like that.

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Teleparter got his start doing that.

411
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So did a lot of people I know.

412
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It was cool.

413
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Do you know what that is cool?

414
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Most of the people I got on were people from the Hyun's Dojo server,

415
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
which is all about stick figure fighting.

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Hyun's Dojo?

417
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah.

418
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's a discord server for stick figure animators

419
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
who are, I guess, fans or associated with an animator called Hyun,

420
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
who did some shit for League of Legends.

421
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Bass.

422
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I was a fan of that guy since 2009, even before League was a thing.

423
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But yeah, basically we got a bunch of cool stick figure people on

424
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
to animate a stick fight for a draw cast.

425
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And that was also cool.

426
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And it's not even out yet.

427
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But it will be soon, maybe.

428
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Fucking neat.

429
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Fucking neat as hell.

430
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I haven't watched one yet.

431
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I haven't watched a draw cast yet.

432
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But I've seen the episodes you've been putting out.

433
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I saw you guys got, did we talk about already,

434
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
that you guys got YouTube destroyed, but then they fixed it?

435
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh yeah.

436
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Your channel was Nukes or something, right?

437
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, YouTube Nukes.

438
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
By accident?

439
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah.

440
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You have a Nukes for spam and deception, like severe deception.

441
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What does that mean?

442
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Well, I had to look into it because I'm like spam.

443
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Is it because we're uploading quickly?

444
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
No, YouTube wants us to upload quickly.

445
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They want everyone to upload quickly.

446
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If I can't fucking be the reason.

447
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I had to look up YouTube's policy for deceptive practices

448
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and spam and shit.

449
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It turns out the bar you have to cross

450
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
is the lowest fucking bar in the world.

451
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You know these YouTube channels that will upload?

452
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Hello guys, it's BlackPant for 2017 4K.

453
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Watch on YouTube for free.

454
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh yeah.

455
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I hate that guy.

456
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And the video is just a fucking JPEG for an hour

457
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and there's a virus in the video description.

458
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's basically that.

459
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Wait, what?

460
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Apparently that is what YouTube thought we were.

461
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I actually don't know the thing you're describing.

462
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh my god.

463
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The video is, I've seen YouTube videos that are like,

464
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
if you're looking for a movie,

465
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
it will say that it's the movie

466
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and then it will just be a still image

467
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that's like look in the description

468
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and the description is a link to a downloader site

469
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
that will give you a virus.

470
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah, that's basically what I'm talking about

471
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is that kind of shit.

472
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So that's what YouTube is like.

473
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
There's spam policy and deception policy

474
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
is mainly to stop people from doing that shit.

475
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Or just like posting nefarious links in general

476
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
or trying to trick people into clicking on shit

477
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
that is fake to that degree.

478
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So I was like, yeah, I'm pretty sure we didn't do that.

479
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm pretty sure, yeah, I don't think so.

480
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And we followed an appeal

481
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and we heard fucking nothing for almost a week.

482
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And then we just made a Twitter post

483
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
which nothing really happened.

484
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Vintela Perte retweeted it

485
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and it got solved within a couple hours.

486
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, that's how it goes.

487
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That's how it works.

488
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That isn't that the way they say it goes.

489
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Sad but true.

490
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If only you'd had big famous friends

491
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
to save the PCP when it was under fire.

492
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If only.

493
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If only.

494
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, we had a couple,

495
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
but maybe not Teleperte-sized.

496
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So it did eventually get fixed.

497
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's not that fast.

498
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah, just a few months, you know.

499
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Although, yeah.

500
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I saw, is YMS still having the thing

501
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
with like his side channel got demonetized or something?

502
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And for a while there, he kept tweeting about it

503
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and it seemed like they weren't doing anything.

504
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh yeah, didn't his game channel got nuked for terrorism?

505
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, because, was it like a 9-11 joke or something?

506
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, there was a 9-11 joke.

507
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It was really messed up.

508
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Hmm.

509
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Did they fix it?

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't know if they fixed it.

511
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
When a channel like YMS complains about something,

512
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
they always get what they want, because they're big.

513
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You would think they would be like,

514
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
oh, sorry, sir, right away, sir.

515
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I haven't seen a post about it in a while.

516
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I mean, I could just look up that in plays

517
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and see if it's there.

518
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
See if it exists, come on YouTube.

519
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Well, it was always there.

520
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It was demonetized, though, was the problem, right?

521
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Was it? Hold on.

522
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm trying to read the post,

523
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
because I found the post on Twitter from Adam.

524
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
This is him talking about YouTube claiming

525
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
that he supports violent criminal organizations.

526
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Hell yeah.

527
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Just lean into it.

528
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, yeah, okay, I see what happened.

529
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
He got a guideline strike, so it wasn't free strikes

530
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and he's out, he just got a strike that was stupid.

531
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah, I don't know if I'd ever got resolved.

532
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I see multiple tweets of back and forth between YouTube

533
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
where he's like, hey, YouTube, I'm not a terrorist,

534
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and YouTube's been like, hi, after reviewing,

535
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
you are a terrorist.

536
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Which is like, thanks.

537
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You gotta be like...

538
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Huh, what?

539
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh, sorry, you go.

540
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm gonna say you gotta be like, well, if YouTube

541
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
tells them, thinks I'm a terrorist,

542
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
then maybe I really will be a terrorist.

543
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Maybe I'll show them what a terrorist I can be.

544
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'll show them how many funny 9-11 jokes

545
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I can make and tell my audience that blowing up things

546
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
is cool, actually.

547
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
We'll see. We'll show them.

548
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Okay, now you go.

549
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I mean, you did say that terrorism was cool

550
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
at the beginning of this podcast.

551
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I mean, I am a traitor of America.

552
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You are.

553
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Thanks, C-Tol.

554
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Thanks, C-Tol, for getting me on the Traitors of America list.

555
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
That list probably doesn't exist anymore, huh?

556
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's a shame. I hope it still exists.

557
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Maybe that guy, I think that guy deleted his Twitter account.

558
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What's his name? Irate Gamer?

559
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Wait, is it Irate Gamer or someone?

560
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Pretty sure it's someone else.

561
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Maybe...

562
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, he had a name like that, though.

563
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It was like One Angry Gamer or something.

564
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Oh, yeah, One Angry Gamer sounds right.

565
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I think Irate Gamer was like some ancient,

566
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
like, angry video game nerd knockoff.

567
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah, yeah, I think you're right.

568
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So, sorry Irate Gamer if you're listening to this.

569
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I didn't mean to impugn your character

570
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
by implying that it was One Angry Gamer.

571
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Much completely different.

572
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Irate Gamer's character has been impugned enough already.

573
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's be fair.

574
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's true, that's true.

575
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Is he the one that basically just completely stole

576
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Angry Video Game Nerd's shtick?

577
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm pretty sure.

578
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
God, I first heard of him

579
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
when I found my first Doug Walker video, I think.

580
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
There was a video I found on YouTube

581
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
fucking years ago of like...

582
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It was called like the longest insult ever

583
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and it was the nostalgia critic, like

584
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
calling someone a dirty, fucked up,

585
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
sadistic piece of shit for like two minutes.

586
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Just a big string of ad-homs.

587
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It was great and I was like,

588
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
wow, this is funny, who's the Irate Gamer?

589
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And I had no idea.

590
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Wait, why did you think...

591
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Was he insulting the Irate Gamer?

592
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think so.

593
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That's sort of what it was related to in some way.

594
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Why was he insulting the Irate Gamer?

595
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
What did he do?

596
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Why would he do this?

597
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Hold on, I mean, I guess I could look it up.

598
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Why would you so viciously attack one of...

599
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Literally, one of your co-workers,

600
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
one of your contemporaries,

601
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
one of your peers?

602
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Why would you attack them like this, Doug?

603
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't know.

604
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I mean, according to this,

605
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that's just what the title says.

606
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And unless the insult was from something else

607
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and there was some Irate Gamer drama

608
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and everyone was just putting this video at him saying,

609
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
hey, this is you, which I don't know.

610
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hey, this is you.

611
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Hey, I bet Doug's talking about you right now

612
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and he's like, I don't know about Doug.

613
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Everyone was like, oh my god, Doug Walker

614
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and talked for two minutes

615
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
about what a piece of shit someone is.

616
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
This makes me think of the Irate Gamer.

617
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I gotta tell the Irate Gamer, okay, this is you.

618
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh my god, there he is, it's young Doug.

619
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's young Doug in a more innocent...

620
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
A more innocent time.

621
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You know, back when the wall was slightly beige.

622
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Back before...

623
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, the wall behind him, not the wall review.

624
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh god, no, not the wall review.

625
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I've seen...

626
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I've watched so many videos about the wall review.

627
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I've...

628
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The wall review is great.

629
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's actually a great video because it's inspired so many,

630
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
highly entertaining takedowns

631
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and think pieces about why is this what it is,

632
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
why does this exist, why is this so terrible.

633
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Why is Corey Taylor from Slipknot involved?

634
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That's my big question.

635
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There's so many things about it

636
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
that are like, why would you do this?

637
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Why is this the form this project took?

638
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah, fucking Fena.

639
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I knew about Fena already because one of my furry friends

640
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
was like introvert stuff

641
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and I always thought it was creepy and weird

642
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
the way they move around.

643
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Is Fena a girl?

644
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't know if Fena's like the creator is a girl or boy.

645
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I think the character might be a girl.

646
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Maybe.

647
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Is one of the characters named Fena?

648
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Actually, maybe not.

649
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I think Fena is the artist and the...

650
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
God, I don't know.

651
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm just thinking of the creepy rat thing

652
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
with the sharp teeth and the rat thing on the side.

653
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
No, that thing's not named Fena.

654
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That has a different name.

655
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Lucy Lace Maker?

656
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That sounds correct, actually.

657
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I just thought all the characters were named Fena.

658
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Maybe that's my mistake.

659
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Every character is named Fena.

660
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It was after I watched a Folding Ideas video

661
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
about the wall.

662
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That was a pretty good video.

663
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I love that video.

664
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's so good.

665
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But he talks a little bit about Fena

666
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
and he sort of explained...

667
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
He says that it's bad, but it still made me curious.

668
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I was like...

669
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's like a multi-media...

670
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's like an expansive universe.

671
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It mixes animation and real-life actors.

672
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
That's kind of odd.

673
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That's sort of unique, I guess.

674
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'll go and look at some.

675
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I went and navigated over the channel

676
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and I looked at it and it really is...

677
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It is an interesting idea.

678
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's an interesting way of making a cartoon.

679
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But it's...

680
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It's like someone tried to interpret Vivzi Pop's style

681
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
into Uncanny 3D.

682
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Uncanny 3D?

683
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Like...

684
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's like...

685
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's like watching a high school or home movies

686
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
with just ad-libbed the dialogue.

687
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
When the actors are talking it all feels ad-libbed

688
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
and aimless.

689
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I watched one that was like...

690
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It was like a guy brings another guy to a field

691
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and he's like...

692
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, we own you now. You're my slave now.

693
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We're gonna make you work in these fields

694
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and do farm work for me because I own you.

695
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Him and Lucy just like...

696
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't know, they just ramble about it.

697
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The guy goes...

698
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm in a predicament and Lucy goes...

699
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's what you deserve, mate.

700
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
This is payback for what you've done.

701
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
What have you done, lad?

702
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Why have you brought me to this field, son?

703
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Why did you bring me to this field?

704
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Because it's cheap to film in an outdoor location

705
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
as in the public field.

706
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The crowd will never be yours.

707
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay.

708
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
What do we have to work with for our video?

709
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We have a camera

710
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and we have a bunch of outdoor places that we could go.

711
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Okay, so what story can we tell

712
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
in which it only involves our characters

713
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
like walking into a field,

714
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
talking to each other for a minute,

715
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and then the video ends?

716
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay, indentured servitude. Got it.

717
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Okay, that's easy.

718
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I guess when it comes to videos in fields,

719
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Favre in the field is the best video of all time.

720
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Favre in the field.

721
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This is my favorite fucking video on YouTube, probably.

722
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I save it about 10 different videos,

723
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
but this is one of the 10.

724
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
This is what FedEx should have spent their time doing.

725
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Just animating JPEGs moving around

726
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
rather than really complicated 3D models.

727
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The thing about FedEx is it is impressive

728
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
how much we're able to do,

729
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
but more movement does not equal better animation.

730
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The characters are just constantly

731
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
moving up and down.

732
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
They're constantly wiggling.

733
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's weird.

734
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's not good character animation.

735
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It's smooth, but that doesn't equal good animation.

736
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
They have some sort of tool set

737
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
that enables them to make the character

738
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
just constantly be wiggling around at all times

739
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and be good for them.

740
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah, but it's very...

741
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It looks like they're...

742
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't know.

743
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It looks like they're floating in liquid or something

744
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and their fur is sort of anti-gravity.

745
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's all just kind of moving around.

746
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The dialogue is the same.

747
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
They're constantly muttering something.

748
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
They're constantly mumbling

749
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
or just saying some off-topic stuff.

750
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
There can be no silence.

751
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There has to be some...

752
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They must overload your brain at all times.

753
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, it's the same philosophy with the movement

754
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
as with the dialogue.

755
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's just constantly moving.

756
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It doesn't matter if it's going anywhere,

757
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but it's all moving.

758
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah, accurate.

759
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
What is this father in the field?

760
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's like Monty Python.

761
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh, I skipped ahead a little bit.

762
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Someone's getting stabbed.

763
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Someone, definitely.

764
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
This is okay.

765
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It seems good.

766
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
This seems like something Gib would like.

767
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah, probably.

768
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This guy was like a video game review channel

769
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
or something, and then he just

770
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
didn't make a review in a long time

771
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and then just made this.

772
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And I'm like, yeah, you've peaked.

773
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You can't peep.

774
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Father in the field.

775
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I feel like I wish I had...

776
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
If I could freeze time,

777
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I would freeze time,

778
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
watch the whole thing, and come back.

779
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But we're on a tight schedule.

780
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We're on a tight schedule here.

781
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
We got to be in Cincinnati by sundown,

782
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
as Big Joel once said,

783
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
for no particular reason.

784
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Joel's not that big.

785
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
He's not even named Joel.

786
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What the fuck?

787
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's illegal.

788
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You can't false advertise like that.

789
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
But it's not.

790
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Okay.

791
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
My back feels a little better

792
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
from lying down.

793
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Sorry about my creaky mattress.

794
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Sorry if my throat sounds like

795
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
because I'm laying on my neck.

796
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I have the mattress pressing.

797
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It feels great, though.

798
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Shut up, phone!

799
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Telling me that it's 11.05 in the morning.

800
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't want to know that.

801
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Well...

802
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I had my phone delivered to me by my husband.

803
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I had to leave it with him

804
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
so it could wake him up

805
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
after I started recording this podcast.

806
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And he delivered it to you?

807
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I guess he delivered it to me.

808
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
He came out here a few minutes ago

809
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and just put the phone on my desk and then left.

810
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Why doesn't he get his own damn phone?

811
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I don't know.

812
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I don't know.

813
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
They'll wake me up at 9.30.

814
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You know why I feel so bad this morning.

815
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You know why I'm cranky.

816
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's because I didn't have my damn rain sounds.

817
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I forgot to put my damn rain sounds on

818
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
for sleeping.

819
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I forgot to put my favorite YouTube channel,

820
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Dreamy Sound.

821
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And I didn't have it.

822
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So I'm not rested.

823
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Dreamy Sound.

824
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I love Dreamy Sound.

825
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You know Minecraft, you tube a dream.

826
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's where he puts his music from.

827
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Dreamy Sound?

828
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The thing about Dreamy Sound,

829
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
this is a bit interesting.

830
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There's actually a little bit interesting.

831
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There are channels where they'll just post

832
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
10 hours of recording of rain or something.

833
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Dreamy Sounds does not merely post

834
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
long sounds.

835
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
He posts that.

836
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But for each sound,

837
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
he creates like a

838
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
fantasy landscape

839
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
to go with it.

840
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
He will make like...

841
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Oh yeah, this is the sound of the ocean.

842
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But in the video,

843
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I will put together a little image that's like

844
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
a bed floating on like a platform

845
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
in the middle of like a

846
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
vast like placid ocean.

847
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You can see all the way to the horizon.

848
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Or like...

849
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Placid, Placid.

850
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Placid, okay.

851
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Or he'll be like...

852
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Or he'll composite an image of

853
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
like, oh, this is like my dream apartment.

854
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And it's like, you know, it's got

855
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
like mood lighting and it's got, you know,

856
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
it's like a nice little cozy living room.

857
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And there's like a big window

858
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that looking out on like a city from

859
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
like a high rise building.

860
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Or, you know, whatever.

861
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
He'll put together these little scenes.

862
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It's like, this is the scene

863
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
where in the dreamy sound is occurring.

864
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh, these are like...

865
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
These are like cool 3D renders.

866
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

867
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That's cool. It is cool.

868
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I mean, I honestly don't care.

869
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I don't really care about the visual.

870
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I only care about the sound.

871
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
But he goes above and beyond and he makes

872
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
these little like...

873
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
These little scenarios for them.

874
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That's kind of neat.

875
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Wait, hold on. This is cozy rain.

876
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I clicked on a video called dreamy sound

877
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and then the next video

878
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
that I thought was the same channel

879
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
was actually a channel called cozy rain

880
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
doing the exact same thing.

881
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That's just like when I'm watching

882
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
my favorite cooking YouTuber,

883
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
chocolate cacao.

884
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And then I click on the next video

885
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and I think it's another chocolate cacao video.

886
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But no, it's some other freak.

887
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's some other freak stealing his bit

888
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
of making food that looks good.

889
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And I can't fucking get off to that.

890
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I can't get off to someone else

891
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
making a damn jelly tart

892
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
because they don't sprinkle the chocolate on it

893
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
at the end and they don't do the little

894
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
yada, like triumph pose at the end.

895
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And what's even the fucking point

896
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
if you don't do the little yada triumph pose

897
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
at the end?

898
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Honestly.

899
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Why even live?

900
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
That's why I eat food so I can pose afterwards.

901
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
He does a little

902
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
he doesn't say yada

903
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
but he does a little like

904
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
fist pump thing.

905
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Is he like

906
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
is he like a

907
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Japaneseman?

908
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I think so.

909
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I think so, yeah.

910
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
He doesn't show his face.

911
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You only ever see his face

912
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
in like dark, in like

913
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
shadowed silhouettes. Just for like one shot.

914
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Just for one shot at the end of the video

915
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
you'll see his hands and you'll see his body

916
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
he's wearing an apron.

917
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And then at the end they'll have a

918
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
other recipe and he'll put it on the table

919
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and then you'll have one little shadowed

920
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
shot from the side where you see his face

921
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
only in silhouette and then he does

922
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
a little triumph and pose and then he

923
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
brings up a pinch of cocoa powder

924
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and he starts to sprinkle it and then you see

925
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
the cocoa sprinkling onto whatever

926
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
it is he just made.

927
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And that's all you get to see

928
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
of chocolate cacao.

929
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's cool, Gladdy.

930
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's so cool.

931
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Mystery is fun.

932
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
He's not entirely faceless.

933
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
He's mostly faceless

934
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
but he gives you just a little bit.

935
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Damn.

936
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I mean, his

937
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
tarts are

938
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
works of art.

939
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
They're not even food.

940
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
They're masterpiece sculptures.

941
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
The only cooking YouTuber I've watched

942
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
is, I don't remember her name.

943
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
She's like an Australian

944
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
woman

945
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
who looks like my mom

946
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
kind of

947
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and

948
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Does she talk or is she silent?

949
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
She used to

950
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
just do regular cooking videos

951
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
and then she started doing a video series

952
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
where she debunks

953
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
fake cooking videos

954
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
where people are like, oh hey

955
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
pour some batter into a paper bag

956
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
microwave it, instant brownie

957
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
and they have all these recipes

958
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
that are literally impossible

959
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
or will actually kill you

960
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and she'll basically explain how the videos are fake

961
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and she'll

962
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
life hack.

963
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No big cheesecake.

964
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Put cheese in a bowl

965
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
and then put flour in it

966
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and mix it up and yeah.

967
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Cheesecake.

968
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah, I see.

969
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's pretty good videos

970
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
but then she made a lot of them

971
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and I don't want to watch a lot of videos of this.

972
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah.

973
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Speaking of

974
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
speaking of debunking

975
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I had never seen

976
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
a Doctor Disillusion

977
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
No, a Captain Disillusion.

978
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I finally watched

979
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I think Gib mentioned

980
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
him in my discord

981
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
a couple days ago

982
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and I just was like okay

983
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and I went and looked up a video

984
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
and I watched a whole bunch of them

985
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and they're so good, they're so cool.

986
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Have you gone back

987
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
to his earliest video from 2007?

988
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
No.

989
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Alright, I want you to do that now

990
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and just watch the first few seconds

991
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
because it's freaky

992
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Are you gonna post it?

993
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah.

994
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Let me just link it.

995
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I can't wait.

996
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It's so...

997
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
This is from 2007.

998
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It looks like Kramer.

999
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Penguin slap debunk.

1000
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It looks the same.

1001
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Exactly, it looks the same.

1002
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
He's been doing this shit

1003
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
for so long

1004
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
at such a high quality.

1005
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It's crazy.

1006
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I mean, it's a little less fancy

1007
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and he looks younger

1008
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and thinner.

1009
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So I mean, good for him.

1010
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But, yeah, other than that

1011
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
kind of the same.

1012
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's crazy like

1013
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
how

1014
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
good he was early on

1015
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and how unknown he was until recently.

1016
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I discovered him...

1017
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Is that true? Was he unknown until recently?

1018
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Well, I mean

1019
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
recently on the scale of

1020
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
doing this shit for 14 years,

1021
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I suppose.

1022
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I discovered him in 2015.

1023
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I saw the floating city

1024
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
debunk video

1025
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
because I saw that floating around

1026
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and people were saying, oh, it's a hologram

1027
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and I have a government

1028
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
that's a mirage and I'm like, it can't be a mirage

1029
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
because

1030
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
the buildings are seen from a low angle

1031
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and if it was some kind of reflection

1032
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you'd see an upside down version

1033
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
of them or some shit was what I was thinking.

1034
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I just found his video on it

1035
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and I was like, what the fuck?

1036
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What is this production value?

1037
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And he had 60k subscribers at that point.

1038
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And I checked his social

1039
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
blade

1040
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and he had been sitting at 25k

1041
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
for a very long time.

1042
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That's not even

1043
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
even for like early YouTube

1044
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that's not even that much.

1045
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah, and the 25k

1046
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
had only been for like the past two years

1047
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
because he had like one video blow up

1048
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
before that he was like

1049
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
around 10k

1050
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and he was like getting no subscribers for years, it seemed.

1051
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That's insane.

1052
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I mean, now he's gone big.

1053
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It was right after I discovered him

1054
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
he started blowing up so clearly.

1055
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So something must have really hit.

1056
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Was it the

1057
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I remember the first time

1058
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I ever heard of Captain Disillusion

1059
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
it was when

1060
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't remember who was talking about it

1061
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
but some other video was talking about

1062
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
his video debunking

1063
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the staircase.

1064
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
The infinite staircase, you know what I'm talking about?

1065
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The Asherian stairwell.

1066
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah, and someone

1067
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
someone was criticizing him.

1068
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I think they said that

1069
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
his video was

1070
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
was like too cruel

1071
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
to the

1072
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
to the creator

1073
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
of it because he was critical of that guy

1074
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
for like, you know, basically turning

1075
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
an art project into like a hoax.

1076
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm trying to think

1077
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
it's perfectly fine to be critical of that.

1078
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Yeah, it was.

1079
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It is.

1080
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Dammit.

1081
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I don't remember who.

1082
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I don't remember whose video I watched

1083
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Captain Disillusion.

1084
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
They criticized Captain Disillusion

1085
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
for his take on it.

1086
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't remember where it was.

1087
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Oh well.

1088
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I mean

1089
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I don't know why you would criticize for that.

1090
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
In hindsight, yeah, I don't either.

1091
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I don't

1092
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I wish I could remember because I'm like

1093
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
yeah, why would you do that?

1094
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
He did nothing wrong.

1095
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because then

1096
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I watched

1097
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
a bunch of

1098
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
those Captain Disillusion videos

1099
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and I finally saw that one

1100
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
the staircase one that I had only heard

1101
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
about second hand

1102
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
previously and I watched it and I was like

1103
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
yeah, he is critical of that guy but like

1104
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
it's kind of

1105
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
only in the sense that

1106
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
people who fall down the rabbit hole

1107
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
of believing

1108
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
UFO conspiracies

1109
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
up until like

1110
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
you know, COVID

1111
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
denial stuff and all that

1112
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
like weird fake videos

1113
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
or like sort of what helped shape their world view

1114
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
of everything being fake man

1115
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
so like contributing to that is generally

1116
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
not a good idea even if it is

1117
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
for an art project it's good to like

1118
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
be like hey, by the way, this is fake

1119
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
just so you know.

1120
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah.

1121
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
See if this proves the lizard men are real.

1122
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
My boy

1123
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Jack Saint made a video

1124
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
one time

1125
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
that I really liked. I really liked it

1126
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
it was a

1127
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
it was the story of like

1128
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
a town

1129
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
in

1130
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
the US. I forget what the name of the town

1131
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
was but it was like a

1132
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
the story basically went

1133
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
that there was like a telecommunications company

1134
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that set up like

1135
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
a new like internet

1136
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
service provider like hub

1137
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
in the town and it like something went wrong

1138
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
with it and it started to

1139
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
like produce a noise

1140
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
it started to produce a constant noise and like

1141
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the noise was like unsettling

1142
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
to the residents and they started to

1143
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
they you know a lot of them couldn't sleep

1144
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
a lot of them started to become

1145
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
like you know have like

1146
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
mood problems and like a lot of them

1147
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
they became irate and they started

1148
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
having like you know it caused

1149
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
all these all these all these

1150
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
all the problems you would expect of everyone being constantly

1151
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
assaulted with an unpleasant noise

1152
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
that makes it hard to sleep all the time

1153
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
until and and and and the telecommunications

1154
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
company just like kept

1155
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
basically just kept doing like PR

1156
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
about it and being like

1157
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
pretending the issue was solved even when it wasn't

1158
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
and like you know it led to like

1159
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
you know it led to like some shooting some accidental shooting

1160
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
deaths in the neighborhood

1161
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
it was not it turned out it was not a real

1162
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
story I thought it was a real story

1163
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
he he later said like

1164
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
yeah this was like a work of fiction

1165
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
that I wrote and like

1166
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
it and like I was like

1167
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
oh okay well I guess I liked it as a

1168
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
story and it had like you know it was a

1169
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
fable about you know capitalism

1170
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
bad it was like yeah okay

1171
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
but I think he apologized

1172
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
because he was like yeah maybe I should

1173
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
have made it more clear that this was like a

1174
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
a work of fiction

1175
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I was like yeah

1176
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
yeah I feel a little duped

1177
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I feel a little bit duped because I thought this was a real thing you were telling me

1178
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I watched the whole video and I

1179
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
oh I felt I felt kind of stupid I felt like

1180
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
um

1181
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
he sort of implied that like you were supposed

1182
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
to know that it was a fake story

1183
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I was like well I didn't I guess

1184
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm a rube

1185
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
um

1186
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
oops

1187
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
yeah yeah

1188
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
you gotta watch out

1189
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
you can't be spreading

1190
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
spreading fake shit

1191
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
yeah like a lot of people have told captain

1192
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
this illusion like oh why don't you make

1193
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
your own fake UFO video and then reveal it

1194
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
was you after it goes viral how'd that be

1195
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
so funny and he's just like I mean I

1196
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
could do that it would be funny

1197
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
the people who are in on the joke would

1198
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
find would be very you know entertained

1199
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
but a lot of people

1200
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
are gonna see that video without seeing

1201
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
the correction and they're just gonna be like

1202
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
yeah see man this is what the government's

1203
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
hiding from us the aliens man

1204
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
and he you know

1205
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
it's not and that means it's not

1206
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
worth it which I respect that's

1207
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
in that's integrity I think

1208
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
that's what integrity is I mean

1209
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
is it

1210
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
so

1211
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
okay so I guess I guess the client the contention

1212
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
there is that

1213
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
if you if you make a if you make

1214
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
a if you make something that looks

1215
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
impossible and you put it out there

1216
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
and then you debunk it

1217
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
like it does more

1218
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
it does more harm by

1219
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
showing the fake

1220
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
thing then then it does

1221
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
good by like by debunking

1222
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
something that's fake and showing

1223
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
like this is how it can be faked

1224
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
because

1225
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
like debunking is good

1226
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
like in the sense that like

1227
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
people are putting out fake stuff

1228
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
into the world

1229
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and you can like debunk it and like

1230
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
you know

1231
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
some people will be like oh okay that was fake but like

1232
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
ultimately like

1233
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
the fake thing would have convinced

1234
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
a few people and then you can unconvince

1235
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
a few of them but some of us people still got convinced

1236
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
so like the net is still

1237
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
in the bad direction

1238
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
probably

1239
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
maybe

1240
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I feel like

1241
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
it's theoretically possible

1242
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
that you might

1243
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
debunk something

1244
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
in such spectacular fashion

1245
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
that the debunking

1246
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
gets more

1247
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
seen more than

1248
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
the original thing itself

1249
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that's true

1250
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
possibly

1251
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
you might not be able to guarantee that that happens

1252
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
so I guess I understand

1253
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
why you might still not want to do it

1254
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
it's probably like more of like a principle thing

1255
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
than a like

1256
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I'm doing my utilitarian calculation

1257
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
of how many people this will

1258
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
bring which way or the other way

1259
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
in any case captain D

1260
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
probably

1261
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
one of my favorite YouTubers ever

1262
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I binge his entire channel like twice a year

1263
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
because the videos are just

1264
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
very watchable

1265
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I was

1266
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
binging the other day I didn't finish

1267
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I have more to binge

1268
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I have more captain D

1269
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
than I haven't seen yet

1270
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
it is all good shit

1271
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
he did a long video

1272
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
recently about

1273
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Flight of the Navigator

1274
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I skipped out on it

1275
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
because I was like I kind of just want to see more

1276
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
of the regular

1277
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
the main videos

1278
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I mean

1279
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
lowkey me too

1280
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
but I still thought

1281
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
the video was pretty cool

1282
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
it was still good

1283
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
it's interesting to talk about how the movie

1284
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
was made like that's fine and all

1285
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
but like you know

1286
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
it's not as dense

1287
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
it's not as densely interesting

1288
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
as the D-Boom videos

1289
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I can't

1290
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I couldn't

1291
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I couldn't fucking believe

1292
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I don't know

1293
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I couldn't believe

1294
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
he did the laminar flow

1295
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
when he made the

1296
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I looked at his most popular video

1297
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I think his second most popular video was

1298
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
the laminar flow

1299
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
proof

1300
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and it's just like no it's just real

1301
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
it's just real and like here it is

1302
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
and then he just does it

1303
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
oh okay

1304
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
wow

1305
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
that was so fucking

1306
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
funny that video

1307
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
the ending where like he's like

1308
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
but if I did want to fake it and then he has

1309
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
the fucking water flying all around the room

1310
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and doing all this crazy shit

1311
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
yeah and he's touching it and like

1312
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
he's just fucking

1313
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
showing off his visual effects skills

1314
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
because like to me

1315
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
because I do

1316
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
visual effects, animation, editing

1317
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
sort of shit for a living

1318
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
so the video of his

1319
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I mean I was watching him for like

1320
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
two years before he even came out

1321
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
the tape measure video was one of my favorite ones

1322
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I saw that one

1323
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
it's not just that he like

1324
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
you know explains how the video was faked

1325
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
he will like

1326
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
somehow like create

1327
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
a version of the video where he has

1328
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
removed the visual effects

1329
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
and like given like the blank like raw

1330
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
footage back which is so hard to do

1331
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
we have to like erase the effects and like

1332
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
paint the background back in

1333
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
and match the camera movements and shit

1334
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and then he'll edit himself into the scene

1335
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
like to be like look this is how I set up the effect

1336
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
and you see him walking around in the video setting shit up

1337
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
and it's like that is so much fucking

1338
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
work that is like way more work than like

1339
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
was actually put into the original thing

1340
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
then they made to make the video in the first place

1341
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
yeah

1342
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
it's like if someone gave you a fucking Marvel movie

1343
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and you gave it to a guy

1344
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
and he just turned it back into the green screen room

1345
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
and like removed everything

1346
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
that would be really fucking hard to do

1347
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I really liked

1348
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
that one the

1349
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
tape measure one

1350
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
and also I think there's another one of like

1351
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
they're throwing knives

1352
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
like they're throwing knives at a girl and she like catches them

1353
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
on ping pong paddles

1354
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
that was the first one that like

1355
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
bumped him up to 25k I think

1356
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
with subscribers

1357
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
that was the first big video he had

1358
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I mean not even

1359
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
his

1360
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I mean his debunking is interesting but like

1361
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
the reason it's so interesting is because it's like

1362
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
wow they did this

1363
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
but they didn't use like

1364
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
fancy fucking

1365
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
they didn't use like super technology software

1366
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
to make like perfect 3D

1367
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
effects they just

1368
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
they did it with like

1369
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
weird little practical tricks

1370
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
that you're like you just kind of don't notice

1371
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
when you see it and when you hear it explained

1372
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
you're like like oh

1373
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
she already had the knives sticking in the ping pong paddles

1374
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
she was just holding them backwards

1375
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
so you couldn't see them

1376
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
and then she flips them around in one frame

1377
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
and then it looks like they catch the knife on it but no

1378
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
they were just already there

1379
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
oh my god they tricked me

1380
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
they tricked me

1381
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
they got me so good

1382
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
um

1383
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
yeah the

1384
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
the way that they cheated

1385
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and they like

1386
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
you know they have the thing

1387
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
like one shot

1388
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
like someone must have just sat down and been like

1389
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
hmm how can I

1390
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
how can I make it look

1391
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
like my tape measure

1392
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
how can I make it look like my tape measure

1393
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
is coming out of the little thing

1394
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
and going to a

1395
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
port-a-potty door and pulling the door open

1396
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
if I drilled a hole and I put a wire through the door

1397
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
so you could pull it

1398
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and then I cut the two shots together

1399
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
it's like

1400
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
it's very admirable

1401
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
that someone sat down and figured all this out

1402
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
in the

1403
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I guess they work for an ad agency

1404
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
so they were like well I gotta make some

1405
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I gotta make some

1406
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
video of some weird impossible looking shit

1407
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
so um

1408
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
what can I throw together

1409
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
with some guys in like a lumber yard

1410
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
um

1411
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
oh yeah

1412
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
yeah so good

1413
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
very cool

1414
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
um

1415
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
duh

1416
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
how you been

1417
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
how's your life

1418
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
how's your life going

1419
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
my life is going cool

1420
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I should mention

1421
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
the GoFundMe

1422
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
yes the GoFundMe

1423
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I saw that

1424
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I think I mentioned earlier

1425
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
in this very episode right now

1426
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
whoa

1427
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I think in 2017

1428
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
like

1429
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
my girlfriend was harassed by a nurse

1430
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
for being asexual

1431
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
yeah

1432
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
it turns out

1433
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
that the reason they were asexual

1434
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
is because

1435
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
they were

1436
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
they're trans

1437
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and they just didn't know it yet

1438
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
that's crazy

1439
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
having big honking titties

1440
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
kinda sucks when

1441
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
you're a boy

1442
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I guess so

1443
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
it might yeah

1444
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
it might possibly

1445
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
maybe just a little bit

1446
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
so

1447
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
we're doing

1448
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
they've been transitioning for about 3 years

1449
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
about almost 2 years on hormones

1450
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
um

1451
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
so we're overdue

1452
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
we could've, I think

1453
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
most places will let you get top surgery after a year

1454
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
so we've been doing it for nearly 2 years

1455
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
with the hormone stuff

1456
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and

1457
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
we need to raise the link

1458
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
we need to raise like $10,000

1459
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
because fucking health insurance

1460
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I believe I was the first donor

1461
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I believe I was the first donor

1462
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
yeah I saw you sent a funny

1463
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
you sent 20 funny bucks

1464
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
sorry

1465
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
sorry my American currency is so

1466
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
so hilarious

1467
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
American

1468
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
American currency

1469
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
the reason it's funny is because I sent you

1470
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
like about 20 bucks like a week before

1471
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
like a week before

1472
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
oh that's right

1473
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
oh yeah so it all

1474
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
what goes around comes around

1475
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
exactly

1476
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
well basically you're just trading

1477
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
your husband's tits

1478
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
for a copy of Roger Radclon

1479
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
that comic must be worth a lot then

1480
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
damn

1481
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
oh yeah that's

1482
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
that's just called doing business

1483
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
making deals

1484
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
but

1485
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
you know storytelling is

1486
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
a donation to this cause

1487
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
is a donation for gay sex

1488
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
see I've been, we've been married

1489
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
like 5 years

1490
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
sex what even is that

1491
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
they haven't been comfortable with their body

1492
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
but this sort of shit is helping

1493
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
since they started taking hormones

1494
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
they were like oh hey, hey, sex maybe it's cool

1495
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
so help me get like

1496
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
this is what I'm saying

1497
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I

1498
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I

1499
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
what more can I add

1500
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
what more can I even say

1501
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I guess we'll probably

1502
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
put the link down in the description to

1503
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
support the

1504
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
top top surgery

1505
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
expense

1506
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
you know it's good

1507
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
good for them living

1508
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
their best

1509
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
life and making moves

1510
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
yeah it is generally

1511
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
awkward

1512
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
like having

1513
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
big booby in the way

1514
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
cause I don't want to touch it cause they're not comfortable with it

1515
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
but I want to like hug them

1516
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
and tell them they're cool

1517
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
and go jogging

1518
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
they can't go jogging

1519
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I can't even look at them

1520
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I have to like avert my eyes

1521
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
tell me more

1522
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I don't know

1523
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
exercise sucks

1524
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
a lot of things suck they get in the way

1525
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
you know

1526
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
these boobs were not meant for this world

1527
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
they must go so help with that

1528
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and

1529
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
it'll be epic

1530
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
you know what's epic

1531
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
you know what's epic

1532
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
the epic game store

1533
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
yeah

1534
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
what's epic Ben

1535
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I don't know I was gonna say

1536
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
something about

1537
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
how do I

1538
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
concoct some sort of like

1539
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
man it's good

1540
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
when a person

1541
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
gets to

1542
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
be the most

1543
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
authentically

1544
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
realized version of their

1545
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
their authentic self

1546
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
and whatever

1547
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
when they have the opportunity

1548
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
to

1549
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
make you know

1550
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
the most liberated

1551
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
liberation of their self

1552
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
from the shackles

1553
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
of flesh and blood existence

1554
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I don't know

1555
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
do you ever have a dream where you

1556
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
can do anything Ben

1557
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
um

1558
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
yeah

1559
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
bro

1560
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
lucid dreaming

1561
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
it's like

1562
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
you can

1563
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
control it and shit

1564
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
you can do anything

1565
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
you can make it happen

1566
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I swear for a certain portion of my life

1567
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
lucid dreaming was like an MMO

1568
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
that sometimes if my brain

1569
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
was lucky I would log in and I would retain

1570
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
my skills from the last time I lucid dreamed

1571
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and I could like level up and shit

1572
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
um and I save this

1573
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
metaphorically it was more of it like

1574
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
each time I lucid dreamed I had like

1575
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
better control over what happened

1576
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I could fly easier

1577
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
things we just generally

1578
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
like

1579
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
this is the plot of secret

1580
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
in the basement

1581
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
secret in the basement is that a book?

1582
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
is that a game?

1583
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
yeah that's the

1584
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
spiritual sequel to

1585
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
legend of the ten elemental masters

1586
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
it's Ululilia's second book

1587
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Ulululu

1588
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
yeah it's the second book

1589
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
that's about

1590
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I guess

1591
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
okay it's not actually about

1592
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
like the kid does

1593
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
he has RPG

1594
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
adventures in his dreams

1595
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
but like he first becomes

1596
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
okay

1597
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
it is while he's dreaming

1598
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
but it's not a dream

1599
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
it's a real place that he goes

1600
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
when he dreams

1601
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
and it's in his basement

1602
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
so

1603
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
you would think that he

1604
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
would either go there in his dreams

1605
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
or he would find a secret portal in his basement

1606
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
but no it's both

1607
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
in his dreams he can find

1608
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
a secret portal in his basement that takes him to

1609
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
a real place

1610
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
that gives him superpowers

1611
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
oh shit

1612
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
secret in the basement

1613
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
is such a funny book

1614
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
it's okay

1615
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
the thing that maybe makes it worse

1616
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
than

1617
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
ten elemental masters

1618
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
one it's not about like funny

1619
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
like fucking tiny

1620
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
like colorful wizard people

1621
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
aliens it's just about a kid

1622
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and that's boring

1623
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I hate children

1624
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
and it's really long

1625
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
it's a thick book

1626
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and it's kind of repetitive

1627
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and it probably didn't need to be as long as it did

1628
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
but

1629
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
it kind of flips back and forth between

1630
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
have you read

1631
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
ten elemental masters

1632
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I've

1633
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
only heard the name

1634
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
come from your mouth Ben

1635
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
on the pcp

1636
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I see

1637
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I don't think I've really heard of it anywhere else

1638
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I don't know anything about it really

1639
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
well I made a let's read video

1640
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I made a let's read video

1641
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
with terrible video quality

1642
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I was really ashamed

1643
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
that you were reading the book out loud

1644
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
instead of reading it in your mind

1645
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
how

1646
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
but then I couldn't

1647
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I couldn't make a video

1648
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
okay

1649
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
you say that but like Gib

1650
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
did her let's read series

1651
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
years ago

1652
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
and she didn't have to say anything

1653
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
she sat down with the book

1654
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
and she just opened it and then it was just like

1655
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
ten minutes of just flicking pages

1656
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
and then there was an N word

1657
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
then that was it

1658
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
yeah I should

1659
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I should take a page out of her book I guess

1660
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
well

1661
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I kind of want to do

1662
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
one of those but like with better

1663
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
video quality and a better

1664
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
shot

1665
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
with Secret on the Basement

1666
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Secret on the Basement is funny because

1667
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
in ten elemental

1668
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
masters it's just about this

1669
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
weird

1670
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
sort of autistic

1671
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
alien

1672
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
who like just never

1673
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
doesn't give a fuck about anything

1674
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and he can't relate to these humans at all

1675
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
cause he's just like oh food

1676
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I just create

1677
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
nutrient molecules in my body

1678
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I never need to eat

1679
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
but here's some waffles

1680
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
here's some breakfast waffles for you kids

1681
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
oh light so you can see

1682
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
oh I can see in every spectrum in the world

1683
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
so I don't need light but like here

1684
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I'll just illuminate my

1685
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
spectrums

1686
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
he's like oh yeah

1687
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I live in a

1688
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
concrete

1689
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
a featureless

1690
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
cubic concrete bunker

1691
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
deep underground with no light

1692
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
anywhere because I don't need light to see by

1693
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
but I guess since these kids are visiting

1694
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I will

1695
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
make my concrete bunker a little bigger

1696
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
for them and I will

1697
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
illuminate it with a light source

1698
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and I guess I will make

1699
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
beds for them to sleep in

1700
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
with fun patterns on the sheets

1701
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
that look like

1702
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
things they like

1703
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
what a gentleman

1704
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
he has a complete gentleman

1705
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
secret in the basement is different

1706
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
cause it's about a kid so like half of the book

1707
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
is like the kid just like

1708
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
living his normal life and going to school

1709
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
and dealing with bullies

1710
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
but it's funny dealing with

1711
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
bullies

1712
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
to the kid in secret in the basement

1713
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
bullies means that like

1714
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
one kid like calls him

1715
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
like makes like a bad

1716
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
pun in class

1717
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
and the teacher gets mad and gives him

1718
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
like 14 detentions

1719
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
and like that like that's

1720
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
bully like that's what a bully does

1721
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
in Ululili's mind

1722
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
is like be rude in class

1723
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
and the teacher is like

1724
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
that's one detention that's two detentions

1725
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
that's ten more detentions

1726
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
and then later on all the good

1727
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
non-bully kids go wow

1728
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I can't believe Jessica got 14 detentions

1729
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
that's gotta be a record

1730
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
damn what a bully

1731
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
that's epic

1732
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
this is a place of learning

1733
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
you shouldn't be making puns clearly

1734
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
no like

1735
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
sometimes

1736
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
sometimes

1737
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
they'll make like a

1738
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
shitty pun

1739
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
about something the teacher says

1740
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
and the teacher will go haha

1741
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
good one but you shouldn't be making jokes

1742
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
in class I'm gonna have to give you a detention

1743
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
for that

1744
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
like

1745
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
the teacher will be impressed

1746
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
but I have to I have to discipline you

1747
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
for this

1748
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
so we got the ten elements

1749
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
earth, water, fire, air, detentions

1750
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
one of the fundamental forces

1751
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and it's

1752
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
it's a more fun book because

1753
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
the kid starts out as normal

1754
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
but then like in his

1755
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
dream basement adventures

1756
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
he levels up and he improves

1757
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
his stats

1758
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
but the stat increases carry over into

1759
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
the real world so by the end of

1760
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
the book

1761
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
he's literally like stopping burglaries

1762
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
by like casting ice spells

1763
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
on like at camp

1764
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
like at summer camp and stuff

1765
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and he's like

1766
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
he's like tracking down like fellow

1767
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
like kids that like

1768
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
got possessed by demons and like went on

1769
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
like got lost in the woods he's like tracking

1770
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
them down and like exercising them with light

1771
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
spells and shit

1772
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and

1773
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and it's very funny because

1774
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
everyone around him is just like

1775
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
wow where did you learn to cast

1776
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
spells that's neat

1777
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
oh well I won't ask

1778
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
any further questions

1779
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
it's normal

1780
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
yeah everyone's like wow

1781
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I can't believe you I can't believe

1782
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
you can do you know 19

1783
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
pull-ups a second

1784
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and can like leap

1785
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
like a hundred feet in the air

1786
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
that sure is impressive anyway

1787
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
what were we talking about

1788
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
bye

1789
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
god that's funny

1790
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
it is funny it is funny

1791
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I feel like

1792
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I don't know if I

1793
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
like

1794
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
do you mind if I spoil the ending

1795
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
spoil as much as you want

1796
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
the spoilers for Seeker of the Basement

1797
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
the ending in the end

1798
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
when his

1799
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
dream adventures have come to an end

1800
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
he's got all these

1801
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
fucking powers his stats are so high

1802
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
he becomes

1803
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
a movie star he becomes

1804
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
like a superhero movie star

1805
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
but like because

1806
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
they don't use special effects

1807
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
he acts in superhero movies

1808
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
as

1809
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
himself

1810
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
because he just has superpowers in real life

1811
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
why

1812
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
and then he spends the rest of his life

1813
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
like well I did that

1814
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
so now I'll

1815
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
he just like he becomes a gold medalist

1816
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
in every Olympic event

1817
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
he becomes a star

1818
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
player in every sport

1819
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
in every league he just wins every fucking trophy

1820
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
in every league just because he can

1821
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
they just let him in

1822
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
they just let the superhuman in

1823
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
well yeah they do

1824
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
they just do

1825
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
at least you're not a woman

1826
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
if you're a woman we couldn't let you compete

1827
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
where in the rulebook does it say us

1828
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
you know

1829
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
a level 10,000 wizard from

1830
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
the dream realm can't be

1831
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
a basketball player or whatever

1832
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
there's no rule against it

1833
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
if you were a trans woman that would be

1834
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
an unfair advantage

1835
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
but yeah

1836
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
but no you leveled up

1837
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000

01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
like everyone else you went to the dream world

1839
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
and you tapped on the little thing

1840
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
and the wizard with like the barber pole

1841
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000

you bought your cosmos helm

1844
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
from the store

1845
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
with your igani

1846
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
you collected igani like everyone else

1847
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
it's just legit

1848
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
why shouldn't it just worked harder

1849
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
he picked himself up by his bootstraps

1850
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
but the end

1851
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
when he's finally done

1852
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000

01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
peak human accomplishment in every field

1854
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
of endeavor that exists

1855
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
what he decides to do with the rest of his life

1856
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
is become a cop

1857
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000

1858
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000

on burglars and like petty

1866
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
and petty criminals

1867
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
and drug dealers and stuff

1868
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
that's the best way to help the world

1869
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
freezing burglars

1870
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
nuts off

1871
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Ululilia loves cops

1872
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
he thinks cops are the good guys

1873
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
and criminals are bad guys

1874
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
he should have just fucking like it was a mistake

1875
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
like I can like

1876
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Ululilia

1877
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I made a mistake like one

1878
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
like what did this kid

1879
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
do to get good at acting first of all

1880
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
why doesn't he just

1881
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
why doesn't he just work for a VFX team

1882
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
why doesn't he just like

1883
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
why isn't he just like

1884
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
the pyrotechnic guy except he just

1885
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
shoots the flames out of his fucking asshole you know

1886
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
instead of

1887
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
he doesn't have to be the main character to do the elemental stuff

1888
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
honestly honestly it's

1889
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I think in

1890
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
in Ululilia's mind

1891
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
he wrote this character to just be a kind of

1892
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
idealized like good guy

1893
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
who everyone likes

1894
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
but

1895
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
in actuality the character comes off

1896
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
as an extremely off putting

1897
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
like weirdo

1898
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
who like responds

1899
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
with complete deadpan appreciation

1900
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
whenever anyone makes a shitty pun

1901
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
he just goes like

1902
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
haha that was a very funny joke

1903
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
he just told

1904
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and he goes um

1905
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
he likes to like he likes to correct people

1906
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
he's a he's a big smart ass who likes to correct

1907
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
people and he just likes to bring

1908
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
up like like a trivia that nobody

1909
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
cares about in in random situations

1910
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
he will just he will just start like citing

1911
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Wikipedia pages

1912
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
and be like I know I know a lot about

1913
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000

1914
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000

01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
that that star that's the dog star

1916
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
serious that's this constellation canis

1917
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
major you know he's just like some like

1918
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
obnoxious book nerd like I know all about

1919
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
the launch dates for the James Webb space telescope

1920
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
did you know the telescope was supposed to be

1921
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
launched in 2017

1922
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
yeah basically but but but you know

1923
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
he

1924
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
but in his mind this character he's just a nice

1925
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
smart guy who everyone likes

1926
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
and

1927
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
so why why can't he also be a movie star

1928
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
why can't he also be you know

1929
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
the charismatic leading man

1930
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
but how much how much sex

1931
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
has had that's that's the real

1932
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
measure I believe none

1933
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I believe I believe none

1934
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I don't think we are

1935
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
he gets like a roommate he

1936
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
moves in with like his female roommate

1937
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
but I don't think they're dating

1938
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
and I don't think he ever gets like a girlfriend

1939
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
or anything he does he does

1940
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000

1954
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I don't think so

1955
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
there's no mention of like Jesus or

1956
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
religion or anything and I guess I just

1957
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
hate I guess I just hate sex

1958
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
it's the only thing I can think of

1959
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I he might be I mean he could

1960
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
be asexual I don't know

1961
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
he never he never talks about like

1962
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
romance or anything like you know I don't think

1963
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
in any of his dream diaries he talks about

1964
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
like attraction

1965
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
or anything like that

1966
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
not tonight

1967
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
no he just loves you just loves video games

1968
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
and he loves it when you

1969
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
can go run really fast and jump really

1970
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
high

1971
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
that's what get that's what gets him off

1972
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
those are admirable qualities for sure

1973
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I am

1974
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I think I might have mentioned this along

1975
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
maybe months ago I talked to him again

1976
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
and I asked him if he

1977
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I didn't I didn't ask him again about whether

1978
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
he wanted me to make the audio book

1979
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
for for legend of the 10 element masters

1980
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
because it was he just seemed like so

1981
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
uninterested in

1982
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
discussing that I didn't even ask him

1983
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
about that I just asked him like how he was doing

1984
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
and he told me that he was

1985
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
he told me about the game he was working on

1986
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
he's making a new a new game

1987
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
and he said he told me the name

1988
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
of it and I mentioned it on the on the previous

1989
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
episode I don't remember anymore what he called it

1990
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
but it had a name

1991
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and he didn't even

1992
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
he didn't share that much about it with me

1993
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
but

1994
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
platform masters

1995
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
never came out it was never finished but like

1996
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
the proof of concept for platform masters

1997
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
basically was the game like it

1998
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I feel like we got a full idea of what it was

1999
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
just from the trailers in which you are

2000
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
just a little man's

2001
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
and you run really fast and you jump really high

2002
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
and there's extremely scientifically

2003
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
accurate parallax scrolling in the background

2004
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
that's what platform masters was

2005
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
this one I don't know what it is

2006
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I hope it's something different

2007
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
also I hope it gets done

2008
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I hope it becomes real one day

2009
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I mean having

2010
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
scientifically accurate parallax is the most

2011
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
important aspect of the video game

2012
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
that was the thing that he was the most

2013
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
interested about like in the videos where he talked

2014
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
about the game he was making the thing that he

2015
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
focused on the most was how he had calculated

2016
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
the precise distances of the background

2017
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
elements and he was like yes

2018
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
they scroll at the precisely

2019
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
scientifically accurate speeds

2020
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
there was one where you were on Mars

2021
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
there was one where you were on Mars

2022
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
and you could see Earth

2023
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
in the sky and he was like

2024
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
yeah Earth moves

2025
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
at the accurate like

2026
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
if you run like thousands

2027
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
of miles an hour you will see the Earth move

2028
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
in the sky like a tiny

2029
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
like one pixel yeah

2030
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
barely at all but it does move

2031
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I mean

2032
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
like the people at NASA

2033
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
who you know created

2034
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
the big dome over the sky

2035
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
they should have factored that in they should have used his math

2036
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
because you know we can see through

2037
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
their lies

2038
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
we know the planets are fake

2039
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
they're not real

2040
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
there's um

2041
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
have you played Lisa

2042
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
um Lisa

2043
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
the painful

2044
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I know of it I've seen

2045
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
a video on it

2046
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
there is a part

2047
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
in Lisa

2048
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
you know the game is set

2049
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
in this town of Olaf

2050
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
and it's like a

2051
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
post apocalypse but it's not clear if like

2052
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
the entire world

2053
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
is in an apocalypse or if it's just

2054
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Olaf like if Olaf is just like

2055
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
somehow separated

2056
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
from the world because you never hear

2057
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
anything from outside you can never leave it

2058
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
um

2059
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
there's a secret area in one

2060
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
section

2061
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
you have to jump down a

2062
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
a cliff in a spot that you wouldn't

2063
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
think you would want to jump down but it's a secret

2064
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and the hint

2065
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
of how to do it the hint for where

2066
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
it is is that in the sky there are clouds

2067
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
and this one cloud

2068
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
is like tilt it's like tilted at an angle

2069
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
and if you and that's

2070
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
where it's like I guess it's maybe

2071
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
supposed to be like pointing down

2072
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
but it also makes me think like

2073
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
the edge of the world is this like

2074
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
is this like the sky dome

2075
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
that I'm seeing

2076
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
it's heading towards the ground at like a 45

2077
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
degree angle here and that's why the clouds

2078
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
are like that are painted on clearly

2079
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
yeah yeah yeah

2080
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
and it's like

2081
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
is this the dome

2082
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
is this the dome of the sky

2083
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
is this uh

2084
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
is Olaf just under like

2085
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
is it like a Truman show

2086
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I was about to say this is season 2 of the Truman show clearly

2087
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
yeah I'm not sure

2088
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I'm not sure if that's the implication

2089
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
of like the the angled cloud

2090
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
or if it's just like

2091
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
just a visual hint

2092
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
about the video game and I shouldn't even

2093
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
read more into it

2094
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
it's it's it's uh it's possible

2095
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
um

2096
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
uh bup bup bup uh man Lisa's so fucking good

2097
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
what a what a good ass video game

2098
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
funnily I funnily I played

2099
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
video games you know

2100
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
wait I hope I didn't delete this image

2101
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
um there's a

2102
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I think the other night um

2103
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
my husband and a couple of my friends were

2104
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
looking at a website that like

2105
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
looks at how many hours you've spent on steam

2106
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
and how much money you've spent on steam games

2107
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
and

2108
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
it was it was uh

2109
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'll link it

2110
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
if you want to fuck with that stuff

2111
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
uh sure

2112
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
let's see where I put the link

2113
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I don't I don't I don't spend that much money on

2114
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
sometimes I will go on steam

2115
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
every like one year or so

2116
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I might go on steam

2117
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and buy a bunch of like uh

2118
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
a bunch of like the cheapest games

2119
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I can find things that are on sale

2120
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
and stuff for like a few dollars each

2121
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
so I probably haven't spent

2122
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
more than maybe like a hundred or something

2123
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
dollars on steam in like my entire life

2124
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
maybe two hundred I don't know

2125
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I've really ever put money into steam

2126
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
but like

2127
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
what I'm uh proud of I think

2128
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I may not have put the correct link in there

2129
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
um

2130
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
it says private

2131
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
yeah I took a screenshot of the important part

2132
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
um so

2133
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
well let me see it it's all private

2134
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
yeah I mean you can you I linked it

2135
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
mainly so that you could input your

2136
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
your stuff if you want to

2137
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
oh I see I see

2138
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I set my profile to private afterwards

2139
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
but

2140
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
yeah so apparently the total hours I've put into steam

2141
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
in history is like

2142
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
1882

2143
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
does that include like time spent playing games

2144
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I think that's I think that's just like

2145
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
game time it just looks at all the game time

2146
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
you have on all your games and adds it together

2147
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I have spent I have spent like eight hundred hours

2148
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
playing Noida just just playing

2149
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Noida so

2150
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
damn

2151
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I'm embarrassed to admit that

2152
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Noida is a good game though

2153
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
it is a good game and I like it a lot

2154
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
but when I think about like

2155
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
what else could I have done with those

2156
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I mean I guess it would I mean I guess

2157
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
it was 2020 quarantine like I think that's

2158
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
part of why I put so much into it

2159
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I mean you could have played a Minecraft

2160
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
of all those hours I could have been playing

2161
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Minecraft that whole time yeah

2162
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I could have been playing on the PCP Minecraft

2163
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
server at patreon.com

2164
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
the procrastinators to get access

2165
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
to the Minecraft server which

2166
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
we should do another we should do another shekels

2167
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
for heckles this week we didn't do one last week

2168
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
yeah

2169
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
the thing I'm proud of with this

2170
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
is in

2171
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
2019 September so like about two years

2172
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
ago they started calculating

2173
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
hours per platform

2174
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
so what this means

2175
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
is it says the amount of time I spent in windows is

2176
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
27 hours what that means is I've

2177
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
only spent 27 hours playing games

2178
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
in the last two years which is

2179
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
cool I've been playing a lot less

2180
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
games because I've been doing a lot more

2181
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
work 27 hours and

2182
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
that's nothing that's nothing at all

2183
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
it is nothing and I think

2184
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
you're not even a gamer

2185
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I think half of that is among us

2186
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
no wonder you haven't been invited onto the gamer zone

2187
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
exactly you know

2188
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
having more subscribers than they

2189
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
not good enough I have to be a gamer

2190
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
oh yeah

2191
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
you've

2192
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
he's at like 100

2193
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
he's 114

2194
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
he's 114 I'm 116

2195
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
congratulations

2196
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
did you have like a recent bump

2197
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I had a bump

2198
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
the come video last year but I talked on

2199
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
when I was on the podcast one year ago

2200
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
yeah yeah yeah

2201
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I was hoping to have a sequel out by now

2202
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
but work's been fucking me up

2203
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I've had barely any time to animate anything

2204
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
except for the last week where I've been

2205
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
animating again including during this podcast

2206
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I have been

2207
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I have been tragically

2208
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
tragically pulled away from my

2209
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
work on my game

2210
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
to do the lord of ghosts

2211
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
a bonus comic

2212
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
for the lord of ghosts book

2213
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
and

2214
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
it is

2215
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
it's really big

2216
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
frankly it's nine pages

2217
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I've spent the last two days just

2218
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
drawing this one page

2219
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
and it's like

2220
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I would say it qualifies as like slavery

2221
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
wages

2222
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
the amount I'm being paid to do it is frankly

2223
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I'm putting way more time into it

2224
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
than I

2225
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
have been compensated for

2226
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
that's my choice

2227
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
that was me when I was for

2228
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
PCP editor basically

2229
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
yeah it was

2230
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
and you put

2231
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
what am I trying to say

2232
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
you went over and above

2233
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
in terms of editing

2234
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
so hard that you were like I can't do it anymore

2235
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
and it's like well you don't have to

2236
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
go so hard

2237
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
you don't have to make every editing a masterpiece

2238
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
and you were like no I have

2239
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I'm afraid there's no room to compromise on that

2240
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
it will either be a masterpiece

2241
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
or it will be nothing

2242
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
goodbye

2243
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
that's how I roll

2244
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I am incapable of like

2245
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
it's passable

2246
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
the PCP

2247
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
this podcast

2248
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
was very helpful for me

2249
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
because I used to be even worse

2250
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
if you can imagine

2251
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
the thing about

2252
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
PCP

2253
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
in terms of my perfectionism

2254
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
and not being able to let things go

2255
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and settle for good enough

2256
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
because

2257
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
my main skill is

2258
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I'm really really good at polishing things

2259
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
making them really smooth

2260
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
making them really shiny

2261
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
the problem is sometimes I start out

2262
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
with an idea that isn't that great

2263
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
but I can polish it to where it looks shiny

2264
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
and people like it

2265
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
watching the PCPvo

2266
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
it's like long before the PCP

2267
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I was watching

2268
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I was watching Tom's shit

2269
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
in like 2013

2270
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
like pony stuff

2271
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
yeah your pony videos

2272
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
actually recently 2013

2273
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
yeah with the candlelight wedding video

2274
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
that Tom did with

2275
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
was that 2013

2276
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
yeah the video that Tom did with Anthony C

2277
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
for a candlelight wedding

2278
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I remember that video

2279
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
wait what

2280
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
2015

2281
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
couldn't it be in 2015

2282
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
because season 4 was started

2283
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
late 2013 I think you're about a year off Ben

2284
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Jesus

2285
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
okay alright

2286
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I know your history better than you

2287
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
it seems

2288
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
yeah the first t-bap episode was December

2289
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
2014

2290
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
wow okay

2291
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I thought it was like 2015

2292
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
yeah okay

2293
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I remember it was in December

2294
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
so okay

2295
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I guess you're right

2296
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
damn yeah I for sure remember that

2297
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
candlelight wedding video it's probably been deleted

2298
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
right it's probably like not up anymore

2299
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
because didn't Tom like scrub all his pony videos

2300
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
coward

2301
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
it's on Anthony C's channel

2302
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
so it's still up

2303
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Anthony C

2304
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Anthony C is a cool guy

2305
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Anthony C

2306
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
he commented on the last video

2307
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
he commented on the last video wanting to see

2308
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Cassie's drawing

2309
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
because someone had commissioned Cassie to draw

2310
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
a bunch of brony

2311
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
people

2312
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
and he commented like where can I see it

2313
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
and I don't know

2314
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I also have not seen it

2315
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
someone

2316
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
send Anthony C

2317
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
that picture if you know

2318
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
where it is I guess

2319
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I suppose

2320
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
you suppose well you don't think so

2321
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
you don't think they should

2322
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
if they know where it is

2323
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
the man wants to see the

2324
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
damn drawing

2325
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
save him

2326
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
okay

2327
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I was watching all you guys

2328
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
pretty early on

2329
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
and you guys were the fucking best

2330
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
in the analysis sphere

2331
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
that was obvious

2332
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
everyone was shit except you guys

2333
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I think that's true

2334
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I think that is true

2335
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I'm glad

2336
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
a lot of very annoying

2337
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
personalities in that community

2338
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I was looking at a time lapse video

2339
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I think this

2340
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
it was for the art telephone thing in the draw cast

2341
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
talking about how are we going to edit the time lapse footage

2342
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I'm so sorry

2343
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
are you going to be editing at all

2344
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
it's fine I've edited time lapses before

2345
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
so I looked at an old time lapse I had done

2346
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
to see how many hours it was

2347
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
because I used to time lapse my pony animations

2348
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
one of them

2349
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
when you say time lapse

2350
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
you mean like a show your work

2351
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
kind of

2352
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
it's a 7 minute video with

2353
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
60 hours of OBS

2354
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
recording my screen while I animate

2355
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
gotcha

2356
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
while I was looking this over

2357
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
in the corner because I had one monitor

2358
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I was watching fucking t-bat videos

2359
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
exactly what time stamp it is

2360
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I went into

2361
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I just talked about this

2362
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
on my Patreon

2363
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
my Q&A

2364
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I call it a Q&A

2365
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
it is a Q&A people ask me questions

2366
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
but it's more of just like a what have I been up to

2367
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
in behind the scenes

2368
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
just my personal stuff

2369
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
talk about shit

2370
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
podcasting on my

2371
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
patreon.com I talked about this a bit

2372
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
more

2373
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
but I will just say I've been thinking about

2374
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I've been thinking about making a video

2375
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
about Phantom Horn

2376
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
called thoroughly analyzing Phantom Horn

2377
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I think I might make that video

2378
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
after Phantom's Revenge is done

2379
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
and just kind of

2380
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
talk about

2381
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
the character

2382
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
and the ideas behind

2383
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
the ideas he was supposed to embody

2384
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
and how he succeeded

2385
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
and how he failed at that and his whole arc

2386
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
and like what

2387
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I don't know

2388
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I love Phantom Horn

2389
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
for being racist

2390
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
he's totally racist

2391
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
it's really cool

2392
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
he's so racist

2393
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
but he's um

2394
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I don't

2395
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I don't know if I want to get into it

2396
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I have a lot to say

2397
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I have a lot to say about like

2398
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
what his deal is

2399
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and what people might have

2400
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
thought his deal

2401
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
and what I thought his deal was

2402
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
because I don't think I fully understood

2403
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
some of the ideas

2404
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I was trying to communicate with Phantom Horn

2405
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
in the beginning I think

2406
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
now I can kind of look back and be like

2407
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
this is what I was trying to do with him

2408
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
but at the time I was like

2409
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
kind of like didn't have the

2410
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
vocabulary I think

2411
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
because Phantom's flaw

2412
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Phantom's fatal flaw is not that he is like

2413
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
an SJW

2414
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
like a lot of the jokes about him

2415
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
in his videos are like

2416
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
he's such like a tumblerina SJW

2417
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
but like really that's not

2418
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
that's not really

2419
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
the

2420
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
the

2421
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
that's over simplification

2422
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
that's like the surface level

2423
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
that's the most surface level

2424
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
critique of Phantom where you could give and there's a lot more to it than that

2425
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I was watching

2426
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I rewatched

2427
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
that one video

2428
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
where we sing

2429
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
where we did the cover of

2430
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
and with

2431
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
with Tommy

2432
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
and Digi Brony

2433
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
and An-Y Pony and all them

2434
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
and I was like

2435
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
you know An-Y?

2436
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I know An-Y I was on his podcast once

2437
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
oh yeah

2438
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I haven't

2439
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
heard from him in forever and ever

2440
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
but that's okay

2441
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
yeah anyway

2442
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I just watched that and I was like some of these

2443
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
what was these jokes about Phantom Horn

2444
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
are weird the whole

2445
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
the whole joke here is like is bizarre

2446
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
and I wouldn't write this today

2447
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
um

2448
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
anyway

2449
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
he's a good boy

2450
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I wonder if I've seen that video

2451
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
is it on the t-bap channel or is it on someone else's channel

2452
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
yeah it's on the t-bap channel

2453
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I think it's um

2454
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I think it's part of the cutie mark kerfuffle

2455
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
series there was gonna be

2456
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
two there were gonna be

2457
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
three parts

2458
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
to the cutie mark kerfuffle

2459
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
and it was a

2460
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
it was

2461
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I think it was a

2462
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
we just made a song parody

2463
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
and then I think later we decided to turn it into a series

2464
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
and then later we decided

2465
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I guess we'll call it the cutie mark kerfuffle series

2466
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and it's three videos

2467
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
it's when we all got our fucking cutie marks

2468
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
swapped around

2469
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
and it's just each one is just a song parody

2470
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
but the third one we kind of just didn't make

2471
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
it's not like somebody made the song

2472
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and I think it's Jesse rapping

2473
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I think it's a Jesse like rap

2474
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
and there's no like animation to

2475
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
there's I drew one image that kind of

2476
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
communicates the story of what's going on

2477
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
it's it's when um

2478
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
yeah I think it's Anthony C

2479
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and Jess and and starboard bow

2480
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
become alicorn princesses

2481
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I think that's what happens in that one

2482
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
uh

2483
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
but it never got posted

2484
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
no it got posted it just

2485
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
there was just an image

2486
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
uh the song is there

2487
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I think I think this I think that

2488
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
video that I was just talking about the one where we sing

2489
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
the song we sing a true true friend

2490
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
I think it ends with a little teaser where

2491
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
like Anthony C and Jesse become

2492
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
alicorn princesses

2493
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I see it

2494
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
wait no wait no everyone's an alicorn

2495
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
were we

2496
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
yeah I'm looking at it

2497
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
everyone's an alicorn

2498
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
except you because

2499
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
it's a real horn

2500
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
oh yeah

2501
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
who says that the toilet paper

2502
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
isn't a real horn it's as real as anyone

2503
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
else's it can magically

2504
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
wipe your ass that's the one thing it's good for

2505
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
t-bap

2506
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
the lost chapters and there's like

2507
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
what is the secret of mana fucking like

2508
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
text scroll

2509
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I don't even remember this why is it like this

2510
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I actually don't think I've seen this

2511
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I guess I sort of

2512
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
the secret of mana text scroll

2513
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
there's not that much to explain

2514
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I guess there is actually

2515
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I guess there is

2516
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I think I think the text

2517
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
scroll is just like it explains

2518
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
like what would have happened in between

2519
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
like the last video

2520
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
and this song

2521
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I think it's just like here's the context folks

2522
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
enjoy

2523
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I forgot about this

2524
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
um

2525
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
this reminds me of

2526
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
we were gonna we had we had one other song

2527
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
we had another t-bap video we wanted to

2528
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
make at the time it was gonna be

2529
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
it was gonna be like it was gonna be a keg and phantom

2530
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
sort of like backstory

2531
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
video just like a song about

2532
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
them and like what their family is like

2533
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
and it was gonna be the introduction of

2534
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
you see their parents

2535
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
in briefly in the flashback

2536
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
in phantom reviews heartswarming you

2537
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
this was gonna be one where they

2538
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
sing just kind of about their

2539
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
themselves it would be set to raise

2540
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
these barn raise this barn but it was

2541
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
gonna be raise these bros and it was

2542
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
gonna be about like how much

2543
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
they annoy their dad

2544
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
uh it was gonna be great

2545
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I think we I think

2546
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I

2547
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I think we recorded the song actually

2548
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I think Nate wrote the lyrics and I think

2549
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
we recorded the song

2550
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
but we never actually got around I drew

2551
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
some some images for it

2552
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
we just never made it

2553
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
never finished I say I started

2554
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
sketching it

2555
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
that was that was gonna be a good video

2556
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
that was gonna be a good video but at the time the time has passed

2557
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
it's like there's there's no need

2558
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
anymore but still sometimes I think

2559
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
about it like I would have been good

2560
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
you know what I mean

2561
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I suppose yeah I have

2562
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I've got a bunch of videos that like

2563
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I wanted to make when I was in

2564
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
that community but I never got around to

2565
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
honestly that that feeling

2566
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
is kind of like dangerous

2567
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
because it's what

2568
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
prevented me from making a Five Nights

2569
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
at Freddy's parody when that was like new

2570
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
it's what prevented me from like jumping

2571
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
on a bunch of stuff that was like

2572
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
hot and fresh because I'm like no I gotta finish

2573
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
this pony animation first

2574
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
and then you know

2575
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I missed my chance

2576
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
which

2577
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
oh god

2578
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
fuck my back

2579
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
it's a little painful

2580
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
wait which what what attitude

2581
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
is dangerous what what do you mean

2582
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
the the oh like

2583
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
for me like I had

2584
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
all these like pony ideas like ideas for

2585
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
pony animations that I was like attached to and I wanted

2586
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
to make all of them

2587
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
and as a result I ended up like

2588
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
turning away like opportunities

2589
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
to do things that could have

2590
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
been way more profitable and successful

2591
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
because when a fandom is new

2592
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
like making an animation

2593
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
even if it is complete dog shit

2594
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
quality it'll get like five million views

2595
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
it doesn't matter

2596
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
people will just watch it

2597
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
and like it

2598
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
and I should have like

2599
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
you know when Five Nights at Freddy's

2600
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
was a new thing I had a few ideas for

2601
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Five Nights at Freddy's animations but I want to finish

2602
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
my pony animations first

2603
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
which took like a year

2604
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
which which sucks by the time I was

2605
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
done like like Five Nights at Freddy's

2606
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
was already so big and like it was

2607
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
like too late they were already tons and tons

2608
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
of fan animations exactly it was too late

2609
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
to jump in and then the standard had risen

2610
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
and it's not like I was going I was planning

2611
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
on making like a lazy piece of shit

2612
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I would have still made it look good

2613
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
but of course it's you

2614
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I

2615
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
fucked up and there's been so many points

2616
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
in my life where I had an opportunity

2617
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
to do something and I just mucked around

2618
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
finishing old things that ended up not

2619
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
being successful and then missing

2620
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
you know the train to something bigger

2621
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
which is what I'm trying not to do now

2622
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
by capitalizing on a meme

2623
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
immediately when it's popular

2624
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
instead of waiting around which is what

2625
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I'm doing right now

2626
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
it's what I've been animating during this call

2627
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
which I can't share

2628
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
you can't

2629
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
not with the public

2630
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I mean you can look at it and you can

2631
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
ooh and ah oh yeah please

2632
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
discord says

2633
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Ben St. has requested discord

2634
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
block messages that

2635
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
a robot seemed to be explicit Ben

2636
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
you're a prude I didn't know

2637
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000

2638
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000

2641
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
language advanced

2642
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
voice and video accessibility

2643
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
it's

2644
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I forget the setting that like

2645
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
prevents people from sending you porn

2646
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
privacy and safety sounds right

2647
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
privacy and safety sounds right

2648
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
allow access to

2649
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
NSFW servers on iOS

2650
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
no that's not it

2651
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000

discord

2653

there you go

2665
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
that's what I've been animating by the way

2666
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
wait

2667
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
well I like it

2668
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I like what I'm seeing here

2669
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I don't know if I know who this

2670
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
is

2671
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
that's my character from the cum zone

2672
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
video doing the

2673
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
the Anka

2674
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Animal Crossing porn dance meme

2675
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
thing

2676
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
oh I'm not familiar with that

2677
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I know Anka

2678
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
okay

2679
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
there was zone did an animation

2680
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
of Anka from Animal Crossing

2681
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
doing a big sex

2682
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
that was like inspired

2683
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
by like an old minus 8 animation

2684
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
and it's

2685
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
people cropped the sex

2686
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and like so that way you couldn't see

2687
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
the big dick going into her cat pussy

2688
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
basically

2689
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
and people thought oh she's dancing

2690
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
and they turned it into a tiktok dance

2691
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
not knowing that it was sex

2692
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
which is fun I mean it's hardly

2693
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
even a dance

2694
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
it is hardly a dance

2695
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
but it's an easy to animate loop

2696
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
so I'm just fucking going for

2697
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
a remix for song and everything

2698
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
my patrons can see this shit

2699
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
early but you guys

2700
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
listening to a ptp you can't

2701
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I get it for free

2702
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
yeah Ben gets it for free

2703
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
as you know we charge all

2704
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
of our guests to be on the show

2705
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
so this will come out of

2706
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I will reduce your

2707
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
appearance fee

2708
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
by

2709
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I don't know

2710
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Ben saying the inventor of patreon

2711
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
gets all patreon rewards for free

2712
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
it's just one of the perks

2713
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
of being an innovator

2714
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
the

2715
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
where you were just describing

2716
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
alright I'm gonna air

2717
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
my personal fear

2718
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
my fear and terror and dread

2719
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
what you were just describing

2720
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
about like the

2721
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
getting caught in like oh I gotta finish my thing

2722
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I gotta finish my thing

2723
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
but then I can't do

2724
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
some other thing that might be more

2725
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
that's just like my whole life

2726
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
that's just my whole life is just

2727
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I gotta finish this old thing

2728
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
that's like

2729
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
nobody cares I mean I've been working on this

2730
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
fucking phantom horn game for almost a year

2731
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
and I know that it's not

2732
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
like

2733
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
it's not attached

2734
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
to anything

2735
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I know that it's

2736
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
based on some old shit that I did

2737
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
that is like

2738
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
why are you still doing this

2739
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
but like I can't that's what I like about it

2740
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
it's like yeah it's got no

2741
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
it's not

2742
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
it's not gonna hit big or anything

2743
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
it can't

2744
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
but I just want to

2745
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I don't know

2746
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
fuck it

2747
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
but I

2748
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I guess the stallus I can take

2749
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
is that I know that

2750
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I am wasting my time

2751
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
doing some nonsense that

2752
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
will not succeed

2753
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
or benefit me in any way

2754
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
will not pay dividends

2755
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
but on the other hand

2756
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I'm not actually losing anything

2757
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
because if I wasn't doing that

2758
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
it's not like I would be making good choices

2759
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
it's not like I would be doing something that was useful

2760
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I would just be wasting my time

2761
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
even worse

2762
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I guess you can take comfort in that

2763
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
absolutely

2764
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
pass up some good ideas

2765
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
like fuck

2766
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
not me

2767
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I wanted to like in 2016

2768
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I was like you know I kind of want to make

2769
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
story time like animator videos

2770
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I feel like I have a lot to say

2771
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
like in that sort of style

2772
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
story time like the

2773
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
lightly animated like draw my life

2774
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
kind of thing

2775
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
like the jaden animations fjord ones out

2776
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
domics if anyone remembers

2777
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
that sort of thing

2778
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
he was like

2779
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
the og he was doing that shit like

2780
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
in 2012 2011 or some shit

2781
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
he was doing it real early

2782
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
but like I had ideas for like

2783
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
videos like that I could make

2784
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
and I was like oh but I've got this project

2785
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
and that project and this project and that project

2786
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
and then I saw like a year later

2787
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
the story time animator scene

2788
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
blew up a bunch of channels

2789
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
just like shut up into the millions of subscribers

2790
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
and then I was like

2791
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
oh it's too late now fuck

2792
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
now the market saturated

2793
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
should have

2794
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
followed my gut instinct

2795
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
perhaps I mean it's the

2796
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
it's the

2797
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
you know I've known people who were like

2798
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I was

2799
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
this close to investing in bitcoin back in like

2800
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
2010 like I almost

2801
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
did it like I thought about doing it

2802
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
it's kind of like

2803
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
that I guess like

2804
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
there was a thing that I thought about doing

2805
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I didn't do it

2806
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
it turned out it would have made

2807
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
it would have been a huge benefit for me

2808
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
if I did but

2809
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
but it didn't so

2810
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I was a fool

2811
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
huh

2812
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
it was foolish

2813
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
sure sure

2814
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I'm not being a fool anymore

2815
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
now I'm like I know porn

2816
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
porn animations

2817
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
pay very well

2818
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
on patreon

2819
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
and

2820
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
like a lot of artists I follow

2821
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I've you know been drawing NSFW

2822
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
art for like less than a year

2823
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
now

2824
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I've been doing it for like 10 months on and off

2825
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
and I don't have a whole

2826
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
lot of followers but I know people with like

2827
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
10 times my follower account who make less than

2828
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
me on patreon

2829
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
like you know you know cake they call

2830
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
him cake big booby

2831
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I do I do know they call him cake

2832
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
150 on patreon

2833
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
really

2834
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
but they're big on twitter

2835
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
they're huge they've got hundreds of thousands of followers but

2836
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
they only get like 150 on patreon

2837
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
why is that

2838
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
it's a combination of

2839
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
not like

2840
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I think for one they don't draw like explicit stuff

2841
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
really but also

2842
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
they don't have

2843
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
paywall content that I'm aware of

2844
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
oh well yeah

2845
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I guess that makes sense

2846
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
that does like

2847
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
you know that does make a huge difference

2848
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
and also

2849
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
like people who do animations

2850
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
like porn animations just make like double or

2851
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
triple most artists anyway

2852
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
on average

2853
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
so whoa

2854
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
what is this?

2855
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
hi

2856
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
are you recording?

2857
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
did I be late?

2858
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
yeah

2859
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
wow

2860
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
how interesting

2861
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
are you recording?

2862
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
okay

2863
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
you're just in time we just started talking about boobs

2864
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
like

2865
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
sort of

2866
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
sort of

2867
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
drawing over that

2868
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
drawing over that now

2869
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
what?

2870
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
what?

2871
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
hey guys welcome to the pro crest news podcast

2872
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
show's over

2873
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
goodbye

2874
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
don't listen to Ben

2875
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
he's a liar

2876
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I'm sorry I lost track of the conversation

2877
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
you guys are gonna have to carry it for me

2878
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
well I was just talking about

2879
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
porn artists

2880
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
and porn animators and how

2881
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
being a porn animator makes you lots of money on patreon if you

2882
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
do it right

2883
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I have a big old audience on my youtube channel

2884
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
so what I need to do

2885
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
is make

2886
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
porn animations that are like

2887
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
covered up in youtube

2888
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
save and then have

2889
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
the naughty versions on patreon

2890
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I've seen people do that

2891
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
they've jumped from like

2892
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
1,000 a month to like 10-20,000 a month

2893
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
doing that

2894
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I've seen a few people do that

2895
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I mean that's what Mary does

2896
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
or I don't know if he does it anymore

2897
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
he probably does but he would have her

2898
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Mary weather

2899
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
you know him

2900
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
oh yeah yeah

2901
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
the internet explorer

2902
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
comics guy

2903
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
he's also a vtuber now

2904
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
yeah you have them on the pcpr number

2905
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
yes they do

2906
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
yeah they would have like a comic going

2907
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
and then they would have you know

2908
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
if you were a patreon supporter you could get the

2909
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
the explicit version

2910
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
not the explicit version

2911
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
but like an extra panel sometimes

2912
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
or just like official art

2913
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
of the NSFW art of the character

2914
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
they have only

2915
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
90 patrons

2916
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
interestingly

2917
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
at the highest here

2918
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
25 which

2919
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
that would only be like 2,000 dollars

2920
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
it's actually

2921
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
it's probably a lot lower than that

2922
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
wait Mary weather only has 90 patrons

2923
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
yeah Mary weather comics only has 90 patrons

2924
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
so assuming everyone's a 25 dollar patron

2925
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
which is unlikely that they'd only be getting 2,000

2926
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
that's less than I expected

2927
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
wait a second I'm like

2928
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
what

2929
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
okay I was sure

2930
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I feel like

2931
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
it was like 10,000 a month at some point

2932
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
maybe

2933
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
am I crazy hold on

2934
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
maybe you're crazy

2935
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
also

2936
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
I just logged into patreon I have 18 notifications

2937
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
this never happens

2938
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I usually have one or two what the fuck happened

2939
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
why do I have it I'm scared is that everyone

2940
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
on pledge or did I gain like 20 pledges

2941
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
have you been putting stuff out

2942
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I've been putting stuff out

2943
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
oh

2944
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
someone went through and liked all of my posts

2945
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
oh

2946
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
what an asshole

2947
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
what an asshole

2948
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
thank you

2949
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
this could have been about money

2950
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
okay so yeah I got 16 likes

2951
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
on a bunch of patreon posts

2952
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
and then two people pledged okay

2953
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
alright

2954
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I was like today's

2955
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
did something happen

2956
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
okay that's cool

2957
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
some

2958
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
part of me thinks you should take

2959
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
yourself all more seriously Gib

2960
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
you should maybe try

2961
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
to like

2962
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
have a product that people can get excited for

2963
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
on patreon.com

2964
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
gib and take slash patreon

2965
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
and I don't do it

2966
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
but I could

2967
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
the porn stuff I'm not really like good yet

2968
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
at like

2969
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
anatomy because that's the most important

2970
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
well not really

2971
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
not really the most important but it's very

2972
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
very helpful for like actually

2973
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
communicating

2974
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
a specific look

2975
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I mean people can get away with like

2976
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
drawing the same thing 100 million times

2977
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
exactly the same every time

2978
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
and if people like it

2979
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
then that'll work

2980
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
but I get bored

2981
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I get bored too easily

2982
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I have a couple

2983
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I have a couple that put patreon notifications

2984
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
oh my god oh two people pledged to me

2985
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
oh wow

2986
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
three people pledged to me

2987
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I lost a few patreons at the beginning of the month

2988
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
but a couple new ones too

2989
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
so thank you Jacob and Airlock and Roger

2990
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I'll tell a few people that

2991
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
unpatron okay

2992
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
okay thank you yeah the balance

2993
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
the balance must remain

2994
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
the light

2995
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
and the dark rises to meet it

2996
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
there must always be a Sith for a Jedi

2997
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
fuck oh okay

2998
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I gotta look at Merryweather's grafter on history

2999
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
because I'm sure they were making more than that

3000
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I gotta look this up

3001
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
okay

3002
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
but yeah like my twitter

3003
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
a big girl squish

3004
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
which I've mentioned before

3005
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
is like oh that's the porn one

3006
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
where I post

3007
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
not even that much porn

3008
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I have these characters

3009
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
who are like oh cool

3010
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
sex and stuff

3011
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
but I've not really done anything with that twitter

3012
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I very occasionally have a drawing

3013
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
and I put it there

3014
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
and uh

3015
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
it's really

3016
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
it's like I'm treating it too much

3017
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
like a hobby but maybe it is just a hobby

3018
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
there's a lot of pressure

3019
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
just from all sides and constantly

3020
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
to make everything you do content

3021
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
can't waste content

3022
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I can't waste it

3023
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
what if I could make a

3024
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I don't know

3025
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
some sort of an established following

3026
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
of people who know what I do

3027
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
and I could do commissions or something

3028
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
ah jeez

3029
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
sheesh

3030
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
okay I can't find

3031
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Merryweather on grafteron

3032
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
yeah I can't find them either

3033
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I'm finding a

3034
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
someone who looks like a stripper

3035
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
there's a deleted patreon

3036
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
for someone called stormy merryweather

3037
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
who is a porn star

3038
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
um

3039
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I've never encountered this before

3040
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
I just can't find their grafteron

3041
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
weird

3042
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I use grafteron for the first time

3043
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
yesterday so it's funny you bring it up

3044
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I use grafteron to watch Trixie's

3045
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
patron, patreon collapse

3046
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
month

3047
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I use it to

3048
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I use it to check over

3049
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
a few like fellow porn

3050
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
animators to see like

3051
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
at what time their patron jumped up

3052
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I'm doing similar things

3053
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
to some of them and I'm just trying to figure out

3054
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
how beneficial

3055
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
it'll be for me

3056
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I only need to earn like 2k

3057
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
and I can quit my job and then like make

3058
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
probably about five times as much porn

3059
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
as I am now

3060
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
that would be cool

3061
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I've seen behind the scenes bits

3062
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
of you drawing stuff

3063
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
and I've also seen the public stuff

3064
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
it is good drawings

3065
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
wait no

3066
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I make more than you on patreon

3067
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
if you start

3068
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
making porn animations

3069
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
you might pass me

3070
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
and I don't want that so

3071
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I have to stop you at any cost

3072
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
we can't release this episode

3073
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
but if I surpass you

3074
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
you have to delete your patreon in shame

3075
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
that's for rules

3076
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
what if I

3077
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
what if I

3078
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
okay

3079
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
what if I patron you now

3080
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
but if you pass me in patreon

3081
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
you have to patron me

3082
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I say this knowing that you definitely will

3083
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
your plan is full proof

3084
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
and it definitely will work

3085
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
so I'm gonna have to like how can I negotiate you

3086
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
into an unlinable deal

3087
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
here's the thing Ben

3088
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
that is actually the moral thing to do

3089
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
if your friend is earning way more than you on patreon

3090
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
it's foolish for you to pledge the same amount

3091
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
to both pledge each other at the same time

3092
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
because you're just exchanging the same coin

3093
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
and patreon's taking a cut

3094
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
only the bigger person should pledge to the smaller person

3095
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
I feel like that is

3096
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
what should happen also

3097
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
even if I like someone's content

3098
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I generally don't pledge to them

3099
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
if they make more than me

3100
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
because like why

3101
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
you're doing fine

3102
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I say that yet I still pledge teleperte on occasion

3103
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
even though we're friends

3104
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I might

3105
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
he does just give me his shit for free

3106
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
yeah

3107
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
who am I a patron of

3108
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I am a patron of

3109
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I think I pledged to you Gib

3110
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I think I pledged to

3111
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
for a while I was a patron of Japanese emoticons.com

3112
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
just because I used it all the time

3113
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I pledged them $1 a month

3114
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
and then I was like why am I still doing this

3115
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
my creators

3116
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
literally where do I

3117
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
find who I'm pledged to

3118
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I can't fucking find it

3119
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
oh there's more tears on

3120
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Mary with this thing

3121
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
oh there are more tears

3122
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
oh there's five levels

3123
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
oh I didn't see that

3124
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
oh wait I still support DeVoo

3125
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I don't know why

3126
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
okay DeVoo changed their thing

3127
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I pledged a dollar to DeVoo

3128
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
but it was per game

3129
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
now it has changed to per month

3130
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
and I think I'm gonna unplug

3131
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
cause I don't want to do that

3132
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
oh live on the PCP Ben

3133
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I think I'm gonna unplug DeVoo

3134
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
yeah I'm gonna do it

3135
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
just stab in the back

3136
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
well I mean it's

3137
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
money you do what you want with it

3138
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I will

3139
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I usually like to

3140
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
like for Autominus

3141
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
the soundtrack was like the way

3142
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
yeah

3143
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
so I bought that and that was good

3144
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
oh I'm a ShadOx

3145
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
patron I'm a pledge to ShadOx

3146
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
after the RFCK animation

3147
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I was like I didn't mean

3148
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I gotta pledge to that

3149
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
gotta pluge

3150
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
gotta pluge

3151
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
ShadOx is only

3152
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
per episode

3153
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
so like god I mean I could

3154
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
for an episode of LoveWeb I feel like

3155
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
it's worth more than $5

3156
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I might increase that

3157
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
per month

3158
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I would be $5

3159
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
but per episode I'm like I should be like

3160
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
$100 per episode honestly

3161
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
that shit

3162
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
that shit is wild

3163
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I'm also pledged to

3164
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I'm pledged to Cheesy Manfredo

3165
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
and I'm pledged to Gabriel the Starman

3166
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
a few dollars a month

3167
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
what's Gabriel's

3168
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
is that a twitch thing

3169
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
do you know them?

3170
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
yeah Gabriel from RFCK

3171
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
and also just in general

3172
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I saw them at Brighton

3173
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I mean they're an artist

3174
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
although I can't

3175
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I don't know if they've posted anything

3176
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I'm not sure if they

3177
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
they take their Patreon down

3178
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I mean I haven't

3179
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I haven't seen them draw in a while

3180
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
but they have been like streaming with a funny

3181
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
monkey vtuber

3182
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
oh I haven't seen that

3183
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
they made a Patreon a while ago and I pledged to it

3184
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
that might be a secret

3185
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I haven't said that

3186
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
oh dear

3187
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
never mind

3188
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I didn't say exactly what it was

3189
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
I think they may have

3190
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
taken their Patreon page down

3191
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
but I'm still pledged to them

3192
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
maybe I should try

3193
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Patreon's just stealing it

3194
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
stealing it all

3195
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
that would be unfortunate

3196
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
but that is something they would do

3197
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
well this has been

3198
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
a revelation

3199
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
for me this has been

3200
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I've learned some things that I

3201
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
feel damaged

3202
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
to know

3203
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
wow

3204
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
a loveless episode of

3205
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
the money cast

3206
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
bonus next bonus

3207
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
idea for the bonus episode

3208
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
we just watch

3209
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
the price of Bitcoin rise and fall in real time

3210
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
and we go oh it went up like 30 cents

3211
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
you have to modulate

3212
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
the pitch of your voice to match the direction

3213
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
it's going oh it's going up

3214
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
oh no

3215
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
oh no the candle's red

3216
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
oh no the candle's red

3217
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
oh my god the hammer's green

3218
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
oh there it goes

3219
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
you know if we had someone

3220
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
smart

3221
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
because I know that data is archived

3222
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
you could have someone run a literal

3223
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
pitch changer

3224
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
in real time that follows the graph

3225
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
we send in our audio

3226
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
and we run through the script

3227
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I have no doubt in my mind that crack could do that

3228
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I have no doubt in my mind

3229
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
that he could create something that

3230
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
dynamically reacts to the market

3231
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
that would be like what makes it worth listening to

3232
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
maybe

3233
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
maybe if you could do it to just Ben's audio

3234
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
and then I would just be there to sigh

3235
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
every so often

3236
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
in normal pitch

3237
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
hey speaking of the bonus episodes

3238
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
let me ask you something

3239
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
what if

3240
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
what if I were to call you

3241
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
how would you feel

3242
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
what if I said

3243
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
hey you know what oblivion fall

3244
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
you're a fucking gay wizard

3245
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
not only that

3246
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
but you're a bottom

3247
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
you're a bottom gay wizard and you probably

3248
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
either are or are friends with

3249
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
at least one sorcerer

3250
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
what would you say to that

3251
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
choose your words carelessly

3252
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
choose your words yes

3253
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
if you have a big penis

3254
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
put it in my ass

3255
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
please

3256
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
oh my god he admit it

3257
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
oh my god he admit it

3258
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
it's just a hypothetical you didn't have to admit it

3259
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
ergy ergy ergy

3260
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
no this I'm using your platform to solicit sex

3261
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
from the audience

3262
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
well shit that's what we're supposed to do

3263
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
you're not allowed to do that

3264
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
well I gotta say

3265
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I gotta say

3266
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
that's not

3267
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
that's not what I was expecting

3268
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I was gonna

3269
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
that's a hell of an answer

3270
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
if you want to understand the ramifications of what just transpired

3271
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
you're gonna have to be a patron

3272
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
and watch the latest bonus episode

3273
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
which should be out by now

3274
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
for context into what the fuck I'm talking about

3275
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
see I designed it like this so there'd be FOMO

3276
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
so people wouldn't get the joke

3277
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
if they don't know

3278
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
FOMO is a moral good

3279
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I can't remember the joke I don't remember

3280
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I can't remember this

3281
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I can't like egg you on

3282
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
with like specifics

3283
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I just know that there's a thing

3284
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
and it's funny

3285
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I remember it but I don't know how to say it

3286
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
if you want that's the only way to know

3287
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I'm gonna keep asking

3288
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
guests until one of them gives the correct answer

3289
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
the correct response

3290
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
to that and see how long it takes

3291
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
give can't egg you on

3292
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
but perhaps give can most of an egg

3293
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
you on

3294
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I'm just gonna say

3295
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
things are not gonna go well

3296
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
things are not gonna go well for you

3297
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
if that's what you have to say

3298
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
about the gay wizard thing

3299
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
wrong answer

3300
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
buzzer

3301
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
that was a terrible attempt at a

3302
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
buzzer sound

3303
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
much better

3304
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
okay do you guys have any

3305
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
any more issues to raise

3306
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I got a thing

3307
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
to talk about

3308
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
so this is October

3309
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
wow

3310
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
clearly

3311
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
oh my god it's spooky season

3312
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
oh my god it's apple pumpkin

3313
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
it's apple pumpkin spice time

3314
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
oh my god

3315
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
sweater weather

3316
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
it's time to get all the cowboy paraphernalia out

3317
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
cause it's wild west month

3318
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
which is why

3319
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I'm getting

3320
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
the Clarissa Gunsmoke comic

3321
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
finally out into the public eye

3322
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
all nice and dolled up

3323
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
and polished

3324
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
and I've been drawing

3325
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
not really like draw

3326
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I've been like touching up a few panels here and there

3327
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
where this line work is really sloppy

3328
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
but mostly just

3329
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
adding like tone

3330
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
to the hair and some other things in the shading

3331
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
so it's like the hot summer

3332
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
sun of the wild west desert

3333
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
beating down and it feels

3334
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
way better than it was

3335
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
before

3336
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
and redoing a lot of the dialogue

3337
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
cause it was cringe before and it sucked

3338
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
of course

3339
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
most importantly I'm reorienting it

3340
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
reorienting it from

3341
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Japanese to western

3342
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
left to right reading

3343
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
which is harder than it

3344
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
looked

3345
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
harder than it feels

3346
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
cause it's like you can't just

3347
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
flip the page because then

3348
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
the panel

3349
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
the panels that you would read

3350
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
would be the wrong way around

3351
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
and like the characters would be looking in the wrong direction

3352
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
if you want like the flow

3353
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
of visual

3354
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
stimulus and the speech bubbles

3355
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
have to shift so that they actually

3356
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
also within a panel

3357
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
are left to right reading

3358
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
but yeah

3359
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
it's a whole lot of stuff

3360
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
the first chapter is gonna be about 20 pages

3361
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
gonna be posted on my website

3362
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
gibandtake.site

3363
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
so if you're gonna put it on twitter

3364
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
it'll be buried in twitter

3365
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
but people will see it and be like

3366
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
oh I guess I go check out the website

3367
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
and yeah

3368
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
that Clarissa Gunsmoke Month

3369
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
finally

3370
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
are you gonna finish

3371
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
the comic like is it gonna get

3372
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
completed?

3373
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I don't expect that

3374
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I will have the time to finish

3375
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
cause

3376
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
there's a lot of stuff that happens

3377
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
after the end of what I had already drawn

3378
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
but there's 50 pages

3379
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
there's enough for three

3380
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
sort of medium-sized chapters

3381
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
and

3382
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I'll think about

3383
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
how I can finish it later

3384
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
but I think as soon as I'm done with that

3385
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I'll be

3386
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
more focused on the Lord of Ghost

3387
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Kickstarter backer reward

3388
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
mailing stuff

3389
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
and then after that I could probably start drawing

3390
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
maybe even go back to

3391
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
streaming the draw streams

3392
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
with those

3393
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I mentioned this before

3394
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
but I have spent

3395
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
the last two days working on

3396
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
this page

3397
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
of the Lord of Ghosts

3398
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
comic that I'm working on

3399
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
it has been

3400
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I accidentally deleted

3401
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
my sketch of it so I had to

3402
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
recreate the sketch and then I have been

3403
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
there's just a lot of layers

3404
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
there's like

3405
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
there's like 50 layers

3406
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
on this

3407
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
one page

3408
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
on one page

3409
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
there's a lot

3410
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
happening in this one

3411
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
it's good

3412
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I'm excited

3413
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
you're gonna like it

3414
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
maybe when you see it

3415
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
you can guess which one

3416
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
God I hope this is the page that takes me the longest

3417
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I'm hoping not the other pages don't take

3418
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
so

3419
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I'm

3420
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
a little sick of looking at it honestly

3421
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I've had enough but

3422
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
it's almost done

3423
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
this is page 4

3424
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
this is page 4 of 9 that I am

3425
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
holy shit

3426
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I know

3427
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
the other ones weren't as bad

3428
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
yeah

3429
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I'll get it done

3430
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
pretty soon

3431
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
we could go to voicemails

3432
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I wanted

3433
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I did want to mention one thing

3434
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
about Clarissa

3435
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
yeah

3436
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
she is a tall sexy woman

3437
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
which is good

3438
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
something I never forgot

3439
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Gib

3440
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I don't know if this is when you first revealed her

3441
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
it was like a post you did with her

3442
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
a long time ago you said she'll root ya

3443
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
to ya then shoot ya

3444
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
which hell yeah

3445
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
the way I imagine that

3446
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
was like

3447
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
moan bark fart but instead it's

3448
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
because root means sex

3449
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
wait

3450
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I don't know if that's it

3451
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
what was the thing you said the moan

3452
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
bark fart

3453
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
you know moan bark fart

3454
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
no

3455
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
no

3456
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
nates mentioned it on the podcast before

3457
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
oh

3458
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
moan boat

3459
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
wait

3460
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
that was a sound thing

3461
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
okay I thought it was like a weird

3462
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
moan bark fart

3463
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
and then you bark

3464
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
this is like a very specific

3465
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
furry sex

3466
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
fetish

3467
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
order of operations

3468
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
it's just an order of sound effects

3469
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
cause root

3470
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
is slang for sex

3471
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
so I figured with calisher

3472
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
it would be moan

3473
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
moan

3474
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
moan for

3475
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
root to shoot

3476
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
yeah I get it

3477
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I need to make an animation of that at some point

3478
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
oh please do

3479
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
that's technically fan art

3480
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
and I love that

3481
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
anyway

3482
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I pog all over the fan art

3483
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
everyone's gonna love this conversation

3484
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
cause the sound effects aren't gonna be in my

3485
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
recording

3486
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
oh so we can hear them

3487
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
but your microphone can't

3488
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
maybe

3489
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I'll make the sound effect for

3490
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Eleazar and he can put it in

3491
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
moan boat

3492
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
that I can't say

3493
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
it's not boat

3494
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
it's bark

3495
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
what does moan boat

3496
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
fart even mean

3497
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
no it's like moan boat

3498
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
I switched

3499
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
some letters

3500
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
to your own boat

3501
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
and you're like

3502
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
oh

3503
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I had to go

3504
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I was too hungry I had to go get some baby bells

3505
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
but I'm back

3506
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
baby bells

3507
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
back and chatter than ever

3508
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
oh cheese

3509
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
yeah cheese

3510
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
the little red

3511
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
wax circles

3512
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
oh the little wheels

3513
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I have had those

3514
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
to go on crackers

3515
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
you should get a greater bell

3516
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
I'm happy to do voicemails

3517
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
if you guys are

3518
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
yeah I guess I didn't really have much to say

3519
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
about the clear so just

3520
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
be excited

3521
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
you idiots and enjoy it

3522
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
so it's going on your website

3523
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
right it's going on gibbentake.site

3524
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
it's gonna go on gibbentake.site

3525
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I guess I could maybe do a webtoon

3526
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
or a tapas or both I don't know

3527
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I don't care about those sites they suck

3528
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I hate them

3529
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
you know what I'll read it

3530
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I'll finally read it

3531
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
oh yeah that's the point

3532
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
that is the point

3533
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I hadn't read it because it was technically

3534
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
complete but like no I'll read it

3535
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
finally when it goes on the website

3536
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
because otherwise I don't want to hunt it down

3537
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
yes

3538
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
that'll yeah

3539
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
it'll be good

3540
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
had you posted it anywhere before

3541
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
it was up on the artstreet.com

3542
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
which is the

3543
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
medibang paint

3544
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
like

3545
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
artist area

3546
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
like a deviant art kind of or a pixiv

3547
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
where you can post comics and illustrations

3548
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
and I put it there

3549
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
uploaded for the contest

3550
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
and then I put like a price tag on it

3551
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
so people could

3552
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
pay 7

3553
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
no 420 yen

3554
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
to see

3555
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
like

3556
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I think the whole thing

3557
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
and there was a preview of a few pages

3558
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
but yeah it's been up

3559
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I think

3560
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
but it's the one

3561
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
that version is going to be

3562
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
outdated it's going to be ruined

3563
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I'll leave it there

3564
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
wait are you doing

3565
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
are you remastering it

3566
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
I'm only remastering it

3567
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
in the sense that I'm

3568
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
making it look good

3569
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
because before

3570
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
the contest was over

3571
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I was like oh shit I don't have time

3572
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
to like make it

3573
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
do shading and stuff

3574
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
because I wanted that

3575
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
and I started for the first 3 pages and I was like

3576
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
nah I don't have time

3577
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
I'm just going to post it

3578
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
and then I just didn't get around to shading it

3579
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
for an entire year and a month

3580
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I see

3581
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
sure

3582
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
okay sick

3583
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
let's do

3584
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
let's do a voicemail

3585
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
here

3586
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
let's do

3587
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
shit where did I

3588
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
it's the 3rd

3589
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
of October

3590
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
and the first

3591
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
voicemail

3592
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
why are these all out of order

3593
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
what the fuck

3594
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
oh I briefly should mention

3595
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I'm doing

3596
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
a voicemail

3597
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I should mention

3598
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I'm doing

3599
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
a whatever tober

3600
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
which is a drawing challenge

3601
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
is what you draw whatever

3602
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
whenever

3603
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
in October it's a really great system

3604
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
because you can't fail

3605
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
perfect

3606
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
why didn't anyone think of this

3607
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I was trying to do prompts

3608
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
prompts annoy me

3609
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
everything is the same

3610
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
oh was it chip chip

3611
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
she was drawing

3612
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
a character in a different status effect

3613
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
affecting them

3614
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I thought that was fun

3615
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I like video games

3616
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
it's neat enough

3617
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
it's the sort of thing that

3618
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
once I see other people doing it

3619
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
why would I do it

3620
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
why would I also do that

3621
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
just do whatever

3622
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I mean sure

3623
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
the first 3 voicemails

3624
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
are not voicemails

3625
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
which relate to me personally

3626
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
in the form of the names of the voicemails

3627
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
the voicemails are called

3628
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Ben Delta Rune

3629
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
literally has the characters jump into

3630
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
one out of question mark

3631
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
and then the second voicemail is called

3632
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
another world and use RPG mechanics

3633
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
to fight enemies

3634
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
2 out of question mark

3635
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
and then the third voicemail is

3636
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
they explain to Noelle

3637
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
how RPG battles work

3638
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
it's isekai

3639
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
so those are the first 3 voicemails

3640
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
they have no content other than the title

3641
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
and I just gotta say

3642
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
yeah I know Delta Rune isn't isekai

3643
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
obviously Delta Rune is

3644
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
like the most obvious isekai

3645
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
veils are

3646
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
isekai purity chart

3647
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
which I will post here

3648
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
that I retweeted on the twitter account

3649
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
yeah that was a good one

3650
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
it is a good one

3651
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Delta Rune is it's like most

3652
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I think it's most pure

3653
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
isekai

3654
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
that is not Japanese I guess

3655
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
the super pure

3656
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
is that it has to be from Japan

3657
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
anime

3658
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
it doesn't have to be from Japan

3659
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
and then the lowest one is

3660
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
it doesn't have to be from any medium in fact

3661
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
or it can be from any medium

3662
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
it doesn't need to be from the heart

3663
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
medium again

3664
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
colonialism isn't isekai

3665
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
tripping on acid isn't isekai

3666
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
true

3667
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
there was this other isekai chart

3668
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
that went up

3669
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
the same day

3670
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
as that PCP episode

3671
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
but they didn't credit the PCP

3672
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
if they ought to be

3673
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
shot in the back of a head

3674
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
they ought to be lambasted

3675
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
they ought to be shot

3676
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
wait was it you

3677
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
I didn't say that

3678
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
YouTube would not support terrorism

3679
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
how did you fucking do this

3680
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I support terrorism

3681
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I once said 9-11 out loud

3682
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
and they killed me for it

3683
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
they shut down my channel

3684
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
wait is this you

3685
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
are you this vtuber

3686
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
no that was just some person

3687
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
no not you

3688
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
wait I thought that

3689
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
I'm not talking to you

3690
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
who are you talking to

3691
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
you you oblivion

3692
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I'm not this vtuber

3693
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
this is just some guy

3694
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
or girl I don't know

3695
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
after the PCP episode went up

3696
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
where you were talking about isekai alignment charts

3697
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
like 10 hours after the episode went live

3698
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
this person posted this chart

3699
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
and didn't credit the PCP

3700
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
how bad of them

3701
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
this is

3702
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
it's not even a good chart which is annoying

3703
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
no I think it's a good chart

3704
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I think the moon landings is a good entry

3705
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
moon landing is pretty good

3706
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
but like I don't know

3707
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
the way

3708
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
just fails is better

3709
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
the descriptions are better

3710
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
the examples are better

3711
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
I actually

3712
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I kind of think the examples are better in this one

3713
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I kind of like

3714
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
like to me

3715
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
there's not enough meaningful difference

3716
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
in the medium rebel

3717
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
row the haley's comment

3718
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
colonialism and tripping on acid

3719
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
are both questionably isekai

3720
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
but they're all in the same way

3721
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
they're all just like a real thing that happened

3722
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
whereas

3723
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
function radical on this one

3724
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
your name kory in the house

3725
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
and entering a taco bell

3726
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
those are all not isekai

3727
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
but they're not isekai in different ways

3728
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
because one is an anime

3729
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
it's just not about going to another world

3730
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
really

3731
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
kory in the house is also not about that

3732
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
but it's a show and then entering a taco bell

3733
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
is just a thing that you do in real life

3734
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
so

3735
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
wait is this like rotated 90 degrees

3736
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
compared to

3737
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
yeah no it is

3738
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
in this one

3739
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
all

3740
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
the form

3741
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
is in the column

3742
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
but then it veils it's like the top row

3743
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
the medium purist

3744
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I guess the axes are different

3745
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
we could dissect this

3746
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
scholars will debate

3747
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
which of these two isekai alignment charts

3748
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
is more

3749
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
is more scientifically

3750
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
accurate

3751
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I kind of prefer the bottom one

3752
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
but I do hold

3753
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
great malice towards them for not

3754
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
crediting the pcp for the idea

3755
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
you know

3756
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
do you actually think that they got it from us

3757
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
I assume

3758
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
unless that

3759
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
could it just be a weird coincidence

3760
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
the discussion in the episode sounded

3761
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
pretty like spontaneous

3762
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
it didn't sound like you were referencing an existing meme

3763
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
unless you were

3764
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I'm just wondering

3765
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
do you think this person actually got the idea

3766
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
or could it just be a weird coincidence

3767
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
it was like 10 hours or so

3768
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
after the episode

3769
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
that would be a pretty big coincidence

3770
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
I would say the myth of Plato's cave

3771
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
in the top 10

3772
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
that's a good one

3773
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
that is a good one

3774
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
that's a good example

3775
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Cory in the house

3776
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
something about Cory in the house being

3777
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
that's a tired meme

3778
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
what is this 2012

3779
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
what is this 2001

3780
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
it works though

3781
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
it does but I don't know

3782
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
I like examples that are

3783
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
not overdone

3784
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
I mean they could have used

3785
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
literally any show

3786
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
about

3787
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
well

3788
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
any show whose premise is about someone goes

3789
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
somewhere which is like most shows

3790
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Golden Girls

3791
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
is an isekai because it's about

3792
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
entering the metaphorically different world of being old

3793
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
it doesn't exist

3794
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
what

3795
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
yes it does exist because Dorothy

3796
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
had chronic fatigue and the doctors told her

3797
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
she was just a dumb woman and she didn't understand what her body was saying

3798
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
and then she told that doctor off in the restaurant

3799
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
and she said he was bad at his job

3800
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
and he should be ashamed of himself

3801
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
being old was invented by like M. Night Shyamalan

3802
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
like less than a month ago

3803
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
it's like what

3804
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
it's like

3805
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Carl Pilkington said why don't they just

3806
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
invent a pill

3807
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
that when you get old instead of dying

3808
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
you just start aging in reverse again

3809
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
until you become a baby and then you disappear

3810
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
why don't they just invent that

3811
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
why haven't they made this happen yet

3812
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
the man's keeping us down

3813
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
the man

3814
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
makes a good point

3815
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I'm looking at the

3816
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
second isekai, sorry I'm still on this

3817
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
like the function

3818
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
purest on the second one

3819
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
isekai is to travel what is a clearly

3820
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
a separate reality and then neutral

3821
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
can be traveled to what can be

3822
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
physically described as another world

3823
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
but then radical is like can be

3824
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
traveled to metaphorically different world

3825
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
are they

3826
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
very similar those

3827
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
like how is the matrix

3828
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
not a purest

3829
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I guess

3830
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I guess it's not magic

3831
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
cause it's like

3832
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
it's not exactly a world

3833
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
it's a simulation

3834
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
he's still in the real world

3835
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
he's just experiencing a

3836
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
yeah that one is

3837
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
like that one is like

3838
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
it is

3839
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
in every functional way to the story

3840
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
it is about like going between

3841
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
from one world to another

3842
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
it's just it's

3843
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
yeah I think I agree with you that's like too close

3844
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
and then the wizard of us

3845
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
being like more pure

3846
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
is strange cause that was a dream

3847
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
oh yeah I guess it was a dream

3848
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
was it even a physical different world

3849
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
yeah you know what

3850
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
you're right

3851
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
they're the same in every meaningful way

3852
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
wizard of us is the matrix

3853
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I think we need to

3854
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
but just without computer it just is

3855
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
it just is

3856
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
it's just the same story

3857
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
that's what we need to part of the world

3858
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
let's listen to a voicemail

3859
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
shall we?

3860
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
let's do it

3861
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
the first voicemail after that is called

3862
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
cliché

3863
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I won't

3864
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
wait can I post it in the

3865
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
okay it's called cliché

3866
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
three two one go

3867
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
but I'm just of

3868
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
more like

3869
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
but I'm just of

3870
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
okay

3871
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
I get it

3872
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
hold on it's coming out my

3873
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
negotiations is a word that I learned from watching

3874
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
star wars for phantom menace as a kid

3875
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
yeah

3876
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
whenever I heard my parents say

3877
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
the word negotiation

3878
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
that's the star wars word

3879
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
when do they say that

3880
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
when the trade federation is talking to

3881
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
we have to have our negotiations with the trade federation

3882
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
we have to have the negotiations

3883
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
we've got to negotiate a trade deal

3884
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
to get the blockhead out of

3885
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
fucking

3886
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Naboo

3887
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
it's a funny story

3888
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
you're really do

3889
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
you're like negotiation

3890
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
just like a Shakespeare

3891
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
okay

3892
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
setting default audio to

3893
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
wireless headphones okay good

3894
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
wait I don't mean

3895
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I don't mean to derail

3896
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
go derail away

3897
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
on the topic of George Lucas

3898
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
have you seen the video

3899
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
there's just a guy walking through the street talking about some shit

3900
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
and George Lucas just appears

3901
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
in the background

3902
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
and just

3903
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
making music plays

3904
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
I have to

3905
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
is it just someone was vlogging

3906
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
and George Lucas just happened to be there

3907
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
and he just walks into a building

3908
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
that's great

3909
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I can't believe that George Lucas

3910
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
actually walks around in the real world

3911
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
that's so fucked up

3912
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
it shouldn't be allowed

3913
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
it's kind of nice

3914
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
because I feel like George Lucas

3915
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
lives in a real place

3916
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
more so than other celebrities

3917
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
which you only see them

3918
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
never

3919
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
only out of a limo

3920
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
he's got that Skywalker ranch doesn't he

3921
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
yeah they say that he lives on like his personal

3922
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
little ranch

3923
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
he's super rich

3924
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I've heard that he's kind of like a recluse

3925
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
or I mean red letter media called him a recluse once

3926
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
and I just assume they know what they're talking about

3927
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
I thought he's been like seen just

3928
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
eating salad in a food court

3929
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
oh yeah enjoy your salad

3930
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
yeah I remember the food court

3931
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
thing

3932
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
another thing red letter media made fun of him for

3933
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
but like why

3934
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
why make fun of him for eating the food court

3935
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
what's wrong with that

3936
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
let's react to this video

3937
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
PCP of a reaction channel

3938
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
where we react to voicemails and funny videos

3939
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
okay here we go

3940
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
three two one go

3941
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
right

3942
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
and they use something they call pyro processing

3943
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
the interesting thing is

3944
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
they call it pyro processing

3945
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
it's a molten salt process

3946
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
they're dissolving this thing

3947
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
in a molten salt

3948
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
and they're doing electro chemistry

3949
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
it looks just like him

3950
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
yeah I think it's him

3951
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
because then it brings up another superior thing

3952
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
molten salt

3953
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
oh it is

3954
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
it's

3955
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
that's so similar to his face

3956
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I'm looking at his face

3957
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
and now I'm not 100% sure

3958
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I wasn't sure until I full screened

3959
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
it looks more like it than

3960
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
well

3961
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
oh no there's a frame where it looks

3962
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
like someone else

3963
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
who knows maybe it's just a

3964
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
classic outfit

3965
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
he just looks like a regular old man

3966
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
so like

3967
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I really thought it was at first

3968
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
but now I'm like it could be

3969
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
just someone who kinda looks similar

3970
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
and I think it's him

3971
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
very funny

3972
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I don't know what the salt processing

3973
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
molten, shut the fuck up

3974
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
fucking egg head

3975
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
get out of here

3976
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
regardless of George Lucas

3977
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
it's funny how he just sort of jumps

3978
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
into frame like he's like supposed to be there

3979
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
because he wanted to see this happening

3980
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
and then he's like oh I guess he's filming

3981
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
he didn't just walk by casually

3982
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
he jumped into frame looking at the camera

3983
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
like uh and then he just

3984
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
walked all the way across the screen

3985
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
but in a way that maximized his

3986
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
screen time

3987
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
he did it's like he's staying

3988
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
maybe he had he like

3989
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
maybe he like knew he had to walk by

3990
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
and saw that the guy was filming

3991
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
and he was like I kinda don't want to

3992
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
walk through this line of film but like I have to

3993
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
so he tried to like

3994
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I don't know it looked like he

3995
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
he didn't like that he was on camera I think

3996
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
he was trying to ignore it

3997
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
he looks like a man who's seen a camera or two

3998
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
you could say

3999
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
you could proof perhaps

4000
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
perhaps

4001
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
the other smell which I have right here

4002
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
is called heartfelt dondas

4003
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
ready

4004
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
three two one go

4005
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
donda

4006
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
donda

4007
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
donda

4008
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
donda

4009
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I don't know if you have to listen to all 30 seconds of this

4010
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
donda donda

4011
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
donda donda

4012
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
donda donda donda

4013
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I don't know what it means

4014
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
donda donda donda

4015
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
donda donda donda

4016
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
donda

4017
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I mean I believe it

4018
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I believe it too

4019
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
donda

4020
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
this is definitely George Lucas

4021
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
this one I have no doubt about

4022
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
this is George Lucas having sex dude

4023
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
that's the noise in a minute

4024
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
yeah

4025
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
that's so heartfelt dondas

4026
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
I was thinking of that fucking turtle

4027
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
having sex video with the shoe

4028
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I was thinking of that

4029
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
I said it's donda

4030
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
next one is called

4031
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
L2 bait

4032
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
spot scrubs

4033
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
three two one

4034
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
go

4035
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
yeah this whole

4036
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
general strike thing

4037
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
striking for one day

4038
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
smells like bait

4039
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
that's not how strikes

4040
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
fucking work guys

4041
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I wasn't sure about it

4042
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
but it's not the easiest bait to get a bunch of

4043
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
dipshit baby leftists

4044
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
fired

4045
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
don't fall for it

4046
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I mean do you

4047
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
I get that it doesn't seem like it's going to do anything

4048
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
but like

4049
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
is anyone really going to get fired over it

4050
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
is anything even going to

4051
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
if it seems like such a

4052
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
you would never see the fruits

4053
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
if your goal is like haha I will put out a plan

4054
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
that will get a bunch of stupid baby leftists fired

4055
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
that will get a few people fired

4056
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I have never met

4057
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
but maybe vaguely have a sense that I don't like them

4058
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
and in my heart I will know that haha

4059
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
maybe a few of them got fired

4060
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
because they fell for my trick

4061
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I guess that's something people would do

4062
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
there are people in the world who are that cruel

4063
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
I guess that's probably true

4064
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
there are other Ben Saints out there

4065
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
no no

4066
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
I cornered the market

4067
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
damn it well I need I guess I need a new

4068
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
shtick cruelty is taken

4069
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
next voicemail is called

4070
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
will ben have cake

4071
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
3 2 1 go

4072
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
you will never have any cake

4073
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
you will never have any cake

4074
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
you will never have any cake

4075
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
you will never have any cake

4076
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
you will never have any cake

4077
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
and then the delta rune logo appears

4078
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
sounds like you answered your own question there

4079
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
buddy

4080
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
I'm sorry

4081
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I knew I said to the fucking voicemail

4082
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
I forgot what it was

4083
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
oh it was you

4084
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
you fucker

4085
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I forgot about it

4086
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
okay

4087
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
okay cool

4088
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
thanks

4089
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
thanks man

4090
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
good shit

4091
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
you got that 5-4 groove going on

4092
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
is that what that was

4093
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
that was a fucking

4094
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
time signature

4095
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
is that doing like a disturbed

4096
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
like

4097
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
at the end

4098
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
it was like you will never have any cake

4099
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
you will never have any cake

4100
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
it wasn't the drum line from

4101
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
down with the sickness

4102
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
no that's 4-4

4103
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
5-4 is like 1 2 3 4 5

4104
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
5-4 is real fun

4105
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
most random sentences

4106
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
if you just save them rhythmically

4107
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
end up being 5-4 in my experience

4108
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
you will never have any cake

4109
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
yeah

4110
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
yeah

4111
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
sorry for your ears

4112
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
that's okay

4113
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
did I post it

4114
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
the next one is called

4115
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
it's called tiny facts number 1

4116
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
a tiny fact

4117
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
3 2 1 go

4118
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
it's me

4119
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
the muffin man

4120
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I like the way he cooks the dough

4121
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
you're the muffin man

4122
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
but you like the way he cooks

4123
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
who's he

4124
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I don't know

4125
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I don't know

4126
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
there's so many holes in this

4127
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
story I don't think I trust this guy

4128
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
the next

4129
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
it's a very tiny fact

4130
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
it sure was

4131
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
vanishingly small

4132
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
the next one is called we did it boys

4133
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
racism is no more

4134
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
alright

4135
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
1 go

4136
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
on one of the recent episodes

4137
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Ben expressed his opinion that gender and race are fake

4138
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
and we shouldn't treat people differently because of those characteristics

4139
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
given croc disagreed

4140
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
so Ben quickly folded as befitting of a spineless

4141
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
beta cut

4142
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
in relation to that I'd like to know your opinion on Asian

4143
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
penalty in the US

4144
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Asian penalty

4145
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
like football

4146
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
like football penalty

4147
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
kickoffs

4148
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
like how Japan

4149
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
a world cup

4150
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
one time

4151
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I don't think that conversation

4152
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
happened according to as this person

4153
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
describes it I don't think I

4154
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I don't remember that either

4155
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
what is Asian penalty

4156
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
okay

4157
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
do they mean like Chinese

4158
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I think they're talking about

4159
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
what's the word

4160
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
when you do something bad

4161
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
and the government says points deducted

4162
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
okay I think they're basically talking

4163
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
about

4164
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
the opposite of affirmative action

4165
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
where colleges

4166
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
won't take Asian people

4167
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
because they have too many

4168
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
I think that's what it is

4169
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
weird

4170
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I think

4171
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
I don't know I think it's neutral

4172
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
I think it's neutral

4173
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I think affirmative action

4174
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
is generally good

4175
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
and

4176
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
whatever those

4177
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Asian kids can just go to a different college

4178
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
just like everybody else

4179
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
big fucking deal

4180
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
whatever

4181
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
it's maybe not great but it's not

4182
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
that big a deal

4183
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
I don't think affirmative action should

4184
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
negatively affect

4185
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Asian applicants

4186
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I thought the idea was like if two people

4187
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
have equal qualifications

4188
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
you give it to the person who probably

4189
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
struggled harder to get there

4190
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
well yeah

4191
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
I mean yes

4192
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
but it's not like Asians don't experience racism

4193
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
or I guess it's a different kind of racism

4194
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I mean

4195
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
you necessarily

4196
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
if two people

4197
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
have a thing and you have to give one

4198
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
or the other

4199
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
you're necessarily denying it to the other

4200
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
that's just life

4201
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I mean

4202
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
I mean

4203
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I don't know

4204
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
it's a zero sum gain

4205
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
it's a zero sum gain

4206
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I guess it's bad

4207
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I guess it's bad if like

4208
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
an Asian person who

4209
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
qualifies for something doesn't get it

4210
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
and the reason is

4211
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
in some part because they had to fill a quota

4212
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
they had to give it to someone else to fill

4213
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
some race quota or whatever

4214
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
for anything right but like

4215
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
the opposite would be just as bad

4216
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
like if they gave it to the Asian kid

4217
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
and not to the

4218
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
someone is losing out either way

4219
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
so it's not like an

4220
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
ill has been inflicted on the world

4221
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
a resource was moved from one person to another

4222
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
which is just

4223
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
happens all the time

4224
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
and is normal

4225
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
just go to a different college

4226
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
the resource of my bullet has been moved

4227
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
to the resource of your brain

4228
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
true

4229
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
I'm just trying to remember the

4230
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
conversation

4231
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
I just think racism is good actually

4232
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
you know, sometimes racism is actually good

4233
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
most of the time

4234
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
we finally have a left at bits

4235
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
you know what

4236
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
I was kind of racist all along

4237
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
we all were

4238
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I can't remember what that conversation was

4239
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
I don't know anything

4240
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
lol

4241
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I don't know if I listened to the episode that was referencing

4242
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
gender

4243
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
I don't think I would have said

4244
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
it's fake like money

4245
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
it's real because we make it real

4246
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
yeah

4247
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
whatever

4248
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
okay

4249
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
next voicemail

4250
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
where did I put it

4251
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
it's called

4252
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
fuck I lost it

4253
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I lost it because that was one of those

4254
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
those

4255
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
vocaru messages

4256
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
just get a fucking microphone

4257
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
just get a microphone

4258
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
okay

4259
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
okay

4260
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
next one is called

4261
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
34

4262
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
where's the number

4263
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
no sorry the next one is an image

4264
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
the

4265
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
I can't

4266
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
there

4267
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
posted

4268
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
okay

4269
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
so we have

4270
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
whatever

4271
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
defeated by

4272
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
I assume this is mage

4273
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
glowing

4274
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
effulgent with power

4275
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
can't believe defeated by a woman

4276
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
and then it's me saying Nate we don't know their pronouns

4277
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I get it

4278
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
I get it because

4279
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
the joke is that I'm obnoxious

4280
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
the joke is

4281
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
true

4282
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
but why are you on the right side of the screen

4283
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
why is Nate to the left of you here

4284
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
that's true

4285
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
it's this

4286
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
what we just said nice art

4287
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
it is nice art

4288
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
this guy

4289
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
this guy kills it

4290
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
this guy is really killing it in the voicemails

4291
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I gotta say

4292
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
okay next one I posted up above

4293
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
it's called hmm

4294
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
it's the one we didn't listen to okay 3 2 1

4295
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
go

4296
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I just wanted to test if

4297
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
my mic works better

4298
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
with socks on

4299
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
or without socks

4300
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
so now comes

4301
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
the review

4302
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
let's see if there is any difference

4303
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
well viewers

4304
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
well viewers what do you think

4305
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
with socks or without socks vote down below

4306
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
vote in the comments

4307
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I guess

4308
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
my advice to the voicemailers

4309
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
use your own ears

4310
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
don't send it through

4311
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
a service that like

4312
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
purchases your audio and makes it probably worse

4313
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
he can only tell if it's better

4314
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
if he hears us listen to it on the PCP

4315
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
a week later just so you know

4316
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
listener a speak pipe

4317
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
fucks with the audio that gets sent through

4318
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
and makes it lower quality so

4319
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
it's not a good way to test if something

4320
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
sounds good

4321
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
or is it

4322
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
I have voicemails I've never sent because

4323
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
I had a lot of advanced audio editing

4324
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
and speak pipe just fucking like

4325
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
tries to mute all of my sound effects

4326
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
and then it just sounds like it's underwater

4327
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
so it's just not like this

4328
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
you gotta use vocru

4329
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
vocru has a shitty bit rate is a problem

4330
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
oh

4331
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
that's when I put a link

4332
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
to download and the thing

4333
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
and then you complain

4334
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
yeah I did

4335
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
that's me

4336
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
next voicemail is

4337
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
this is another genes

4338
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
here we go

4339
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
3, 2, 1

4340
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
wait

4341
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
I'm stupid

4342
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
the 35

4343
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
35 is genes

4344
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
3, 2, 1, go

4345
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
with my high school friends was

4346
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Halo 3, Reach

4347
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
and Halo 4

4348
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
while those were fun multiplayer games

4349
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
they didn't laugh with any interesting

4350
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
conversations

4351
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
and I didn't have any significant

4352
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
recollection of those events

4353
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
could you recommend

4354
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
any similar comfy play foods

4355
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
that I can cozy up and listen to

4356
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
yeah if you're playing Halo

4357
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
I mean you're like you're

4358
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
you're engaged you're being like

4359
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
or I'm gonna be shot

4360
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
you're heavily engaged

4361
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
cozy play throughs

4362
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
do you mean like let's play videos

4363
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
or do you mean like games that

4364
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
can be like Ape Escape

4365
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
in a cozy way

4366
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
my cozy playthroughs

4367
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
that I like so much

4368
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
is I really really like

4369
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
gdq speedruns of

4370
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Final Fantasy games and like

4371
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Chrono Trigger like 9 hour long

4372
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
ones of like Final Fantasy 8

4373
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
and stuff

4374
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
that's the that's the

4375
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
good content for me

4376
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
I guess who excel

4377
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
did a bunch that I like a lot

4378
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I guess this is sort of normal

4379
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
but I like game grumps

4380
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
there's a lot of good

4381
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
old game grumps things but you probably already knew

4382
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
that so I don't know

4383
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
meaningful conversations

4384
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
I don't think Ape Escape is specifically

4385
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
like tailored for that sort of thing

4386
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
I'm trying to figure out

4387
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
what they mean

4388
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
they missed out on playing

4389
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
games that if played with

4390
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
friends would result in

4391
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
deep conversations

4392
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
it just comes from having deep things to talk about

4393
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I think what she's saying is that

4394
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
she didn't have

4395
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
yeah cause they were all actively

4396
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
playing Halo they were focused on the game

4397
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
I think the thing about the

4398
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
that playthrough and that game

4399
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
is not that it was Ape Escape

4400
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
it's that you were playing

4401
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
and the rest of us were just kind of hanging out

4402
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
yeah and like only sort of half

4403
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
paying attention to the game

4404
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
is me and Jesse passing it to each other

4405
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
and then everyone was just hanging out

4406
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Davoo fell asleep

4407
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
the best game

4408
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
to just chill

4409
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
and talk with your friends is Minecraft

4410
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
that's a good one

4411
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
yeah that's true

4412
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
a lot of Minecraft is

4413
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
just with your friends and just build some shit together

4414
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
it's great

4415
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
like you have your own little solo project that you're working on

4416
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
and then occasionally

4417
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
you invite them over to see your house

4418
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
or you go to see theirs

4419
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
and you just sort of hang out and stand around

4420
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
and talk

4421
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
it's nice

4422
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
it's a good time

4423
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
yeah I guess that answers the question

4424
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
next one

4425
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
yep

4426
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
next one is called

4427
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
drawcast idea

4428
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
well good thing you're here for this oblivion

4429
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
you've stolen our fucking thing

4430
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
hey

4431
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
3, 2, 1, go

4432
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
it was silent

4433
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
it was okay

4434
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
is that the joke?

4435
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
the joke is don't do the drawcast

4436
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
well we weren't going to

4437
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
don't worry

4438
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
that's a lie you know me and Gibb

4439
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
we're doing a drawcast later today

4440
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
oh my god we are doing it later today

4441
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
thank you for reminding me

4442
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
hey we're going to draw

4443
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
thank god

4444
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
yeah

4445
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
based alert

4446
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
wait what's the theme for today

4447
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
halloween girls

4448
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
I hate halloween

4449
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
boo I'm a halloween

4450
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
rude

4451
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I'm going to draw scream

4452
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
from scream with fat titties

4453
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
underneath their cloak and their mask

4454
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
it's not going to be a scream mask

4455
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
we're going to be

4456
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
cumin

4457
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
it's going to be great

4458
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
it's going to be cumin

4459
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
like my curry

4460
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
every drawcast episode my goal

4461
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
is to draw a character with big tits or ass

4462
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
so that can be the thumbnail

4463
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
it's the only way

4464
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
the only way

4465
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
the only way to what I don't know

4466
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
next next voicemail is called

4467
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
sad wait no I think I already posted

4468
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I'm losing track yes I already posted it

4469
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
next one is called sad

4470
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
three two one go

4471
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
I've experienced life

4472
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
later what

4473
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
a series

4474
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
of humiliation

4475
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
and defeats

4476
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
what are you talking about

4477
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
don't stop

4478
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
I haven't got a

4479
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
got a W

4480
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
ever since I was born

4481
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
oh gee I can't imagine

4482
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
couldn't be me

4483
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
are you okay

4484
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
don't have the constitution

4485
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
for suicide

4486
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
as the guy says

4487
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I'm true detective

4488
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
but other than that I see

4489
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
no reason not to quit

4490
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
your job

4491
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
don't kill yourself

4492
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
he's saying okay

4493
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I understand the point

4494
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
what he's saying it's just he took so long

4495
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
to say it with his like bizarre

4496
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
like drawing like

4497
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
took him like so long

4498
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
he sounded like he's drunk

4499
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
don't kill yourself

4500
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
he's got the Eleazar accent

4501
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
but it's not Eleazar

4502
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
it's some kind of

4503
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
South American accent

4504
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
I can't place it more specifically than that

4505
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
but

4506
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
yeah don't kill yourself

4507
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
is what I would say

4508
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
dude here's the thing

4509
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
W's

4510
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
come after L's in the alphabet

4511
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
I keep digging

4512
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
keep going through those letters

4513
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
yeah it's just

4514
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
wow that's deep

4515
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
W comes after L in the alphabet

4516
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
by sex toys

4517
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
it's like

4518
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
it's like tomato anus

4519
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
always says you guys ever watched tomato anus

4520
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
no but I like that

4521
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
he does speedrun explain videos

4522
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
he'll walk through

4523
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
a record breaking speedrun

4524
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
and he'll just explain like what is the runner doing

4525
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
here and here and here

4526
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
every single video that he makes

4527
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
he will at a completely random point

4528
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
just insert a little

4529
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
like 30 second bit where he's just like

4530
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
and by the way I just want to say

4531
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
the things will get better for you and if things are going well

4532
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
if you feel bad now you won't always feel that way

4533
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
and there's always hope and people that love you

4534
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
and I just want you to know

4535
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
that the things will get better

4536
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
alright back to the run anyway

4537
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
frame perfect inputs

4538
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
so just go watch one of those

4539
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
and just assume that

4540
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
pretend that I said what he says

4541
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
don't kill yourself

4542
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
we love you

4543
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
tomato anus

4544
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
he's a wise man

4545
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I was just curious

4546
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
has anyone personified

4547
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
a tomato

4548
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
as a girl

4549
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
and drawn her with an ass

4550
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
and they have

4551
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
of course

4552
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
it's a round

4553
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
it's a fruit

4554
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
these images are so bad

4555
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
the only two images of like

4556
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
tomato women

4557
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
is an among us with a tomato

4558
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
leaf and tits

4559
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
and then one that's shitting catch up

4560
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
and one that's farting and those are the only results

4561
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
on rule 34

4562
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
no one of them is an among us

4563
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
I mean I guess this one's not explicit

4564
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
I guess this one's technically

4565
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
like technically won't get us

4566
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
on youtube

4567
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
the other ones will

4568
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
because they involve anuses

4569
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
but I did find

4570
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
I found tomato anus just believe me

4571
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
what did we get

4572
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
that community guidelines strike for

4573
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
it was for the

4574
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
the link to the tails gets trolled

4575
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
or jerry getting fucked by the dog

4576
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
it's because it recognized the URL

4577
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
of the website I think

4578
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
we still have

4579
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
we still have a strike

4580
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
on the channel from the time that we

4581
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
posted the

4582
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
the shadbase link

4583
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
in the description

4584
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
even though we took it out

4585
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
it was like a long time ago

4586
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
but it's about to I think it expires this month

4587
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
so that's exciting

4588
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
but yeah we've had a strike on the channel

4589
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
because of that link for like

4590
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
a year

4591
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
we didn't get the strike when we posted

4592
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
it was retroactively applied

4593
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
like much later

4594
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
when I mentioned I was drawing

4595
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
like boobs

4596
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
booby in one of my voicemails

4597
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
and I just linked the image

4598
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
you linked the uncensored image

4599
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
in the video description

4600
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
maybe that should also be removed

4601
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
or replaced with a censored version

4602
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
in the one that you were on

4603
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
I think it doesn't look at the image

4604
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
I think it looks at the link

4605
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
text

4606
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
and if it matches with like

4607
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
rule 34 that's a not allowed

4608
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
site

4609
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
I'm nervous about it because

4610
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
they've retroactively applied them

4611
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
the fact that it didn't trigger the thing

4612
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
doesn't mean that it's safe

4613
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
and that it won't be triggered in the future

4614
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
if you tell me which episode it is

4615
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
I can go and edit the description

4616
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
I can try to figure it out

4617
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
you weren't on the episode

4618
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I wasn't on it

4619
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
it was a voicemail

4620
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
all I know is it was one of the ones

4621
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
with the gravestones

4622
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
I don't know why

4623
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
there's no particular reason why I'm bringing this up now

4624
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
but I want to mention that last night

4625
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
I drank a

4626
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
see this is the price

4627
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
this is the price of spooky season

4628
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
nobody talks about the damage

4629
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
it is inflicted on society

4630
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
from the spooky season meme

4631
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
I drank a pumpkin flavored

4632
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
hard seltzer

4633
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
it was so bad

4634
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
I know it sounded awful and I was like

4635
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
that sounds awful and I tried it

4636
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
and it really was

4637
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
it was terrible

4638
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
it's not right

4639
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
it's not the normal flavor

4640
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
choice for such a thing

4641
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
it didn't work but oh

4642
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
it's so cozy

4643
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
the meme

4644
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
has to die

4645
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
I'm going to be the one to kill it

4646
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
the instagram girl version

4647
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
of Halloween spooky season

4648
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
is certainly

4649
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
trite

4650
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
it's just like shut up

4651
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I like chocolate

4652
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
and I like punk

4653
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
and ghosts and skeletons

4654
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
I don't really like ghosts and skeletons

4655
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
and pumpkin is okay

4656
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
skeletons are funny

4657
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
honestly

4658
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
I like pumpkin stuff

4659
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
the fact like when it's October

4660
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I like pumpkin stuff less

4661
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
because I'm like I don't want to eat it

4662
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
it's a meme it's a meme now

4663
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
my enjoyment is not

4664
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
my enjoyment is not authentic

4665
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
get a big fucking turnip

4666
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
get a big fucking tomato

4667
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
I like pumpkin flavored eggnog

4668
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
and ice cream

4669
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
and all that shit it's great

4670
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
but when it's being commodified

4671
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
when capitalism has turned it into

4672
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
a consumer

4673
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
for the holiday

4674
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
what everyone tell me about Halloween

4675
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
is all about

4676
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
the true meaning of Halloween

4677
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
it's to get fucked

4678
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
it's to get

4679
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
wow

4680
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I guess I was wrong

4681
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
it's to get fucked

4682
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
sure

4683
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
I mean Halloween stuff

4684
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
is very much less commercialized

4685
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
over here because it

4686
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
even though we celebrate it

4687
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
it has always felt like a big American thing

4688
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
it's from America

4689
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I was shocked

4690
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
I didn't realize when I lived in Poland

4691
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
it was October

4692
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
October came around and it was Halloween

4693
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
and nobody did anything

4694
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
I saw

4695
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
I might have seen a couple

4696
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
a handful of college students that were wearing a costume

4697
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
but

4698
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
it just kind of wasn't a thing

4699
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
I thought everybody did Halloween

4700
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
I didn't think it was just an American thing

4701
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
and it's not just an American thing

4702
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
but it's

4703
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
most of

4704
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
everybody does it over here

4705
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
most of it comes from

4706
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
not culturally

4707
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
but my understanding of Halloween

4708
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
comes from Halloween American movies

4709
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
stuff that takes place in Halloween

4710
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
spooky things

4711
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
all the iconography and stuff

4712
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
it's Hollywood

4713
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
sure

4714
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
it's our main export

4715
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
we're civilizing the rest of you

4716
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
next voicemail

4717
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
is called

4718
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
sex

4719
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
sex

4720
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
I never had it

4721
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
3, 2, 1

4722
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
oh there's the tomato anise

4723
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
the anise isn't visible

4724
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
the anise was in a different anise I can't send

4725
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
3, 2, 1, go

4726
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
why does Kazi hate Nate?

4727
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
they seem positive about everything else

4728
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
but

4729
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
it's like

4730
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Nate

4731
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
is he real or is it ironic

4732
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
and why

4733
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
did he do something

4734
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
how do you feel about

4735
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Michelle

4736
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
how

4737
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
sex

4738
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I never had it

4739
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
true

4740
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
I think Kazi doesn't like

4741
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
the stuff that Nate says

4742
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
in his videos and elsewhere

4743
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
I don't know if there's anything else to it

4744
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
next voicemail

4745
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
by the way

4746
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000

02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
it is called

4749
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000

I stepped on and that's the story

4754
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
next voicemail

4755
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
is called

4756
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
moving spaghetti around

4757
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
they don't get it

4758
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
they got that tomato anise

4759
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
true

4760
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000

just be a guy's name

4775
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
why is he buying

4776
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
what is it

4777
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
well I'm selling

4778
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Ben's selling Nate's buying

4779
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
is it a crypto currency called Nate

4780
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
that'd be really funny

4781
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
is it Nate.tech

4782
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
yeah I found Nate.tech

4783
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
it's like a payment

4784
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
dude there's a fucking tomato

4785
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
there's a fucking tomato on the website

4786
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
does that have an anise

4787
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
there is

4788
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
it looks like an anise it looks pretty puckered up

4789
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
it's a pretty puckered tomato

4790
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
everything is linked together

4791
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
universe

4792
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
that tomato better be on screen

4793
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
the world's only app

4794
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
it's some fucking

4795
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
it's some fucking payment processing app

4796
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
it's garbage

4797
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
solving a problem that

4798
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
was invented specifically

4799
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
for it to solve

4800
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
it makes me mad

4801
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
it makes me mad just looking at this

4802
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
fuck this

4803
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000

thanks Tom

4823
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000

4829
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
someone

4830
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
asked

4831
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000

4836
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
next voicemail is called

02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
3, 7, 4, 1

4838
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
it is called

4839
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
the

4840
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
okay damn it

4841
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
it's another image

4842
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
it's a PNG

4843
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
if that's exciting

4844
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
the cycloneal is a socialist

4845
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
masterpiece

4846
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
immigration is a form of colonialism Abby

4847
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
we need to hashtag build a wall

4848
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
booba

4849
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
that is what she think

4850
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
that is what she think

4851
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
this is a true image

4852
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
this is very true

4853
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
it rings very true yeah

4854
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
I like that

4855
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
I have 9 subscribers and I'm called

4856
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
patreon.com

4857
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
on youtube

4858
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
should have unironically called my channel that

4859
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
413 views

4860
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
haha

4861
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
413 views yes true

4862
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
cycloneal is not a socialist

4863
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
masterpiece

4864
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
but the version of me

4865
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
that made this video

4866
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
it's a socialist-ish piece

4867
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
it's a socialist-ish

4868
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
it is

4869
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
it's social-ish

4870
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
it's so delish

4871
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
we never

4872
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
I never re-read

4873
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
cycloneals for the cycloneals cast

4874
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
we could always do it

4875
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
but we could always do it

4876
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
I still want to

4877
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
I still wanted to do one about it

4878
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
at this point I would have to re-read it

4879
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
myself as well

4880
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
okay I don't want to think about that

4881
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
I got fucking shit to do

4882
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
next voicemail is called

4883
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
J

4884
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
wait no here it is

4885
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
there it is

4886
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
wait do we listen to the last one

4887
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
it's 0 seconds

4888
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
there's no content

4889
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
next one is called J

4890
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
one go

4891
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
what's your opinion on comics

4892
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
drawn by people with no artistic

4893
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
talent

4894
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
do you think the story has to be funny

4895
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
for terrible art to be justified

4896
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
I am asking this

4897
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
because I am a person with zero

4898
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
artistic knowledge and I'm planning to make

4899
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
a comic but it's supposed to have

4900
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
a serious tone not a comical

4901
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
tone

4902
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
that's tough

4903
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
comics and all

4904
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
illustrations can look

4905
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
raggedy

4906
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
there's no correct way

4907
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
the cleaner the lines are

4908
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
doesn't mean it's better

4909
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
if you can find a way

4910
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
to communicate whatever ideas

4911
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
you have

4912
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
with the level of talent you have

4913
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
because if it's a serious

4914
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
story and you don't have

4915
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
any artistic drawing talent

4916
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
but you can write the dialogue

4917
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
or whatever

4918
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
you can basically make it text

4919
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
there's no rules

4920
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
you could also

4921
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
get away with

4922
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
even if you can't draw particularly well

4923
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
if you're good at setting up a visual tone

4924
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
for the use of color or something

4925
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
that could also help

4926
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
you ever read

4927
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
you ever read Kate Wertz

4928
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
comics

4929
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
yes

4930
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
though she's really good at drawing

4931
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
she is good

4932
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
there's sketchy there

4933
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
there's a lot that goes into drawing anything

4934
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
even

4935
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
things that a layman might assume

4936
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
is like oh that's lazy work

4937
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
that's easy to draw

4938
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
but I mean obviously not really

4939
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
no

4940
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
just work within your means I guess

4941
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
if you know you can't really draw

4942
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
very well but you really want to draw something

4943
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
if you try to paint

4944
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
a masterpiece thing

4945
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
it's probably

4946
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
not a good place to start

4947
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
you can work towards it of course

4948
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
you okay I think

4949
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
it's tough if you have

4950
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
a tone in mind

4951
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
if you have a serious tone in mind

4952
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
and it's like well

4953
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
if you're a

4954
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
bad artist

4955
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
and you just kind of go with it

4956
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
I mean it's going to draw attention to itself

4957
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
like the bad artist is going to call attention to itself

4958
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
and it might be tough

4959
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
to make that work in a serious

4960
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
story

4961
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
well yeah I think if they're asking

4962
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
because they said they don't want it to be a comedic

4963
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
work and from

4964
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
like tales gets trolled

4965
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
some of the things there are like

4966
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
not supposed to be funny

4967
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
they're supposed to be intense and gory

4968
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
and scary but they nonetheless

4969
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
are hilarious because

4970
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
of how badly they're drawn despite

4971
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
how serious they're trying to be

4972
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
for a number of reasons

4973
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
for a number of reasons

4974
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
like if I imagine like oh berserk

4975
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
but drawn by a laserbot

4976
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
it would not

4977
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
work as well in conveying

4978
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
guts and his like

4979
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
struggle if it was drawn like that

4980
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
but

4981
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
there are ways

4982
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
I think it's mostly because

4983
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
like drawing a character from berserk

4984
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
requires

4985
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
knowledge of anatomy but if you draw

4986
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
a character that deliberately is not supposed

4987
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
to be anatomically correct

4988
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
you sort of sidestep

4989
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
the implication

4990
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
that you are failing at doing something

4991
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
if it may if it looks deliberate

4992
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
if you know what I mean

4993
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
I think if okay you can't

4994
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
you say you can't draw okay

4995
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
I think the only way

4996
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
the only way is you're gonna have

4997
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
you're gonna have to bust out the old tablet

4998
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
or whatever and you're gonna have to like doodle

4999
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
you're gonna have to like experiment with what you

5000
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
can draw and just try and find

5001
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
some balance

5002
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
of something that you are able to do

5003
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
and that like looks close enough

5004
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
that it doesn't look like

5005
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
distractingly different than like

5006
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
what tone you're going for

5007
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
you can't it's there probably is

5008
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
some I can't think off the

5009
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
top of my head of any like very

5010
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
like I was thinking one punch man

5011
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
one punch man was drawn very sketchily

5012
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
but like that's a that's not

5013
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
it's not exactly a comedy

5014
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
it's partly a comedy it's also possible

5015
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
to like go for a really simplified

5016
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
style that just looks appealing

5017
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
like appeal can also

5018
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
be fine on its own

5019
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
something like I mean yeah

5020
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
you could just go for like a hyper minimalist

5021
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
sort of thing and that could

5022
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
like um

5023
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
I don't know like like Paul

5024
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Paul who is a ghost I mean that's

5025
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
that's a comedy a comedy it's partially a comedy

5026
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
is that what is called Paul

5027
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
who is a

5028
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
uh

5029
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
uh

5030
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
it's a yeah it's a comic

5031
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
but it was from a website the website was

5032
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
do you know

5033
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
do you know what I'm talking about Paul who is a ghost

5034
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
I think I can't find it on google

5035
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
no it was a it was

5036
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
a webcomic okay I don't know

5037
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
oh pictures pictures for sad children

5038
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
pictures for sad children is the

5039
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
webcomic I'm thinking of it is

5040
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
it is somewhat it is comedic but it is

5041
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
it has a sort of

5042
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
serious tone to it

5043
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
and is hyper minimalist

5044
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
yeah super hyper minimalist can

5045
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
work I think the the the main thing

5046
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
to remember is that

5047
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
if it looks

5048
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
if whatever style you're drawing looks

5049
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
deliberately drawn that way

5050
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
and it doesn't look like you've tried

5051
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
and failed to do something that you can't do

5052
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
then it would then it will come

5053
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
across as less comedic

5054
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
so if if you think of like

5055
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
an artsy fartsy um student

5056
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
film because I've seen a lot of those

5057
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
artsy fartsy student films

5058
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
and student film animation

5059
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
things they're drawn

5060
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
you know sometimes

5061
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,000
the the the student can't draw

5062
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
very well but they have a very serious

5063
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
topic that they want to talk about in their

5064
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
film and

5065
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
they're sincere and they're earnest

5066
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
and they're not trying

5067
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
to go beyond you know the good ones

5068
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
I mean they're not trying to do

5069
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
what they can't do

5070
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
and because of that you can sort of buy

5071
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
this really shitty art

5072
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
telling this sad story

5073
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
so or not necessarily sad

5074
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
but like non comedic

5075
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
so it can work

5076
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
yeah yeah

5077
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
so you've got options

5078
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
it's not it's not hopeless

5079
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
but you gotta you gotta you're gonna have to experiment

5080
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
you're gonna have to try different things

5081
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
and strike upon something that you think

5082
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
you can do and that works with the

5083
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
story you're trying to tell

5084
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
if possible

5085
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
next voicemail is

5086
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
it's number

5087
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
43 here and it is

5088
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
called

5089
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
patreon.com

5090
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
3 2 1 go

5091
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
saw someone on twitter talking

5092
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
about how

5093
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
like they were upset that someone

5094
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
on patreon had essentially pledged

5095
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
just for a reward and then

5096
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
immediately unplugged

5097
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
like gave them the dollar got the thing

5098
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
got out and their basis

5099
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
for their argument was basically like

5100
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
oh you don't pledge to patreon

5101
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
for the reward so you pledge to support

5102
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
a creator this is a

5103
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
super dick move if you do something like this

5104
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
psa guys don't

5105
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
psa don't do this

5106
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
give me psa

5107
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
you care if people do that on your

5108
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
patreon

5109
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
like people you put a reward

5110
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
at a dollar amount

5111
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
it's so rude

5112
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
it's so rude for you to pay the amount

5113
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
that I asked you to pay in exchange for the thing

5114
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
I said you could have

5115
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,000
yeah

5116
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:28,000
if they were talking about themselves

5117
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
if they were talking about like someone just pledged

5118
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
to my patreon and then unplugged

5119
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
psa don't do this

5120
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
this is a bad move

5121
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
like that would be so gauche

5122
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
you're just telling people not to pledge to you

5123
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
that's money you're not getting

5124
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
if you're not happy

5125
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,000
the sort of person who

5126
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
is not interested in pledging long term

5127
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
which is a lot of people

5128
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,000
even if they do like your work just because of

5129
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
money issues they just need to

5130
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
hop on and off and that's fine

5131
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,000
the sort of person who would

5132
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
pledge just for a reward is the sort of person

5133
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,000
who would not have pledged had the reward

5134
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,000
not been there

5135
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
they would not have just become

5136
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
a supporter

5137
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:10,000
it's extra money you're getting

5138
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
if you think that your reward is

5139
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
not

5140
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
it's

5141
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
more than what they should be getting for

5142
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,000
you know a single pledge

5143
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:22,000
then like don't make it a patreon reward

5144
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,000
like sell it on whatever you're offering

5145
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
sell it on gumroad or something

5146
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:28,000
or at least up your like

5147
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:30,000
tiers to be more expensive or something

5148
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
yeah up your tiers or do it some other way

5149
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
like you're the one that put it on

5150
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
the marketplace at that price

5151
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,000
if you see like a guy on patreon

5152
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
who's getting like 10,000 a month for some crazy shit

5153
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:42,000
only like half that money

5154
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:44,000
is probably going to be from like long time supporters

5155
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:46,000
a lot of it's going to be people who pop in and out

5156
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,000
but if there's enough of them that can still be

5157
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,000
a consistent revenue source

5158
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
there's nothing wrong with that

5159
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,000
it's going to happen and it's going to make you money

5160
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
so accept it

5161
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,000
imagine complaining about

5162
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:00,000
someone pledging to you wrong

5163
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,000
that's so annoying

5164
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
you're giving me money to think about

5165
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,000
plus to us instead we

5166
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
appreciate every patron

5167
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
we did, we did

5168
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
someone on twitter when I made the post

5169
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,000
with the new bonus episodes

5170
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
someone was like

5171
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
I'm just going to pledge

5172
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
they were being cheeky

5173
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
they were like I'm just going to pledge

5174
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
and get all the episodes and un-pledge

5175
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:28,000
and I was like no don't give us $5

5176
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,000
oh no please

5177
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
don't do it

5178
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:34,000
how will we ever recover

5179
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:36,000
yeah

5180
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,000
next

5181
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
voicemail is called

5182
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
oh it's another, it's just called

5183
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
who designed the procrastinators podcast logo

5184
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
there's no audio

5185
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,000
the answer is divu

5186
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:50,000
I forget

5187
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
the reasoning for it

5188
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
I guess I could scroll back in the

5189
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
PCP chat and maybe find where divu said it

5190
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,000
was there reasoning for it?

5191
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
I think they had reasoning for it

5192
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
but I don't remember

5193
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
and it was such a long time ago

5194
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
they just made it

5195
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
and it's like okay how about this

5196
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:10,000
and we were like yeah that sounds cool

5197
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,000
we know what CDs are, we're old

5198
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
it's funny

5199
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,000
the background of the image

5200
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,000
well I changed the icon

5201
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,000
to be the gravestone one

5202
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,000
but the old image in the background

5203
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:24,000
it had some gray shit

5204
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,000
and it was actually the vapors

5205
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:28,000
it was a page of the vapors that was

5206
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:30,000
partially scribbled over I think

5207
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:32,000
that's what that is, interesting

5208
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
why?

5209
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:36,000
I'm pretty sure, yeah the old

5210
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:38,000
maybe if I have the file

5211
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:40,000
do I have the full size file on my

5212
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:42,000
computer somewhere

5213
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,000
yeah I think if you look at the

5214
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:46,000
I want to

5215
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:48,000
fuck where is it

5216
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,000
D drive, PCP folder

5217
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:56,000
wait it would be in the google drive

5218
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:58,000
the full size

5219
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:00,000
version

5220
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
you can't see it on the small version

5221
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:04,000
hold on I'm going to do it

5222
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,000
I'm logging in

5223
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:08,000
I remember doing some fucking stuff

5224
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:10,000
if you're a logo when I did my

5225
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:12,000
PCP theme way back

5226
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:14,000
I was making an icon for it

5227
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
and I didn't know what that sketchy stuff was

5228
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:18,000
and I had to recreate something similar

5229
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:20,000
yeah I'm almost

5230
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:22,000
I just want to look and see

5231
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:24,000
and just make absolutely sure that I'm not making

5232
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,000
complete fool of myself

5233
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:28,000
PCP components

5234
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,000
theme

5235
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
theme assets

5236
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:34,000
I'm looking through the

5237
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,000
no those are audio assets

5238
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:38,000
images and logos, here we go

5239
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:40,000
general

5240
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,000
here we go

5241
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,000
here we go

5242
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:46,000
download this one

5243
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:48,000
scanning for viruses

5244
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,000
let's examine this

5245
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:52,000
closely

5246
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:54,000
there it goes

5247
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:56,000
uploading

5248
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
yeah it's the

5249
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,000
vapors, it's the bush

5250
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:02,000
it's bushes and trees

5251
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:06,000
I don't know why

5252
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:10,000
and there's another image

5253
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:12,000
warped over it

5254
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
it's like two pages of the vapors superimposed

5255
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:16,000
on each other

5256
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:18,000
I don't know

5257
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,000
fascinating huh

5258
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:24,000
sorry I was

5259
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:26,000
for a second

5260
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
there it is

5261
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:30,000
sketchy vapors, sketchy vapors bushes

5262
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,000
right I always had

5263
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:34,000
the cutaway

5264
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,000
PNG version

5265
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,000
thumbnails and stuff

5266
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:40,000
I wonder if I can find the image I created

5267
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:42,000
for my

5268
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
soundcloud thing because I also had to put some

5269
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:46,000
scribbly lines in the background but there were different

5270
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:48,000
scribbly lines

5271
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,000
there's no real reason for it to be there

5272
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,000
it's so strange

5273
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:54,000
I thought it was like marble

5274
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:56,000
never really looked at it

5275
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:58,000
yeah I can see why you would think that

5276
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
but no it's uh

5277
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
it's that

5278
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
just because

5279
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:06,000
which voicemail

5280
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,000
was that

5281
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
that was

5282
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:12,000
three

5283
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
no that was uh

5284
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:16,000
okay there's one more

5285
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,000
voicemail

5286
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:20,000
it is called I need it

5287
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:22,000
here it is, found it

5288
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:26,000
okay I need it

5289
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:28,000
3, 2, 3, 2, 1

5290
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:30,000
go

5291
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:32,000
I need

5292
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
breath mints

5293
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000
I need it

5294
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,000
breath mints

5295
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,000
it does not

5296
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:42,000
need to come

5297
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
from a cis woman

5298
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
it can come

5299
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:48,000
from a man with

5300
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:50,000
big mommy

5301
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,000
milkers

5302
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Ben

5303
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
give me your breast

5304
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,000
milk

5305
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:00,000
that's what they said

5306
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:02,000
okay

5307
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
I'm on it chief

5308
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,000
my tradition of harassing Ben is being continued

5309
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
by the people

5310
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,000
you started something but can't

5311
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:12,000
when the voicemails were brand new

5312
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:14,000
once let out the genie can't be put back in the bottle

5313
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
when the voicemails were brand new I remember Ben

5314
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
I remember you saying

5315
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
why is so many of these voicemails about me

5316
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
it was me Ben

5317
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,000
yeah true

5318
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:26,000
that makes sense

5319
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:28,000
I'm seeing this meme theme

5320
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,000
I'm seeing this meme theme here

5321
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
what did you just scribble

5322
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:34,000
that stuff in the background

5323
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:36,000
I think I just googled like sketch of

5324
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,000
trees and just

5325
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,000
so you knew it was trees

5326
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
I mean it sort of looks like trees and bushes

5327
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:44,000
I could sort of tell

5328
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:46,000
clouds like it had to be one of those things

5329
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:48,000
it's one of the shots

5330
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,000
of the scenery from

5331
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:52,000
Vincent's point of view in Vapors Chapter 2

5332
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
I know exactly what it is

5333
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:56,000
I didn't know it's from Vapors that is some cool trivia

5334
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:58,000
and also Voice Smailer

5335
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:00,000
if you like breast milk

5336
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,000
well I've been animating a pair of flopping titties

5337
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:04,000
this whole time I've gone

5338
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:06,000
I've been looking at them this whole time I've had my dick in my hand

5339
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,000
the entire show

5340
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,000
by the way

5341
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
you can go to patreon.com

5342
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
the content on patreon.com

5343
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:16,000
slash oblivionfall is

5344
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,000
it's my seal of approval

5345
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:20,000
right now if I had to plug a money thing

5346
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
it would be the GoFundMe please

5347
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:24,000
yes the GoFundMe

5348
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:26,000
to remove boobs

5349
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,000
to remove boobs

5350
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:30,000
it is a paradox

5351
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:32,000
what is given can be taken away

5352
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:34,000
it's not actually

5353
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:36,000
it's not actually that confusing

5354
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
what is that up to

5355
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:42,000
how much do I talk about it

5356
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:44,000
it's up to $600

5357
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,000
and it's been one day

5358
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:48,000
one day

5359
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:50,000
actually slightly under 24 hours

5360
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:52,000
as of our recording right now

5361
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,000
I'm going to be doing

5362
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:56,000
some live streams

5363
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:58,000
to fundraise I'm going to be playing Undertale

5364
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:00,000
for the first time

5365
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,000
I've never played it

5366
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,000
that's going to be a big live stream

5367
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:08,000
I'm going to be doing a 12 hour variety stream

5368
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:10,000
youtubers and stuff I know

5369
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:12,000
and I'll be doing like a minecraft stream

5370
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:14,000
where I try to speedrun the game

5371
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,000
while my friends try to hunt down and kill me

5372
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:18,000
that'll be fun but a few things planned

5373
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,000
oh like dream

5374
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:22,000
yeah like dream

5375
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:24,000
just like that one guy

5376
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:26,000
it is really fun except when we do it

5377
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:28,000
it's not fake

5378
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,000
I'm not going to say that dream fakes

5379
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:32,000
those videos but there's a lot of

5380
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,000
elements that are rehearsed

5381
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:36,000
for sure

5382
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:40,000
on twitch

5383
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:42,000
stream on twitch or on youtube

5384
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:44,000
it'll be on my oblivionfall youtube

5385
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,000
the one with like

5386
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
38,000 subscribers

5387
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
not the really big one

5388
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:52,000
I don't know what that audience is like

5389
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:54,000
they scare me a little bit

5390
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,000
the big one

5391
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:58,000
are they there for the tits

5392
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:00,000
they're there for the cumzone stuff

5393
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:02,000
they'd be like a fundraiser to remove tits

5394
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:04,000
I'm just going

5395
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,000
I don't love you anymore

5396
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:08,000
you'll be attacked

5397
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:10,000
you'll be torn to shreds

5398
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,000
you'll be hard and feathered

5399
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:14,000
drawn and quartered

5400
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:16,000
exactly

5401
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,000
I don't want to risk

5402
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,000
the demographics of those

5403
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,000
freaking out those people

5404
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:24,000
it can't hurt though right

5405
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:26,000
maybe there's few people

5406
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:28,000
well here's the thing

5407
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:30,000
if it turns out that there's a bunch of people in there

5408
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:32,000
who are like transphobic or something

5409
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:34,000
which I don't know if that's true

5410
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:36,000
I would rather

5411
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:38,000
those people

5412
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:40,000
support me for my animation

5413
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:42,000
and then that money can go towards

5414
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:44,000
my partner's bottom surgery later on

5415
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:46,000
so that way they can unknowingly

5416
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:48,000
aid in that endeavor

5417
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:50,000
true

5418
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:52,000
sneaky

5419
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:54,000
but I mean

5420
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:56,000
they're just there for the boobs which to be fair

5421
03:19:56,000 --> 03:19:58,000
that's reasonable

5422
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:00,000
who can blame them

5423
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:02,000
ugh

5424
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:04,000
that's it that's the last voicemail

5425
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:06,000
oh are you

5426
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:08,000
I know

5427
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:10,000
what else we got

5428
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,000
did I complain about that terrible pumpkin seltzer

5429
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:14,000
I did

5430
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:16,000
I kicked a mouse the other day

5431
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:18,000
you kicked a mouse

5432
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:20,000
yeah there was a mouse

5433
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:22,000
in my new shitty apartment

5434
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:24,000
it got even shittier

5435
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,000
there's a mouse running around in the kitchen

5436
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:28,000
and I saw it on the table

5437
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:30,000
and I saw it like climb down

5438
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:32,000
I saw something at the corner of my eye

5439
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:34,000
it was on the table and I see something

5440
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:36,000
climbing down

5441
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:38,000
the like rack that we keep our like

5442
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:40,000
our pans on and it climbed down

5443
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:42,000
to the floor and I see it

5444
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
and I can see it start to run across the floor

5445
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
it's right in front of me it's crossing right in front of me

5446
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
I think

5447
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:50,000
that I had

5448
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:52,000
the ability in that moment

5449
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:54,000
to kill it to put my foot out and

5450
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:56,000
I saw its path I saw where it was going

5451
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:58,000
I could have stopped it and killed it

5452
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:00,000
I didn't have the courage

5453
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:02,000
I was too squeamish

5454
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:04,000
you thought about how it would feel to have your head crushed

5455
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:06,000
I mean

5456
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:08,000
that's the kind of thing that makes me squeamish

5457
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:10,000
and makes me like I don't want to

5458
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:12,000
I don't want to do that

5459
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:14,000
so instead

5460
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:16,000
I kicked it

5461
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:18,000
I kicked it like a hacky sack

5462
03:21:18,000 --> 03:21:20,000
did it fly across the room

5463
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:22,000
it did not fly across the room

5464
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:24,000
it did not leave the ground it did not get air

5465
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:26,000
but it did sort of go skidding

5466
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:28,000
it kind of spun and skidded across the ground

5467
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:30,000
and it sort of like

5468
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:32,000
it wasn't even that hard

5469
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:34,000
it didn't even hit that but it kind of thunked into

5470
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:36,000
like the kitchen

5471
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:38,000
sink cabinets

5472
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:40,000
and then it like scurried between

5473
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:42,000
the cabinet and the dishwasher

5474
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:44,000
and I was like fuck

5475
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:46,000
I should have why did I even bother

5476
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:48,000
why did I even bother to do that

5477
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:50,000
I could have killed it

5478
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:52,000
now it just has a broken rib cage

5479
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:54,000
maybe it'll just

5480
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:56,000
saw it again later

5481
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:58,000
it's literally better than ever

5482
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:00,000
it was exhilarated

5483
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:02,000
it got hit close to death

5484
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:04,000
but it came back twice as strong

5485
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:06,000
it just came back with a cool story to tell

5486
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:10,000
that's all I gave it

5487
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:12,000
I bought a bunch of traps

5488
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:14,000
and set a bunch of traps in the kitchen

5489
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:16,000
so maybe it will die soon

5490
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:18,000
I guess we'll see

5491
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:20,000
stomping a mouse to death is a bit

5492
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:22,000
much for anyone I think

5493
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,000
I one time in my old place

5494
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:26,000
which at one time

5495
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:28,000
did have mice in it we eventually killed all the

5496
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:30,000
mice with traps but at one time it did

5497
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:32,000
have a mouse problem and one time I

5498
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:34,000
there was a mouse in the

5499
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:36,000
near the trash can and I saw it

5500
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:38,000
it like scurried and it stopped

5501
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:40,000
and I froze and I was like

5502
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:42,000
what do I do what do I do and I

5503
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,000
dropped a pan on it and I killed it

5504
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:46,000
by dropping like a metal pan and crushing it

5505
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:48,000
it was not that gruesome

5506
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:50,000
it wasn't like smushed

5507
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:52,000
it was just you know

5508
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:54,000
concussed and injured and bleeding

5509
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:56,000
a little bit and it died

5510
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:58,000
that's what you got to do I could have done it again

5511
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:00,000
but I didn't want I don't want to feel its bones

5512
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:02,000
crunching I don't feel its organs

5513
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:04,000
squishing under my foot like

5514
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:06,000
the thing with me is that

5515
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:08,000
like I don't want to have to like

5516
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:10,000
pick it up but I know no one else

5517
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:12,000
will do it and it's

5518
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:14,000
I don't want to leave it there

5519
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:16,000
like a fucking towel

5520
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:18,000
like get the blood off like

5521
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:20,000
you when I moved

5522
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,000
in my old

5523
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:24,000
my old house the sanctity of life has nothing to do with it

5524
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:26,000
it's just gross we had

5525
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:28,000
we had a mouse problem for a while

5526
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,000
at one time

5527
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:32,000
a mouse was definitely running around

5528
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:34,000
in my bedroom and I was like

5529
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:36,000
this is fucking unacceptable this can't

5530
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:38,000
fucking continue and there was a whole

5531
03:23:38,000 --> 03:23:40,000
my old room had a

5532
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:42,000
it had sort of a little

5533
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:44,000
like not a crawl space

5534
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:46,000
it just had a weird like

5535
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:48,000
it was a rectangular room

5536
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:50,000
but on one side of it

5537
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:52,000
between the far wall and the near wall there was just a gap

5538
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:54,000
there was like a two foot wide little like

5539
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:56,000
side space

5540
03:23:56,000 --> 03:23:58,000
that I just kept like a bookshelf in there

5541
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:00,000
and in that

5542
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:02,000
down that little side space

5543
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,000
the inside corner of it at the very corner

5544
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:06,000
underneath the radiator there was a little hole in the wall

5545
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:08,000
and I was like

5546
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:10,000
I saw a mouse one time crawling inside

5547
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:12,000
the radiator

5548
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:14,000
just going from one end of the radiator together

5549
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:16,000
definitely coming from inside that hole

5550
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,000
so I put glue traps

5551
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:20,000
I put a glue trap in front of the hole

5552
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:22,000
and I was like it can't come through here anymore

5553
03:24:22,000 --> 03:24:24,000
it'll step on the glue trap it'll die

5554
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:26,000
I was clean so

5555
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:28,000
fast forward like two years later I'm cleaning up my room

5556
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:30,000
I'm packing up all my stuff I'm moving out

5557
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:32,000
and I'm taking my bookshelf out of that hidey hole

5558
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:34,000
space

5559
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:36,000
and I see underneath it

5560
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:38,000
it's kind of hidden underneath the radiator

5561
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:40,000
I see the glue trap

5562
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:42,000
there's something on it

5563
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:44,000
I'm pretty sure

5564
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,000
that there's just been a dead mouse

5565
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:48,000
you know in the corner of my room

5566
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:50,000
for like a year now and maybe

5567
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:52,000
maybe it was the only mouse

5568
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:54,000
and it got stuck in the glue trap and it died

5569
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:56,000
maybe

5570
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:58,000
it died there and other mice

5571
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:00,000
would look at that hole

5572
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,000
and think maybe I should come out into this room and then they would see

5573
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:04,000
a corpse lying there and be like

5574
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:06,000
no I don't want to go there actually

5575
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:08,000
one way or another

5576
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:10,000
it did stop mice from coming into my room

5577
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,000
I never saw another one

5578
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:14,000
so mission accomplished

5579
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:16,000
didn't you smell dead mouse corpse?

5580
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:18,000
no

5581
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:20,000
I mean in terms of

5582
03:25:20,000 --> 03:25:22,000
like volume of

5583
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:24,000
guts

5584
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:26,000
mice don't have a lot

5585
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:28,000
they're quite small they're very small

5586
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:30,000
well this was Elton

5587
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,000
I didn't look I didn't

5588
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:34,000
I didn't want to look at it I didn't examine it closely

5589
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:36,000
I'm pretty sure it was like a desiccated mouse

5590
03:25:36,000 --> 03:25:38,000
it was so

5591
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:40,000
I couldn't even really tell what it was

5592
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:42,000
when I saw it

5593
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:44,000
but I think if I had looked closely I would have seen

5594
03:25:44,000 --> 03:25:46,000
like a withered mouse

5595
03:25:46,000 --> 03:25:48,000
remnants

5596
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:50,000
I suspect

5597
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:52,000
I mean how much does a mouse weigh

5598
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:54,000
you could compare that to like leaving a bit of meat on the floor

5599
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:56,000
right?

5600
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:58,000
like one ounce

5601
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:00,000
like nothing at all

5602
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:02,000
house mouse like 0.68

5603
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:04,000
mouse mouse one ounce

5604
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:06,000
less than an ounce

5605
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:08,000
waylord just like waylord

5606
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:10,000
a mouse is lighter than air

5607
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:12,000
by volume

5608
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:14,000
it floats like a balloon

5609
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:16,000
that's a fact

5610
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:18,000
does that mean tiny

5611
03:26:18,000 --> 03:26:20,000
now that's a tiny fact

5612
03:26:20,000 --> 03:26:22,000
yeah it has

5613
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:24,000
yeah it's volume

5614
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:26,000
and it's mass

5615
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:28,000
if you calculate it

5616
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:30,000
it's literally lighter than air

5617
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:32,000
and it's called the float whale

5618
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:34,000
it's a float whale pokemon

5619
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:36,000
it literally like floats like a balloon

5620
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:38,000
alright so like a house mouse is like

5621
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:40,000
0.04 pounds

5622
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:42,000
that's like

5623
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:44,000
a 25th of a pound

5624
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:46,000
so if I take a pound of meat out of the freezer

5625
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:48,000
it's less than an ounce

5626
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:50,000
and take like

5627
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:52,000
less than a 20th

5628
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:54,000
take like 4% of it and leave it on the floor

5629
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:56,000
that's not gonna smell

5630
03:26:56,000 --> 03:26:58,000
I don't think so

5631
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:00,000
I have

5632
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:02,000
one story

5633
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:04,000
on the topic of being afraid to squish things

5634
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:06,000
this is a

5635
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:08,000
horror story from my real life

5636
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:10,000
you know it's October

5637
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:12,000
it's the season

5638
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:14,000
for spookies

5639
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:16,000
boo

5640
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:18,000
no spookies allowed

5641
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:20,000
so I was living

5642
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:22,000
in Dunedin

5643
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:24,000
which is at the bottom of the south

5644
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,000
island of New Zealand

5645
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:28,000
it's in

5646
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:30,000
I'll post this image in chat

5647
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:32,000
because I lived in the north island most of my life

5648
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:34,000
but my family spent like

5649
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:36,000
5 or 6 years living in Otago

5650
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:38,000
specifically in Dunedin

5651
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:40,000
and we're not supposed to get

5652
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:42,000
a lot of bugs in that area

5653
03:27:42,000 --> 03:27:44,000
like most of the

5654
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:46,000
New Zealand doesn't have many nasty bugs or animals

5655
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:48,000
in fact it's one of the nicest places on earth

5656
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:50,000
for avoiding that stuff

5657
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:54,000
but we were in Dunedin

5658
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:56,000
I was playing in the sand pit in the backyard

5659
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:58,000
and I felt a scratch

5660
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:00,000
scratch on my neck

5661
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:02,000
and I'm like

5662
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:04,000
I just kind of flicked at it

5663
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:06,000
and then a few seconds later I feel it again

5664
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:08,000
terrifying

5665
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:10,000
and then I feel it really strongly

5666
03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:12,000
it's like on the side of my jaw

5667
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:14,000
and I see something out of the corner of my eye

5668
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:16,000
I swipe at it and a fucking

5669
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:18,000
Avondale spider

5670
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:20,000
drops into the sand in front of me

5671
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:22,000
Avondale spider

5672
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:24,000
I put a picture

5673
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:26,000
that's a big boy

5674
03:28:26,000 --> 03:28:28,000
they are fucking huge

5675
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:30,000
these things are not supposed to be in the south island

5676
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:32,000
they're supposedly not there

5677
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:34,000
but there is one of these fucking things on my face

5678
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:36,000
I was like 8 years old

5679
03:28:36,000 --> 03:28:38,000
I screamed

5680
03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:40,000
yeah I mean fair

5681
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:42,000
I would

5682
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:44,000
I was fucking crying

5683
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:46,000
and my sister out to kill it

5684
03:28:46,000 --> 03:28:48,000
and my sister didn't want to squish it

5685
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:50,000
I thought you can't squish it

5686
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:52,000
it's so big it must have bones

5687
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:54,000
I'm getting uncomfortable

5688
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:56,000
get this fucking image out of here

5689
03:28:56,000 --> 03:28:58,000
no I guess I'll leave it it's fine

5690
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:00,000
no I can bear it

5691
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:02,000
the people can suffer

5692
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:04,000
this was on my face Ben

5693
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:06,000
I was like

5694
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:08,000
oh what if it's more spiders on me and I took a shower

5695
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:10,000
but my sister used up two whole cans of fly spray

5696
03:29:10,000 --> 03:29:12,000
on this thing

5697
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:14,000
one time I found a caterpillar crawling on my shoulder

5698
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:16,000
and I was like oh my god what if there are other caterpillars on me

5699
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:18,000
what if they're just on me all the time

5700
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:20,000
and I just don't even know what to throw on me right now

5701
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:22,000
caterpillars are cute though

5702
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:24,000
I hate caterpillars

5703
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:26,000
they're wriggly and squishy usually

5704
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:28,000
they're big and squishy

5705
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:30,000
they're fat and they're gross

5706
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:32,000
we have them

5707
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:34,000
they're slow and not a spider

5708
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:36,000
I'm gonna throw up just thinking about them

5709
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:38,000
we have

5710
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:40,000
a thing where I live

5711
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:42,000
in other places too

5712
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:44,000
we have these things called gypsy moths

5713
03:29:44,000 --> 03:29:46,000
I wonder if you're not supposed to call them that

5714
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:48,000
anymore

5715
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:50,000
but yeah that's what they're called

5716
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:52,000
and that's what everyone calls them

5717
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:54,000
and they have

5718
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:56,000
part of the year in trees

5719
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:58,000
they would

5720
03:29:58,000 --> 03:30:00,000
in the corner of trees

5721
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:02,000
in the corner of branches

5722
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:04,000
they would have these big white masses

5723
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:06,000
of webs of nets or whatever

5724
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:08,000
and they would lay their eggs in there

5725
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:10,000
and then some years

5726
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:12,000
there would just be a big harvest of them

5727
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:14,000
and you would just find them

5728
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:16,000
crawling up your house's walls

5729
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:18,000
and garage doors

5730
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:20,000
around

5731
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:22,000
and then they would die

5732
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:24,000
and then you'd find their corpses all over

5733
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:26,000
the fucking place

5734
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:28,000
the gypsy moths are

5735
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:30,000
particularly disgusting

5736
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:32,000
they're not cute at all

5737
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:34,000
but even the so called cute ones

5738
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:36,000
I think are pretty nasty

5739
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:38,000
and disgusting and I don't want to think about them

5740
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:40,000
oh the gypsy moth caterpillars

5741
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:42,000
they're kind of gross looking actually

5742
03:30:42,000 --> 03:30:44,000
they really are, they're not pleasant

5743
03:30:44,000 --> 03:30:46,000
when I was at school we had like monarch

5744
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:48,000
caterpillars

5745
03:30:48,000 --> 03:30:50,000
we just had a plant that had a bunch of ease

5746
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:52,000
and we would watch them and then they'd go into a cocoon

5747
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:54,000
and we would like wait for the butterfly to come out

5748
03:30:54,000 --> 03:30:56,000
and it was really cool

5749
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:58,000
that's pretty cool

5750
03:30:58,000 --> 03:31:00,000
yeah I mean these are in like a

5751
03:31:00,000 --> 03:31:02,000
these are not

5752
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:04,000
they're funny, he's reaching

5753
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:06,000
he's halo reaching

5754
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:08,000
I would be absolutely disgusted

5755
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:10,000
if one were on me or if I had to touch one

5756
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:12,000
like

5757
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:14,000
I let them crawl on my fingers

5758
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:16,000
not the spider though

5759
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:18,000
having long hair

5760
03:31:18,000 --> 03:31:20,000
sometimes freaks me out

5761
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:22,000
cause like you know it touches my neck

5762
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:24,000
and I'm like well that's my hair

5763
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:26,000
you know I know what that feels like

5764
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:28,000
and then occasionally like I don't know

5765
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:30,000
a bit will like fall

5766
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:32,000
whereas it's been balanced and it falls onto my neck

5767
03:31:32,000 --> 03:31:34,000
and I feel like something is suddenly touching my neck

5768
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:36,000
and I'm like oh my god

5769
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:38,000
there's something touching my neck now

5770
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:40,000
but it's just my hair again

5771
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:42,000
and then sometimes there is a bug

5772
03:31:42,000 --> 03:31:44,000
and I don't know what to think

5773
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:46,000
at any moment

5774
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:48,000
any feeling I could feel

5775
03:31:48,000 --> 03:31:50,000
could be like death

5776
03:31:50,000 --> 03:31:52,000
you will die

5777
03:31:52,000 --> 03:31:54,000
I was walking

5778
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:56,000
this is an old story now

5779
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:58,000
this might have been pre-COVID even

5780
03:31:58,000 --> 03:32:00,000
but I was walking around with

5781
03:32:00,000 --> 03:32:02,000
Kazi and Munchie

5782
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:04,000
and Munchie had like a

5783
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:06,000
he was like he like

5784
03:32:06,000 --> 03:32:08,000
jerked or moved and he was like and there was like a beetle in his hair

5785
03:32:08,000 --> 03:32:10,000
there was just like a beetle crawling around

5786
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:12,000
in his hair or I think it was a beetle

5787
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:14,000
or it might have been

5788
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:16,000
it might have been like a big

5789
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:18,000
it was some kind of like fairly large insect

5790
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:20,000
was just like in his hair and he was like what

5791
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:22,000
ugh and he was grossed out

5792
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:24,000
and then like an hour later

5793
03:32:24,000 --> 03:32:26,000
there just was another one

5794
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:28,000
there's just two of these same like

5795
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:30,000
I think they were beetles, these black beetles

5796
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:32,000
and he was very disturbed by this

5797
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:34,000
because it's like how many more are there gonna be

5798
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:36,000
I came home from the movie theater

5799
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:38,000
recently

5800
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:40,000
we saw a movie I think

5801
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:42,000
actually maybe it was I don't know

5802
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:44,000
we came home from somewhere like a week ago

5803
03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:46,000
and I just felt something tugging on my arm

5804
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:48,000
when I moved my arm I felt something like tugging

5805
03:32:48,000 --> 03:32:50,000
and it was like restricting my

5806
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:52,000
movement and I realized like after like

5807
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:54,000
a minute of fumbling around it was a spider web

5808
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:56,000
but like a really really strong one

5809
03:32:56,000 --> 03:32:58,000
like just a single thread

5810
03:32:58,000 --> 03:33:00,000
that had like wrapped itself around my body

5811
03:33:00,000 --> 03:33:02,000
it was like near invisible and I could feel it

5812
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:04,000
and I was trying to get it off me

5813
03:33:04,000 --> 03:33:06,000
and then my husband

5814
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:08,000
was like trying to help me and then it got stuck to him

5815
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:10,000
and he was like what the fuck this is strong

5816
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:12,000
and I don't know where it came from

5817
03:33:12,000 --> 03:33:14,000
but it was like a single long thread

5818
03:33:14,000 --> 03:33:16,000
that was at least like three or four meters

5819
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:18,000
long

5820
03:33:18,000 --> 03:33:20,000
I've never had a spider web

5821
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:22,000
thread that's like so strong that I'm like

5822
03:33:22,000 --> 03:33:24,000
oh it's pulling on me like it's

5823
03:33:24,000 --> 03:33:26,000
yeah like and I tried to like pull it

5824
03:33:26,000 --> 03:33:28,000
to break but like I guess it was also like

5825
03:33:28,000 --> 03:33:30,000
it just kind of got taught

5826
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:32,000
it was weird

5827
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:34,000
was it like twisted around like a rope

5828
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:36,000
it was sort of like on my arm

5829
03:33:36,000 --> 03:33:38,000
sort of wrapped around my arm a bit

5830
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:40,000
and then like went around the back of my chest

5831
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:42,000
and maybe like my shoulder

5832
03:33:42,000 --> 03:33:44,000
or something and it was also like

5833
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:46,000
sucked in my hair in some aspect

5834
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:48,000
I was trying to get it off for like

5835
03:33:48,000 --> 03:33:50,000
a good like five minutes with one long

5836
03:33:50,000 --> 03:33:52,000
thread

5837
03:33:52,000 --> 03:33:54,000
I don't know what kind of spider would make that

5838
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:56,000
but I never found a spider

5839
03:33:56,000 --> 03:33:58,000
there was um

5840
03:33:58,000 --> 03:34:00,000
okay funny

5841
03:34:00,000 --> 03:34:02,000
funny exterminator story

5842
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:04,000
I was talking to my

5843
03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:06,000
Brazilian roommate

5844
03:34:06,000 --> 03:34:08,000
about the mouse we had both seen the mouse

5845
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:10,000
and uh

5846
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:12,000
I was relaying to him a funny factoid

5847
03:34:12,000 --> 03:34:14,000
which was that someone I knew

5848
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:16,000
once had an exterminator

5849
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:18,000
I think it was like a store that they worked at

5850
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:20,000
and like an exterminator came in to like

5851
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:22,000
do pest control and there was like

5852
03:34:22,000 --> 03:34:24,000
there was like a crab there was an ocean crab

5853
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:26,000
like living in their basement

5854
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:28,000
or something the exterminator had to get rid of a crab

5855
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:30,000
that just lived there

5856
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:32,000
for reasons that nobody knows and

5857
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:34,000
I told him this fact and he was like

5858
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:36,000
uh crab like what's uh

5859
03:34:36,000 --> 03:34:38,000
what's what's what's that what's a crab

5860
03:34:38,000 --> 03:34:40,000
like he didn't know the word in English and I was like

5861
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:42,000
uh

5862
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:44,000
I'm like trying to think how do I explain what a crab is

5863
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:46,000
I'm like well it's you know it's in the ocean

5864
03:34:46,000 --> 03:34:48,000
it's got a shell

5865
03:34:48,000 --> 03:34:50,000
and finally I had to do the little

5866
03:34:50,000 --> 03:34:52,000
like I had to do a little crab walk

5867
03:34:52,000 --> 03:34:54,000
I had to put my hands up in little pinchers and move

5868
03:34:54,000 --> 03:34:56,000
move side to side going like huh

5869
03:34:56,000 --> 03:34:58,000
and he was like oh yeah

5870
03:34:58,000 --> 03:35:00,000
like I got it

5871
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:02,000
I did the I had to I pantomimed it

5872
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:04,000
and it's the universal language

5873
03:35:04,000 --> 03:35:06,000
that that that gesture

5874
03:35:06,000 --> 03:35:08,000
means crab it's in in every language

5875
03:35:08,000 --> 03:35:10,000
across the globe actually you were a crab but were you

5876
03:35:10,000 --> 03:35:12,000
crab core

5877
03:35:12,000 --> 03:35:14,000
yeah for a moment yeah just for a moment

5878
03:35:14,000 --> 03:35:16,000
I think so

5883
03:35:24,000 --> 03:35:26,000

5888
03:35:34,000 --> 03:35:36,000
emo like metal music was going through

5889
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:38,000
it's like

5890
03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:40,000
weird you're like well like when metal

5891
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:42,000

I guess I guess

5896
03:35:50,000 --> 03:35:52,000
I guess and at the time

5897
03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:54,000
people liked the metal core bands

5898
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:56,000
where

5899
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:58,000
but they're like the bands where the

5900
03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:00,000
