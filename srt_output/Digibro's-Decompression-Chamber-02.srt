1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
So, one of my favorite things about Jesse's podcast, especially the perfect cast, is

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,840
that he'll actually record it in segments over the course of like a week or however

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,720
long it takes to set up the podcast. It's something that had never really occurred to

4
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,640
me. You know, it's sort of a thing that you're, a luxury you're afforded by doing a solo podcast

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,360
as opposed to having other guests because you don't have to organize a bunch of people

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,200
to get together more than once, you know, in the course of a, of however long you can

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,880
just record segments and throw them in and it's, it's no biggie. So I wanted to do that.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:06,080
This is being recorded on the 24th, right after having woken up after releasing the

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,920
previous podcast. I actually passed out listening to my own podcast. I did not make it all the

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,760
way through. I just sort of had it on and then crashed that fucking theme of, of guts

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,840
from Berserk, man. It's a, it's a real soothing track. So anyways, I wanted to continue with

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,080
thought that I like kind of cut myself off with in there where I was rambling so much

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,640
about how scatterbrained I am that I scatterbrainedly forgot what I was going to say. Because

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,800
I was saying that towards the beginning I said that when I go out to eat or something

15
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,240
or like celebrate after releasing a video that it creates a sort of bad habit and I said

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,280
I'd get back to it and I never did. Well, here's the explanation of that that I realized

17
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:01,280
over the last week, which is that by not having the catharsis of having accomplished something,

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,840
I think it helps to drive me to keep creating stuff like out of desperation because like

19
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,400
for me, you know, that moment when the video goes live and I see the first couple comments

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,440
that I sort of confirmed that it's there is like the big release, you know, it's like,

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,960
it's the coming night and day, if you will, of like finishing, you know, I've written

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,040
something that I'm proud of and I feel great about it, but it's not until it's out there

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,720
that it feels over, you know, that like the thing is done and now I can just bask in the

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,520
glory of having done it, you know. So when I put out a video, when one actually releases,

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,880
that's when I feel like the, ah, now I have done something, then I tend to, you know,

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,080
calm down and relax and do other stuff and not feel the need to, you know, stress over

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,600
the next video as much. But I think that because of the way that like I gave DeVu these two

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,320
videos to edit and I've been working on all this other stuff, then like there's been no,

29
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,720
like with the novel or the videos that I've been working on, there's been no sense of

30
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,560
release yet because all six videos are not out, you know, DeVu hasn't even, hasn't even

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,960
considered starting working on them because he's working on the previous videos and we

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,600
still have one more that we want to do before September's over that we haven't even started

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,960
on yet, not September, October. But anyways, yeah, so all these things that are piling

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,160
up, it helps to feel itself where it's like I can keep working and working because I haven't

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,480
felt that any of these projects have concluded, so it's easier to, you know, keep going through

36
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:45,320
that stuff. Which is kind of why I, like part of the reason I've slowed down vlogs a bit

37
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,560
because when I was doing tons and tons of vlogs, it was like this constant sensation

38
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,360
of getting things done, which was at some point when it was like at its most height,

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,520
like when I was just doing shit tons of vlogs, like after the summer season of anime and

40
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,480
I was like covering all the, or was it the spring season? The spring season. When the

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,680
spring season ended and like I covered all those shows, then there was a brief period

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
where I wasn't working on the main channel quite as much and part of that was because

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,680
I was, you know, building up to this whole everyone moving in thing and I really thought

44
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,280
I was going to like make vlogs, the central focus of my channel, which I still have plans

45
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,720
to make vlogs a bigger focus. Me and Victor just finally got the lighting setup done for

46
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,680
the studio space that we have that you've, that the plebe and the weave was filmed in.

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
I mean, we were using Victor's like professional lighting kit for that and we probably will

48
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,760
again for the plebe and the weave because that one's a little bit higher for production

49
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,520
value, but like with the original concept of building the studio was that I wanted there

50
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,920
to be lights that are just in there and that once the studio was set up, it would be very

51
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,760
easy to just walk in, turn everything on and start filming. You know, I wanted it to be

52
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,760
a setup that, that, that if I wanted to do just casual vlogs with like me and whoever

53
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,040
else was with me, then we could easily set it up and easily shoot it and it would look

54
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,760
professional enough that it could go on the main channel, but it wouldn't be like a super

55
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,040
high production value video, you know. So we finally got the lights set up to make that

56
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,880
possible and I just need to finish building the set and then, you know, I haven't been

57
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,000
vlogging currently because I'm working on all these huge projects, but like the fact that

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,640
I already have six videos written, like if we decided not to go through with a video

59
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,000
every day for all of November, I still have more than enough videos to cover November.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,880
So like, you know, at some point when I've written so far ahead of myself that I've got

61
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,160
like months worth of backlog ready to go, then vlogging will be easy because I'll just

62
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,680
be like, wow, all my work for this month is completely done so I can just do whatever

63
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,000
I want, let's vlog, you know, or just keep my backlog going, just keep building it bigger

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and bigger until I've got like a, you know, I've gotten way ahead of myself, which would

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,200
be great. Getting ahead of yourself is something that I think every creative wants and none

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,600
of us have pulled off, you know. Everyone I know talks about how badly they want to

67
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:18,840
have a backlog. Everyone really wants or at least to have, you know, just to have, God,

68
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,040
to be a couple weeks ahead of yourself, to not always feel like you're at the end of

69
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,880
your rope at the end of the month, like, oh my God, I have to have something come out,

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,820
you know, in the next few days, we're also not going to make any money this month, you

71
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,000
know, like to already have that financial guarantee allows you to go and experiment and

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,880
do other things in the meantime, which is why I wanted my Patreon to get so high and

73
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,920
it has gotten to that point where like I've got enough money now that I can make a few

74
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:53,060
videos and then go experiment and go do whatever I want, you know, or in the case of like the

75
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,560
early months of this year, me and DeVoo were like following a tight schedule where I was

76
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
like planning out all the videos that were going to happen in a month and then I'd give

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,000
him the plans and we were like editing down to a specific time frame. But yeah, we can

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
keep doing stuff like that now and so the vlogs will probably start coming. But yeah,

79
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,040
I do think that there's some value in just stockpiling stuff and never getting that sense

80
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,800
of like, I'm just done, oh, we put out a video, I feel so good, I don't feel like I have to

81
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,920
do anything else for the rest of the week, you know, it's a lot more intense and I like

82
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,040
it this way because like it might sound like, well, you know, that lack of gratification

83
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,040
must be, you know, must make it difficult. It's like, you know, it's not, it's like not

84
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,680
jacking off for a whole week. But you know what happens when you don't do that is that

85
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,680
you, at the end, when you finally do, then it's bigger and better than ever before. And

86
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,680
so, but the thing is that, you know, oh God, I can't stop with this jacking off metaphor

87
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,200
so I apologize ahead of time. But the thing is that the act of jacking off is already

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,000
the part that feels good, you know, the big after you come, then you just feel like bored

89
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,880
and miserable. So really, it's like I'm edging my way through all these videos and it feels

90
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,480
great because I'm constantly writing and writing makes me feel great or working on videos

91
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:28,480
makes me feel great. So it's like this nonstop edging and thankfully, unlike with, with masturbation,

92
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,520
it doesn't eventually give you blue balls and start to hurt. Although I guess my back

93
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,360
hurts a lot from sitting in this chair for like two weeks straight, you know, and not

94
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,960
moving and not doing anything. So I guess that's the blue balls of the writing world.

95
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,440
I apologize for how disgusting this metaphor got.

96
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Alright, this is section two. It's around five in the morning on the 26th of October

97
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,240
and I just woke up, but I wanted to talk about some stuff. I'm going to talk shop for a little

98
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:10,280
bit. I'm going to talk about some of the secrets of how I do my work and how I, how I approach

99
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:18,120
trying to have a successful YouTube channel because I know some people who are really

100
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,840
like all about chasing the numbers, chasing success, trying to, you know, make something

101
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,600
that appeals to the highest number of people or is like trendy or just like, you know,

102
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,560
what can I cover that everyone wants to see right now? And there's other people who are

103
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,560
completely against even attempting to, you know, curve their content towards mass appeal

104
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,640
and personally, I kind of fall not so much in the middle, so much as all-encompassing.

105
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,120
What my goal has always been is how can I talk about whatever I want and make people care

106
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,760
about it? You know, how can I drive people towards my opinions and my content and the

107
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,440
things I want to talk about? Like, how can I make them want to engage with this? So,

108
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,280
you know, and I'm not saying that every project can do this. Sometimes I do stuff just because

109
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,960
I feel like it. Like Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s, a video series that as I mentioned in

110
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,960
the last episode of this, like, I never expected it to be huge. Now, Akiyuki Shinbo is a pretty

111
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,400
well-known anime director, so I knew this was not going to be like a go nowhere series

112
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,080
in the way that it would be if, say, I had made a video called Shinichiro Kobayashi in

113
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,400
the ever, you know, no one knows who that is, which is why that video is called the master

114
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:53,400
in the background of 40 years of Japanese anime or whatever it's called. So, yeah, like,

115
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,840
with Shinbo I knew I could at least use his name, but you know, the first video it's got

116
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,320
a big face of Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho because it's the most popular show that Shinbo worked

117
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,120
on, the one that would probably get the most people to click on it on the basis of what

118
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,120
character was on the thumbnail. And I don't think anyone truly appreciates how fucking

119
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,080
important the thumbnail and title are for a YouTube video success. No one seems to get

120
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,640
it. Like, I keep telling people and they're like, okay, yeah, sure, that seems right,

121
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,880
you know, and I keep showing them the numbers and how they correlate. They're like, okay,

122
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,360
I guess, you know, but no one, you don't understand. The only thing that matters if you want your

123
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,720
video to be successful is the title and the fucking thumbnail. That's it. That is all

124
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,000
that matters because no one knows what the content of your video is until they click

125
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,920
on it. No one has any idea, you know, they don't know how great your video is. They don't

126
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,360
know how genius it is. They don't know what's going on with it. In fact, they don't really

127
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:03,160
know that until it gets to a point where it's genius, you know, I think one of the biggest

128
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,400
reasons that endless Jess has never, you know, gotten the like a claim that he deserves is

129
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,360
because he takes too much of an artistic approach to his videos where his titles are always

130
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,600
very clever, especially if you know the video, you always are like, wow, that's a that's

131
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
a genius title, but it's not clickbait, you know, or have a great thumbnail that's like

132
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,560
really iconically staged, but it's not clickbait. Because what clickbait is is a close up of

133
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,240
someone's face. It always is that it's always a close up of someone's face. And if you like

134
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,040
take the YouTube tutoring shit, like where, you know, you get contacts from YouTube themselves

135
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,920
and like have advice with them, they tell you this, they tell you like close ups of faces.

136
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,680
That's what works, you know, I started doing it after Game Grumps talked about it. Like

137
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,840
they said that, you know, they had looked at all the big channels, all the market research

138
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,040
and everyone who was successful was saying, yeah, close ups of faces, because it's just

139
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,800
the most like intimate human connection, you can form with something instantly, you see

140
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,680
a bright starry face, you know, you just want to click on her or a or a gross face or someone

141
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,040
making a face, you know, some kind of reaction face, they always work. It's why like the

142
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,480
React series, the, you know, whoever reacts to whatever series is like always three pictures

143
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,360
of people's faces making different extreme reactions, you know, or why every big YouTuber,

144
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,800
you know, puts themselves edited into the thumbnails. You know, we were parodying that

145
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:43,680
with Movie News Weekly, my brother's hilarious video that's on Digibro After Dark. And like,

146
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,800
I understand why that could be frustrating for people. Like someone like Jesse, I don't

147
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,440
see him ever trying to curb himself to like have every video have a face thumbnail. He

148
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,520
would not do that because it would be artistically dissatisfying, you know, that instead of coming

149
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,520
up with these genius thumbnails that he does for every video that aren't clickbait, but

150
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,840
they are great thumbnails, you know, to instead try to make stuff that appeals to everybody.

151
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,360
Now for me, what I enjoy the most is when I get to have my cake and eat it too. When

152
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,240
I get to do exactly what I want to do, but also convince people that they want the same

153
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,720
thing. So that's why I go all out on the clickbait of the thumbnails and the titles. Because

154
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,000
to me, those are the least important elements of my video anyway. You know, those are an

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,480
afterthought. They have nothing to do with the actual content of the video. The job of

156
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,560
the title and the thumbnail is just to get people to click on the video. And especially

157
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:51,520
if I can somehow get you, if I can have a thumbnail and a title that are just dishonest

158
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,840
enough to get you to click on the video, but not so dishonest that you feel lied to after

159
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,440
you watch the video, that's the perfect sweet spot. That's what I'm always going for. It's

160
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,960
how can I title this in a way that, so like, you know, I just put out this video called

161
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,800
10 anime music videos you should check out. Now you, you already know that the clickbait

162
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,000
formula is top 10s. All the biggest anime channels are top 10 channels, best anime tops or like,

163
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,160
you know, Misty Kronexia, they do top 10s. It's just a clean number that people always

164
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,480
want to know. Now I didn't do top 10 anime music videos and that would have gotten even

165
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,160
better results probably, but I just didn't want to do that because I didn't want to put

166
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,400
these in order and I was making a lot more than 10 and like, it just wasn't what I wanted

167
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,080
to do. But 10 in itself is a great thing to have up there. You know, it's a great way

168
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,000
to get people to look just any kind of number, any kind of round solid number is always great.

169
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,200
And I didn't want it to say 15 or 20 because I actually recommend like 20 videos. If it

170
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,800
said 20, then it's overwhelming. It's like, oh, I don't, I don't think I'm going to have

171
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,520
time to watch 20 anime music videos, you know, but if it's 10, it's like, hmm, I could probably

172
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,080
watch all that and an hour, you know, that's anime music videos three minutes long, you

173
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,600
know, of course I want to know what 10 anime music videos I should watch right now, you

174
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,760
know, the video is 15 minutes long suggests that maybe this won't take you all day. But

175
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,840
of course it's a lot more than 10 recommendations. But if it said 17 or 18, it's not the same.

176
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,280
It's not the same as 10. But no one's going to complain that they got more than 10. No

177
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,160
one's going to say like, oh, you bastard, you tricked me. There were more than 10 in

178
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,240
this video. If anything, they're all happy about it. I mean, a bunch of people have pointed

179
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,200
it out. Most of them think it's funny because it is funny. It's kind of a joke. And that's

180
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,160
why at the end of the video, I call attention to it. I'm like, that was like 10 or so music

181
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,520
videos, I guess, whatever this video is long. Now let's move on, you know, like the joke

182
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:06,320
sort of is it was more than 10. And, you know, that's the kind of thing that I love doing

183
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:15,200
the most is if I can if I can give you a title that you you go, you know, and this happens

184
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,520
to varying degrees, people were a little bit more wary of like, how to recognize a great

185
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,240
anime in just one episode or how to recognize a terrible anime in just one episode, because

186
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,360
those titles weren't exactly what I was doing. They were, you know, close enough, in my opinion,

187
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,760
and I didn't really have a better title for those videos. But they were close enough to

188
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,760
the same thing as what I was doing that, you know, and some people did call out like this

189
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,280
is not actually what the video is. And I was like, yeah, that's kind of fair. But what

190
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,760
would you have titled this video? You know, like it's it is what it is kind of and the

191
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,400
title is what would be the most attention grabbing and it worked wonders. Those titles

192
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,000
and those thumbnails were unbelievably successful, especially the one for how to recognize a terrible

193
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,480
anime in just one episode, super provocative title, you know, people want to know how to

194
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,040
do that, people want to know why you think you can do that, you know, they're upset immediately.

195
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,800
And I've got this super close up of the super cute girl from gate just staring right into

196
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,920
the camera looking moe as fuck. Because you got to remember that even though the anime

197
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:34,320
sphere talks so much shit about cute girls, they overwhelmingly adore cute girls. There's

198
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,400
a reason cute girls are so fucking successful and popular, you know, it's kind of like how

199
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,720
even though Kaon gets shit talked all the time by people who are like, oh, this is the

200
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,160
death of anime, everything's cute girls, that show is super successful. Tons of people have

201
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,520
seen that, you know, both in Japan and the West. I mean, it wasn't as successful here

202
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,440
in terms of like sales figures because I mean, Bandai did a terrible job of releasing most

203
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,800
of the things they released in the late 2000s at way overpriced prices when everyone else

204
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,880
was slashing their prices down to nothing and not really advertising shows like Kaon,

205
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,520
at least not in the US. So it's kind of perplexing that they were like releasing it for these

206
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,480
high budget, you know, high budget release but not really advertising it that well. We're

207
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,640
like, you know, letting people know what it is or what the appeal is. But yeah, like,

208
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,560
I feel like, you know, people want so badly to portray this image that we're totally not

209
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,840
about cute girls, but they are. They are totally about cute girls by and large, you know. Maybe

210
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,200
those people aren't the ones leaving the comments because the people commenting about anime are

211
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,520
the ones who are dissatisfied. The people who are satisfied have no reason to raise hell

212
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,280
about how many cute girls there are, but the cute girls are the most popular. So if you

213
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,200
post some cute girl, if you post a hot anime girl in your picture, you know, Misty Kronexia

214
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,760
is like disgusting without he games the system, you know, he just straight up posts like the

215
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,120
most pornographic thumbnails he can get away with. And of course people click on it because

216
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,000
like, I mean, every time I see one, I'm like, I come very close to clicking on it. I'm like,

217
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,480
I want to know what this incredibly hot anime girl is from, but I know I'm not going to

218
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,800
get the answer because I know the formula. I know that Misty Kronexia is just putting

219
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
that thumbnail there. So you'll click on the video and then you'll have to, you know,

220
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,200
look at his fucking bald ass while he like talks to you about a bunch of other bullshit

221
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,040
that I don't care about. And I'm never going to find that thumbnail that I wanted that I

222
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,000
came for. So that's why, you know, and I'm not willing to go that far because I have a

223
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,200
brand. I have a brand that is somewhat classy, somewhat, you know, approachable, somewhat

224
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,520
like this guy appeal. I want to simultaneously appeal to hardcore otaku while also suggesting

225
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,080
to the people who are embarrassed about hardcore otaku that they can totally watch the videos

226
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,920
as well. You know, whereas like Misty Kronexia, I don't, I think a lot of people would be

227
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:10,160
embarrassed to say that they liked him, you know, whereas the people who just don't care,

228
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,640
especially younger people who just don't give a fuck are going to watch all the videos.

229
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,680
So, you know, I want to hit that middle ground. But again, for me, it's all about these middle

230
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:26,840
grounds. It's all about maximum viewer engagement. But like in terms of getting the most views

231
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,440
possible while still making what I wanted to make. And it can never be lazy, because

232
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,880
like I don't want to make lazy videos. I don't want to make videos that are just about getting

233
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,680
clicks. I want people to click on a video that I thought was great. And I'm going to

234
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,360
make them think it's great. So with the anime music videos thing, like for me, what was the

235
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,200
in what made that video fulfilling is that this video comes out for the song called Shelter.

236
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,760
Like it's super big. Everyone's talking about it. And I think, A, I can capitalize on the

237
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,440
success of Shelter to talk about a part of the medium that I'm a big fan of that people

238
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,360
don't talk about enough. You know, I love anime music videos. I get this is now a platform

239
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,560
being afforded to me to share ones that I like. I also want to have seen them all and

240
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,080
to be able to suggest all the good ones I can think of. Now we'll say, um, god damn,

241
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,800
there's a lot of people who are commenting with like, why not this show? Why not that

242
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,480
one? Why didn't you include this? A lot of them are ones I just haven't seen because

243
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,240
in spite of the fact that I see, I said I've seen them all. There's some that are not really

244
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,120
because I watched everything that's considered a music video by my anime list. So anything

245
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,560
that's not professionally released, you know, I didn't watch some of the animator expo shorts

246
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,040
that I still haven't seen yet were music videos, which I fucking tried to look into that. I

247
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,520
like looked up, you know, which ones are music videos. I didn't get like any results that were

248
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,760
helpful. So that's why I didn't include more animator expo ones because I wasn't sure which

249
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,880
one are music videos and I haven't seen all of the animator expo yet. But I can probably

250
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,240
just do a video about the animator expo at a later date. But you know, there's there's

251
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,640
a few I didn't include said and seen him some because I just didn't care for them and stuff.

252
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,720
But like, you know, ultimately the point of the video was to just share a bunch of them.

253
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,660
It wasn't about like, here's a comprehensive list, nor was it about here's a top list.

254
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,280
A lot of people seem to think this was a top 10, which was not at all the case, but you

255
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,000
know, whatever. So but the idea was like, let's have seen all the music videos that

256
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,120
I that I can and let's share all these cool ones and like get people to watch something

257
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,960
that they wouldn't have watched otherwise that they would never have known existed.

258
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,160
So, you know, the amount of research I put into this vastly outweighs what anyone else

259
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,880
would put into a 10 list of any kind, you know, because that's my style. I want to overwhelm

260
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,380
with how much research I do. I want to be that guy who went that far, you know, not

261
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:09,160
only because it's cool, it makes me look cool, but also because I just that's the kind of

262
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,640
content I want to see. I wish everyone was doing this much research into a top 10 list,

263
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,480
you know, and if I can do that much research for something and pour that much heart and

264
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,280
energy into it and yet still have it managed to be successful, that will be the perfect

265
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:32,320
thing, you know. So the title and the thumbnail are entirely in service of that and I I capitalized

266
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,040
so hard on shelter for this. Like I just took, you know, I showed clips from it at the start.

267
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,800
I mentioned it. I never mentioned my opinion of it, which is just kind of meh, you know,

268
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,560
I just say, hey, shelter's really popular. Here's a bunch of other anime music videos,

269
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,320
you know, I'm not here to start a fight. I'm not here to make people talk about shelter.

270
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm here to make people watch these videos using shelter as the springboard. And of course

271
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,160
I use shelter as the thumbnail. And I would have liked a different thumbnail. I didn't

272
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,000
want it to be the exact same one that the fucking video itself uses. I did crop it to

273
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,920
be a better fit for my style, which is like hyper close up with with blue in the background.

274
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,960
That's the thing. The thumbnail was too perfect, like, because it's super close up of a cute

275
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,720
girl's face and it's got a bright blue sky. And for whatever reason, bright blue does really

276
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,800
well for me. I don't know if this is true of everybody. I don't know if there's any science

277
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,560
behind this. And I have some thumbnails that are on big videos that aren't all blue, but

278
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:35,880
almost all of my biggest videos are all blue thumbnails. Sword Art Online sucks part one,

279
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,360
blue thumbnail. Why good anime is hard to make? Blue thumbnail. How to recognize a terrible

280
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,760
anime in just one episode? Blue thumbnail. Why one piece works so well? Blue thumbnail.

281
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,360
So and most of them are blue either because of hair or because of the sky. So blue just

282
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,480
seems to be a really attention grabbing thumbnail for whatever kind of audience watches my video.

283
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,720
So I definitely gravitate to and I like them too. I love like blue how it pops off of the

284
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,480
screen and stuff. So, you know, that's why I chose blue hié for that shinbo thing, why

285
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,960
I chose blue sky behind the girl from Shelter. But like, yeah, everything about this video

286
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:24,260
is meant to say, hey, you like Shelter? Here's more. And like, if I can perfectly capitalize

287
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,200
on the success of Shelter to get people to watch something that is totally my thing and

288
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,320
something they did not at all anticipate getting, then that's perfect. You know, just getting

289
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,600
people to say like, to suggest to the audience that they're going to get the kind of trashy

290
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,040
bullshit they want. You know, they want the top 10. They want the cute girls. They want

291
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,640
the reminder of the thing they already care about like Shelter. They want to just watch

292
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,320
a video about something they already have opinions about and just want reaffirmation

293
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,720
that someone else cares about the thing they care about. So yeah, it looks like it's just

294
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,480
a video about Shelter, but it's not. It's the opposite. It's about a bunch of obscure

295
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,720
shit that no one cares about except me. And I'm now forcing you to care about it if I

296
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,480
can, you know. So yeah, that's sort of my that's that's that's the trick of the trade.

297
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,840
That's what my goal is. Be the most myself possible and get the most people to care about

298
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,400
it possible as opposed to trying to, you know, go to my audience because I don't want to

299
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,360
do that. I don't want to go to them. And when I whenever I try, I regret it, you know, like

300
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:43,120
when I not to say that I don't like these videos, but I mean, I've made it clear in

301
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,640
the past that like every once in a while I cover a popular show just so that I can have,

302
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,520
you know, something new or current or popular to talk about, you know, usually it's when

303
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,080
I just don't have any other ideas. I'll be like, All right, let's make a video about

304
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,080
what to motay people like what to motay. And that video is huge. Let's make a video about

305
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,080
erased and myriad colors phantom world. Those videos are huge. Cabin airy debt videos huge,

306
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,960
you know, it's a very easy way to to reach success. And I only do it if I have something

307
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,200
to say mob Psycho 100 huge, huge video. All those were the most popular anime of the season

308
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,440
that they were airing. I found something to say about them. So I made a video about it.

309
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,320
And, you know, but the the main thrust of why this show, why cover this show is because it's

310
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,200
the biggest show of the season and people will come to me for it. And, you know, if I was, I

311
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,680
feel like if I was a normal YouTuber, if I was someone like a gig or something, that would be

312
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,680
all I do. I just find the most popular shows and not gig, I meant glass reflection. The gig

313
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,880
is similar. They, you know, they go after what's the talking point? What are people talking about

314
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,000
right now? And they respond to it. And they, you know, they just whip up the audience reaction

315
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,880
they want. Whereas for me, it's like the opposite point. Get people invested, even though they

316
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,240
didn't think they'd care. Use Re Zero as a platform to talk about something else, you know,

317
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,440
which I almost wish that, you know, the, that Planetarian and Re Zero had been reversed,

318
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,720
where we could have had re like use the Re Zero video to tell people to watch Planetarian,

319
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,920
because unfortunately, as expected, my Re Zero, Plebe and the Weeb, it has three times the view

320
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,240
counts of the Planetarian Plebe and the Weeb, you know, so, which is to be expected. But if we

321
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,480
could have diverted people there, that would have been nice. But, you know, the reason Re Zero,

322
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,960
we even covered it on Plebe and the Weeb was to get more attention to Plebe and the Weeb,

323
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,880
a show that people would not have watched. It was, you know, a two guys talking show that

324
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,960
is totally different from my normal content. Nobody really knows who Jesse is. The title is

325
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,120
not Click Beaty, you know, the Plebe and the Weeb is the name of a show. It's not a Click

326
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,080
Beat title that will get like, you know, if I had been trying to make those just Click Beaty,

327
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,680
it would have just been like Re Zero, best or worst show on television or something, you know,

328
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,320
like, because who cares? It doesn't matter what the title of the video is. But with the Plebe and the

329
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,400
Weeb, we want it to be a series and we want it to be recognized as such. But covering Re Zero at

330
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:31,040
all is a huge boost to the series. You know, if we hadn't covered that show, then there's a good

331
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,320
chance or covered anything popular, you know, like we covered your name because it was new and it

332
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,240
was making waves and Re Zero because it was a huge deal. You know, Planetarian is more of the

333
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,120
kind of show that me and Jesse would be more inclined to watch and more inclined to talk about.

334
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,120
But that video has way fewer views and it would not have gotten Plebe and the Weeb off the ground

335
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,520
and it would have just sank down my channel, you know, though I am impressed by how many views it

336
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,400
did get at least, you know, I think 21k was a pretty healthy amount. Even if that's like,

337
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,040
for my current self, that's like the lowest I'm likely to get at all, you know, like it used to

338
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,840
be that I had videos that, that if it was like no one cared about it, it was below 10k. But now

339
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm big enough that like 20k is kind of like the rock bottom I can hit. But nonetheless, I'm glad

340
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,960
that that's the rock bottom I can hit because that's a lot of people and that's a lot of heads

341
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:28,960
to go watch Planetarian, you know, in go watch Jesse's content. But yeah, and I mean, even with

342
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,560
the thumbnails for Plebe and the Weeb, like, I was going to make the thumbnail for, like, Jesse

343
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,960
made all the thumbnails for it and I would have had your name would have been the image of her

344
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,320
groping her own tits from the start of the movie because we do talk about that scene. I would have

345
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,080
had the Re Zero One would have just been a close-up of Rem and Ram, like as close as I could get

346
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,200
into their faces, but at least they were in there for Jesse's thumbnail. And then with Planetarian,

347
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,520
just, you know, close-up of cute girl's face, like, that's close-up of face. It's, it is a one-way

348
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:08,720
ticket to your video getting views. And it's so satisfying when you do it and it works, like,

349
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,680
when you put the, like, with the anime is how to recognize a terrible anime in just one episode.

350
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,240
I knew what the thumbnail was going to be immediately when I was watching Gate because,

351
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,360
like, the second that girl's face popped up on camera and it just hogged the whole frame

352
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,640
and it was just this perfect shot of this girl's face, I was like, that's the thumbnail. You know,

353
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,160
like, I figured that out before I was done writing the fucking script and I was so fucking excited

354
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,920
to use it and that video has over a million views. It's my second most viewed, no, yeah,

355
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:48,720
my second most viewed video of all time. People, the title and the thumbnail. And, like,

356
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,120
I told this to Mother's Basement and he's totally changed the way he does titles and thumbnails

357
00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:00,400
as a result, but he's still not doing it right because he'll put, like, a kind of okay thumbnail

358
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,320
but then he puts his stupid animated avatar over it, which is cartoon guy, which is totally

359
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,800
antithetical to making a good thumbnail and unnecessary and I don't know why he does that.

360
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,880
I keep telling him to stop, but he keeps doing it. It's terrible. It's like, it's cancelling

361
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,280
out the effect of the thumbnail, you know, but he's gotten better with the clickbait titles.

362
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,440
He stopped, you know, it used to be like, what's in an OP? X show and then now it's called like,

363
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,040
how strong is one punch man's punch? What's in an OP? You know, personally, I would cut out

364
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,360
the extra part entirely. I would just make it what it is because there's no reason to have

365
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,120
a series title. It doesn't, the only people who care that it's a part of the series are people

366
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,720
who watch all your videos, you know? Like, if you can come up with a series title that's also

367
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,920
clickbait, like cool character designs is a good clickbaity title for the kind of videos those are.

368
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,560
Like, that's what the video is, is about cool character designs, but it also is eye catching.

369
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,720
Oh, I want to hear about cool character designs, you know? So that's a good clickbait series,

370
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,360
but if it's a series title that doesn't really mean anything to the audience, you know, like in a

371
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,120
major way, like what's in an OP is okay, but it doesn't make me like rush to click in the way

372
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,760
that just saying like, here's what's cool about this show's OP, you know, gets you in.

373
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:30,560
Um, but, you know, I know Jeff likes to keep things as part of a series and he kind of has

374
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,720
like an older YouTuber mindset because it used to be that, you know, people really wanted things

375
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,280
to be a part of the series so that people like knew that there was more and they knew to go find

376
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,840
more of it. But nowadays, if people want more of your content, they subscribe. Like, YouTube is a

377
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,600
subscriber culture now. It wasn't like that before, you know, back in the day there was, there was

378
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,160
not this push for subscriptions. And when YouTube redesigned the whole website back in like 2013,

379
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,120
they did it around subscriptions. They built it around how do we make people get drawn to the

380
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,520
subscribe button. That's why the subscribe button is dead center in your channel on the page, you

381
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,400
know, like they want to drive people towards subscribing to channels because they realize

382
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,560
that that was the best way for content creators to, you know, keep their audience and keep making

383
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,560
revenue. So yeah, like you really want subscriptions and the people who are subscribed to your

384
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,600
channel, it doesn't matter that it's a series. They get it, you know. Now you can codify your

385
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,520
thumbnails and titles in a way. I think the best way to handle doing a series is color-coded thumbnails.

386
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,040
You know, guys like Chaseface do this well, where, uh, you know, if it's part of one series, then it

387
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,920
all has the same color of thumbnail, but the title and thumbnail can be something clickbaity,

388
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,000
you know. If you want to have, or Glass Reflections does this well too, where he's got like, you

389
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,120
know, if it's a proper review, then it's like a close-up of a character's face and like a blue,

390
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,760
like, techno-y background. And it's like, you know, this anime review. But then if he does like the

391
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,680
impressions, then it's like a gray background. And it's close-up of a face on a gray background.

392
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,840
This is an impressions video. And you can instantly tell looking at his channel like, okay,

393
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,160
there's several different series here, which one am I interested in. Canapa Effect does something

394
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,480
similar. He uses like, blue text for all of his, you know, creator spotlight videos, and then other

395
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,480
kinds of text for other stuff. That's a good method of doing it, because it doesn't take away from

396
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,040
your ability to make things clickbaity, while also notifying it as a series. So, you know.

397
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,040
But anyways, everyone needs to pay more attention to their titles and thumbnails. They're the only

398
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,640
things that matter. The only things that matter for views. The only things. Because you just have

399
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,480
to get them to click the video. That's all that matters. Like, once they're there, they will

400
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,960
find out that it's a genius video and they'll reshare it. You know, if you're making, if you're

401
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,880
making good content, then, then it's going to, you know, it's going to get, um, going to get

402
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,720
reshared once people find it. Once they find out it's good. But they have to find out it's good

403
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,760
first, you know, and they're not going to find out it's good if they're not going to find it.

404
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,880
And if you're not going to click on it in the first place, if it's got a weird title and a

405
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,680
weird thumbnail and people don't understand what the appeal of it is, they're not going to click

406
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,560
on it. Um, so you just got to get your fucking hooks in people and drag them kicking and screaming

407
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:24,240
over to what you want to do. Alright, that's it for this segment. She's opened up a beer.

408
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:34,800
So as an addendum to the stuff I was saying like four days ago or for you like one minute ago,

409
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:46,800
um, advice for YouTubers, tag yourself on all your videos. Your tags have to do with what shows up

410
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,520
in the related videos on the side. And for my whole YouTube career, the overwhelming majority

411
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,560
of hits that I get that aren't from subscribers are from related videos. And if you tag yourself

412
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,120
all the time, it means your own videos are more likely to show up in the related videos.

413
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,520
So always tag your own name, write your own name into the tags. On the PCP, all the tags are pretty

414
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,280
much just the names of all the PCP members. I don't know how well that works, but um,

415
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,320
it's a, you know, it's worth doing. So I got to talk about one of the big things going on with

416
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,240
me right now, which is that I am turning into a fucking monster. This is going to contradict

417
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,680
everything I was saying on the fat fuckery podcast. We were talking about lifting and I was like,

418
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,960
oh, lifting sucks. It just leaves you exhausted all day, blah, blah, blah, and all that shit. Well,

419
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,400
you know, at the start of that podcast, we hadn't finished building the squat rack,

420
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,920
the one that Ben brought with him. We told a whole story about that, but we did like within a couple

421
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,800
days of that podcast. And so me and Ben started lifting. And what I quickly realized is that

422
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,800
lifting is fucking awesome. Now, yes, it does have the negative consequence of being exhausting.

423
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,600
And your muscles feel sore all the time, at least so far mine have, you know, they've never,

424
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,840
because we keep pushing ourselves to higher and higher weights every time we do it. We've never

425
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,520
just been maintenance lifting. It's all strength lifting, all in increasing the amount we lift

426
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:27,120
every other day. So, you know, it's been a fairly brutal workout schedule, but I feel strong.

427
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,280
And every time, like right after working out, it's just like, you just feel the pump and it's

428
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,160
just like, yes, I can do anything. I am a God, you know, and definitely gives me more of like a

429
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,160
strut and like more just, I don't know, I feel good about whatever I'm doing. And it's funny,

430
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,520
because, you know, so much of my time is spent sitting around and just like, when I'm not sitting

431
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,360
around and probably eating, I say this all the time, how I pretty much just leave the house to go get

432
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:00,880
food. And, you know, that can make me feel like I'm not doing enough physical activity, like I'm

433
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,720
not getting out enough and stuff like that. But lifting, which only takes like half an hour,

434
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,720
with the lifting, you know, the schedule me and Ben have been doing, is like, it feels like it

435
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,680
meets that need completely. It's like, you know, working yourself to such physical exhaustion

436
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,400
that it's like, yes, I have done my physicality for the day, you know, and now I can feel good

437
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,520
about just sitting down for eight hours doing work, you know, or just getting up to go eat

438
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,920
and stuff like that. I don't feel like I'm hugely missing out on the rest of the world

439
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,840
or just on doing anything physical. And it's, I mean, it's been fun. Me and Ben have been,

440
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,840
you know, doing the workouts together. It's just a fun time to just pump out some iron,

441
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:54,880
you know, see what we can see how high we can raise our, our fucking lifting amounts and stuff,

442
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:01,280
feel the gains flowing through us. But here's what's, here's why it's turned me into a monster.

443
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,200
Because ever since we started, started lifting, I can't stop eating. I've been eating constantly in

444
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,520
larger and larger portions. Like I've always been kind of a small eater. There's only been a couple

445
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,760
of times in my life where I've been able to eat like more than normal. And it's usually like,

446
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,760
like, it's like the kind of thing where once you start eating big, you can continue to eat big.

447
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,880
But if you typically don't, then it's like you feel capped out at a lower level, you know,

448
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,440
I'm the type of guy who often doesn't get the side dish with my order, you know,

449
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,440
go, go to a, go to a fast food restaurant. I don't need the fries. I don't need the combo,

450
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,600
you know, buy one, get one free. I might eat half of the second thing, you know,

451
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,920
I've never been someone who eats like a huge portion or even like a normal portion. But

452
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,240
like now ever since I started lifting, it's just been like, I will eat everything in sight.

453
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,880
It doesn't matter. Give me the biggest thing on the menu. I'll fucking put it down. Give me the

454
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,440
two. I need the two. I also need the large drink, you know, I usually can't even finish a fucking

455
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,680
medium sized drink of like soda, you know, with my meal. Now I'm just chugging down these fucking

456
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,960
big ass drinks. I went to Hardee's yesterday. I had like they had a steak, egg and cheese

457
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,000
biscuit, buy one, get one free. I got two. The guy said, do you want a dollar drink? And I'm

458
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,240
like, what the fuck is a dollar drink? And he said, it's cheaper than the small or yeah,

459
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,680
because I think I asked for small, but then he gives me the dollar drink and it's a fucking huge

460
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,520
cup. It's like an extra large drink. And I'm like, I don't know why that's a dollar, but sure, I'll

461
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,720
take it, drink the whole fucking thing, you know, along with eating both steak, egg, and cheese

462
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,560
biscuits, which I am certain I wouldn't have been able to do two weeks ago. It's just given me such

463
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,880
a fucking appetite. And I know that the way I'm eating, because, you know, you're supposed to

464
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,560
eat big to get big. If you're lifting big, you got to eat big, but you got to eat right. You know,

465
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,200
the key is to maximize on protein, but not to eat a bunch of fat and a bunch of sugar,

466
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,040
because if you do, you're going to get, you know, your muscles will get bigger,

467
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:15,760
but you're also going to get fat. But I, I don't care. Like it feels so gratifying to like pump,

468
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,200
you know, to just lift heavy weight and then be just, and then just go eat everything that I want.

469
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,160
It doesn't matter what I just, I want it. It's going in my mouth. There's no hesitation. There's

470
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,280
no looking at the labels. There's no nothing. I have been eating like a fucking pig, and I know

471
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,360
I'm going to get fat, but I'm going to get strong fat. And I feel like, I feel like I like that.

472
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,000
I want to, I want to be a mosh pit guy. That's what that's the body I think I'm going for is the guy

473
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,800
in the mosh pit at metal shows, which I've been to a considerable number of metal shows. I've been

474
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,000
in a few mosh pits. I'm usually the guy who gets pushed around pretty hard. I usually walk out pretty

475
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,480
bruised, you know, because there's usually at least one guy in there who's some big fat buff

476
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,640
motherfucker with huge muscle, huge chest, huge arms, but you know, like a beer, beer gut.

477
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,880
I see myself being that guy, because honestly, for me, like, I feel like vices

478
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,960
are like, I don't, I don't get the point of life without them to some extent. I guess if you, if

479
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,480
you get really into something like running and it makes you feel like your life has been affirmed

480
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,000
or something like that, like you don't need any vices because you have running, which needs to

481
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,600
be the way that runners act, you know, like a, like a Casey Neistat or even my dad, like my dad

482
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,520
used to smoke and drink all the time. You know, he was like a pack of day smoker. He drank a lot

483
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,400
at parties and shit, completely quit both of those, took up running. That's what he does now.

484
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,320
And maybe that'll be me one day. Maybe in my 30s or so, I'll eventually, you know, my dad started

485
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:59,200
late. He didn't really start running till it was like late, late 30s, early 40s, I think. But uh,

486
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,080
you know, maybe that'll be me one day. But right now, it's hard for me to go very long without

487
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:13,920
advice because I start to wonder why am I even alive for this? You know, like why, why be a person

488
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:21,200
who has to eat healthy and watch what you eat and not drink too much and not smoke? Because those are

489
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,560
the things that make life fun. Those are the things that make it easy to do, to do work all the time.

490
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,120
You know, like to not, I live a lifestyle where all I really want to do is work. That's all I want

491
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,560
to do. All I want to do is watch anime and make videos about anime and make blogs and make podcasts

492
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,000
and, and, you know, collaborate with other creative people. That's like the only desire I really have,

493
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,200
other than like, you know, having interesting conversations. I like doing that, you know,

494
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,520
I take breaks from work to go hang out and talk to people both in real life and online,

495
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,360
you know, offline and online. I don't know why I still say in real life. I hate that being

496
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,080
equated with something different, but it's just such an ingrained phrase. But anyway, yeah, you know,

497
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,000
having interesting conversations is great, making stuff is great, and there's nothing else I really

498
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,320
like to do. I don't really like to leave the house except to eat, you know, that's the only reason I

499
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:24,720
want to leave. I've done the whole go out and do things stuff. Things aren't interesting. The beach

500
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,080
is not that fun. Mount Trashmore is not that fun. Maybe once a month it's fun to go out and do

501
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:37,200
something somewhere, you know, gatherings all week. I don't care. I just want to stay home and work.

502
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:45,280
And all I want to do other than that is stuff that will make me feel like I have not sat in one spot

503
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,440
for eight hours. And there's a few easy ways to not feel that way. One is to get up and go have a

504
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,640
smoke. It's such an easy way to like, I've been working for an hour. I kind of want to just stand

505
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,240
up and have a break. You go outside, you smoke a cigarette, you come back in, you feel ready to

506
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:09,600
take on the next hour of work. Or I'm about to do a huge editing job that I don't want to do.

507
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:17,040
Let's have some beers. It'll make this easier, you know, like the other day, what was this, two days

508
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,800
ago, I had, okay, so everything I talked about in the previous podcast is not happening the way I

509
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,160
described it, which is good. And because that leaves me the opportunity now to not describe this

510
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,000
stuff that I am doing in too much detail so that it can still happen. But I'll go into at least

511
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,400
this much, because this is already guaranteed, because I described that I had written six videos

512
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,800
for a month-long project in November to make a ton of videos all at once. I ended up canceling that

513
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,920
project because it was financially retarded to make 15 videos in one month. I obviously can't

514
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,360
Patreon all of them, and I already had got those six ideas that I had that were so good that I like

515
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,920
wrote instantly. Those were all the like ideas I had that I really wanted to do, and all the other

516
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,840
ones I'm looking at like, eh, this, eh, you know, I don't want to write this video. But I have another

517
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,320
project that I am excited about, and I'm just going to get straight to work on that as opposed to

518
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,840
the whole novel of videos in November. So I'm already working on the next big project. But

519
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:26,880
instead, I now have, you know, six videos that DeVu can make at his own pace over the course of,

520
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,120
one will come out by the end of this month, and the other five will come out over the course of

521
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:40,000
November. And so, like, I'm looking at it like, that's five videos that are already written. All

522
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,480
I have to do is voice them, and then the rest of it's DeVu, you know, like, I mean, there's a few

523
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,440
that I have to make some more notes for. But basically, I can have all my work for November

524
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,960
done as soon as these are all voiced. So two days ago, I just sat in my closet and voiced all five

525
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,840
scripts one after another for like, probably two and a half hours or something, and just sat in

526
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:07,520
the closet, voiced every single one of them, then I came out of the closet, and I edited all of them.

527
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:14,640
And so, you know, editing audio is not horribly difficult or time consuming, it's just kind of

528
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,480
a grind, because it's just remove all the spaces and bad takes, and then add in new spaces anywhere

529
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,400
that there's not enough space between words, which basically means listen to the same 15-minute

530
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:34,240
script like three times in the process of editing it to sound coherent. It's kind of boring, especially

531
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:40,480
to do on five videos at once. So had a few beers, made it easier, you know, by the time I was done,

532
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,080
I was feeling pretty drunk, and was ready to pass out, great day of productivity. That's now five

533
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,240
videos that I have done my whole part for, and so the entire month of November, if I really wanted to,

534
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,160
I could fucking sleep, you know, but of course, because all I like to do is work, I'm already

535
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,120
started on the next big project that'll probably start coming out in December, and I've, you know,

536
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,200
I'm planning all these other things that I want to do, we've got planning for the plebe and the

537
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,160
weave to worry about, we're trying to figure out the situation with getting Jesse and Nate down here,

538
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,720
I've been guesting on podcasts, putting together my own podcast like this one, my own vlogs, I have

539
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,840
a bunch of, I have like five vlog series, five vlog videos that are like halfway done, or even less,

540
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:30,320
like okay, I started up all these new vlog series that are related to like watching a show, there's

541
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:38,240
like the second chances board, and what happened with that was I, you know, I selected the next show,

542
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:45,280
I watched the first episode while I was drunk, and it was, it was kind of too difficult

543
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,520
to comprehend, like there's too much going on for my drunk mind to process, so I decided to

544
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,120
wait till I was sober to watch any more of it, and I just haven't gotten around to it, because I'm

545
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,640
not that, like, I didn't want to drop the show based on that first episode, but I'm also not excited

546
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,880
to watch more of it, and I probably will drop it before the end, but like, I don't know, and then

547
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,040
there was the, the exact same story with random ass recommendations, I shot the dart at the screen,

548
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,120
got the next show, watched the first episode of it, and like, I didn't dislike it, but I also

549
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,240
wasn't so enthusiastic about continuing that I would watch the rest immediately, then I started up

550
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,200
another thing that I won't describe too much, which is another Select a Show thing, I selected

551
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,280
a show, watched the first four episodes, really loved them, but got busy with other stuff, and

552
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,760
haven't gotten around to watching the rest of the show, which is horribly ironic, considering the

553
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:45,440
nature of this particular show, which you'll see eventually, and then, and then there's also

554
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,960
Finish or Fail for 2016 shows, which of course, the entire fucking summer season ended, so now

555
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:00,960
there's like 30 fucking shows that I had on hold that I now have to try to watch, so all of that

556
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,760
is waiting, and in the meantime, I'm working on this other huge series that I just, you know,

557
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,800
got excited about and launched right into, so there's just too many have finished and unfinished

558
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:24,320
projects going on, I have to edit this commentary for the for the for the Patreon before like tomorrow,

559
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,000
and meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna start promoting the PCP guys, because like,

560
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,920
I'm trying to get all everyone on the PCP more popular and more famous, because all of us are

561
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,440
trying to do this as careers, and I'm the only one other than Jeff, who's like really succeeding at

562
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,160
it right now, Jesse is too, but like Jesse has a lot of stuff that's siphoning his money away,

563
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,400
other than just the fact that he spends it haphazardly, but like, we want to get Jesse and

564
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,920
Nate living down here, and Hippo eventually, and we want everybody to be like, satisfyingly able to

565
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,640
make careers off their arc, and so I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna help promote these guys,

566
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,080
how I'm gonna like, you know, help them to find content that they can produce that'll

567
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,280
that'll make it easier to have a career doing this stuff, you know, that's that's kind of the

568
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,160
the thing we're all chasing is to have everybody as a group be able to, you know, sustain ourselves

569
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:32,640
off of this shit, and right now my my Patreon, I'm actually kind of, I wouldn't say I'm like

570
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,200
losing money or anything, but my Patreon is like kind of just floating around a number that it's

571
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,320
just kind of stable at, and I'm not gaining a ton of views on my new videos because I've chosen to

572
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:49,120
work on stuff that's not topical and not like big stat cow stuff, which I mean is deliberate,

573
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,600
I just want to do what I want to do, but you know, there's a reason I do those stat cow videos

574
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:00,000
sometimes, it's because I want the growth that comes with it, and that's not coming right now

575
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,040
because I'm doing weird shit like Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s and stuff like that, that and plebe in

576
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,760
the weave, that's not going to draw the numbers the way that a, you know, clickbaity title on a

577
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:25,520
current show is going to do. So point being, I've got all this stuff going on, vices are a great way

578
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,600
to help me through it, all I want to do is do all these vlogging projects, all these

579
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,120
podcasts, all these fucking videos from my main channel, all these huge research projects that

580
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,520
I keep getting myself into, and the project, it really is reaching the point, I'm reaching the

581
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:45,360
promised point, I used to always say that like if I hit this amount on Patreon, I'll be able to do

582
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,480
bigger and bigger projects, I kept saying that like guys, if you get me up to a thousand dollars of

583
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,280
video, and I only need to make two videos a month, and those videos can be as big as I want them to

584
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:00,960
be, they can be these huge weeks long research projects that are just like, you know, deep and

585
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,520
involving, and that's exactly what I'm now doing. Stuff like Shinbo in the 90s, you know, is a project

586
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:13,840
where it just takes that long to watch all those shows and do all that research for it, and it's,

587
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:20,000
I'm so glad, like this is what I've always wanted to be doing, is these huge projects, and now that's

588
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,440
exactly where things are going, but um, but in the meantime, it's like, I just want to have a couple

589
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:34,000
of beers, a couple of cigarettes, and eat whatever I want, because eating makes me happy, eating things

590
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,080
I like makes me happy, eating things I don't like doesn't make me happy, you know, like eating healthier

591
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:46,720
food, you do get that sense of like, wow, I feel physically better, but there's no satisfaction

592
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,720
in it, there's no sense of reward, there's no sense of like, I just worked for three hours,

593
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,960
and I want something to take the edge off, you know, when you just eat something that's just

594
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,160
good for you, it just feels like, well, I am now sustaining myself, like, yes, I can now continue

595
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,720
to live, I guess I'm not hungry anymore, but there's no sense of like, yeah, all right, I did something,

596
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,440
now back to work, at least not for me, I know it's different for some people, the DeVoo has been on a

597
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,960
big health food kick, and it's really working out for him, but for me, I take so much satisfaction

598
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,720
from eating, it's such a huge thing, you know, it's a huge element of what I like, and from drinking,

599
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,920
and from smoking, which I'm gonna try to cut out the smoking, because that's gotten out of hand,

600
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:40,880
vaping only made it worse, and I've been smoking too many cigarettes, but only because I was like

601
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,160
experimenting with different types, because I bought a pack of blacks, which is a clove cigarette

602
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,960
that I've always wanted to try, I mean, I've tried one before, but I've always wanted to try and buy

603
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,440
one, and I like, hunted them down and bought a pack, and that was pretty cool, but those things take

604
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:02,320
too long to smoke, and you know, by the end of it, I've got a headache, so went through that pack,

605
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:10,560
then this is kind of its own story, but I was watching The Dick Show, which if you're a patron

606
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:16,640
of The Dick Show, you get to see video feeds of the episodes, and Asterios Cocanos, who is a

607
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,360
fantastic comedian who I love, was finally on the show after a long period of trying to get him on

608
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,080
there, and it was a fucking great show, and Asterios was just smoking cigarettes constantly through

609
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:31,440
the whole show, and it was really funny, and I am extremely suggestible, so when I saw him smoking,

610
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,840
I immediately wanted some, and what he was smoking was a cigarette brand called Dunhills,

611
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,760
which had this really interesting package, and I was like, okay, I want to try those, so I hunted

612
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,480
them down, and now I'm smoking a pack at Dunhills, but once that's over, I will hopefully stop

613
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,320
for at least a little while, because I've been burning through this pack at a rate that is

614
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:58,160
completely beyond anything I've ever been doing before, so it's not a good look in terms of getting

615
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:06,160
addicted, but you know, cigarettes notwithstanding, I do love drinking, which I am good at doing in

616
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,040
moderation, I've never gotten to the point of alcoholism or any kind of addiction with that,

617
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,560
it's purely a casual thing, cigarettes, it's starting to feel very not casual, which is why

618
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:25,200
I'm worried about it, but yeah, that stuff just gets me through, man, that's what makes it so

619
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:35,200
five days of nonstop work doesn't feel exhausting, I don't feel like, oh my god, I haven't done

620
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:41,680
anything, I feel like wow, I've accomplished so much, and I've felt good the whole time, and all of

621
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:48,800
it's possible because of the lifting, because the lifting is so satisfying, and so like, physically

622
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,040
engaging, and it makes me feel so like good afterwards, like my body feels good, and I look

623
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,640
at myself in the mirror, and I feel good, because I see this like, I see the confidence running

624
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:08,880
through me, I see my body slowly becoming more, you know, like able to stand upright, and you know,

625
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,760
and have a posture to it, that it's like, yeah, I don't even care if I'm fat, because who do I

626
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,080
need to be skinny for, I don't know, I don't care, I'm not even like, it's not like if I like lost

627
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,680
a bunch of weight, and got like really good looking, that I would suddenly go out on the town, and start

628
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,000
like, hooking up with girls or something, like that's not gonna happen, you know, even if I

629
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,080
completely lost weight, and I look fantastic and beautiful, it's still gonna be me sitting around

630
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,600
on the computer, editing your, you know, writing videos for days on end, so it's like, as long as

631
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:50,240
I feel good, it doesn't matter what I look like, I just want to feel good physically, and what makes

632
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:56,560
me feel good physically is pumping fucking iron, and feeling strong, you know, and as long as I feel

633
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:02,640
strong, no amount of eating makes me feel completely gross, no amount of drinking makes me feel

634
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:10,560
completely gross, and so I'm just totally indulging, I am completely breaking bad, and going off the

635
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:18,800
deep end, and it feels great, and I don't know if I recommend that to anybody else, if that would

636
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:27,920
work with anyone else's lifestyle, but um, yeah, I just physically feel, for the last like two and

637
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,440
a half weeks, I felt great, and I mentioned at the start of the last Digi Bro's decompression

638
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,520
chamber, I was like, you know, even though I need to decompress just because there's too much going

639
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,360
on, I feel good, like I don't feel bad at all, everything in my life feels really great right

640
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:50,160
now, and that's entirely because of the lifting, the strictly regimented lifting just every other day,

641
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:56,800
me and Ben lift, you know, and then I feel, I feel incrementally stronger, I feel confident,

642
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:03,840
and I can just eat whatever I want, and not give a single fuck about anything, and I have been

643
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:10,720
picking out on a scale that I have never done before, and uh, and probably spending too much

644
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:17,040
money, but I mean, I don't really spend money on anything else, so my budget is so hard to exhaust,

645
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,640
because it like, it like, the amount I spend on food looks like too much, but then there's nothing

646
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,800
else taking it away, so I always look at my bank, and there's still money there, and I'm like, well,

647
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:33,040
as long as there's still money there, I guess it doesn't matter, but we'll see, we'll see what happens

648
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:39,840
when tax day comes, and it all comes crashing down around me, and I have to fucking make an LLC,

649
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,880
and I gotta fucking register DeVue probably as an employee, because I'm sure he's made

650
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:53,520
ten grand this year, uh, uh, I don't want to do any of that, I need to, I looked up the rates for

651
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,960
hiring an accountant, they were too high, uh, I gotta figure out how to do it all myself,

652
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,440
no money, no problems,

653
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:10,320
all right, this is either the end of this episode, or there's gonna be another segment that I record

654
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:17,760
tomorrow before I post this, so look forward to that, and uh, see you then. You know, all week long,

655
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:24,000
I had fully intended on finishing and editing and uploading this thing on the 30th, and the 30th came

656
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,200
around, sat around all day, kept thinking I was gonna do it, but putting it, putting it off for

657
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,920
this reason or another, and now it's already the next day, but I wanted to talk a little bit about

658
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,920
why this is on the PCP channel, because some people were saying that this seems like a very

659
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:46,800
after-dark kind of, uh, kind of show, and I get where they're coming from, the explanation is

660
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,040
something that I think anyone will understand who's an artist, and probably a lot of other people

661
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:57,040
will too, which is just basically about the different ways that you compartmentalize

662
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:05,120
your thoughts, and your works, and just what you do, and there's sort of the reason that I have so

663
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,840
many channels, and I think this applies to everyone I know who has multiple channels,

664
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:15,120
is that each one has a very distinctive voice and purpose. You know, some people,

665
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,240
back in the day, we started up multiple channels because we thought, well, you know,

666
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,720
this channel's for anime, this one will be for this, this one will be for that, but uh,

667
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,240
over time it's come to be more of like the character of the content that's on it, so

668
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:39,600
my main channel is meant specifically for like, you know, highly edited videos that have a concrete

669
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,760
point, but it's not just that, it's also that they're kind of individual, like each one,

670
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,520
while I do expect that people, you know, watch more than one video on the channel that they want

671
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,800
to fully get, like, where I'm coming from with my videos, because I think there's a sort of

672
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:02,240
ongoing narrative of the way I talk about shows, um, I don't expect that people who watch the channel

673
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,040
will know me that well. I don't expect them to know, like, everything I've ever done, I don't

674
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:12,720
expect them to know who I know, who I talk to, you know, uh, so if I make a video on the main

675
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:19,040
channel where I'm just openly making reference to, like, the PCP, or to any of my friends, or to,

676
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,680
like, more personal aspects that I don't expect most of those people to have heard of, or like,

677
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,080
to get where I'm coming from, then I think it would, it would be weird, you know, so it's like,

678
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:35,040
each, each video on there is more about, here's a subject I'm dissecting, and you can go from

679
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:40,240
this video to any of the others, and it'll, it'll continually make sense, it's that kind of body

680
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:46,480
of work, whereas on other channels, like After Dark, I have more of an expectation that if you're

681
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,360
watching After Dark, it's because you're invested in me, not so much that you're invested in anime,

682
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:57,600
or in analysis, per se, you're just invested in what's DigiBro up to, and that channel is intentionally

683
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:03,360
random, it's just whatever comes to mind is up there, it could be a vlog, it could be a music

684
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:09,760
video, it could be anything, you know, I don't market it in such a way that, uh, that I expect

685
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:17,360
people to, you know, subscribe for one kind of content. Now I know that, I mean, that's not,

686
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:22,400
in terms of marketability, it's probably a terrible idea, I mean, there's lots of stuff on After Dark

687
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,680
that if the channel was just that, it would probably get bigger, and if I, you know, if I

688
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,960
changed the thumbnails and stuff to be more accessible, but I don't want it to be that,

689
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:40,000
it's meant to be just anything goes, uh, take it or leave it, you know, it's the DigiBro experience.

690
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:48,000
Now, the PCP channel, though, is a little bit different, because PCP channel is about regularity,

691
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,840
it's about shows that come out on something resembling a schedule, you know, each show is a

692
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,240
once a week schedule, with the exception of some of the specials that we do, like, you know, the

693
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:04,720
draw cast or rowdy fuckers cop killers, but even those are a series, there's a definitive style

694
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,120
to it, there's not a lot of videos on this channel that are just totally out of nowhere,

695
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,360
there's the 360 classroom, which we do intend to do more of, so that's a series as well,

696
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,280
and the Great Dark Souls race is probably like the most, just like, this is just a thing we did

697
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:27,520
with all of us in it, um, kind of thing, but like, the idea of the channel is weekly shows that are

698
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:32,640
usually pretty long, they're always like at least an hour, they're mostly podcasts, there's not a lot

699
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:39,680
of visual element to this channel, um, and when there is, another part of it is that it's, it's

700
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,160
all of us, and even if we're not all in the video, or even if it's a one person podcast, you know,

701
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,520
there's still a lot of reference being made to the PCP, to other people involved, and so,

702
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:58,560
so, you know, I think for that reason, this show kind of belongs here, where if I, if I constantly

703
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:05,920
talk about my online friends on Digibro After Dark, I don't know that all of my audience knows or

704
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:11,600
cares about them, you know, like, if you're watching the PCP channel, it means that you know who all

705
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:18,720
of us are, probably, as opposed to on After Dark, which has its own distinct audience that's about

706
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:25,040
me, so, yeah, I agree that this is the kind of content you would kind of expect from Digibro After

707
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:32,000
Dark, but it's very formulated, and I wanted it to be that way, it's a weekly show-ish, it's, uh,

708
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,280
you know, it's got this certain visual presentation, the certain style of audio, it's got music,

709
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:44,000
which is unusual for my content, you know, so, yeah, that's why I think it's more of a

710
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,120
procrastinator's channel show, and we wanted, uh, Jesse especially wants each of us to have

711
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,760
our own show, or for each combination of us to have our own show, so like, we'd love it for the PCP

712
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:00,480
channel to be like a bunch of different podcasts, uh, each of which have their own formula, their

713
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,560
own regular intervals of output, and uh, yeah, I think that's cool, and it's kind of, in a way,

714
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:11,280
it's a lot like the Red Letter Media way of doing things, you know, where their channel is like,

715
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,400
there's the best of the worst, there's half in the bag, there's review, and they're all

716
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:23,200
sort of different, different takes on the same concept of two guys sit down and talk about

717
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:28,720
a movie, um, in a way, The Plebe and the Weave would have been a good fit for this channel too,

718
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:35,040
but that show is, um, just, we wanted it to be big, like, I wanted to see how big of a deal

719
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,560
The Plebe and the Weave could get to be, so that's why we put it on my main channel,

720
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,800
because I have the most subs out of everybody's channel, so, you know, I didn't want it to sort

721
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:49,760
of languish in obscurity on something like the PCP channel, which is growing, but not huge,

722
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:58,400
you know, at this point, but yeah, um, that's why it's here, and I think it's, I think it's good

723
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,440
for it to be here, I like it being here, and I like the idea of the podcast in general.

724
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:12,800
By the way, I thought I'd mention, if you guys haven't been listening to Jesse's panel cast,

725
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:19,520
you should be, because it's great, um, so far, it's two for two on getting me to read a comic

726
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:26,000
that, uh, that I would have never heard of, or ever read, and both of them I loved. I liked

727
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,440
Gwenpool last week, and this week I read All of the Vision, which is actually a complete run,

728
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:38,000
it's 12 issues, and it's finished, and it was, it was great, um, once again, I went out to try and

729
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,520
buy it, but they didn't have it at Barnes and Noble, so, um, one day I'll read a comic that

730
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,800
is available, but yeah, uh, it's a good time, you should read that comic, and you should listen to

731
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:54,960
the panel cast, and I guess that's about it. I don't, I don't want to talk too much on this

732
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:03,040
podcast about the specifics of, like, what I've been up to, because usually those are things

733
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,520
that will be represented in a video. It was one thing to talk about, like, the spreadsheets and

734
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,080
stuff before, because that's an element of my work that doesn't actually appear on camera,

735
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,440
but like, I've been watching, uh, Tsukuyomi Moonphase for the last few days, and it's like,

736
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:22,320
everything I have to say about it, it's gonna be in the, the video about it, you know, and about

737
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,240
Shinbo, though I guess what I could talk about is the fact that because the show is pretty boring,

738
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,120
and I kind of lost interest in it about eight episodes in, I've just had it on on my second

739
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,760
monitor, and I've been like, really struggling to pay enough attention to it, you know, to, to get

740
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,560
what I need, because I'm just watching it for research, I, I don't care about the story at all,

741
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:49,840
and it has elements that I really, really like, the character designs are incredible, um, there's

742
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,360
just great facial expressions, a lot of the characters are likable, and the show is good

743
01:10:53,360 --> 01:11:00,320
when it's just like a light-hearted, fun comedy, but it, it's rarely that, it's usually this really

744
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:07,520
boring, plot-driven show where the story is fucking generic and garbage, uh, so that's what

745
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,480
I've been struggling through, just smoked the last cigarette that I had in my pack, and I'm gonna

746
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:20,480
quit now, um, because that's getting to be a dangerous hobby, so getting out of that,

747
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:30,720
it's Halloween today, I've got a video coming out, kind of regret that I didn't, um, I meant to post a

748
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,320
like, a Patreon post of three months worth of vlogs and unpatron videos, I still might,

749
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,240
I always feel bad when I load multiple Patreon posts into the very end of the month, because I

750
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:48,640
feel like, you know, it suddenly hits people with multiple things to pay for right at the very end,

751
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,760
um, which feels like a transparent money grab, but it just so happens that because,

752
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,040
you know, we get paid by the month, we always have a plan to like, this video has to be out on

753
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,640
this week, this one on this week, and this one by the end of the month, and so like, you know,

754
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:10,640
I both want to post this like, hey, here's three months of, uh, three months of content that hadn't

755
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:16,080
been patroned yet, and then also this new video, and part of the reason that I don't want to do it,

756
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:25,440
um, like, I don't want to do my post first, because I pay DeVoo 40% of whatever I make on Patreon,

757
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,240
uh, for the videos that he edits, so anytime I make a Patreon post for something that wasn't edited

758
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:37,760
by the DeVoo, and you know, with each post you make exponentially less money, like, the first of the

759
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,480
month is where I make what it actually says on Patreon, and then each one after that is way, way

760
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:48,640
less, because most people have a monthly cap on how much they'll pay, so, you know, each video is

761
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:58,000
basically worth more the earlier into the month it's posted, and so if I post up like, um, you know,

762
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,160
my, just like, here's three months worth of vlogs that never got patroned, then that will make more

763
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:09,360
than the video that DeVoo's editing, and that means that DeVoo gets paid a smaller amount,

764
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:17,360
than he would, uh, you know, if his video came out before my post, so, you know, I know DeVoo needs

765
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:22,720
the money right now, so I'm kind of hoping his video comes out first, I mean, I could just pay

766
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:29,520
him 40% of the other one instead, but yeah, because of all that, I was hesitating on posting it,

767
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,880
but now it's the last day of the month, so if I post both on the very last day, then it, I don't

768
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,800
know, it feels weird to me, I don't know if it feels weird to the audience, no one's ever complained

769
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,280
about me doing it that way, no one ever complains that, like, at the very end of every month is when

770
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:49,520
a ton more content comes out than normal, you know, like, when we had Kurokono Basket and

771
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,920
Mob Psycho in, like, the same day, and then also at the end of the month is when the commentaries

772
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,120
come out, so there's like a four-hour commentary, and then, like, you know, all this other stuff,

773
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:04,480
I don't know if people treat that more as like a wow, I'm getting so much content all at once,

774
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:10,160
or if it's like a wow, you've completely, you know, charged me all this shit I wasn't expecting

775
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,560
right at the end of the month, but, I mean, everyone has their monthly limit set in place, so,

776
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:22,480
you know, as long as, as long as you have that monthly limit, then you know, you know what

777
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,480
you're in for with how much can be spent by you by the end of the month, I don't know, Patreon's

778
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:31,520
weird. I'm thinking about doing some kind of really long vlog, or maybe even podcast about

779
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:40,400
the weird nature of living in a world where people fund you, and the nature of the cult of

780
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:47,280
personality that's forming, and how I get scared for people sometimes when they have to start up

781
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:52,880
a Patreon or something, especially if they're starting it on the back of something controversial,

782
01:14:52,880 --> 01:15:00,240
because you kind of become like someone who's not just doing your job, but who's trying to

783
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:04,960
convince people that you are worth spending money on, you know, and a lot more of like

784
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,360
stuff that's not connected directly to your work becomes a part of it, where like, you know,

785
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,480
if I said something that deeply offended a contingent of my audience, or I got involved in some kind

786
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:23,120
of drama, then that could affect my, you know, like my Patreon, whereas, I mean, that would happen

787
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,760
with other stuff, and that's partly also what I'd want to get into into this podcast. In fact,

788
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,840
I should just stop talking about this now, because I'm gonna have a whole thing about it. It's an

789
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:38,720
interesting sort of conundrum, and I've been in a unique position to observe it as an early adopter

790
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:47,520
of Patreon, who's been using it for God, three years? Holy shit, that's a lot. Well, yeah,

791
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,600
that's about it for this episode. I just wanted to do one last segment before, before wrapping it up.

792
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:04,960
So, I'll see you next week, and have a good time. Have a nice night, and listen to this soothing music.
