1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, I'm the Angry Video Game Nerd.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And together we are...

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
These farce floor on the mic.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
These Nostalgia Video Game Nerd Critics.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, it's 2023.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, Happy New Year, Merry Christmas.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We didn't make an episode a week ago.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And you're just going to have to deal with it.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because we were both...

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, you were traveling. I was also kind of traveling.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We just like...

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It was like already Tuesday past the Sunday we were supposed to record.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And we were like, when can we record?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it didn't want to.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We would have had...

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Like if we had the Nostalgia...

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It would have been on Christmas Day we recorded the episode.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And it was like, I don't want to do that.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I don't want to do the day after or the day after.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because I got stuff done.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And they don't want to do the next week on New Year's.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So here we are on the second.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
January 2nd.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Almost the anniversary of my favorite holiday.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
January 6th.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
January 6th.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's not as funny as 9-11.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They're going to do it again?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, it's not as funny as 9-11.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
9-11 has a better ring to it as well.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But then again, yeah.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But then again, you know what it is.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What could ever be?

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, shit.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I shouldn't say 9-11 in the first two minutes of the episode.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They'll catch that.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They'll catch it.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, so I guess how was your Christmas?

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, so that's it.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now let's go to the one-piece recap.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I mean, we want to talk about that.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's cool.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's very cool right now.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's so cool right now.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm so glad I got back into it when I did.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Because everything else sucks except for the current arc,

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which is good.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The end.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My Christmas.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What the fuck happened?

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let me briefly explain the logistics of my Christmas.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, all right.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now, I, like many of you,

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
have a mother and a father.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh my god.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, you know, I got two sides of the family.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So on like the 17th,

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
my dad's side of the family usually does a Christmas Eve celebration.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And we'd had to do that early this year

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
because one of my cousins was going somewhere

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and some uncles wanted to visit him or something.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So we did it early and that was fine.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And then I did like a family thing.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
My, you know, my Nate and my sister were not in town.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So my Christmas Christmas was just me and my parents,

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
which was, you know, fine.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And then my mom's side of the family usually

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
does a New Year's Day, get together.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And so yesterday I got on a train

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and I went to go to Connecticut to go and see them.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And that was okay.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A lot of these people I haven't seen in ages and ages.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And, you know, that was all, that was fine too.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But I'm sort of relieved that it's all done.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because it's sort of a lot of work.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It is.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Traveling different times.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's funny how like Christmas is like a moment of cheer

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and everything and like, oh, it's a holiday.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a time off.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But it's like the most stressful, like work-intensive holiday.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's actually much harder than just normal living.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you think about it.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There's all sorts of events that you can't,

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you just have to plan around and people you got to see

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and you got to say hi.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I mean, I don't dislike saying hi to relatives.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just don't like getting in a car and driving somewhere

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
or going on a train or getting up early.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't like any of those things.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm less bothered by it than I used to be.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But I still don't really love, you know,

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I got to spend my, got to use my day to do,

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
got to do that with my day.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then I got to like prepare for it.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Rather just.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I got to like make myself look normal.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Like I can't look like a freak.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Right.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Right.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's the whole thing.

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I mean, not, not that hard.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Not that, not that hard in my case, but the.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, very hard for me.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I know.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I know.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Some of us have a, some of us are,

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what's the phrase?

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
A normally, normally challenged thing.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What did I get for Christmas?

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I got an immersion blender.

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Immersion.

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Imm, in bur, an in burgeon blender.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's the, it's the kind of blender.

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's like a, it's on a long stick and you put it down into like a fluid and you blend,

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you stick it into the liquid to blend with rather than,

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
rather than putting like stuff into a blender and blending it inside of the blender.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like it's a weapon.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You could use that to get someone.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You, you, you thrust it like a, like a fencing saber at your opponent.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And it blends whatever part of it strikes.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Could you, could you drill inside of a watermelon and then blend it from the inside?

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No, it has to be, it has to be liquid.

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It has to at least be mostly liquid.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hmm.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then what's the point?

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sorry, there is none.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's the point of anything?

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You know, my sister got me gummy molds, shaped like skulls.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So that's cool.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hell yeah.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hell yeah.

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll put drugs in those ones.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No gummies.

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just drugs.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Just hard press, like cocaine dust.

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll probably think of some other things at some point.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One or two other, like kind of neat things.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What about you?

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What was your-

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My stupid holiday.

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,280
It was much of the same. I also have people with sides of families

156
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,920
I went to see actually only want to see my mom's side of the family this year

157
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,080
That's how the family you know doing all this stuff. I admit most years

158
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,800
I will often just only see my dad's side of the family

159
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,640
That's why I had been so long since I'd seen my mom's side in a lot of cases

160
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,360
Which I feel kind of bad about cuz like they're just as valid, you know, they're just as valid. Yeah, and they miss me

161
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,920
You know, they they've been denied. They've been denied and my presence. They've been denied my presence

162
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,960
You know, I feel I feel I feel bad

163
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,480
I feel bad because because it had been so long since I'd seen some of them

164
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,240
I felt a bit awkward, you know, I try I talked to a bunch of them

165
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,880
But a lot of you know, I think I was more quiet and I think I ended up talking less

166
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,840
Overall to the that side of the family that I had seen less of even though I kind of needed to do more catching up with them

167
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Yeah

168
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Yeah, it's this a classic like

169
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,400
So

170
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,680
First of all, who are you? I don't recognize you. You don't want to say that and then right?

171
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,880
What have you been up to? Oh the last 10 years of your life. That's a lot to talk about. Yeah

172
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,720
It's like you don't want you don't want to approach that they don't want to approach that so you just sort of nod

173
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,320
Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's that's exactly that's exactly what happened

174
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,640
Well, what are you gonna do? Yeah

175
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,940
I'm it's it's got to a point for my family stuff. We're like

176
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,960
There are younger children around. Yeah, and like some of them are cousins

177
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,080
Mm-hmm. Like like you formally apologize to

178
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:27,120
To deadly comics on the last episode. He said that your cousin's kid is your

179
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Cousin once removed and I said it's your second cousin. He was right. I was wrong

180
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,280
Yes, cuz it's yeah, I still I can't wrap my head around it because the names are too similar

181
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,360
It actually it actually makes sense. Okay, imagine you have

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,760
One common ancestor and then they have two kids and those are siblings

183
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,280
And then if you step one rung down like each of those siblings has a child

184
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,080
Those are cousins and then if you if those cousins have kids

185
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Those are second cousins and then if those cousins have kids those are third cousins

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,740
So if they if they are on the same rung of the

187
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
Generational ladder, they are first second third fourth fifth cousins

188
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:18,040
But then if like if if you're talking about one generation removed like your second cousin's father is your is your second

189
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:25,020
second cousin once removed and your your second cousin's son is your second cousin wait

190
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
You've lost me no, you're you're your

191
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,920
No, it'd be your uncle you're your cousin your second cousin's

192
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:40,300
Father is your second uncle once removed and your second and your second cousin's son

193
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,880
He is your second cousin set he is your second cousin once removed

194
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,700
But but he but you are his second uncle. No, he's your second nephew fuck. Oh, no

195
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,640
See, I think I think the person the nerd who came up with all these terms didn't even have a family

196
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,320
They were just fantasizing about they were they were just thinking about what if they were just thinking

197
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I wouldn't it be funny if I made it up

198
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,600
named like this

199
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Nobody else had even thought to try

200
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,680
But oh, yeah, that was the thing that the young kids in because I was usually the youngest cousin there

201
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,160
and then one of my uncles finally had children and

202
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,140
Now there are cousins who are in my same like quote-unquote generation

203
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,960
They're first cousins, but they're like they're like 10. I see

204
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,420
They played pumpkin alley. We had they had their laptops there and they played the video game

205
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,160
Oh made shit. Did you did you like tell them about it there and they were like, oh shit

206
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,240
You made a video game. Can we play it? Yeah, and that was that was really nice

207
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,840
That was a really nice moment cuz they loved it. They really got into it and they

208
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,080
It was really gratifying and and and stuff seeing them play

209
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,840
And like was like figure out the controls was Henry there

210
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,920
He was too out of it. I think to want to go

211
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,600
It's a long drive. Oh, okay, so you're younger cousins were into it. That is pretty cool

212
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,480
That is pretty cool. And I watched them like figure out

213
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
How to play the game like they got stuck in places and then he walked around like what do you do?

214
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,280
Oh wait, and then they saw like I mean the part of the level that I had made

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Like just deliberately to like guide them towards the solution and they figured it out and it's like, ah, yes

216
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,960
Level design. I did it. It worked. Are you 10 year olds can understand pumpkin alley?

217
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,240
That's pretty good. If you if you're 10 years old right now, are you a zoomer?

218
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Or are you whatever comes after zoomers? I

219
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,760
mean, I

220
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,040
I don't know what the I think generations are like vague. So like yeah, sure I

221
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,360
Would assume the generation that comes after zoomers is ones that are born of zoomers

222
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,840
So this is the new generation. No, no, it's not quite that the generations like

223
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,600
Millennials parents are boomers and

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
And

225
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,760
Like gen gen Z's parents are our gen Xers. So it kind of like skips one. I think right

226
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,440
So I feel like the zoomers are like 20 now

227
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,760
Zoomers are like are like teens and 20 now

228
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
But I'm only like I'm not even 30 yet. So like I

229
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,360
Guess I'm on the cusp of zoomer and millennial maybe

230
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,640
I'm like a late millennial. I think you're

231
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Yeah, yeah, that sounds about right

232
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,240
Anyway, I just whatever I was I all I wanted to ask was like I just wanted to refer to these cousins as zoomers

233
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,400
But then I thought they might even be too too young to even be zoomers. But anyway, I just want to

234
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Well, that's

235
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
Well, you know that the nomenclature in our fck right for the generations

236
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,920
I forget there's the I mean, there's the original people like the first generation

237
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,400
Oh, yes, and then there were the two the tumors were the people that joined in season two

238
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
And then there's the three tards

239
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,880
Season three and oh shit. I forget the one and

240
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,600
There are like sub ones that like the ones that joined during the negapause. There was between one and two

241
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,200
There was a name for those people to the dead dead born or something the born dead

242
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,840
Yes, the born dead. Yeah, the born deads because they joined when there was when everyone was a ghost and then the

243
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,600
Four necators from the season four. It's something like that. It's something like that

244
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,960
But but anyway, I just wanted to know had these kids

245
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,840
Were they familiar with like that kind of game?

246
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,880
Like have they ever played they ever played Jack and Daxter Banjo-Kazooie or whatever?

247
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,960
I know like oh, it's one of those kind of games or were they like what the fuck they had no commentary on like

248
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,480
Oh, it's just like this game. They just were playing it and like oh cool

249
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Yeah, yeah, so I think

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,280
It certainly didn't confuse them they they saw it was a 3d game and you're a pumpkin you jump around

251
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,520
You got a little person

252
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,520
That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. You can pick them up and throw them. That was fun

253
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,200
I mean people asked me like what I've been doing and I did you know, I

254
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
Would tell them

255
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,760
You know, I made a I made a big huge video on YouTube that did pretty well

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Got a bunch of views and then sometimes I would say oh, yeah, I'm working on a book

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm working on finishing a book of a graphic novel that I drew a couple years ago and everyone would be like, oh, that's cool

258
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,560
You know, everyone everyone can mostly comprehend those things

259
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,320
Did get into like a discussion about like the YouTube algorithm with one of my cousins

260
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,440
She she showed she showed me a tic-toc that she had made a few years ago that had gone viral

261
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,520
She's pretty funny. So, you know, that was cool

262
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,360
Yeah, didn't like didn't like show off slime and punishment or anything because that would be embarrassing

263
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,320
Yeah, I showed off

264
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,000
Clarissa gunsmoke. That was the two things. It's like, oh, what are you doing? Oh, I'm just sort of in between

265
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,640
Work and I'm working on like a little comic project. I'm doing Clarissa gunsmoke. I fill up my website

266
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,000
I show them things and I'm like, oh, this is really good. They say I'm like cool. Yeah. Yeah, they say

267
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,200
and then there's pumpkin alley and that's like

268
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,240
It's like, oh, yes

269
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,800
This is funny. No, I can I can I can see like you can show that to anyone

270
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,480
I mean, I feel like anyone can immediately appreciate like, oh, wow

271
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,440
You made a whole video game and it actually works and like this looks like

272
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,240
That's the way I would have made pumpkin alleys is so that when I go to family gatherings

273
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
I can show them something and I don't have to talk

274
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,040
Look at that. Look at the funny colors. That's not true. That's the only way you don't have to play the guitar

275
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:57,240
It was funny. My grandma was watching the kids play and she's like didn't understand couldn't understand what a game was

276
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,960
And she's like, oh, this is quite a long film. Isn't it like she thought I'd made a film

277
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Oh, come on. They were playing she was I mean, she's a little

278
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Okay

279
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Is she like

280
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,080
Okay

281
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,840
All right in that case, I guess it's understandable, but like

282
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,400
Old people know what video what is she not? What is she not fucking remember Pong?

283
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,000
What is she not remember fucking Pac-Man and Donkey Kong like give me a break old lady?

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,960
Oh, she's like saying you're staying here. Stay in your fucking lane. It's like 80 something. Okay. Well, she was she's

285
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,040
Sure, but that means that she was like only she was only 40 when like Donkey Kong

286
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,880
What I'm so I'm not 40 year olds didn't know they did yes

287
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,520
They did 40 year olds would they would see Pac-Man on the news because it was a craze. They would see they would see

288
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,640
You know, it's not like she doesn't know what a video game is, but she just didn't in that moment

289
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,480
She was just sort of like lapsed in like understanding. It's like we made a game

290
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,440
She's like, oh, that's interesting and then later. She'd be like this is quite a long story like she doesn't realize very funny

291
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,680
Like it wasn't that's her. That's her little anyway of saying this is boring guys. This is boring

292
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,600
Yeah, well, she couldn't do anything about it. She was in the ha ha she's old now and she can't

293
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
The future is now

294
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,800
We sit and we play our film and I brought COVID for her for Christmas terrible shame on you shame on me

295
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,240
I didn't know I was perfectly I did catch I did not it wasn't COVID

296
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,640
But I definitely caught like a cold or something from my early Christmas Eve

297
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,080
Family gathering I was sniffling for a while after that, but it was fine. It wasn't that bad

298
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Hmm

299
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,760
You know

300
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,280
The thing about being a dude at these sorts of gatherings is once you get your salutations out of the way and you've kind of said

301
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,680
Hello to everyone most of the time

302
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,280
You don't really have to talk because a football game will be on and you can just sit down and watch the football game

303
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,720
And that's perfectly acceptable and and then you don't have to like talk about stuff

304
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,960
You can just be like oh man that interception. Oh, he blew it. Oh, he blew it. Oh

305
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,160
Come on, man. Why don't you root? Why don't you why don't you why don't you bring one in for the home team?

306
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,360
You fucking said oh, this guy can't catch. Oh, this guy. Oh, he's got no range. He's got he's good close range

307
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,640
He's got no long-range game. Ah, what happened to Brady? Ah, geez, you know, it's just it's so easy

308
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
It could not could not be simpler

309
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,240
It's funny as not usually like a sports game on during one of those gatherings

310
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,920
Maybe the sometimes some sometimes during the summer, they'll probably be like I don't know if like some sort of thing

311
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
during a I don't know if maybe I

312
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,840
Feel like it might be an American tradition and the reason I say that is just because you know foot football season is in full

313
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,740
Is in full swing during the holiday season. There's always a game playing on

314
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,180
on Thanksgiving in

315
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,900
Christmas, maybe not on Christmas Day, but but on

316
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,820
Well, no, sometimes they're there probably is around them

317
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:18,560
You know, they probably do play on Christmas Eve Christmas Day New Year's like it's right the lead up to the the playoffs so like

318
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,720
Things are things are pitch. I mean the last

319
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
The last like

320
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:33,300
Football like soccer thing right that ended and that yeah that ended so I mean so, you know, it kind of would yeah

321
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,980
I guess yeah, so that would make kind of make sense that like that's a thing that we do just because the seasons are

322
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,180
lined up for it, but

323
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,500
Yeah, but anyway that makes it very like

324
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Make makes it makes it effortless

325
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,220
That's my version of playing guitar, so I don't have to talk to anyone

326
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,380
Is just sit down and watch the game, but it's sort of yeah, there was a guitar there

327
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,020
I did play the guitar. I didn't know what to do. I'm just making fun of you. I was I was looking pretty good

328
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,340
I was looking pretty good. I had like some makeup on and I was like

329
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:14,140
Some people knew that I was trans and some people didn't and so but I didn't feel like correcting people and

330
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,540
it was just so it was it wasn't like I

331
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,480
Don't have any relatives that are against that. I don't think even my grandma's just sort of like okay like she's just

332
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,800
That's a very um, that's a very long

333
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,280
Gender you've got there. What's what's what's going on with that? Oh

334
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,340
Wait, that was a that was a call back to say that okay, I understand now lol

335
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,060
um

336
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,500
Yeah, yeah, I I looked good and I felt like because I looked good

337
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,500
It was easy to chat with people as opposed to when I look like a weirdo

338
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,580
And I'm like, oh these people are normal and they have like normal lives and stuff and

339
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,220
They're gonna hear about me talking about my art stuff. I'm doing and I'm like, I don't know

340
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,300
Yeah, I guess I don't know I gotta hey

341
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,340
Yeah, I don't know like that's that's all of it. It's always been like that

342
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,300
Like ah, but it was nice. It was like I had like a glass of wine. I was chatting with people

343
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,300
It was normal. I was so normal. It's amazing. That's a me. That's I'm happy for you

344
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,060
My my big takeaway from the holiday season has mostly been I

345
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,140
Mean I kind of already knew this but it sort of was hammered it into me even more

346
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,700
so all my relatives not all of them, but like most of them are quite bougie and

347
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
I

348
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,220
Truly am an insect just an insignificant worm

349
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:05,340
You know all my uncles and stuff most of them got like big houses and stuff not like mansions, but like

350
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,720
Some of some of them kind of have things you might you might describe as mansions

351
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,460
My cousin bunch of my cousins ones around my age got houses

352
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,300
They're they're like they're renting their houses to tenants and stuff, you know, bunch of a bunch of them are married

353
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,340
Bunch of we're having kids and whatever and I'm just like, ah jeez my I

354
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,740
Just I feel I feel a power differential forming there. I feel like I am lower on the societal

355
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:39,780
Totem pole. I feel like if it came to it if it came to some sort of conflict some sort of like battle between us

356
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,500
They would they would crush me they would defeat me because they have more institutional power in the form of

357
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Capital and that

358
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,700
Upsets me that upsets me quite a lot. I

359
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,380
Want to crush my enemies. I want to crush my enemies and I want to know that if I need to crush someone I can crush them

360
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Do you understand?

361
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,500
I do understand. Then we are then we are then we understand each other and then we are

362
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,820
Yeah, I mean trying to think of my family, there's a few of my cousins on my dad's side are like

363
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:24,940
Like one of them got into banking and he's like super wealthy and he's got his own house and it's all like

364
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:32,020
Was that a cousin you say a cousin? Yeah around around your age or a little older like five

365
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:39,020
Six years older. Yeah, okay, and he and he he studied really hard at school, and then he got back into like banking and stuff

366
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,660
And it's like that's some big money

367
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,700
Sure, and it's it feels weird talking to him because I'm like, what am I I'm like on the other side of the family

368
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,580
unemployed basically and

369
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,420
I

370
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:57,780
Draw a bit and I make some music sometimes and animate and yeah, yeah

371
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,140
Yeah, I don't know how I can hold a conversation with him even though

372
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,900
We were like quite close when we were little

373
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,820
He showed me he showed me Grand Theft Auto

374
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,940
He showed me Vice City when I was like six. Yeah

375
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,580
And I played that in his room and it was like, oh my god. I ran over someone. Ha ha

376
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:24,740
Interesting that was cool. Yeah, and it's like now he's he's not different. It's just like I feel a little

377
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,500
Inadequate, I don't know and and yeah, so I so I understand the feeling

378
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,940
Yeah, yeah, sounds like pretty similar

379
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,940
um

380
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,780
I mean, I guess um

381
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,940
I guess my options are you know one

382
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,740
Just cope just cope and sieve

383
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,860
Cope and sieve and that's and usually that's what I would go

384
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,420
But let's explore alternatives here

385
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,420
Uh, I mean you can cope and grin. I can I can

386
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,740
Forgo the sea I can see this is important. I can cope and grieve cope and grieve. That's pretty good

387
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,820
Um, but no, I can I can just cope with it and be like, well, you know

388
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,660
I'm a I'm an art guy. I'm an internet poster guy. It's okay

389
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,620
It's okay that I don't uh

390
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
But I haven't bought a house or whatever

391
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:19,060
Whatever, I'll just be the indie. I'll just be the indie cousin man. It's fine. Yeah, and that's that's whatever that's okay

392
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
um

393
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,020
I could sell I could sell out

394
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,300
Is it you kind of it kind of makes me well

395
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,740
Kind of makes me want uh, it kind of makes me think again about that thing that I might have mentioned before about maybe

396
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,380
Maybe I should look for like a job with a studio or something

397
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,420
Maybe I should look for some kind of some kind of like some kind of slightly more legitimate

398
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,660
employment

399
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,260
you know

400
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,460
uh

401
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,820
Get some dental insurance now and like, you know, I've said this before

402
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,300
uh, I wouldn't

403
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,660
Wouldn't want to do some bullshit like uh, every time I every time I talk to my dad

404
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,620
My dad's always like you should work for oracle bet like you should like I know lots of people that work for oracle

405
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,100
Like they're always hiring you should work for oracle like why the fuck would I work for oracle?

406
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,740
What are you talking about?

407
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,380
What's oracle? Uh, some like technology or maybe they like cyber security or

408
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,420
Uh, internet browser or something, you know, they do some fucking stupid internet

409
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
He's offering some nepotism

410
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,860
I guess I mean, I don't think he has any connections to oracle. I mean, I guess he

411
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,940
He might have some patience. I don't think he could get me like a foot in the door

412
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,180
um

413
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,100
But I mean, why would I why would I want to work but think of the fact stack spin?

414
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
What would I what would I do for oracle?

415
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,180
I mean, you'd you'd hack into the mainframe. You release the secrets you'd whistle blow

416
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
I don't think that's a good way to get paid

417
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,340
Uh, you get paid first then you do it one paycheck

418
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,260
Um, uh

419
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,260
All right, so I mean

420
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,500
But you but you know what I'm saying like I don't want to do that

421
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:07,220
But um, but I would I would kind of like to say oh, yeah, I I work for someone I have a job doing something

422
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,060
I just

423
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,060
man

424
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,140
I don't know

425
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:19,780
Is it really just for the benefit of like a social awkwardness moment in a family gathering not not really

426
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,220
It's not really about that. It's not about being embarrassed

427
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,980
It's because you know, I didn't really feel that embarrassed. I didn't feel like my cousins were judging me super hard or anything

428
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,740
I didn't feel like oh no. What do they think about me? It's not like that. It was about

429
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,460
You know, just the the things they were talking about

430
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Uh, just made me

431
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,740
I mean, I'm sorry, but it leads me

432
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:47,380
Literally what I said about like they could crush me and I want and I want to be able to crush them first

433
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,300
Um

434
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,660
Yeah

435
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,060
You could crush them with a train become a train driver. I'm sorry, but I'm just I'm just

436
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,620
Out to a crew as much as much power as much power as possible and I feel like um

437
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,620
I have I have I have behave suboptimally in that realm. It's not about right. It's not about money

438
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
It's not about it's not about buying things

439
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,820
Except that it is because capital will protect me

440
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,380
And will be used and I can wield it as a weapon if I need to

441
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,060
So it is about money, but not in the sense that I just want to buy things with it

442
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,060
Uh, I feel like this this could slot into the meme

443
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,220
Of you hiding behind the table and something coming through the door

444
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,900
Like family members coming through the door who have money

445
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,300
What's what's coming through the door? Is it is it a is it a bunch of

446
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Job offers being like come out and come out and accept your paycheck

447
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,540
I hate capital I hate capital or uh, something something like that something like that

448
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,180
um

449
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,740
Okay, I don't want to I didn't want to uh, uh, I don't want to drag this point out or anything, but uh, that's

450
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,900
That's for a man. Hey suggest. Hey suggest in the comments

451
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Suggest to me in the comments

452
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:18,020
Uh, what what jobs should I apply to that I can uh, you know work as a creative professional

453
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,700
and also a crew capital and uh

454
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:30,740
You should become a professor become institutionally powerful a professor of weird internet shit at a real university

455
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,620
They'll probably have a course for that. I'll just do that. You know what?

456
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,660
I saw a tweet the other day and I don't know if it's true

457
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,500
I don't know what this person's bona fides was

458
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,140
But he just said like you used to be able to just send a letter to a university and be like

459
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Hey, I just want to study so-and-so

460
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,900
Give me a job as a professor so I can do that and they and sometimes they'd just be like, okay

461
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,740
You know not all the time, but like if you had something legit

462
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,020
If you had a nice jacket you had a nice I do I do have a nice jacket. Well, it's kind of old

463
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,020
Maybe I should get a new one

464
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,540
But um that you know, I think like nowadays

465
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,940
I don't even know how you'd go about doing that. I don't even know how you'd go about doing that these days

466
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,420
Probably it's just the same. It's just everybody thinks it's not doable

467
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,220
Send a little letter so hand written letter

468
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
and you and like

469
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:33,300
And then uh better than hand written better than lipstick kiss like a lipstick kiss on the bottom xo xo

470
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Better than hand written

471
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,140
Assemble the letter from cut out letters from different magazine articles

472
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,380
And then attach like a photo like a crime photo, you know the ones

473
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,900
Sure. Well, first I have to commit a crime to take to take a photo of it. Oh, oh, yeah

474
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:59,540
Yeah, yeah, I'm like scenes of the crime. I think yeah, here's me doing a crime just unrelated to the letter

475
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Yeah, just to let him know

476
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:08,980
That I love crime and that I'm a democrat and that and I wouldn't do crime here if I was employed

477
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,780
I could I could do crime if I want to but I've chosen to work for you instead

478
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,300
So that's so that's my Christmas a yearning for

479
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
About

480
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,820
The only other thing I have to say about Christmas

481
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,620
Is that I got very drunk on

482
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,900
Christmas Eve

483
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,540
Cool, and I was hungover for the whole of Christmas day

484
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,580
That's pretty I was like I was about I was like passing out like I got us. I got to lie down

485
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,460
When we were all open in the presence, which kind of ruined the moment, but that's okay

486
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
I uh

487
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,780
because uh

488
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,340
I felt better and that's the end of that story

489
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Spectacular I

490
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,340
I didn't really I didn't really have any hangover. I drank a little bit on like uh Christmas Eve

491
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,180
And a bit I don't know why I was hungover because I like hung over at all. I got like I just like

492
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,660
This was just a few glasses of red wine. It was like four to five now in my in my experience

493
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,500
I feel like wine gives you worse hangovers than other kinds of uh

494
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,340
I guess so I'm not sure why that is or if maybe it's just a coincidence or I was even imagining it

495
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,940
That's just that's just the feeling that I have for my experiences

496
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,180
Like maybe I should have been on the the spirits or something

497
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,340
Definitely definitely switch to the heart definitely switch to the heart. So yeah the eggless

498
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,060
Just pouring drinking straight rum out of a tumbler. Yeah, I call it eggless. No

499
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
That's good. That's good

500
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,420
um

501
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
But you didn't try you didn't have any egg nog

502
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,100
Nobody nobody had any egg. It's just not a thing

503
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
It's good though. It's so good

504
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,100
Look, it's like a nutmeg milkshake

505
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Bre

506
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,260
I am

507
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
I am

508
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,980
I have lots of leftover meat. I have lots of leftover meat and cold cuts from the the new year's gathering

509
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
So that's cool. That's protein

510
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,940
Yes, I am protein

511
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,260
Uh, I am

512
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,780
Yeah, I guess so

513
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,580
um

514
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,500
My lifts my lifts

515
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,260
I'm gaining weight, but that's fine. My lifts are coming along

516
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,500
They're not amazing yet, but they're getting they're getting back to a somewhat respect. I mean not even respect. They're getting back to a

517
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,460
an okay starting point

518
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,220
um

519
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,900
One of my new year's resolutions is to keep lifting and a deadlift 300 again

520
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Uh, that's how I that's how I'll know

521
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,740
That i'm really doing it

522
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
um

523
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,260
I guess

524
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,260
My new year's resolution is to lower my testosterone to the correct amount

525
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,220
Because of my moment to raise my testosterone. Give me some of your excess

526
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,180
Sure. I don't know how to do that

527
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,340
Siphon it out

528
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
Send me your blood. Send me your blood

529
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,260
I used to need to take all of my blood and then like filter out the testosterone and then put my the blood back in

530
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,460
And then you can have the tea all all I want for Christmas is gibbs blood

531
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,380
Yeah, I don't know what are you spit it out nothing

532
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,380
Nothing nothing. How's your new years? Is that any different from Christmas? Was it the same sort of thing?

533
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
I mean in the evening the new year's evening

534
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:54,580
I just hung out at the the munchie house and there's a couple people in town visiting for that. We watched. Oh, we watched um

535
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,940
What's that movie? Sorry to bother you. You know that one?

536
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,700
Nope

537
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,340
It's a boots boots Riley. I think oh shit

538
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,700
Is he the actor too or is he just the director?

539
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,180
I don't know

540
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,300
um

541
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
No, he's just the director. Um

542
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Uh, it's about um

543
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,500
Well, I can't really I honestly I can't really explain what it's about without

544
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,140
Spoiling it, but it's that one where the black guy joins the like telecommunications

545
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
or the telemarketing

546
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,900
job

547
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,620
And the guy tells him to use your use your white voice

548
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,220
Use your white voice when you're calling white people to sell them shit

549
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,660
And uh, he's his white voice is voiced by david cross

550
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:43,860
It was pretty good pretty good kind of fucked up kind of kind of some weird wacky twists and turns

551
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
But it was a good watch

552
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,380
And that's held. Yeah, it's pretty much. It's pretty much all I did pretty much all I did

553
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,220
We got chicken and waffles went out for breakfast. I got chicken and waffles on new year's evening. That was great

554
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum

555
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,700
Uh, I mean, you know, yeah nothing much

556
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Nothing nothing nothing much going on

557
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,460
I did the uh, the new year's stream on on twitch, right?

558
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,940
I played a video game fleshed away on ps2

559
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
Wait, remember that fleshed away

560
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
The movie the um the art movie the game

561
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,940
Right. Okay. Is that a is that a 3d collectathon or is it a 3d platformer collectathon?

562
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,260
and it's it's

563
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:37,540
Like but it's bad, but it's kind of okay. Actually. It's fun and it's really funny looking

564
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,860
I watched that movie at christmas like two or three years ago

565
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,620
I think and I really like and I really liked it. Yeah, I thought it was great

566
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,900
I don't remember it. It's like I know

567
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
Is it hu grant ret?

568
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,940
Yeah, I think so. I think so and he's and he's doing his hu grant voice

569
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
Hugh granted his hu grantiest

570
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,900
and and

571
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,140
And so he goes into the sewers and he's a rat

572
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
And and he has to learn to be

573
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:14,180
Of like a shit rat instead of a clean rat. Hmm. That's the moral of the tale. That's that's it

574
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:21,780
Uh, yeah, I thought that movie was great and was just a good clean a good clean

575
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Uh, you know compelling

576
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,180
You know three act heroes journey

577
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
not not in like a really like

578
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,540
The the like the structure is boring

579
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,420
I like they obviously stuck really close to the structure and and I and it takes me out of the movie

580
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,180
But I'm just like, yeah, you like solid just really solid solid storytelling

581
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,380
Yeah, and I just enjoy enjoyable the whole way through

582
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,700
Pays pace perfectly is quite good. I don't remember flushed away being bad. I just

583
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,580
I remember the the most

584
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,820
The thinking the most

585
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,820
interesting aspect of it was the fact that it is cgi the first cgi ardman animation

586
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,060
Um

587
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,020
Before that they were all like plasticine and stuff and clay

588
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,420
Um, and it's like they made it look like it was clay, but it wasn't

589
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,420
Yeah, so aside for it. So in terms of the story, I actually can't remember whether it was like terrible or fine

590
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,220
It's good and I guess I'm here to tell you it's good

591
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,100
Good my mom didn't like it. She thought it was gross. She doesn't like gross out

592
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,740
Stuff the slugs and slime. I guess so I guess so. Yeah

593
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,780
um

594
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:40,500
But it was fun stream. I kind of want to stream more often. Oh, that's another thing. Yeah, I want to uh,

595
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,220
I don't know if I hope I haven't said this before but

596
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,220
Okay, I have been in between holidays

597
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,820
I've been really trying to work on that book and I said I was gonna get the book done by the new years

598
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,300
And I didn't and it's kind of my fault, but it's also kind of the fault of my shitty internet

599
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,380
Which has been even worse than usual

600
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,780
It's been almost unusual unusable like a lot of the time and it's really fucking me up

601
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,980
So I'm gonna get that fixed and then once my internet is fixed

602
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,780
I am gonna start streaming and what I'm gonna stream is I'm gonna stream myself playing

603
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,540
Uh mega man battle network. I'm gonna play the whole yeah

604
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Yes, I'm gonna play the whole battle network series and I'm gonna stream it because I should have streamed myself playing all the mega man games

605
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,380
And I feel like it was a bit of a missed opportunity that I didn't stream myself playing 45 different mega man games

606
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,940
Because that would have been content and I would have got donos

607
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,540
So yeah, so this time i'm gonna do it because I gotta play those games because I gotta make that video

608
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,860
But I might as well do it on stream and so I will and it's gonna be fun

609
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,460
And it's gonna be fun god damn it and you're gonna watch it. You're gonna watch it

610
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,020
Oh my god, I better watch it. You're gonna watch it

611
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Is that the lowest you can go?

612
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,740
The lowest?

613
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
You're gonna watch it

614
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,260
I was trying to do the um, uh, mr. Plinkett

615
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,820
Yelling at nadine

616
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,580
You're gonna you're gonna watch the star wars movie. Oh, yeah

617
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,460
Speaking of

618
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,260
Mr. Plinkett speaking of the angry video game nerd. I've been rewatching a lot of angry video game nerd

619
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,700
Yeah, I've just been putting it that's just sort of been my like put it on in the background while I do other stuff

620
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,700
content lately

621
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
and I think

622
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,940
In the hot take I think

623
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,020
I think we as a society

624
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,700
need to

625
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Need to start to be okay

626
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,300
with admitting

627
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
That it's bad even though

628
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,660
We think that uh, uh, uh, what's his name is a good guy, right?

629
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,700
Uh, the show is bad james, uh

630
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,460
Is his name james, uh, rolf james rolf. Yeah, I think I think we need to admit to a society that

631
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,620
Yeah, I guess it's charming or whatever. Yeah, I guess he's got enthusiasm or whatever

632
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,220
But like the content is bad the comedy is bad. He's not a good comedian

633
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,460
Uh, it's a bad show. We liked it because it was unique, but it was bad

634
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,340
And it's okay to admit that even though james rolf seems like a decent guy and a family man

635
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,860
And oh, we don't want to offend him. Oh, no

636
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,660
We don't want to compare him to dug walker because dug walker is an asshole and an incompetent stooge and a hack

637
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,740
And we don't like dug a dug sucks and that's true and we don't feel that way about james

638
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,500
But we should we we should we should be able to look ourselves in the mirror and say

639
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,140
The show was bad

640
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,420
uh

641
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,220
I I mean, I would agree that there's plenty of episodes that are just certainly

642
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,180
Like un un good. They're not good. They're bad. Yes. Um, I'm what

643
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,060
Did you watch like from the very beginning?

644
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,100
I've been what I've been sort of just skipping around watching watching the old

645
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,020
I mean, I've been watching the like the full season compilations

646
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,940
So like I'll watch season two and then I'll watch season 12 and then I'll watch season five and I'll watch season 11

647
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,100
There there I a few years ago. I was watching

648
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,300
All of them again, and I'm like I there's definitely a point beyond which

649
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,140
It's like there's a golden era where like mostly episodes are fun and good and then

650
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:17,700
Something changes and it sucks. I'm and it's sort of like this kind of the same but it just sort of feels weird

651
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,220
His delivery is a bit like annoying

652
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,180
And at like after a certain point

653
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,540
I'm gonna say even even though I kind of know what you mean

654
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
I there is sort of a difference in delivery

655
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,780
But I honestly don't think it's that

656
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,700
Much and I think that the early show and the late show are more similar

657
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,860
Than they are different. I don't I think it's I think it's kind of

658
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Hasn't really changed that much

659
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,380
I'll I'll believe that I still will watch them because I'm nostalgic for those

660
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,980
Yeah, my feeling I think you know, I watched a bunch of

661
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,980
I think I watched a bunch of newer ones like I started on the latest season

662
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,860
And I watched through it and I was like lol, okay

663
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,460
And then I went back to an early season and I was like wasn't that

664
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,180
Wasn't that different

665
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,820
He's kind of always been

666
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
If I if I if I just gripe like

667
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,100
A lot of his delivery is is weird and his timing

668
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,900
Is really weird and a lot of his jokes are like not even jokes like when he'll just

669
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,500
And this is the thing he's always done. He's always done it where like

670
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,260
he'll be like

671
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,940
I don't know read

672
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,660
Read in the box of the game like oh this game

673
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,220
This game lets you uh, uh

674
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,580
You know, uh, uh, this game lets you bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yeah

675
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,700
This game lets you bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki

676
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Yeah, and like that's the joke the joke is he like repeats something and then he says yeah, and that's the joke

677
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,700
Yeah, I mean

678
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,060
I don't like those and it's not even he he does it all the time

679
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,940
He does it all the time. He does it all the time to the point. It's like that's his style of comedy

680
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:06,580
Here there's a and it's hack. It's really it is. There's a like an upsetting amount of like references

681
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:13,540
Like taken in their entirety and maybe changed slightly to fit the whatever you're saying

682
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,900
Um of like things he likes like movies and shows and stuff things. I didn't understand. I didn't see them as references

683
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,660
I thought he was being smart

684
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,860
But no, he was just quoting something and it's like so much of of what he did was just quoting something

685
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,220
A lot of people around that time. Yeah of like internet content creators. It's just like hey

686
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,980
I know this movie. I'm gonna say a line from it. If you know the movie

687
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,780
You're what you're you're great. You're a cool guy. Yeah, that's true

688
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,900
That's true, but it's it's not the main issue that I was noticing on the same on the same vein as what I just said like

689
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
You know a lot of the time

690
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,180
A joke will just be

691
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:00,260
That he just says what's happening in the game and he reacts with like inquiry. He's like, oh, man

692
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,700
They're like, oh, yeah, or like damn

693
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,780
and like that's

694
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,060
There's no joke

695
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,580
It's just in noting what he sees and then well saying damn or something like that

696
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,140
I mean and then sometimes he'll say

697
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,620
This is a poopy stick

698
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,660
On a on a dog's anus or something and it's like, okay. Okay. At least that at least that's something

699
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:30,340
At least you've made something out of it. I don't have like a problem with like just having the gameplay and then like

700
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,820
Like responding to something. Yeah, I think

701
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:43,620
The delivery changes over the course of what the decades or something and he sort of goes deeper and more growly and it sort of like is

702
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,460
Unnatural I like the earlier ones because it sounds like he's just a guy in his room playing a game and you're watching him

703
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,620
And he's like fuck

704
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,660
That's how you would say that if you were playing it. I only really feel that way about like season one

705
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,940
I think even by season two. He's become like fully

706
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,980
Stikopher. Yeah, maybe I haven't watched them in a few years

707
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,740
There's a mark difference between season one and season two

708
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,860
Oh, yeah, definitely season one doesn't even feel like a show. It's just like yeah

709
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,780
It's like a vague sense of a character. Mm-hmm

710
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,540
It also it's this is this is a neutral point. This is not a complaint

711
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:28,900
I just think it's very interesting that James Rolfe's idea of a stereotypical nerd is someone that drinks rolling rock

712
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,460
Like that's like that's a key element of the angry video game nerd characters that he likes to drink beer

713
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,060
And that's just such like a non-nerd drink in my opinion

714
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,980
I mean, I I remember him talking about like that

715
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,100
The reason for the beer specifically

716
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,900
Is that like he made the first one or he's just talking about cosylvania 2

717
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,300
It's like what if some guy was still angry at a video game all these years later?

718
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,060
Isn't that a funny concept me and then he did that and then he's like, all right

719
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
Now i'm gonna show him on screen

720
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:06,900
So he did dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde where he was dressed as a nerd stereotypical like glasses

721
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,460
All right, the first one didn't have video

722
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,020
The first one didn't have video the second one is like now i'm gonna like amp it up

723
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,740
This is like the sequel to that concept. Yeah, and he just was like so what if

724
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:26,420
This guy is so obsessed with this any ass game that has ruined his life to a ridiculous degree is such that he's drinking himself

725
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,980
Uh like silly

726
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:33,940
That you know, it's like such a strange idea that someone would be so obsessed

727
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:39,780
So he just picked up whatever he had in his fridge and it just happened to be rolling rock and then from then on he said

728
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,460
I guess that's a character trait. I'll bring it back and then that's his thing and that's the reason that's so silly

729
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:51,620
I mean, so it's almost like he he was he was trying to invent the trope of like

730
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,700
I mean, he kind of did invent the trope of like uh to this reviewing this game is so hard. It's so bad

731
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,140
I have to drink to get through it. Yeah. Yeah, I know like ironically he invented that

732
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,060
But he never really sells it because he never seems like he's getting drunk

733
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,700
He's never seems drunk or like he

734
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:13,060
Maybe i'm forgetting but like it's it's just a few episodes. It feels like it's something that he's doing casually

735
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,540
Yeah, it seems like just

736
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,980
It causes me to drink but then he continues talking normally. There's a few episodes where he gets so drunk

737
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,620
And then it's it's a bit

738
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,860
I don't even I don't remember that ever happened. Well, actually, you know, I think

739
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:33,860
The only one I can think of is like the the return to dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde where he has like a big like

740
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,620
glass

741
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,620
Like what do you call them?

742
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,340
Mug

743
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,500
No, it's like a thing with a stuff a glass stopper in it and it's got alcohol some sort of a spirit

744
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,500
Oh like a

745
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
A canteen

746
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Not a canteen a flat

747
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,380
It's like a huge thing. It's the sort of thing you would have like very expensive whiskey in

748
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,340
And he was drinking that and he was getting super drunk

749
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,740
Playing dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde. Okay, so it sounds like in that episode. He actually did

750
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,460
Do the I have to get drunk to play this video. Yeah, okay, okay

751
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,700
um

752
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,700
But yeah, it's funny that it's just like

753
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,060
Ah this I hate this game sip

754
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:22,500
Like that's that's the extent of it most of the time. Yeah, it that's what I'm saying. Um

755
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,540
Yeah, I don't know, uh

756
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,860
I guess it's just you know

757
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,700
I don't have my favorite moments

758
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,580
But I don't I don't like go up and say oh, you've got to watch all of angry video game

759
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:40,340
It's just like I would never say that the feeling I have mostly found it pretty you know pretty enjoyable

760
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,500
Pretty an offensive to just have it on in the background

761
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,380
Just let it play lately like it's fine like I keep doing it

762
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,300
But I I have to say that in my opinion

763
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,860
A lot of the a lot of the a lot of the content that I feel is meant to be comedic

764
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,660
Is sort of not even really

765
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:06,100
Successfully executed joke. I think a lot of what I would describe as the comedy or the attempts at comedy is is hack

766
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:12,020
Uh and like a writer like a comedy writer could have made a joke out of this whereas the

767
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,060
Angry video game nerd will simply go. Yeah

768
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,580
Imagine that continues playing video game

769
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:26,420
That's it. Yeah, that's that's that's all I gotta say about uh James Rolf and you know, I want please

770
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,540
I'm sorry. Listen. I wish the man I wish the man nothing but the best. I know he's a family man. Okay, like I know

771
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:39,060
I know he's got a family Ben. I know I know and everyone's like, oh james. We just want him to we just want him to

772
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,180
He's he's uh, he just wants to be with his family now

773
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,740
He doesn't have time to make the angry video game nerd and like that's cool man. That's cool. That's good. You know

774
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,300
Good luck to him

775
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,460
um, my favorite moment

776
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,660
Of the top of my head from the angry video game nerd is the batman episode

777
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,140
where he's playing the batman games

778
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,620
and he's playing like

779
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,820
There's this one game where he has to use a grappling hook

780
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:12,980
To get to get somewhere and he's really really like getting really screamy angry like what the fuck?

781
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,140
Why is it not working?

782
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,740
There's something about the rant there that's like he's really blowing out the mic

783
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,620
and it's it's more

784
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
It's more than just sort of like a

785
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,660
I don't know like a throwaway moment

786
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,980
And I was like, yeah, that's great. And then also

787
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,660
Mike Matei playing the joker. That's probably my favorite joker

788
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,580
He's so better better than uh, not Ethan Hawke. Um

789
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:41,780
Heath Ledger, but not better than Heath Ledger. Yeah, but like he's he's like

790
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,020
I love him. I love him as the joker. It's so like it's annoying

791
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,540
But like for the in the in the show in the in the thing

792
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,060
He's just forcing him to play the shitty games and he's just going

793
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,740
And then he gets them all shoved up his ass at the end

794
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,460
there was a really

795
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,340
Funny moment and it was kind of unintentionally funny because I was watching the episodes out of order

796
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,940
And so I I got to one where you know, Bugs Bunny comes back

797
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
But it you know, I watched that

798
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,980
Before I watched the actual one where that like introduces Bugs Bunny

799
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,420
And so when Bugs Bunny Bugs Bunny just shows up and he goes

800
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:27,780
What's up doc and the nerd reacts to the mirror like appearance of Bugs Bunny with an immediate like

801
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:33,380
Furious like I'm gonna kill this mother fucker. Like I hate you. I hate you

802
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,260
Beating the shit out of and it's like what

803
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,260
I I knew that like, you know, I know that there's context there

804
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:45,780
But it didn't feel like it. It just feels like wow this guy just hates Bugs Bunny like for some reason

805
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:52,980
Uh, uh, uh, who knows why? Um, it's I mean, it's kind of like that in the in the original one as well

806
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,780
It's just like he's playing a Bugs Bunny game

807
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,700
And then it's like, yeah, it's Bugs Bunny Bugs fucking bunny and then he starts punching him

808
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,940
And I think the implication is that he doesn't like the shitty video game

809
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,860
Yeah, but like he goes straight to like beating the shit out of the bunny before he's even said anything

810
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:17,700
Is that right? Is that is that his first appearance? No, no, no. Well his first appearance is

811
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,820
Bugs Bunny's birthday blowout or something

812
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,940
Yeah, and I thought that like Bugs Bunny just comes in and they're just

813
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,820
Commentating on the game and and they get in a fight over how bad the game is or something

814
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,500
No, I think I think I remember it being like

815
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,300
He's playing the game and he's losing. It's like, ah, fuck this game and then

816
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,140
Bugs Bunny comes in. He's like, yeah, what's up, doc?

817
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,460
Maybe I'm thinking of that. Oh my god, it's Bugs Bunny. And then he just punches him

818
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:49,380
That's the joke is like he's not happy to see you. He's angry to see him. So, okay

819
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,340
Really? That was his first appearance. I just thought like

820
00:53:53,220 --> 00:54:00,260
Okay, weird. Okay. No, I guess it was funny on purpose for the same reason that I found it funny. So, you know, good job

821
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,780
Yeah, I like the fucking the violence the Bugs Bunny stuff

822
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:14,100
Yeah, there's there's lots of nuggets of gold. It's just there's so like there's there's a point beyond which he's clearly like not interested in

823
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:20,500
Doing the show. Yeah, because of money reasons. He's like, well, I got to do one every month every two months

824
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,060
Uh, let's just do it and it's just sort of

825
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:28,900
I think I don't like it. I don't like it after a certain but I forget when I think but it's just sort of yeah

826
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:35,060
Yeah, generally like I watched the the kingdom hearts one where like he's playing kingdom hearts

827
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:41,060
Just because it was a big game at the time and like he he never even played the there's no nostalgia there

828
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,940
Uh, uh, and and it's

829
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,700
But he just kind of treats it the way he would play any other game

830
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,020
And I don't know I feel like the fact that I you see him like just kind of give the same

831
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,460
What were they thinking? What the fuck? I don't kind of it's like, oh man, you can just

832
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:01,940
This shit kind of just writes itself actually like you could literally just give the same treatment to any game and it wouldn't even matter

833
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,460
Uh, I kind of cheapen kind of cheapen the shtick

834
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,340
In hindsight a little bit

835
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:14,260
Uh, see seeing him do it also to these games that are not really worthy of it

836
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,140
You know

837
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,260
Yeah

838
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,860
You know, I just want

839
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:26,660
Capital so that I can destroy james so I can destroy james rolf that I can like ruin him ruin his personal and professional

840
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,820
Sort of get him it's only get him before he gets me

841
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:36,500
I want to you know, I want to step into into the anger video games nerd nerds room and he'll say oh

842
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,860
Ben sainte you made phantom revenge that game was a fucking dog zainus shitting out barf

843
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,100
And then he'll just jump and start kicking my ass and then I'll go like uh, I have a team of lawyers

844
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,060
I have a team of lawyers who are going to destroy you for this and he'll go

845
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:54,740
Oh, no, and then and then and then my and then the repo man will come and they'll just start carrying all his video games out

846
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,340
And I'll stand there and I'll be like ha ha ha. This is what you get

847
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,420
This is what you get because you didn't make enough money

848
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,900
You didn't make as much money as I did nerd and now you're going to the poor house

849
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,260
And he'll say no my family and I'll say I'm taking them too

850
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,940
And that's it. You have the money to buy them

851
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,100
And it's and it's just the plot of um and from there. It's just um

852
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,380
the um, uh

853
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,220
That song

854
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,540
It's that it's that music video. It's that song. Um

855
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:30,420
It's it's uh, it's thank you by dito. It's just um, it's just a music video for thank you by dito, but it's

856
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,740
But it's angry video game nerd. You know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about

857
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,860
No, I you know you know you come on. Come on. Come on. You know

858
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,460
The song thank you by dito famously the song stamp sampled in m&m's song stan

859
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,100
uh is uh

860
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,300
Is a song that ironically juxtaposes

861
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,860
Uh, someone having a bad day. They describe a bad day that they had

862
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,060
Uh, but the chorus is saying thank you it's saying thank you to an imagined character

863
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:06,340
That is the their lover or loved one of some kind and they say it's the best day ever the best day ever because uh

864
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,300
Because you know, you gave me the best day ever because I was with you

865
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:15,060
Then the music video is dito is singing this while like her uh, the repo men are coming

866
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,100
They're just like kicking around her house. They're taking everything, right?

867
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,820
Uh, so it's that

868
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,700
Epic. Yeah, thank you. Thank you

869
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,500
Um, it's a good song though. You know who should do a music video about that

870
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,660
I mean, you know who should do a video about that as um, and I say this knowing that it's wrong

871
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,660
Um, Todd in the shadows should do a one hit wonderland about thank you

872
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,380
The only song that anyone knows by dito and only because it was sampled in stan

873
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:51,300
And I say that knowing full well that I'm sure he would be like um actually dito like charted on the top 40 like a dozen different times

874
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,500
Back in like the early 90s and I'd say I don't care

875
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,980
I don't care idiot. I don't know any of those songs. It's about my understanding

876
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,860
I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm not I'm not wrong

877
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:07,060
I feel like the average person if you ask them dito, they would be like who the fuck is dito

878
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,940
And then you'd say, you know, they did thank you and they'd be like what the fuck is thank you by dito

879
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,620
And they'd say and you'd say giving me the best day of my life and they'd say oh stan

880
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:23,860
Oh stan by m&m and they go. Yes stan. Yes dito is the one that made stan by m&m

881
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:30,820
You don't what what what I've never listened to m&m. What the what the fuck? I know the spaghetti song

882
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,980
I think that's what it's called actually

883
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,260
Wait, you mean um, you mean lose yourself lose yourself. That's the one

884
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:44,260
I know that because I was around when I was young and it was big and I was like, oh, okay

885
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,580
I mean stan was um stan was all over the radio

886
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,980
But I mean that's when I was uh

887
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,540
You know like an or a young teen or maybe in my maybe like 12 or 11 or 11 or something

888
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,860
I think uh stan is the one

889
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,180
It's really good stan is that it's like a sad song about um

890
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,540
It's from the point of view

891
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:11,780
Of a fan of a of a of a a fanatical fan of m&m writing him letters

892
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,820
Like saying like I want to meet you. I want to meet you my life is falling apart

893
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:23,700
But like my love for you m&m is like the thing that like gets me through the day and uh

894
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,540
Well, I won't spoil the ending no spoilers for the song

895
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:35,700
Okay, well, maybe I will spoil it then he fucking dies, okay

896
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,420
There you go

897
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:42,100
Bam the end of the song the final verse is m&m finally writing back and in the course of writing the letter

898
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:47,780
He realizes that a news story that he saw about someone driving their car off a bridget committing suicide

899
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:53,380
Was about the guy whose letters he never answered there you go and in the middle it goes uh place

900
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,620
Thank you by dito

901
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,340
And that's what everybody knows d dito from

902
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:04,820
Wow now you understand now I understand my multi-layered references now

903
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,620
I don't need to watch or listen to anything now. You don't need to listen to thank you by dito

904
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,780
You don't need to listen to my stand by m&m. You don't need to watch the angry video game nerd anymore

905
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,140
You don't need to listen to the pro crass nators podcast ever again

906
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,300
You got all the context and none of the content just the way it should be

907
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,860
yes

908
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:29,940
2023 is the year of nothing the year of no content. It's the year of no content, baby

909
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:38,820
I have I have big I have like simultaneously big plans and also

910
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,060
No plans for 2023. I want to

911
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,700
interesting I want to

912
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,140
No, I guess I guess I could say the same about myself in a certain way, but go on

913
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:56,340
I've I've got like Clarissa gunsmok on on the on my mind. I've got the the the the

914
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,740
the murmurings of bell japes sequel

915
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,060
the murmurings

916
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,940
There's things with like the whispers. There's there's stuff with uh pumpkin alley

917
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,460
um

918
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,460
and also

919
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:15,060
Stuff with red man and gun girl that is all sorts of comic and story ideas, but then also

920
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:20,180
I don't want to worry too much. I think a lot of last year. I was worrying

921
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,420
And the year before that as well just worrying worrying about

922
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:28,660
Am I gonna make it? Am I gonna be good? Is everybody gonna like me?

923
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,620
Am I gonna get money from this? Is is is any of this worth it?

924
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:35,380
Am I gonna do anything? Is everything gonna go be okay? Like I need to shut up

925
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:40,100
Just draw some some stuff and not like think too big

926
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,820
about the repercussions or the potential

927
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,140
failures or

928
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,220
Whether or not I do anything with my life from all of these stuffs

929
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,220
Hmm. I just need to just I just need to chill out

930
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:00,740
I need to chill out that's my my vibe. I guess I'm gonna go for that

931
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,940
My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why

932
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,060
Got out of bed at all

933
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,220
Money and brains outside. It's a good song. It's a good song. What were you saying?

934
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,540
Um, I was saying I'm gonna kill you again saint. No, I hear I hear

935
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:22,980
Um, um worrying is bad. Yeah, so I sure hope I don't worry

936
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,380
Good one good one, um

937
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,180
My plans are big because I have as I you know, I

938
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:37,140
I don't know. I do have plans for things finish the book stream

939
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,780
Finish finish man finish the book stream battle network

940
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,900
Make some more lecture videos including a battle network one, but also it probably

941
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,540
I would think

942
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:53,140
I think it would be great if I could make at least three more lecture videos this year

943
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,140
I hope that's not like too ambitious

944
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,180
Feel like I should I feel like I should aim higher than that

945
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,140
uh

946
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,780
Even though I might aim high and fail that's the that's the way to do it

947
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:11,300
I mean if they were all you know, if they're all as long as the mega man video that would be impossible, but

948
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:18,660
They don't all have to be that long. So maybe it might be doable. Um, we'll see but um

949
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:24,340
So there's that and the streaming and there's the book and then

950
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,860
I don't know. I feel like that doesn't account for a whole year

951
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,860
And I keep feeling like I need to do something

952
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,100
I need to change what i'm doing. I need to change

953
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:40,660
Uh my life around I need to find something new to do with myself

954
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,100
In addition to not that I don't want to abandon any of these old things

955
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,300
But I feel like um, I need I need

956
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,300
Need to find need to find some new shit need to find some new shit to do

957
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,660
Some new shit to work towards and I don't know and I don't know what that

958
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,300
Would be or look like so

959
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,260
My plan my plan is find something to do

960
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,380
I mean you could always

961
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:10,820
Like a a simple-ish one is just to find like a some sort of a craft hobby to get into

962
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:15,140
I have a craft hobby. I make candy. You make candy. Yeah. Yeah, I have a craft

963
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,660
I have a crafty hobby like that

964
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,100
I mean I can get more into that get new molds try and make get fancy with it

965
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,100
Find new experiment with new recipes. That is something that I plan on doing

966
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,420
um

967
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,420
It's not exactly it's not exactly a goal

968
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,820
maybe um

969
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,980
Maybe try and get like uh, I don't know

970
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,100
Maybe try and get that shit like sold somewhere

971
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:41,860
Maybe maybe get like shit packaged and try and like try and make it a somewhat commercial venture

972
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,500
I don't know, you know, I think I did I mentioned that I think I might like kickstart those might do like at some

973
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,860
Point after the book is done. Just do a separate kickstarter, you know

974
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,620
Maybe just for like a couple thousand dollars or whatever and not a not a big production

975
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,380
But like let people buy like bags of candy

976
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:02,500
That I made. Yeah, I think kickstarter is the only way I know how to do anything

977
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,780
I mean the difficulty I guess is just

978
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,740
Selling food across

979
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:14,180
Like borders is very difficult. I I don't is it though?

980
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:21,140
Well, I'm just assuming I don't know like the laws or the regulations, but I'm sure

981
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,300
I actually think it is because it's not

982
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:28,340
Liquid and like shipping liquids can be kind of hard. Yeah, but like this this is this is this is, you know

983
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:34,260
Solid food and it's just you know, I mean shipping any package internationally is quite annoying and expensive

984
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,020
Unless you're amazon

985
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,140
I guess I'm thinking of like if it was like a branded product

986
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:44,340
And then getting the license to then sell that product in another country is a whole big thing

987
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:49,060
But simply sending a package to a human being directly is is simple

988
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:55,540
It's so so Kickstarter if you're doing it. Yeah, it's expensive and like labor intensive for you

989
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,620
Yeah, but yeah, I guess it would be the same as any other thing

990
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,020
for Kickstarter

991
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,020
That's that's something that

992
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,620
That's not like

993
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:11,300
Oh, that's what I want to do this year, but it is something that I keep thinking about like hey, wouldn't it be kind of funny if I did that?

994
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,380
Hey, wouldn't that be fun? Maybe

995
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,940
something that I want

996
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,940
thinking about trying

997
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,580
Could be could be a

998
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,220
See what happened though. I would want to get it like

999
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,500
If I did that I wouldn't just like send people shit and like ziploc bags. I would have like

1000
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,060
I would have some level of like pseudo professional like oh, yeah

1001
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:39,860
That would be an investment if you get like a little packaging machine that can like do the the ridged like press at the top

1002
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,260
Whatever that is

1003
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1004
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:47,460
Little little plastic baggy. I would you know, I wonder

1005
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,580
I bet something that could do something like that is not even that

1006
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,340
I mean like a big industrial one would probably be really expensive, but like just one

1007
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:01,300
Like maybe an indie one up up to like a hundred bucks for something like that. Maybe

1008
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,180
That's

1009
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,540
peanuts

1010
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,820
nothing peanuts

1011
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,020
You could even you could sell peanuts you could sell peanuts shaped gummies

1012
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,820
I have worm I have worms now. Oh, I got new I got more worms because I already had worm molds

1013
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,780
But I wanted to be able to make more at a time

1014
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:26,740
So I asked my mom just get me some more of the same worm molds so I can make more worms so I can increase my product my rate of production

1015
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,780
Uh, and she did and now I have

1016
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,260
More worms

1017
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,260
So watch it watch out

1018
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,660
Waiting for the worms

1019
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:42,260
That's my that's a pink floyd song. That's my reference. That's my musical reference. I know I know

1020
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:46,260
I know that because I watched

1021
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:54,660
A video about uh, I think I learned it from a dan dan olson's video

1022
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,860
About about uh, the angry not the

1023
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,860
Doug Walker. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sorry

1024
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:07,140
Fuck that's the cursed cursed cursed directly like cursed

1025
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,860
Lineage of knowledge. It is

1026
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,780
It's fucked up that that's I only know things. I only know things

1027
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,060
Not because I I only know things from

1028
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:23,300
Angry video game narrative Doug Walker not because they talked about them because other people talked about them talking about them

1029
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,300
And how they talked about them wrong

1030
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,900
This is how I learned

1031
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,500
So so much

1032
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:34,340
So much I'm looking at the slime and punishment cover. I think I'm like mostly happy with how the cover turned out. I don't know

1033
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,060
I don't know if I haven't seen that yet

1034
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,700
Um, I uh, this is not a final

1035
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:43,140
This is not a final design, but you know, I showed it before

1036
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,260
And it was kind of it had like nightstar. I was gonna put like nightstar looking down

1037
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,060
in the background

1038
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,340
From the sky

1039
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,260
I changed I think I'm taking her out. I think I think maybe I want to do something a little more like

1040
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,900
this

1041
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:05,060
Is it sending it is sending. Oh, yes, I do remember something with the the phantom core in there

1042
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:10,020
Yeah, well, I I was just gonna draw buildings, but then I was like, what if I just

1043
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,180
I think maybe it's a little more honest to put a bunch of like photo bash buildings like this in because like that's how it is

1044
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,180
in the book like most of the backgrounds are

1045
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,300
Edited photos and stuff. So this is like

1046
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,780
Maybe more representative of the contents. I guess uh, in a way

1047
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,020
Where's strawberry milk? He's been he's been fuck strawberry milk

1048
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:36,740
He doesn't get a fucking slot on the cover. But if this is the moment this is the moment when you get pushed to the portal I

1049
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,260
Don't give a fuck

1050
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,460
This is strawberry erasure. Yeah

1051
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,460
It is

1052
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:50,020
What are you gonna do about it? So I'm gonna I'm gonna have too much capital

1053
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:54,340
I'm gonna I'm gonna write a petition and then your capital will be all mine

1054
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,020
Shit

1055
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,780
if this

1056
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,620
Making a petition

1057
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:06,100
If it gets 10,000 signatures, I think ben sainte should give me all his money and I

1058
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,780
Oh, no, I hope it doesn't get 10,000 signatures. Oh, no

1059
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
That would I'd lose all my money

1060
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,460
Ah

1061
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,660
Elon musk making a poll. Hmm should ben sainte give give and take all his money

1062
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,700
Oh, no, they voted yes. Oh, no, I gotta do it. Oh, no, then I gotta do it

1063
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,700
Ben sainte says I will abide by the results of this poll

1064
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:37,460
I will abide by I will abide by the results of any poll and any uh a petition

1065
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:42,420
That is put in front of me. I will buy by any rules that they stipulate no matter what

1066
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,980
That's the ben sainte guarantee

1067
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:48,180
True

1068
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:52,020
Trying to think anything else happens

1069
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,900
Uh

1070
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,900
The answer is no. No, I guess not

1071
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:01,780
My internet's bad. My internet sucks and that makes me angry

1072
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:07,940
Do you want to go all my roommates are like we gotta fix our internet

1073
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,860
We gotta order some new internet and I say, yeah, we do gotta order some new internet

1074
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:16,260
I agree. I'm glad we're all on the same page and then nobody orders any more internet

1075
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
Nobody orders any new internet

1076
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,900
And I'm certainly not gonna do it

1077
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,820
Don't be ridiculous. Oh, okay. Where are you saying? Where are you?

1078
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,860
Uh, I was just asking if you wanted to go to the one piece

1079
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,740
We could yeah, you could talk about the new two two chapters

1080
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:41,300
Two new chapters 10 70 and 10 71

1081
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,860
So, oh, it's that one piece corner everybody block your ears

1082
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:53,700
Unless you want to know years for the next two hours of the pod. Yeah, just just everybody nobody should listen to this part

1083
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,700
Not even if you like one piece ab so loosely

1084
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,980
Oh, no, um

1085
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,180
That's really weird. I complained about my internet a second ago

1086
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:08,180
Even though it was working fine and now it's uh now it's broken again

1087
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:13,620
Now it doesn't work anymore. Well, it won't it won't load. It won't load 10 70

1088
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,180
Even though

1089
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,660
You know, usually most days

1090
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,660
Oh, no, it went

1091
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:26,580
Like I said, most days my internet at like 3 30 p.m. We'll we'll cut out for a while

1092
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,860
All right, here we go 10 10 70. All right

1093
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,660
um

1094
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:40,820
All right, so uh the strongest humans there's this uh bunch of scientists on the cover. Let me try and uh identify these these people

1095
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:45,700
Oh, I think there's no we don't know who they are aside from vega punk

1096
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:51,860
No, these are definitely um, these are definitely um, I think that's gecko moria

1097
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,740
Caesar clown and uh germa

1098
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:00,740
Uh, which one's gecko moria? I think that's him on the left

1099
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,540
Dang, you know

1100
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,300
I mean, he looks he looks a lot different, but I think that's supposed to be him

1101
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,380
Why does Caesar does Caesar clown have horns?

1102
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,940
Yeah

1103
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,220
Okay

1104
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,900
Man, I just I just like like didn't think about this

1105
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:26,420
But yeah, I don't I think right. That's that's germa, right? I mean, wait, is that his name or what's what's the germa dad's name?

1106
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
the germa is his

1107
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,220
Kingdom and then it's king judge

1108
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,100
I think that's king judge

1109
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:38,660
And then I have no idea who this woman in the hat is carmen san diego

1110
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,300
looking at it's uh

1111
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:45,380
Some sort of lady. That's that's correct

1112
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,020
um

1113
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,860
Oh, i'm getting a message

1114
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,060
What?

1115
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,220
The guy on the left is queen queen

1116
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,620
Queen queen

1117
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:59,620
You know queen is a scientist

1118
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:05,300
This is before that's the big fat guy, right big fat guy and kaito's crew

1119
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,500
Hmm

1120
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,780
That would make more sense because moria is like

1121
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,300
I don't know

1122
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:20,100
What he has a different pass that I think we know some of yeah

1123
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,180
Okay, I mean i'm prepared to be wrong about that. Um

1124
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:29,300
So so okay, I mean i'm i'm looking i'm looking at queen and uh, okay

1125
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:33,620
The only real resemblance I see is the eyes kind of

1126
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,180
Sort of a mouth a little

1127
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:47,540
Maybe it's the pants that you're supposed to think oh, he's got striped pants just like queen

1128
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,260
Um

1129
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:56,260
I think when it comes when it comes to like because I think we know that queen knows like scientist people

1130
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,860
And he's like the the scientist guy

1131
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:04,820
The scientist engineer of the kaito crew. He's the diseases guy, right?

1132
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:11,220
Yeah, he made the disease thing that nearly got everybody and so this is mads which was

1133
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,420
The thing from the last that there was a ship

1134
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:18,420
That we saw on the previous chapters like cover page

1135
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:23,460
With that one guy who I don't know who it is and then this these guys are in mads, I guess

1136
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,100
I think I think so

1137
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,420
I'm sorry. I'm I'm comparing him to queen and I just don't really see it

1138
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:35,300
The the resemblance is uh is is passing at best

1139
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,660
Uh like um

1140
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,660
Oh, I didn't even read the thing culvert of urge

1141
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:46,260
Promising scientists gathering for the sake of of the world and all mankind. But why do they have guns?

1142
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:52,500
What's up, huh? Wait, wait, who sent you a message who sent you a message that said it was queen?

1143
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,620
Uh secret secret message

1144
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,900
Okay

1145
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,740
Don't worry about it. Uh, I won't I won't then

1146
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,460
Um

1147
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,860
Yeah, it's like the scientists around them like surrounding them

1148
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:15,380
Yeah, and they don't have guns and these guys have guns. Are they like attacking?

1149
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,460
the

1150
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,460
Looks like they're

1151
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,260
Defending

1152
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,580
I guess we'll know the next time

1153
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,660
The promising scientists that have gathered for the benefit of the world and mankind

1154
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,740
Uh

1155
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:35,380
Well, I mean we can look at the next chapter in the next chapter. There's

1156
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,380
Wait a minute. There's no, uh

1157
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:48,180
There's no intro page in the next chapter. No, it's uh, it's like an early copy. What it's secret illegal early copy. Fuck

1158
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,340
I see

1159
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,780
I see

1160
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:56,100
Um, all right. Anyway, uh, so last chapter

1161
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:04,500
Uh luchi and luffy were fighting and uh sentomaro got sliced not dead not yet

1162
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,340
And uh

1163
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:14,180
Basically luffy's to be in fighting. He's he's being fine. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

1164
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,980
And we get to see the antics thing

1165
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,020
We get to see the seraphim like doing some stuff

1166
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,620
And then jimbey the jimbey seraphim uses

1167
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,100
The swim fruit

1168
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,300
Yeah, um, Frankie recognizes as being senor pink's fruit

1169
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,980
Which was can you remind me what the swim fruit does?

1170
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:38,900
Does it just let you swim through anything? Unless you swim through matter like you're a swimmer. Yeah, I guess. Yeah

1171
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,820
Um, but he's doing like an awakened version of it, right?

1172
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:51,380
I I'm not sure. I can't remember what senor pink was using it for it. Maybe the exact same like as depicted here

1173
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,380
Um

1174
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,260
He says

1175
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,260
He recreated the same devil fruit

1176
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:03,140
Uh, when it comes to art only only the zoan type can be manufactured

1177
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,500
Okay, this

1178
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,580
Uh, I think I might be reading a bad translation

1179
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:13,780
Translators note the special fruits that vagabunk is referring to here are the mythical zoan types

1180
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:20,100
Uh, he didn't mention mythical zoan per se although the df images shown here are the mythical zoan

1181
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,500
devil fruit included kaito and

1182
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:28,580
Wait, what what mythical devil fruit shown here? I don't oh he see oh he shows the fruits

1183
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:33,540
Oh, I see just like sees his outrageous smile. Yeah, that person should just die already

1184
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,820
Wait, this is this is a different fucking

1185
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,900
This is a different translation

1186
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,860
Then the one you read then the one that I read even though I read it on the same

1187
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,860
It's like they changed it

1188
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:51,140
All right, that's odd. I'm on tebc. Was it yeah tcb scans

1189
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,580
tcb typical cracker behavior

1190
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,460
Yeah

1191
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,460
Uh, yeah, and when I read the original

1192
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:06,820
Time it said uh, he vagabunk said like yes Caesar can make smile, but I consider that unacceptable

1193
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:11,620
Yes, this one in this one. He's saying just like Caesar's outrageous smile

1194
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,620
Hmm

1195
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:19,300
They have a large amount of money in time the special fruits can also be reproduced whether you can awaken them is still

1196
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,780
Unconfirmed. Okay, so he's all right

1197
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:27,620
Yeah, he's saying you can you can reproduce zoan fruits even the mythical ones

1198
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,860
probably

1199
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:35,460
It's difficult where he tried logias. It was difficult trickier than expected, but it doesn't say he failed

1200
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,860
Uh, which is uh ominous

1201
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,980
And then there's an alternative of paramecia types

1202
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:48,740
I found you can synthesize a blood additive from a paramecia user's lineage factor that will grant their power once transfused

1203
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:52,580
That's what you see running through their arms. It's I call it green blood

1204
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,420
He made blood so

1205
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,300
you what

1206
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,940
It's kind of it's kind of strange that frankie is so

1207
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,060
Freaked out by the thought of making blood

1208
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:08,260
Like this is like a big taboo or something

1209
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:13,380
I think it's it's just sort of like the the playing god like you're making humans

1210
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:17,780
Like there's there's so much more to this than just it's a robot

1211
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,140
It's like it's got blood. It is

1212
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,860
It can use devil fruits

1213
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:27,700
Yeah, it's uh, it has a personality kind of even though it can be controlled. It's like

1214
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,460
weird

1215
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:34,820
And not like the same as building a robot. I'm um, I'm looking and like

1216
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,780
We get this close-up of I think it's uh, like young bonnie's arm

1217
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,420
With like the green have we

1218
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,060
That's not bonnie. That's that's um

1219
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,540
a boa handcock

1220
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:53,300
The one with the close-up of the arm. Yeah, because you you see a couple panels later. She's doing the mellow mellow

1221
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,220
No, you're right

1222
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,820
But it's a close have we

1223
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:00,100
Has this been a thing? Have we been able to see their green blood like

1224
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:04,020
Before this I don't remember. I haven't looked closely enough

1225
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:08,660
I know I kind of want to kind of want to go back and I just want to go back and look at them and just see like

1226
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,460
I just want to see

1227
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:14,420
Since when since when have they have big like gaps in their

1228
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,780
body that showed like green blood

1229
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,220
Uh load please

1230
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,860
I'm so kind of cool

1231
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:30,340
Yeah, see like freaking green goo in their little in their little arm tubes

1232
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,900
Yes, please

1233
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,220
Uh

1234
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:44,340
Oh, no, they are there. Yeah chapter previous chapter. They've all got on their right arm a little band that

1235
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,540
looked like an arm band, but it is in fact a glass

1236
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,380
Like open area where you can see the blood flowing

1237
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,260
Unlike the the upper arm or the the the I'll just

1238
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,980
Screen yeah, just show me

1239
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:01,860
Uh

1240
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,140
It's kind of I mean, I guess they're all like

1241
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,340
Wearing clothes except for

1242
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,580
Hancock

1243
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,980
I mean, she's wearing clothes, but she has her arm uncovered

1244
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:19,380
There it is

1245
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,540
Uh, let me see

1246
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,620
Huh, yeah genuinely just missed it just

1247
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:34,740
Yeah, I mean doesn't really look like anything so I guess you wouldn't think if if it was the anime if it was in color

1248
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,420
I feel like my eye would have like shot right to it like what the fuck is that green shit

1249
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,460
But uh, this is

1250
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,620
I didn't even didn't even notice there was anything there

1251
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:48,580
They've also mentioned that these are children so they're gonna grow stronger potentially and it's like

1252
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,220
this idea that these

1253
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:53,940
these uh these

1254
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:58,020
This being this new race of artificial person

1255
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:02,420
Is so powerful probably the most powerful beings in the history of the sea

1256
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:03,940
Yeah

1257
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:08,580
Like yeah, come on. Why'd you do that? Why would you do that? Why would you do that?

1258
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,380
um

1259
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,420
I mean

1260
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,420
Because they can control them

1261
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,500
It's gonna be like a big

1262
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:18,900
Like problem

1263
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:23,460
For somebody. Yeah, I think so. I mean imagine how Jinbe must feel about this

1264
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:29,220
Yeah, Jinbe has got his little guy you cloned. Oh you cloned me

1265
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:34,100
There's a little young clone of me running around with green blood and superpowers

1266
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,140
Okay, and any any

1267
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:42,500
Obeys you and will like and he's under orders to kill me at all, you know at any cost. Okay

1268
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:48,900
Fine and and everybody and impaled down. They have access to that devil fruit. They can put them inside

1269
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,820
The seraphim. Yeah, well, well the paramecies anyway

1270
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,940
Yeah, at least those I assume the rest but

1271
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:01,460
I haven't explicitly said that it's sound him saying that like logeas are difficult

1272
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:04,820
It sounds to me like he has not been successful at logeas

1273
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:10,100
So they can recreate zoan fruits and they can transfer paramecia abilities with

1274
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:15,700
Green blood if they have access to their the did you say the lineage factor?

1275
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,140
Yeah, I don't know what that means. I think if they have

1276
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:24,500
Blood of the original user of that devil fruit. So they got like senor pink's blood

1277
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:30,100
Yeah, they can turn that into green blood and give the devil fruit ability to appear a seraphim

1278
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,340
That's what I think is is being said

1279
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,740
so I wonder

1280
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:36,740
Okay, so if a seraphim

1281
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:41,460
So I think a seraphim will automatically have

1282
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:47,300
The fruit ability of the person that they're a clone of right because like Hancock has the um

1283
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:52,340
Well, we don't know that's the reason it could be that they have Hancock's blood as well

1284
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,940
That's true. It could just be they they just gave her the same

1285
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,340
fruit power

1286
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,340
it's interesting though because

1287
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:04,420
Uh, what happened to Hancock didn't wasn't there like a thing

1288
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,220
that happened with her like

1289
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,580
the

1290
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:15,300
The war like garb was garb go go to amazonia or something. No, um, well, maybe but like, um

1291
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:24,660
Hancock the the the warlords was dissolved and then her the amazon lily was like no longer a safe haven for her

1292
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:28,500
Yeah, and and so they were you know marines came

1293
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:32,020
But I forget what happened. I don't remember

1294
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,980
Something happened. I don't I don't remember either

1295
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,380
um

1296
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,380
I mean, maybe we could maybe we could look it up. Uh

1297
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,460
boa

1298
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,460
Hancock

1299
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,700
Oh my god, this article is so fucking long

1300
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:51,300
There's so much every character. There's a billion things

1301
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:53,940
Can you

1302
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,580
Is is there not just like a a history section?

1303
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,620
Okay. Well, this is actually

1304
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,860
harder to uh

1305
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:07,700
This is actually harder to find out like what's going on with her right now than I thought

1306
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,820
uh

1307
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,500
relationships

1308
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,500
my worst enemies

1309
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,140
I feel like

1310
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,660
There should just be like a in this arc this happened, but there isn't

1311
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,260
No, yeah, there's a body

1312
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,820
There's a body measurements section

1313
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,340
Yeah, I saw that Hora Oda responded to a fan saying her height is 191 centimeters

1314
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,100
Wow, how how tall does that maker?

1315
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:41,300
Uh six foot three and a half

1316
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,540
wall

1317
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:48,260
Da da da her three measurements are blah blah blah ha ha jake up breasts epic

1318
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,620
That sounds about that sounds about right. Yes

1319
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,540
Why is that oh history it's a whole tab that's different

1320
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:01,220
Is that yes, it's kind of it's it's kind of funny that Oda will just be like

1321
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,700
He draws he draws these stick figure big boob ladies and then when asked like how big are their tits?

1322
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:13,700
He's like other they're j-cups. They're just so they're up there. They're like triple. They're like double h like

1323
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:17,220
Oh, yeah, they're they're like, um, you know, they're like an eye cup

1324
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:22,740
They're okay. You just pick a random letter from around that point. I mean he gives like specific

1325
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:30,740
Like measurements he does and then it's it's great. He's a man after my own heart. Yeah. Yeah

1326
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,220
okay, so

1327
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:38,100
Why no country after the seven waller systems was abolished Hancock told the subjects not to worry

1328
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:44,740
Uh about the incoming marine fleet the fleet and reminded them the reason the waller position has been offered in the first place

1329
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,820
Was because of how strong they were

1330
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:51,620
Then they had a battle the marine successfully breached the island when the black beard pirates also arrived

1331
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,300
To take Hancock's ability. Yes, I vaguely remember that

1332
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:57,780
Cody pleaded with her

1333
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:00,020
to leave with the marines

1334
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,980
She refused to surrender and petrified most of the marines

1335
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:09,460
And the pirates she was about to attack Kobe when black bid grabbed her and nullified her ability

1336
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,460
She warms. Yes, he was holding her

1337
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:19,060
Hostage and and she and it was like a mexican standoff and it was like if you kill me

1338
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,700
I won't like reverse the petrification on all these

1339
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,740
People or something like that. Yeah condemned his crew mr. Permanent petrification

1340
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,700
She did agree to restore the marines and pirates if they left the island

1341
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,700
But teach refused to trust her

1342
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:36,660
Before teach could kill her Rayleigh arrived and drove the black bid pirates and the marines out of Amazon lily

1343
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,100
So

1344
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,900
Yes, dang. Okay. I do I do remember so she's

1345
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:48,020
She's okay like Rayleigh Rayleigh. I guess got got her. Okay

1346
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:52,820
So weeks later believing the marines would come back to Amazon lily and caught question where she should go

1347
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,220
Before concluding she wanted to marry Luffy

1348
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,260
Well, of course, then she listened uh as

1349
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,460
Shaku yaku. Who's that?

1350
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:05,460
Isn't that the vega punk uh daft punk guy shaka?

1351
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,940
Or is it shaku yaku?

1352
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:09,940
Discuss vega wants to acknowledge

1353
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,500
Wait

1354
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,500
She was there

1355
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:15,940
Who

1356
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:19,620
Who is this it says it says like weeks later believe the marines would come back

1357
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:23,940
Hancock questioned where she should go before conclusion. She wanted to marry Luffy second sentence yaku

1358
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:28,660
She then listened to shaku yaku discuss vega punks technological developments

1359
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,980
Oh shaku yaku is that lady who's with rally?

1360
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,100
Oh shaki. Yeah, I think that wasn't her full name

1361
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:44,500
Oh my god, is she gonna arrive is she gonna appear in this this arc everybody's going to egghead right now

1362
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,220
Yeah, for real

1363
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:50,340
All right, so that's what's going on with her

1364
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:53,780
Uh, who could forget gloriosa

1365
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,540
Me

1366
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:01,700
Former empress of the kuja tribe from one generation before shaku yaku

1367
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:06,340
Two generations before an unknown coup. Sorry. Who's kuja?

1368
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,820
Three generations before but oh, oh, it's the it's the amazon lily tribe

1369
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:14,420
Wait shaku yaku is from the amazon lily

1370
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,460
What

1371
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:21,460
Shaki is a former empress of amazon lily. What the fuck?

1372
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:26,500
I don't remember that part. I just remember her being like it. She's just the lady in the bar

1373
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:31,300
Yeah, that's what that's all I remember about her is that she hung out with rally

1374
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:34,900
Okay, well, there's a

1375
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:38,820
Yeah, there's an even there's like an old grandma who was an even formerer

1376
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,700
Empress of the kuja tribe

1377
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,500
Called gloriosa or elder neon

1378
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:50,580
She's the old lady, right? She's a little little old lady with a snake staff. Yeah. Yeah

1379
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:54,420
Okay, well, that's

1380
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,060
This seems like

1381
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:03,300
It's really fucking crazy. Uh that uh shaki is just an empress and just like oh, okay

1382
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,100
I left I just left

1383
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:08,980
Yeah, I um

1384
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:13,220
Big thing to forget

1385
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:20,020
So the fight continues, uh, we know we now know about greenblood

1386
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:22,820
Greenblood's cool. I like that

1387
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:27,300
Luffy with his like gear. What is it? What does he call this?

1388
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:33,620
The white boy mode, but like what is it? What does he call it? Is it is it gear fifth?

1389
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,260
I guess it's gear fifth

1390
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:41,780
I don't remember. I don't remember if he says anything. He just sort of did it and he he has the big smile

1391
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:43,860
And he's doing the goofy shit

1392
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,820
And he's really like easily bodying

1393
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,900
Uh

1394
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:52,100
Luchy right now. Yeah, it is a wakened zone for him

1395
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,900
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

1396
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,780
And so they they they're all going together

1397
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:01,940
They go on a rocket ship. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What?

1398
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:07,860
Uh, vagapunk. I mean what vagapunk says

1399
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:15,140
Is that it's possible to replicate a mythical zone? I mean somebody else he could give someone he could replicate the hito hito

1400
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,300
model joyboy

1401
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:20,740
If he wanted like somebody else could could could be joyboy

1402
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:27,620
Now that would be fucked that would be like then it would be like the marines are trying to get Luffy's blood so they can do that

1403
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,620
And then yeah, yeah, no Luffy you're bleeding

1404
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,220
Actually, that just occurred to me

1405
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:38,980
But like they would definitely want to do that because the the the government knows that like the joyboy fruit is like the best fucking fruit

1406
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,180
Hmm

1407
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,580
terrifying

1408
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:50,980
Think about it. It'll be a right at the end of one piece. It'll be like, oh, there's Luffy. Oh, no, it's evil Luffy

1409
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,260
I obey maybe blackbeard will get it

1410
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:58,500
It blackbeard will get it and he'll be but it'll be a different color. It'll be black

1411
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,220
Just like how uh

1412
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:08,820
The the kaito's fruit was duplicated for Momo, but it was pink and vagapunk was like, ah, fuck. It's worthless. It's wrong color

1413
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,780
I'll make black joyboy

1414
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,580
That's my that's my prediction

1415
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,900
Calling it now calling it

1416
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,300
It's a little over the top, but sure

1417
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:23,300
I think it's plausible. I think blackbeard already has

1418
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:29,300
A lot of power with his accumulation of multiple devil fruits within one body

1419
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:35,220
What does he have he has the the the yami yami no me and he's got the darkness the gura gura no me

1420
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:41,780
And whitebeards and who knows what else? Well, I mean I've well, yeah, who knows what else? I mean his crewmates have

1421
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:48,180
I've heard people say that they expect him to get three fruits because of his like three-headed

1422
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:49,780
um

1423
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,780
You know flag

1424
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:54,180
That could just be

1425
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,580
I mean why stop it too?

1426
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,580
Why stop it too?

1427
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,580
Maybe after three you die

1428
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:03,380
Maybe that I feel like that's already the case though

1429
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:07,700
Like if you have a devil fruit you eat another one you will die. That's part of the lore for that

1430
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:11,460
Yeah, that I don't know where we learn that but I definitely think that

1431
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:17,700
I think we learn that in any slubby that if you eat a second fruit it just it kills you or you explode or something

1432
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:23,620
Yeah, I think you die if you eat if you are a fruit user and you eat a second fruit

1433
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:31,540
So so still still a mystery how this guy did it with do we even know we like have no idea how he got a second fruit power

1434
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:35,940
We know that he did something they put it under the yeah covered whitebeard in a big cloth

1435
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:38,020
Then he did a magic trick and then he's like ha ha

1436
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:43,540
Good trick. Maybe he needed to suck his dick. Maybe that was the reason you covered it up

1437
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:48,980
Definitely, I don't want people to see this. Come on. Definitely. I want everyone to know that I'm a super powerful

1438
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,780
Fruit user, but I don't want them all to know that I'm gay and I suck dick. So

1439
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,380
I don't I don't want them to know that I'm gonna suck whitebeard's

1440
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:08,500
Legendarily massive dong from that one meme that everybody knows everybody seen even though it's like it's like he's dead

1441
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,580
He's like standing dead

1442
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:13,700
Yeah, well when that happened. So it's like a dead penis

1443
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,740
So it'll be even worse

1444
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:22,420
Blackbeard doesn't mind that's okay. That part's fine

1445
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:29,780
So then everybody gets swooshed right up to the frontier dome

1446
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:34,500
Luffy says uh to sentomaro. Yes, I'll protect vega punk

1447
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:42,900
Sentomaro is like unconscious now and then the seraphim the seraphim are back under the control of cp nine cp zero

1448
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,820
Uh, they're back in the control

1449
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,100
Uh, we

1450
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:52,180
They do wait. No

1451
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,700
Well, cuz sentomaro is like unconscious or dying or dead

1452
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:02,020
And you know, you can't control them from a distance

1453
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:08,660
So now the sentomaro is out cold. Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. I forgot what's happening. Yeah, they have the the funny

1454
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:10,420
controller things

1455
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:12,420
Okay, and I mean I guess uh

1456
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:16,180
What's what's the what's the

1457
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,220
pika pika nomi fruit guy's name?

1458
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:22,900
Uh kizaru kizaru kizaru says um

1459
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:27,780
Send the warships to send the warships on the warships to egghead

1460
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,300
We're gonna we're gonna kill them

1461
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,940
Okay, so there's

1462
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,940
I like how he says

1463
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,740
Oh, the serahak crew has allied with vega punk on paper

1464
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:41,860
That should make for a straightforward escape as we all expected

1465
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:44,180
But boy, they are for a surprise

1466
01:36:44,820 --> 01:36:49,300
Because that this arc is not as short as it may have seemed at first it's gonna continue

1467
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:55,940
You the you the reader might think that that makes uh that that's like well, obviously, you know, they don't

1468
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,580
stand a chance, but

1469
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:02,180
You will find the complications will arise. Okay. Yeah

1470
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:07,380
And it's I did think that I thought like that

1471
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:10,260
They gotta leave because yeah

1472
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,780
No, no, but yeah, they're on their way. They're gonna fuck they're gonna fuck it up

1473
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:18,100
So the marines and also vega punk is like, please can I come on your ship as the only way I can survive?

1474
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:20,980
Yeah, makes it makes sense

1475
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,380
so, okay

1476
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:28,660
Well, actually, I'll I'll I'll save my thoughts generally until we go over the next chapter

1477
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:31,460
chapter 10 70

1478
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,540
Sorry, I got

1479
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,620
Something in my throat

1480
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:38,900
chapter 10 71 a hero is offensive

1481
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:44,900
A hero is offensive a hero is offensive. Yeah. Well, I mean it's contracted with like a hero

1482
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,420
Oh, I see

1483
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:50,020
But it's it's sailing that you like a true hero is someone who's not afraid

1484
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:55,460
To speak his mind to to you know to tell the true the true hero is one who's not afraid of cancel culture

1485
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:59,380
Yes to tell the truth about about the show biz industry like Dave Chappelle

1486
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:02,020
uh, uh, you know

1487
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,820
It's like Dave Chappelle famously said

1488
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:06,580
if it's

1489
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:13,140
Italians it's the mob if it's Japanese it's the yakuza, but if it's the jews, it's a coincidence

1490
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:16,980
That's what they want. That's what showbiz wants you to think but Dave should

1491
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:20,500
Why am I even talking about this? Okay, no one

1492
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:25,300
Nobody nobody cares nobody cares about fucking Dave Chappelle. You've you fucked it Dave

1493
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,380
So

1494
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,380
Someone who we knew was coming

1495
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:33,940
Blast all right. He

1496
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:35,700
crashes into the red line

1497
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,700
crashes into the base of the red line

1498
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,620
And then he's like

1499
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:46,820
Everyone's like, oh my god, it's Bartholomew Kuma. You know that guy who we're all like we know about and he's a he's a slave

1500
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,820
And what's what's going on?

1501
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,660
and he's like

1502
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,660
Like it looks like he's struggling

1503
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:56,740
He's he's definitely breathing heavily and he hit his head very hard

1504
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,380
But like what is going on with him? Is this place?

1505
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:01,620
Are is he like right near marriage?

1506
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:05,380
Well, like if they climbed up that wall would marriage wall be like right there

1507
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:12,340
I think so. I think this is one of the places where like the people arrived to go to reverie

1508
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:13,780
Yeah

1509
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:14,740
So

1510
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:22,260
Yeah, that's right. So he smashed into the wall and he looks up at the red line the world government thing

1511
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:30,420
And I'm like, I thought he was going to egghead, but if he's going to marriage wire, what is he gonna do?

1512
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:35,860
Is he go is he returning home due to orders?

1513
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,820
Yeah

1514
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:42,820
I guess I guess so or

1515
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:45,540
I just I mean I just don't know

1516
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:53,060
My first thought was like, oh, he's going to to see his daughter because of some sort of thing

1517
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:58,420
Um, and I feel like he could have gone over the red line if he wanted to

1518
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:03,540
But he hit the red line. Maybe he's like struggling against his robotic compulsions to go back

1519
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:06,820
Because he wasn't fully like

1520
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,620
Cyborg'd when he left

1521
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:16,660
Yeah, oh right because he was with the uh, the with the in the Kamabaka kingdom

1522
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:21,220
Everyone was trying to rebels with the rebellious revolutionaries. That's right

1523
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:30,900
Like he's he's gotta appear there's it is Bonnie's here. Everybody's here. Um

1524
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:34,500
I notice um, he's looking

1525
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:42,500
Well, this is this is actually back on on um egghead, but like in the last chapter the big cloud around the uh

1526
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:49,220
The dome the punk records had us had a 99 on it and this chapter. It's got a 100 on it

1527
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:51,780
So it's like counting up to something

1528
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:56,740
There's like a big like orbiting like like num numerical display

1529
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,460
I don't know. I'm just

1530
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:02,580
Wonder what the the number means I guess

1531
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,220
I guess, I don't know

1532
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:12,260
How many how many chapters of egghead are we in now not not that many only like like 10

1533
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,940
10 12 maybe yeah 10

1534
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:23,060
It's I mean it feels like not much, but yeah, it's a lot of a lot of drawings a lot of pages sure sure

1535
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:26,340
Um

1536
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,980
Kuma yeah, I have no idea what kuma is doing

1537
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:30,980
We

1538
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:35,860
It's it's so it's so all right. There's so many moving parts in this chapter

1539
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,180
um

1540
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:45,220
Vega punk and all the other punks all the other vega punks. They're all gonna go on the same ship with the straw hats

1541
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,260
and uh

1542
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,260
Oh, uh, then they're like

1543
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:55,220
Uh, we need we might need help from that other person that mysterious other person

1544
01:41:55,940 --> 01:42:00,660
Uh on the island and then vega punks like yes, let's call him say please help

1545
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,980
And we don't know who it is

1546
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:10,660
So there's a there's a there's a mystery person who's gonna appear who is presumably strong. He's gonna help

1547
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:14,580
Won't you be risking them too if we ask for help?

1548
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:17,140
wait wait

1549
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:21,620
Wait, uh, oh I got confused does vega punk and his sentences with quasar

1550
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:28,260
Um in this uh translation apparently maybe they just in the other translations. I've already doesn't do that

1551
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:30,100
I thought he was asking

1552
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:36,500
Someone named quasar for help, but yeah, it's not the case. Okay. I see

1553
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:40,340
Um, so it's just someone we when we have no idea who it is

1554
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:48,020
So yeah, so bonnie is gunning after vega punk. She wants him to turn

1555
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:55,540
Uh her dad kuma back into normal dad. Yeah, and he says he can't but there's a reason

1556
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:58,580
There's a good reason or there's a reason

1557
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:04,260
I'm assuming that it's because this is like part of kuma's plan like kuma wanted this for some reason

1558
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:09,620
I I have to assume that because you know him being part of the revolutionary army

1559
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:11,940
um

1560
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,940
and they're being like

1561
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:16,020
Him being part of a special race

1562
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:19,460
There's a lot of mystery around his intentions

1563
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:23,860
So yeah, his him having some sort of ulterior

1564
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:26,420
Long game plan

1565
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:31,460
It's so weird that like yeah, he's got all these plans and he's got all these like secrets even though he's like

1566
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:34,660
He's almost like not he almost doesn't even exist anymore

1567
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:38,820
He almost like is not even a person and yet he's still like enacting all these

1568
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,540
It's kind of like in death note when uh when light like

1569
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,100
Made itself on kira

1570
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:50,980
And yeah, and then he kept he kept carrying out his own plans even though he didn't know them anymore

1571
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:56,340
Yeah, it's like it could be maybe like oh

1572
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:59,380
Let their guard down. They think

1573
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:03,620
I'm under their control so I can do some something that

1574
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,580
Would be impossible otherwise

1575
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:08,180
Hmm

1576
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:14,980
Yeah, and then I get the death note and I write the names of the the gurus say in the death note perfect genius

1577
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:18,340
Masterful gambit sir

1578
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:22,340
So the frontier dome goes offline

1579
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:24,260
What is the frontier dome?

1580
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:28,980
I believe it's the force field that stops people getting in maybe it's the thing that was counting up to 100

1581
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,700
maybe um

1582
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,700
But it goes offline

1583
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:38,420
And just for just long enough uh for the three

1584
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:45,460
Uh jumpy people from cp zero to jump up there kaku luchi and stussy

1585
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:49,060
And then they're they're up there. They see the straw hat ship

1586
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:53,060
And then we get an epic uh sword slice moment

1587
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:58,500
It's the rematch. Yeah, luchi and luchi had a rematch and now kaku and zoro are gonna have one

1588
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:02,420
Yeah, it's yeah

1589
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:06,820
Ace just is so cool. Um, I love one piece

1590
01:45:08,820 --> 01:45:10,820
Uh

1591
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:12,660
um, um

1592
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,660
Yeah, okay, they're they're leaving

1593
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:17,620
They're leaving with vega punk

1594
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:21,780
Uh, bonnie is attacking him

1595
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:25,940
Yeah, and then uh, we're at uh the

1596
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:29,460
Fuck is it the kid pirates? Are they just called the kid pirates?

1597
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:32,180
I yeah, I think so the kid pirates

1598
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,500
Hey, um

1599
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:41,460
It's is killer is killer. Uh, didn't he eat like a smile and it drove him crazy and now he laughs uncontrollably

1600
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:47,460
I yeah, I didn't seem like he seems fine. He seems totally fine

1601
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:53,940
Maybe maybe he forgot about it. Maybe they found a cure off screen. I I can't remember

1602
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,980
If they did anything like that

1603
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,860
Well, they're at elbaf and that's cool. Yes

1604
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:05,540
They believe they're at elbaf. They probably are probably are that's just like a little aside

1605
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,260
Um kid is at elbaf

1606
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:12,740
And then we don't actually see anything about elbaf except that they have giant fish there

1607
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:15,860
Oh, yeah, it is a big fish. Yeah

1608
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:20,900
Isn't that fish bigger than normal? Hey, you know where things are bigger than normal elbaf

1609
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,940
And also the entire grand line

1610
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:25,540
Or

1611
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,540
Yeah, but like even more

1612
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:32,500
Even bigger things are even more things are even bigger on elba. Well, it's like america

1613
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:37,060
You know everything's bigger in america, but in texas everything's even bigger

1614
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:40,820
So elbaf is like wow the grand line. Yeah

1615
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:43,620
That's what they say

1616
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:45,620
Trust me. I'm an american

1617
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:48,580
Meanwhile in g14 naval base

1618
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:53,700
Which is apparently very close. Is that the place that they like broke out of?

1619
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,420
Who?

1620
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:58,420
Uh, no, I'm thinking of um

1621
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:02,020
There was an anime only like filler arc where they had to

1622
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:07,940
They landed in a in a jail and they had to break out of a marine base. Yeah, this is not bad. This is new world

1623
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,660
This is I think the place where

1624
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:12,900
um

1625
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,900
smoker is based

1626
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:18,740
Like the g14. I like uh skypea was not was before the new world

1627
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:24,740
Yeah, that's great. No, no skypea. Yeah skypea was it was on the grand line, but it was not in the new world

1628
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,260
Okay g14

1629
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,500
That's where smoker have we seen this place before?

1630
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:35,140
Uh, we have not we have seen this place before we haven't like explored it

1631
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:39,700
It's just sort of like we know smoker and tashiki and a bunch of marines from g4

1632
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:42,100
14 I think

1633
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:48,420
Were the troop that met up or were at punk hazard and all that stuff and they're like

1634
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:54,580
Battle hardened marines. They're big burly boys. Um in the new world. Um

1635
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,380
And

1636
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:59,540
Yeah, we got we got garp

1637
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,620
garps here

1638
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,620
Helmepo is crying

1639
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:09,940
Helmepo and there's this black haired lady that he's talking to on the phone and there's this other girl

1640
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:11,940
Who's this other girl this crying one?

1641
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:18,900
Um, she I think there was a few chapters ago. I barely remembered it, but I went back

1642
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:26,100
Um, this is vice admiral or vice. I can't remember something doll. I forget her rank

1643
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,300
and this other character who is like, uh

1644
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:36,740
Um the same rank as kobe friends with kobe. I guess we haven't seen her before I don't think doll is the black haired one

1645
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,620
Yeah, and then this other girl, which I don't even know her name

1646
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,260
Yeah, um, but they're like sort of looks familiar

1647
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:45,940
Uh, it's kobe helmepo and her

1648
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:52,020
buddy kobe's been kidnapped by black by black bear. So his garp is gonna go fight black beard

1649
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:54,580
So, yeah, instead of going

1650
01:48:54,580 --> 01:49:01,300
Instead of going under kizaru's orders with warships to go to egghead, which is close by he's going to go instead

1651
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:03,780
To get kobe back from black beard

1652
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:05,460
um

1653
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:08,020
Who had a confrontation as we spoke earlier

1654
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:11,380
with bower hancock and rayley

1655
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:13,460
and

1656
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:15,460
kobe was there as well

1657
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:19,460
and yes, and he yeah, he was yeah, he was the one that was like

1658
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:28,980
Yeah, he yeah go with the marines. Uh, so that you don't die from black beard. Hmm. Yes. And she said no

1659
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:32,180
So there's there's all this sort of stuff happening

1660
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:36,340
And um, uh, it's a lot

1661
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:38,340
But

1662
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:43,060
There's a bunch of warships and kizaru on their way to egghead. I can comprehend this easily

1663
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:48,340
There's kuma coming garp is nearby, but not going there black beard is

1664
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:51,460
Going it's somewhere black beard is going

1665
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:53,700
Okay, black beard

1666
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:59,300
Failed to capture bower hancock. Yeah, and other than that. I don't think we know what he's doing

1667
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:06,020
Um, well a few chapters before that I think or not before that

1668
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:08,020
But a few chapters ago

1669
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:10,260
He fought law didn't he?

1670
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:12,820
He fought and he turned

1671
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:17,860
Yeah, do you remember he fought the law and the law one thought I don't even know what happened

1672
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:22,020
Uh, black beard and his crew

1673
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,980
Came up to fight law to steal their

1674
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:27,860
rubbings of the the poneglyphs

1675
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:34,260
And the the doc q turned them all into women he did the gender

1676
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,500
Oh, that's right

1677
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:40,500
He did just very funny. He's I'm sorry. Was that a virus?

1678
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:45,060
Did he does he have the does he have the freaking uh fruit that does that?

1679
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:49,940
He has a fruit that does some sort of virus thing. Yes

1680
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:56,980
And he just made a new virus and the virus was a turn you into switch your gender virus switch your gender virus

1681
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:00,260
And everyone was like it's supposed to fluster them. Ha ha

1682
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:05,780
Yeah, so it's like so it's like uh, it's like uh Naruto's sexy nojutsu

1683
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:11,460
But instead of flustering the opponent by turning into a sexy lady and making them aroused

1684
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:14,980
You fluster them by turning them into lady and making them confused

1685
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:22,900
True interesting. Okay. Yeah, I do remember that now that you mentioned, you know, and

1686
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:25,940
I know it would really have sucked

1687
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,820
Uh, if if black beard got

1688
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:33,860
Boa Hancock's fruit like he planned because then he would have the love fruit

1689
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:38,180
And people would fall in love with him in a in a really weird like

1690
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:41,460
I feel like him doing the pose

1691
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:44,500
Yeah, and everyone going like heart eyes would be very strange

1692
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:48,740
It's yeah, it's weird that he wanted that fruit. It's just

1693
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,700
It's not I guess it's super powerful

1694
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,900
I mean

1695
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,900
It it it it's

1696
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:02,980
Okay, hang on. Does it just make people fall in love with you or does it turn them to stone or does it do both?

1697
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:08,820
It turns them to stone literally. Um, and I think it's praise on your

1698
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:11,380
your uh

1699
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:12,900
affection

1700
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:18,420
Like it doesn't work on Luffy because Luffy is like asexual. He just doesn't know what sex is so it wouldn't work on anyone

1701
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:22,500
Because everybody hates black beard and ugly so it just wouldn't do anything

1702
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:29,940
That's the odd thing. Yeah, maybe I don't know idea. Hmm. Maybe you just wanted to hope that people would love him

1703
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:38,500
I do you think maybe it was just hubris like he just thought like oh a fruit that's really powerful the more people love you

1704
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:42,580
Oh, well, everyone loves me. Do you think it's just like he just thinks he's fucking awesome

1705
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:45,540
And so he thought the fruit would be really good for him. Hmm

1706
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,900
Interesting interesting

1707
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:51,860
So, yeah, so this garp

1708
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:57,860
It's I think it's just a lot. Are there any girls on the black beards team? Does he have a girl?

1709
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:01,780
There's there's that one lady the this is like an old lady, right?

1710
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:06,740
An older lady from impel down, right pirate. I think like

1711
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,580
Yeah, I remember an L

1712
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:17,060
I don't remember like what she does or anything. She's like a big nose, right? Yeah. Yeah, okay

1713
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:19,860
like they're pirates

1714
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,940
crew members

1715
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,540
fucking

1716
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:25,540
Katarina Devon that's her

1717
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:29,540
Oh, of course who could forget Katarina Devon

1718
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:33,620
She has not done anything yet

1719
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,500
that I remember

1720
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:39,700
Extremely tall pale skinned well endowed woman law

1721
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:43,700
Of course, okay. You got it. We've got it. Yeah, but how well endowed is she?

1722
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:50,820
Uh, well well, well, well, what do we got here? Who's a sexier old lady? Is it uh,

1723
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:53,780
Katarina Devon or is it um, uh

1724
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:57,860
Chopper's old mentor whose name is escaping me at the moment

1725
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:01,700
Um old lady with the from drum island

1726
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:04,260
Drum island. Yes. She's hotter

1727
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:10,100
Just because she's got she's got that that swag. That's that's cool. She's got the the black leather

1728
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:12,980
Well, she's the boots. Well, she's the glasses

1729
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,180
Yeah, what's her? What's her name?

1730
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:26,660
I can't it's not it's not kooja. That's the first thing kureha kureha kureha

1731
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:32,340
Yeah, I would say kureha is harder if it's just my it's just my opinion because kureha has a slender build

1732
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:37,460
Whereas this Katarina has kind of like a barrel-chested like muscular build and you know, it's just my personal preference

1733
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:40,580
It's my personal preference that uh, uh, uh kureha

1734
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:42,020
sexy

1735
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:46,180
Yeah, kureha gilf everybody. I would say so. I would say so

1736
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:54,820
It's I think i'm just yeah, uh, the fact that they just have a page of the kid pirates

1737
01:54:56,500 --> 01:55:04,180
Arriving at elba and then another page or double page of garp going on an expedition during all of this egghead stuff. It feels like

1738
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:06,980
they're

1739
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:09,060
it's sort of um

1740
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:11,060
Like

1741
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:13,060
It feels like they're building to

1742
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:17,140
Ahead and they're having all of these things happen

1743
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:23,860
Simultaneously, so they'll like culminate but like what the hell could culminate. Why are we learning about all of this stuff?

1744
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,500
in this chapter

1745
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:31,620
Is is something gonna happen in a few chapters where they all converge, you know really like oh my god

1746
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:33,620
So they're all they're all going to different places

1747
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:39,460
That's the thing. That's why it's like a little confusing. It's not confusing. I can comprehend it. It's just sort of like wow

1748
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:43,060
Yeah, what the hell's gonna happen? It's a big mystery. What does

1749
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:47,860
what does kid being on elba and

1750
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:50,820
kizaru being on egghead

1751
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:52,900
and uh

1752
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:55,620
A garp and kuma being at the red line

1753
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:59,540
kuma being at red line and maybe and marriage wa

1754
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:02,580
and uh

1755
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:04,980
Garp being wherever blackbeard is

1756
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:09,780
I mean, maybe blackbeard is going to one of these places as well. So like maybe

1757
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:15,380
I mean, maybe blackbeard and garp and kid will all end up at elba

1758
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:17,140
uh

1759
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:19,060
Just because

1760
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:22,580
So blackbeard could show up at any one of these places at any time

1761
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:27,220
And there's there's always the possibility that

1762
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:30,180
kaito and big mom aren't dead

1763
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:36,660
Because big mom had a whole thing with elba. I always expected her to like appear. Oh, that's true

1764
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:40,420
At the giants because she's got such a connection to the giants

1765
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:42,500
um

1766
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,500
She's not from elba. Is she

1767
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:50,900
I don't think she is maybe she's I forget like if she has like some giant dna

1768
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:54,980
I don't think so. I think her parents are normal sized and she's just a freak. Yeah

1769
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:59,940
And she learned about the giants and there was a giant at her town

1770
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:02,900
They came and they were like friends

1771
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:08,420
But then she had one of her like weirdo moments when she didn't get enough food and she fucking ruined everything

1772
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:13,380
Yeah, yeah, and then the giants were like, um, this kid's too much get the fuck rid of her

1773
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:18,740
I think that was the gist. Oh, was it the lady? Was it the lady who worked at the orphanage? Was she a giant?

1774
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:22,660
No, no, she was small normal size. Hmm

1775
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:27,460
Who was the giant in any event that I think they came to the

1776
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,300
Where her village?

1777
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:34,900
Or maybe she stayed with a giant the giants in a giant village because that was like a good place for her. Yeah

1778
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:41,860
Uh, they I vaguely remember that I got to reread that part. But yeah, um, she's got

1779
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:46,820
Uh an obsession with having a giant in her crew in her family

1780
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:55,700
And she's been like banished from from Elba because she wants one of every race to be in her family. Yeah. Yes

1781
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,300
Yes, understood

1782
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:05,940
So I feel like I feel like big mom is definitely not dead just because that needs some sort of resolution

1783
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:08,660
100 100%

1784
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:10,740
100%

1785
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:13,940
And then I think I guess it could be like kaito and big mom

1786
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:22,100
They skulk away with their the remains of their crew and then they actually do form the new rocks pirates and they come back together

1787
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:25,780
And they could they could clash on Elba

1788
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:32,100
Yeah, there's so many fucking that would make sense for them to show up there. I think oh my god

1789
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:34,100
Damn

1790
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,100
And there's cobing. There's fucking x drake

1791
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:40,020
There's all these marines going around doing marine things drake

1792
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:46,340
Had like a falling out. They was working with basil hawkins, but then they like split up, right?

1793
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:52,100
No, hawkins was working with kaito. He was like full full kuk mode

1794
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:57,940
I'm just gonna be subservient to kaito. Nice. And deus drake was a undercover marine the whole time

1795
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:02,660
Literally me literally me when I think about accruing power and accruing capital

1796
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:08,100
It's time to go kuk mode. It's time to go kuk mode and be conservative because it will it would be a subservient

1797
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:11,780
Because it will uh because it will it will generate capital for me

1798
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:18,020
Who generate capital it will advance my position unless the straw hat pirates come and destroy everything

1799
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:20,260
Right that would be bad

1800
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:26,020
He'll be really bad to spend time working for kaito only for the straw hats to come and kill my boss

1801
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:37,220
I like it. I like one piece. What can I say? I would say uh

1802
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:44,260
Yeah, I've been telling anytime one piece comes up in conversation lately. I say I feel like it's as good as it's ever been

1803
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:47,780
Yeah egg head egghead arc is really cool

1804
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:51,380
And uh the story feels like it's got a lot of momentum right now

1805
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,180
It's pretty exciting

1806
01:59:57,220 --> 02:00:01,780
How does he do it how does he do it how does he do it um

1807
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,060
Nobody

1808
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,140
Nobody knows

1809
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:13,300
You I would be curious. He's a deal. He's got he's got the he's got the manga manga fruit

1810
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:15,940
Oh my god

1811
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:17,940
True. Mm-hmm. It is

1812
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:19,940
it is

1813
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:25,300
Like um, I would be really curious to see a manben episode

1814
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:28,740
Of his holy shit. Can you imagine?

1815
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:32,980
I mean, I yeah, it's it's just like clearly he's

1816
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:39,540
Like a lot he's got a lot of stuff he does but he's definitely got assistance

1817
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:42,340
He's definitely got a studio because there's no way

1818
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:48,260
His arm would fall off his his entire arms would fall off

1819
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:54,180
I think there's definitely like assistance. This is just speculation, but like for for backgrounds and stuff

1820
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:56,500
Yeah, of course

1821
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:59,140
Like and some of this it's just it's great

1822
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:02,180
But how does it how does how does he do it?

1823
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:05,220
Um

1824
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:07,220
Every week basically

1825
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:09,220
Dude a man a manben about

1826
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:12,020
With oda would be a maid. There there was um

1827
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:17,540
Okay, where there's some new manben's that came out or did some new episodes get translated like not that long ago

1828
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:22,980
I think I think they got translated. I haven't seen them because yeah, because a new episode

1829
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,980
You know

1830
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:27,380
It's kind of useless to me unless it's been translated

1831
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:29,460
So I kind of don't really care about new episodes coming out

1832
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:34,980
I care about more episodes getting translated someone read not that long ago told me there were new episodes

1833
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:37,540
And I haven't seen any of them

1834
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:41,300
Join us next time on the pro crass there's podcast one piece corner

1835
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:49,460
I feel like

1836
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:51,540
At some point during that

1837
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:55,060
I've had an idea popped into my head of something else

1838
02:01:55,220 --> 02:02:01,220
Some relevant shit that had happened or I was thinking about that I wanted to bring up and I thought

1839
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:04,420
Not until after the we're in the one piece segment now

1840
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:07,380
Oh

1841
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:08,900
I remember

1842
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:15,300
Uh, I was just wanted to mention that did a little slime rinalia holiday thing for uh for r with rfc k

1843
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:18,420
If you could believe it

1844
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:22,740
Uh, yeah, I actually actually drew some stuff for it if you can even imagine

1845
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:25,300
Ben saint drawing

1846
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:28,660
It's true. I know it's true. I did a little um

1847
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:35,460
It was um one of the mods slash devs. Uh demodunk suggested to me that I

1848
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:38,500
Do a little uh grinch

1849
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:40,820
steel slime rinalia

1850
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:42,340
villain

1851
02:02:42,340 --> 02:02:44,100
thing

1852
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,940
So I did

1853
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:51,140
But um, let me to briefly explain it. There was there was recently

1854
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:53,140
a

1855
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:57,380
A hack on the droplet which is some I don't really understand

1856
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:02,980
I think that just means the bot. I think like the drop the droplet is like the code for the bot

1857
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:08,580
It got hacked. There was like a leak. They had to do repair a bunch of stuff. It was kind of a hassle. Um

1858
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:14,260
So I thought uh, hey, what if what if there was an item called the droplet

1859
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:18,180
And it was like an endless rock. I actually think it was demo's idea that would be an endless rock

1860
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:21,300
So we use the power of the droplet to cancel slime rinalia

1861
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:24,420
um, the way that the way that I did it

1862
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:27,380
was um

1863
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:29,380
Well, there was a um the

1864
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:37,380
Demo, I think was suggested a grinch thing, but I went a different way with it. I went um, you know, you know the movie the santa claws

1865
02:03:39,460 --> 02:03:41,460
Uh tim allen

1866
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:46,580
That's the one where santa falls off the roof and tim allen puts on the suit and he becomes the new santa claws

1867
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:51,460
I've seen a like an ad for that in a vhs, but I know what's the film

1868
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:55,460
Yeah, I watched it as a kid, uh, but um

1869
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:58,260
Yeah, so in the lore, uh, okay

1870
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:00,180
first of all

1871
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:07,700
The the the the lore the lore about slime rinalia is pretty you know, there's there's a febus aka slime and victus who is basically

1872
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:11,060
mlachacom santa claws

1873
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:15,620
But instead of giving you gifts he comes into your house and he steals all your shit

1874
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:17,780
but

1875
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:23,460
If you read between the lines even a little bit, it's pretty clear that's that slime and victus is actually just munchy

1876
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:29,140
Sitting on my shoulders with a robe over us going around to juby's houses and robbing them

1877
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:31,940
um, so

1878
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:36,020
So in this in this in this new lore

1879
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:39,620
Oh, uh, turns out there actually was a real febus

1880
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:43,060
Oh, like oh, shit. He was real after all he does exist

1881
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:47,140
And I and I caught him climbing up my roof and I yelled at him and he fell to his death

1882
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:53,620
And I and I and I and I put on his robe and I cut him open and I found the the the endless rock in his kidneys

1883
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:56,900
And now I'm the new and now I'm the new febus

1884
02:04:57,540 --> 02:04:59,540
Even though I already kind of was

1885
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:02,900
And I cancel slime rinalia forever

1886
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:05,940
Wow, and I drew some

1887
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:07,940
Images of me announcing this

1888
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:14,340
Becoming uh, let's see him. All right. I'll all right. I'll post him. All right. I'll freaking post him if you want

1889
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:16,340
Yo

1890
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:19,540
You're you're shrouded. I am shrouded. This is me

1891
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:22,820
As I this is my the beginning of my announcement

1892
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:26,500
I started at shroud and I started telling the story of the christmas miracle

1893
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:31,060
Uh, and then I found uh, I found his business card

1894
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:34,260
Found his business card as I was scavenging him

1895
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:36,980
And then I reveal

1896
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:39,620
The droplet

1897
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:43,780
Wow becomes st. Invictus is what I'm calling myself now

1898
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:49,380
Is that the the the endless rock? That is it. Yes. That is uh, that is the droplet

1899
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,500
Layers within layers

1900
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:57,460
See it's a kid see I found it in his kidneys. It's like a kidney stone

1901
02:05:57,860 --> 02:06:05,140
Because that's like a thing and anytime that I reference a kidney stone. It's funny because it reminds you the listener of the horrifying

1902
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:08,980
Traumatic medical condition that I had that one time

1903
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:14,900
Yeah, and that's funny. I'm so nostalgic for that. Me too. We have to go back

1904
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:20,740
Uh, oh, why did I just switch to a new server? Uh

1905
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:23,860
That's weird. Okay

1906
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:25,860
Anyway, yeah, I drew these

1907
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:28,420
drew these the other day

1908
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:33,780
Then I made a big post in the auditorium, you know ruin the holiday for everyone, you know just for fun

1909
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:38,820
Just for fun. It was my first it was like the first time I'd like uh, really like done any like

1910
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:44,100
Are like rfck any like rfck interactions in a while. It was pretty fun

1911
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,020
It was pretty neat

1912
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:50,900
Had had fun with it. That's it. That's that's my and that was my other my other holiday

1913
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:57,060
Story, how was my holiday? Well, this was part of it. It was part of the celebration

1914
02:06:57,860 --> 02:06:59,860
Thanks for asking

1915
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:01,700
Okay

1916
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:07,380
All right, let's shall we go to questions. I suppose we'll go to questions. I mean to voicemails. Well

1917
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:10,260
Yeah, uh, they are often

1918
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:14,340
Questions, but also not. I feel like I have a feeling we'll probably

1919
02:07:15,860 --> 02:07:17,860
I have a feeling at least one rfck

1920
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:20,580
oid will probably uh

1921
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:23,140
Mention that in the voicemails

1922
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:25,780
um

1923
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:29,860
So where are we? Uh, oh god

1924
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:36,660
This one there's one just I'm looking for the latest one that we listened to

1925
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:40,180
I think it's might be this one called yo slammer nailia

1926
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:42,500
Yeah, so it'd be after that

1927
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:45,380
There's a youtube link, but there's no description. So we skip those

1928
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:48,100
Yeah

1929
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:50,740
Is

1930
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:56,100
Yeah, okay, I think the first one is called automation good

1931
02:07:57,380 --> 02:07:59,140
All right

1932
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:01,140
Yeah, okay, let's do it

1933
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:05,860
From blah blah at hotmail.blah automation good three two one go

1934
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:13,140
So ben on episode 340 of the pro crest nature's podcast

1935
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:20,900
You said something along the lines of I think that work bad and automation good

1936
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:28,740
And while I can recognize some level of uh hyperbole in that statement. No, it did make me think because

1937
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:34,660
Um, isn't that to some degree kind of a uh anti marxist settlement?

1938
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:38,740
You know since from a marxist perspective, I'm pretty sure

1939
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:41,780
capitalist criticism is not only because

1940
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:48,180
uh capitalism exploits workers, but also because it demeans work in the sense of

1941
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:53,460
Making it valuable only in the sense of its end product as opposed to

1942
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:57,060
valuing the process of creation in and of itself

1943
02:08:57,780 --> 02:08:59,780
Uh, you know, I feel like

1944
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:06,340
Automation valuing automation over work at all times. It kind of goes against that sentiment

1945
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:11,220
Um, of course, you know, that doesn't mean you can never use automation, but

1946
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:16,660
Like with a ir you know backgrounds fine, but you know don't overdo it

1947
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:23,380
Yeah, no, I I get I get what he means though. I kind of I kind of don't get what he means

1948
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:26,180
That's kind of the argument I had for like

1949
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:31,140
Not against AI art, but just appreciating that there is

1950
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:37,940
Value to be had in the creation of art for your own sake or like just it's fun to do

1951
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:45,540
And so you don't have to automate stuff. You it's fun to draw. So like draw sure like you you were saying

1952
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:48,420
It's good that you can automate stuff if you don't want to draw

1953
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:51,060
Yeah, so I don't think they're

1954
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:53,780
Like incompatible

1955
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:59,140
Now I'm I'm no I'm no Marx scholar, right? I know I mean in in

1956
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:04,580
In conquest of bread kropotnik is pretty I feel like kropotnik would say

1957
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:10,100
Like yeah automate away as much work as possible. We should we should we should uh

1958
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:13,860
We should automate anything we can because work is bad

1959
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:18,580
We should like organize society to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done

1960
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:20,980
um

1961
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:23,220
this

1962
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:30,260
I I feel like no, I I really feel like Marx would agree with that. I really feel like Marx would say that

1963
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:35,060
The the need

1964
02:10:35,140 --> 02:10:38,580
I feel I feel like what did he what did I think this is prince

1965
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:40,980
Uh, I think he said that like

1966
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:44,260
Is it demeaning labor? Is it demeaning labor?

1967
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:46,340
to

1968
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:49,220
Reduce the need for it. No, I think what's demeaning

1969
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:51,940
Is insisting that labor be done

1970
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:58,180
When it's unnecessary. I feel like that is what demeans labor. I feel like to honor it

1971
02:10:58,820 --> 02:10:59,940
you would

1972
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:01,780
you know

1973
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:04,020
Expect that it'd be useful and like to simply

1974
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:08,500
Expect that labor be done even in a context where we could

1975
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:12,180
Choose not to do it without any loss

1976
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:15,620
That's what what seems demeaning to me and I

1977
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:22,020
Feel like Marx is is pro-automation in that sense and he I think I think he would agree with me

1978
02:11:23,060 --> 02:11:27,940
It sometimes it's fun to like dig a hole and plant a flower by yourself

1979
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:33,540
Um, but it doesn't mean that there should not be automated ways to do it

1980
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:36,100
Right as well. Right

1981
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:38,340
You should have the freedom

1982
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:40,340
To not be required

1983
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:42,820
To or to to to dig the hole

1984
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:47,220
But you can if you want to that's that's kind of what the ar thing

1985
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:50,020
is. Yeah, I mean I

1986
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:52,020
absolutely

1987
02:11:52,020 --> 02:11:57,860
Don't overdo it. No do overdo it. I mean I don't overdo it because because by definition that's like

1988
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:00,580
doing too much of it, but like

1989
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:07,140
Do do as much as you do as much as you can do as much as automate as much as you can get away with without

1990
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:09,940
incurring any consequences

1991
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:12,580
whether that be like legal

1992
02:12:12,580 --> 02:12:14,580
in that you're stealing someone's work or

1993
02:12:15,940 --> 02:12:17,940
uh, you know

1994
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:25,060
Aesthetic and that like, you know the the piece you're making suffers because ai is not equal to the task of producing the thing you wanted to produce

1995
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:27,540
um

1996
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:31,460
Yeah, I don't know man. I I think it's Marxist as hell and I stand by everything I've said

1997
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:34,660
Yeah, automation good work bad. No high no hyperbole

1998
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,540
um

1999
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:42,100
But and if it's a task that you want you simply want to do if you just want to draw a picture

2000
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:45,540
I mean, I would argue that that's not work. That's that's leisure

2001
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:48,180
Which is good leisure is good

2002
02:12:48,820 --> 02:12:50,820
Yeah, uh work work is

2003
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:53,140
effort expended and you know to produce

2004
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:56,340
Value to generate some sort of like economic

2005
02:12:57,220 --> 02:12:59,220
Return I think

2006
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:00,420
um

2007
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:02,420
Next one is called another question

2008

Braps at official.com 3 2 1 go

2009
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:15,380
Also, I have another question a completely unrelated one and I mean this in the kindest most positive

2010
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:17,220
This is gonna offend me deeply isn't it?

2011
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:25,540
I have question for this particular person this particular other person that calls into the pcp

2012
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:32,740
And they always sound like they're speaking from a tin can yeah, that is hotboxed with like

2013
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:40,020
40 400 milligrams of weed that they're also currently I think it's tom. So I think it's that guy tom this person who comes in like

2014
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:42,420
Hey

2015
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:48,980
Yeah, um, and I want to just ask that person

2016
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:51,140
um

2017
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:57,540
Am I correct that you're calling from inside a tin can and am I correct that you're usually

2018
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:00,340
Blasted out of your mind in one way or another

2019
02:14:01,060 --> 02:14:03,060
If not, what's up?

2020
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,980

Yeah, I love you. Yeah, that guy's delivery is weird. I'm not sure if it's like a language thing

2023
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:16,660
He's always always it sounds like he's mumbling

2024
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:22,180
Yeah, I guess I would say that guy like like quit mumbling freaking annunciate and also freaking like know what you're gonna say

2025
02:14:23,620 --> 02:14:26,980
You need to like you need to be jumping up and down when you when you're speaking

You know fair question fair question. We'll probably hear from that guy, you know as we continue

2029
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:40,820
um

2030
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:42,820

I do

2054
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:10,660
I just saw your stream and

2055
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:13,300
I didn't comment or anything. I just cut the tail into it

2056
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:17,140
I've been meaning to ask somebody who does it. How do you uh

2057
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:21,700
Make the little character and get it to bob up and down when you talk

2058
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:27,780
Oh, uh, that's a program. Thank you. Uh, let me get so what a pretty pretty straightforward question

2059
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:32,180
Uh vido tube mini vido vito

2060
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:35,940
V e a d o

2061
02:16:37,460 --> 02:16:40,100
So vido like weirdly saying video

2062
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:43,700
V e a d o tube mini

2063
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:49,540
It's a little free program. You put a png in it and you can like set the parameters for how much

2064
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:53,780
Like what what it you know, it switches to a different png

2065
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:59,620
So I just drew a mouth open when it gets to a certain audio threshold and you can make it shake if you want

2066
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:02,420
Uh, it's very easy to use interesting

2067
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:05,060
interesting

2068
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:07,380
Well good answer

2069
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:13,140
Um, did I download that? Uh, yes I did. Okay next one is an imager

2070
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:15,060
link

2071
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:17,060
Uh, let's see

2072
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:19,860
What we got here

2073
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:22,420
Ew

2074
02:17:22,580 --> 02:17:24,740
You got that's that stretch. Oh, I

2075
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:27,140
my

2076
02:17:27,140 --> 02:17:33,060
I look hideous, uh, this would be ben saint if he could resist the urge to tweet at elon musk wrong

2077
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:36,980
There are many other failures that I would have to overcome

2078
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:42,100
Uh, do you even want to end up looking like this though that face

2079
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:47,140
You know what it is? It's it's because uh

2080
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:50,580
He wanted my chin to match the chad's chin

2081
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:56,980
But then he wanted me to give me a big forehead. So to do that, he had to smush my face down really far

2082
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:04,740
Um, I do want that physique though. That's why I'm lifting again. That's why I'm lifting

2083
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:09,860
Um, that'd be pretty cool pretty cool. Next one is uh

2084
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:17,460
Do do do do do it are fast ck from prince isolation three two one go

2085
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:25,540
RFC k endless war is a free to play mmo rpg playable entirely inside a discord server

2086
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:29,220
That's what I've heard in it. You collect slime in order to kill people

2087
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:32,740
You can revive from the dead and make funny slime oids

2088
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:38,100
To say you beat in the game you would have to do all these things as quickly as possible

2089
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:40,820
Ending with a total of 20 mega slime

2090
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:46,340
For years players have attempted to push the game to its limits and finish faster and faster

2091
02:18:46,580 --> 02:18:49,460
So they never have to play that shit-ass game again

2092
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:52,820
Until in january of 2023

2093
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:55,460
One gamer beat them all

2094
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:57,780
Here is that run

2095
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:04,820
And then you play the fucking funny summoning itself. I was gonna say you should be playing and then we should be really funny

2096
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:07,380
Should be playing that song

2097
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:11,300
I knew the name of that song very funny at one point

2098
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:18,900
You should probably google like summoning salt music and find a playlist. It's um, I mean, it's just one

2099
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:21,220
it's just one of the songs that um

2100
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:27,860
I think youtube just recommends it. It's like in the youtube playlist. Did I um, did I uh

2101
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:33,140

Oh, I think it's this one

2115
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:20,740
Songs for different sad vibes

2116
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:27,620
Bart I see i'm a simple man. I see bart simpson. I laugh here it is

uh, it's called

2118
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:33,460
You will you will immediately recognize this song from youtube

2119
02:20:34,020 --> 02:20:36,020
Ellie is our play put it in

2120
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:45,220
Oh, yeah, yeah

2121
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:51,220
Yep

2122
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:56,340
I mean, I know it's in a bunch of action button reviews. I'm sure it's in other videos

2123
02:20:56,820 --> 02:21:00,820
I've definitely heard it in other videos. I've heard it in an anime or two. I think

2124
02:21:01,620 --> 02:21:02,660
Really?

2125
02:21:02,660 --> 02:21:06,340
It's the sort of thing that would play and it's like, uh, beautiful scenery

2126
02:21:07,300 --> 02:21:10,420
I'm pretty sure I've seen at least one show have that as like a

2127
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:16,900
Like an actual thing. Hmm. I I associated specifically with youtube

2128
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:20,260
I mean, it isn't like it's a very old song

2129
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:22,980
So there's probably lots of things that it's in

2130
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:26,980
I guess I guess you know what I guess you're right, but um

2131
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:30,020
Yeah, maybe andre wasn't even the first one

2132
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:36,260
But yeah, my the the ending of my dinner with andre plays over, uh, this this song as well

2133
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:38,820
Lamal

2134
02:21:38,980 --> 02:21:40,980
Uh, why did I?

2135
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:45,060
Uh

2136
02:21:45,060 --> 02:21:51,940
What's hang on? What's the summoning salt song home home? We're finally landing. Yeah, that's the one. Yep

2137
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:53,940
Uh

2138
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:56,580
Next one is called crunchy crypto crap

2139
02:21:57,380 --> 02:21:59,380
three two one go

2140
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:04,500
You ever notice how the fdx guy kind of resembles munchie?

2141
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:07,220
Is that like upsetting at all?

2142
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:09,540
the I mean

2143
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:14,580
There's uh, sam bankman freed the guy who was uh

2144
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:17,940
Basically the

2145
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:23,780
I guess he's he sort of bears a passing resemblance to munchie. I kind of see it but like not like

2146
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:29,620
To a degree that I find uh, unusual. No, it looks more like some other guy

2147
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:36,900
Yeah, um, it's uh, he uh, sam bank. fdx was the big crypto exchange that like was

2148
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:42,740
I think a couple like a month or two ago like went completely belly up because it turned out the whole thing was in

2149
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:45,540
Solvent it was all just like fraud upon fraud upon fraud

2150
02:22:46,340 --> 02:22:50,260
Uh, and it was like like billions and billions of dollars were just like

2151
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:57,060
Embezzled and like disappeared uh, and this this this sam bankman freed guy was like the CEO of it

2152
02:22:57,380 --> 02:22:58,580
And he was like

2153
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:03,380
He's like a 20-something guy and like he would show up to like meetings and he would go on like talk shows

2154
02:23:03,380 --> 02:23:05,860
And he would be like and he would do it all in like his pajamas

2155
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:08,340
And he would do it like all while playing league of legends and stuff

2156
02:23:08,740 --> 02:23:11,380
And the guy was like a complete hack and he had no idea what he was doing

2157
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:13,220
But he just sold it

2158
02:23:13,220 --> 02:23:18,420
They just sold him on this mystique of like, oh he's some he's some mad genius like young prodigy or whatever

2159
02:23:18,820 --> 02:23:24,820
And his hair is unkempt. We must he's probably like smart his hair. His hair is unkempt

2160
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:31,460
He's looks he smells like cheetos like he must he's must know something like what does he know?

Yeah, exactly

2163
02:23:34,900 --> 02:23:36,900
And it worked uh for a while

2164
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:38,900
um

2165
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:40,500

02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:10,020
All right. Here's the kicker. All right. I'm gonna turn it on

2241
02:28:11,460 --> 02:28:14,980
All right, okay, and it says low battery, but I know that it's lying the scales a piece of shit

2242
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:18,900
It tells me it's battery is low all the time and then I just turn it on again and it works fine

2243
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:21,860
all right, so

2244
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:24,180
I'm gonna take some cheese

2245
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:27,460
0.7 ounces

2246
02:28:27,700 --> 02:28:28,900
Whoa

2247
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:30,340
0.7

2248
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:32,340
points that I know and then I'm gonna take some pepperoni

2249
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:35,620
It's 1.2

2250
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,780
Pathetic and then I'm gonna eat it

2251
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:43,060
And now I know exactly how much I just ate and I can put it in my calorie counting app

2252
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:45,940
Wasn't that crazy?

2253
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:54,420
So you weigh every bit of every morsel of food. Well, what when it's when it's something that

2254
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:57,860
It has like variance to it

2255
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:01,140
When it's something that like if I'm eating like

2256
02:29:02,820 --> 02:29:03,940
Serial

2257
02:29:03,940 --> 02:29:06,820
Like I measure out a cup of it and then I don't have to weigh it

2258
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:10,900
But if it's like meat or cheese, yeah, you know weigh it you know weigh it and find out how much it is

2259
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:13,860
I guess so

2260
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:16,900
How else would you know how else would you know?

2261
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:23,220
I don't I don't think about it so strictly. I just that's right. You don't think about it. That's right

2262
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:26,420
I put in like a vague like approximation

2263
02:29:28,180 --> 02:29:30,180
Fringe

2264
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:33,300
I'm doing science here

2265
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:36,420
I'm doing science here. Yeah, I'm gonna do it again

2266
02:29:37,060 --> 02:29:44,980
One point. Yep 1.5. Okay. So each slice of this cheese is 0.7 ounces and each piece of this pepperoni

2267
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:48,260
Well, how can you be sure every single slice of cheese is exactly the same?

2268
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:50,660
Well, because I just weighed the second one

2269
02:29:51,060 --> 02:29:54,260
And it was also 0.7. You gotta weigh every single one

2270
02:29:56,900 --> 02:29:58,900
That was my last one

2271
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:01,700
Don't they get like

2272
02:30:02,820 --> 02:30:04,820
Are you getting food all over the thing?

2273
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:11,620
I put a paper plate on it. Oh, okay, then. I'm a genius. All right. Wasn't that crazy?

2274
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:17,380
Uh, no, wasn't that epic? It may be epic. Thank you. Okay

2275
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:23,700
These are my leftovers my leftovers from the new year's party

2276
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:30,900
Okay

2277
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:34,020
Now we're ready to listen to homogenous chapter one

2278
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:37,060
Uh, three two one go

2279
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:44,900
This episode of the pcp has been and give

2280
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:50,740
The episode before has been and give

2281
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:56,580
The next episode will also have been and give

2282
02:30:58,100 --> 02:31:01,140
Every gibb-a-sode is a benesode

2283
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:08,020
Every benesode is a gibb-a-sode. Mm-hmm. It's all very

2284
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:12,020
Homogenous

2285
02:31:12,180 --> 02:31:14,180
Um

2286
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:35,140
Yep, that's the pcp guarantee every episode every is a benesode and every benesode is a gibb-a-sode

2287
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:37,860
Yes, that's a good

2288
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:39,860
tag

2289
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:41,300
I

2290
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:43,060
perfectly normal

2291
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:45,460
perfectly normal for a podcast to have the same

2292
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:49,060
Cast everything that's why they call it a podcast

2293
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:51,540
Because the cast

2294
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:56,820
I like peas in a pod. I like peas in a pod. There you go. Perfect. Thank you. You finished my thought for me

2295
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:00,100
We finished each other's sandwiches. Okay

2296
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:04,740
Uh, you didn't even let me finish that sandwich. I didn't trust you to do it

2297
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:10,260
I knew you would fucking up. Okay, the next one is called

2298
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:13,620
Well, it's uh, I gotta download that one. Fuck uh

2299
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:19,700
Download uh, the next one is also homogenous, but with capital letters this time

2300
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:24,260
Okay, are you ready? Yep. Okay three two one go

2301
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:29,620
5,615.4 divided by one free free seven is 4.20

2302
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:37,940
What is mr. Conference of cock the square root of 4,761 is 69 try to keep up try to suck dick

2303
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:44,820
Did you know the orbital period of Pluto with 7.82 billion seconds? That's too slow get in the fast lane get in my ass

2304
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:50,900
You're a hot guy. I bet your draper point is 69.99 degrees kelvin square of the one carry the two

2305
02:32:51,140 --> 02:32:54,660
You've got an equation for the male persuasion

2306
02:32:55,460 --> 02:33:00,980
First the cum blast then the brain blast life's good when you're a homo genius

2307
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:03,940
I get it

2308
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:07,460
Okay, I was really what what's okay. Okay. Okay

2309
02:33:08,340 --> 02:33:13,220
And that is very homo genius homo genius. I mean in that he spelled it wrong

2310
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:16,580
It's spelled it's spelled wrong in the in the voicemail, but that's okay

2311
02:33:19,540 --> 02:33:22,180
An equation the male persuasion

2312
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:27,780
Uh, what is the circumference of cock? Nobody knows nobody knows scientists have been

2313
02:33:28,660 --> 02:33:30,660
trying to find out

2314
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:37,060
Okay, all right, um the next one

2315
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:40,420
Oh god, it's another

2316
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:45,140
God, it's another vocaru. Okay, uh, three two one go

2317
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:55,140
Oh

2318
02:33:56,740 --> 02:33:58,740
Is this demon days

2319
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:03,060
It's like that is the intro

2320
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:09,560
I'm just sort of expecting a fat beat to drop

2321
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:24,180
Hmm

2322
02:34:26,100 --> 02:34:28,100
And then track two

2323
02:34:28,980 --> 02:34:37,620
Yeah, it's a big beat like oh bass. Oh, oh, it's me 2d. We're the gorillas. I love 2d. Uh, we're the gorillas and we're here to say

2324
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:43,460
Nothing I'm a homo genius. I'm a homo genius

2325
02:34:44,820 --> 02:34:50,660
Uh, I mean it's nice, uh, nice soundscape bro. Nice little uh, nice little uh

2326
02:34:51,380 --> 02:34:56,340
Well, it's an audio environment you created there for me ominous ominous

2327
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:59,220
homominous

2328
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:02,100
Next one is called zero

2329
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:04,980
Wait a minute. We have to download that one

2330
02:35:05,220 --> 02:35:08,820
Okay, there we go. The next one's called zero three two one go

2331
02:35:10,740 --> 02:35:14,500
What's the best digibro video best digibro video

2332
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:17,700
Hmm

2333
02:35:18,100 --> 02:35:20,100
The best digibro video

2334
02:35:21,220 --> 02:35:23,220
Probably measurement man

2335
02:35:24,340 --> 02:35:26,340
That's not digibro. That's modal soul

2336
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,020
but

2337
02:35:28,020 --> 02:35:29,300
uh

2338
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:32,420
Dang it. I mean there is no good video then

2339
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:35,540
I mean unless I mean, I don't know I

2340
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:39,380
I was thinking of ones on the main channel. Yeah, like about an anime

2341
02:35:40,180 --> 02:35:41,540
or something

2342
02:35:41,540 --> 02:35:43,140
I I would say

2343
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:45,140
I mean, um

2344
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:51,700
If it counts as one video, I guess I would probably say the asterisk war sucks is pretty good. Um

2345
02:35:52,820 --> 02:35:54,820
Is there another one that's like comparable to that?

2346
02:35:55,380 --> 02:35:57,380
There was this sort out online

2347
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:58,660
sucks

2348
02:35:58,660 --> 02:36:04,180
Your anime sucks series. There's a couple asterisk war is asterisk war is better

2349
02:36:04,900 --> 02:36:06,980
Asterisk war is the best version of that

2350
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:11,860
I like that one and then um, the the mamoru oshii

2351
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:14,340
a career

2352
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:18,900
Like history one is pretty good. That was that's the last good digibro video

2353
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:24,260
Yeah, I I can't remember any specifics except for the big ones like the

2354
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:29,620
The we have accepted mediocrity was pretty good. I think

2355
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:31,780
You know what?

2356
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:34,020
I'm gonna say in hindsight it actually wasn't good

2357
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:40,100
Because it came from a place of she had no idea what she was talking about and like she didn't mean anything that she said

2358
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:46,980
Yeah, I like the video though. It's very well edited. Davoo did a good job

2359
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:54,020
I actually I'll be honest. I kind of don't really even remember like what happens in that video

2360
02:36:55,220 --> 02:37:02,180
It is it is it is a rambling thought stream of consciousness, but it's it's a cool experience because of the editing

2361
02:37:03,700 --> 02:37:06,740
Hmm when it comes to like an analysis of an anime

2362
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:08,740
I

2363
02:37:09,620 --> 02:37:13,380
Mean I don't really watch the enemies that are talked about so it's hard for me to remember

2364
02:37:14,260 --> 02:37:19,300
Yeah, I never really watched the ones that were like here are my thoughts about an anime because I don't

2365
02:37:20,020 --> 02:37:25,380
Yeah, wasn't don't watch them how to tell if an anime is bad in just one episode that got a lot of views

2366
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:29,860
I don't remember if I enjoyed it. I don't think that one's as good. I mean that one's fine

2367
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:35,620
It's just it's just a recommendation for like oh drop shows early if you aren't enjoying them. Yeah

2368
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:38,340
Yeah, I mean, okay. I have I have no issue with that

2369
02:37:38,980 --> 02:37:43,700
What was the one about like like steins gate versus regular gate?

2370
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:48,740
Oh, it was a show called gate that had a really bad intro

2371
02:37:49,380 --> 02:37:53,220
And it was about like the the knights of yore and the tanks

2372
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:57,940
Fighting what wasn't that the how to tell a bad because because how to tell a bad

2373
02:37:58,580 --> 02:38:02,420
No, how to tell a good anime is the one with that's about steins gate

2374
02:38:02,820 --> 02:38:08,100
I just remember there was a steins gate versus regular gate and that was a funny joke

2375
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,980
Because it's not called regular gate

2376
02:38:11,220 --> 02:38:14,100
It's called gay vaguely. I vaguely remember that one

2377
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:17,860
um, I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go with asterisk war sucks and

2378
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:22,820
The mamoru oshii I can't I can't really think of another are there

2379
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:31,300
Are there any other videos that she did that were like the mamoru oshii like the story of this guy's career because like

2380
02:38:31,620 --> 02:38:33,620
Did you do one about hidi eki ano?

2381
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:38,180
I don't recall one about him, but um, there was this one about this

2382
02:38:39,540 --> 02:38:42,340
Uh painter or like background artist

2383
02:38:42,980 --> 02:38:47,060
Who's you know, like oh that that guy I don't remember his name

2384
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:50,260
Oh, that rings a bell

2385
02:38:50,260 --> 02:38:55,620
Just looking through like the the backgrounds of this particular anime background artist

2386
02:38:57,460 --> 02:38:59,460
Because nobody thinks about background guys

2387
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:04,100
But I you know

2388
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:06,260
If you remember thinking

2389
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:10,820
I think I remember feeling positively about that one. I'll didn't leave a huge impression on me

2390
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:16,260
Okay, I think we've answered this question sufficiently. Yeah next one is called hey man

2391
02:39:17,060 --> 02:39:21,540
Uh, hey man cool podcast three two one go

2392
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:27,540
Dude Ben, why didn't you tell me what a podcast dude? I'm gonna kill myself. I'm gonna kill myself

2393
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:31,540
I live in fear of this the hypocrite and the cum zone guy

2394
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:39,060
That's awesome. Like hey, you want to come on my podcast sometime? I think it'll be great and I'll pay your share of the rent

2395
02:39:39,380 --> 02:39:45,860
For that. Oh, well, okay. Maybe I can show to like, you know promote the ben's roommates podcast

2396
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:49,860
Hey, oh and steve said we need more tp. You're good for it, right?

Thanks, dude

2398
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:53,780
I mean

2399
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:57,700
I mean this was supposed to be a parody but like if he's gonna pay my share of the rent like fuck

2400
02:39:57,700 --> 02:40:01,300
Yeah, you can come on my stupid podcast like yeah, of course

2401
02:40:01,940 --> 02:40:07,620
I like the fact that they know hypocrite and the cum zone guy, but they don't know you

2402
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:12,420
I think yeah, I mean I think

2403
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:18,900
Yeah, if they knew if they knew both of those people I think they would definitely know me that's probably true

2404
02:40:19,700 --> 02:40:21,700
uh

2405
02:40:24,020 --> 02:40:26,020
I mean

2406
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:28,420
I'll just say it again like

2407
02:40:28,420 --> 02:40:34,420
Yeah, if someone wants to pay me money if someone wants to pay me money to be on my podcast or have me on their podcast like I'm

2408
02:40:35,300 --> 02:40:37,300
I'm more than amenable

2409
02:40:37,540 --> 02:40:39,300
to such thing

2410
02:40:39,300 --> 02:40:45,860
So you don't don't get the wrong idea. I'm not here to not sell out. Okay. Let's make that abundantly clear

2411
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:50,900
Um, next one is called. Well, it's an integer. It's an integer link. Yeah

2412
02:40:51,860 --> 02:40:54,580
Let's say I made this episode's thumbnail

2413
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:57,700
Didn't unless maybe he did let's see

2414
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:01,300
um

2415
02:41:01,460 --> 02:41:05,940
What I think they're they're assuming we'll talk about brazil

2416
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:10,660
Why would I talk about brazil because the the new guy is like

2417
02:41:11,220 --> 02:41:17,540
Left leaning and the bad guy the the guy who lost is like refusing to admit it and there's like some news about that

2418
02:41:17,540 --> 02:41:19,540
But I haven't really been keeping up with it

2419
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:23,540
I guess I did um sort of hear about I didn't realize they had had like

2420
02:41:24,820 --> 02:41:26,820
Right, they had to do like a runoff election, right

2421
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:32,100
I have no idea. I just know that the the old guy is like cranky about it. He's like pissed

2422
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:37,620
I know that they had an I think they had an election and lula like won

2423
02:41:37,700 --> 02:41:42,100
But he won by such a narrow margin that like it didn't count so they had to do like a a revote

2424
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,340
which has now

2425
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:46,340
Turned out that has won again

2426
02:41:46,820 --> 02:41:51,540
And I mean I did yeah, I did want that to happen, but like I'm not I'm not following the story that closely

2427
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:54,980
I don't know who these girls are. Why is this playing on the on the thing?

2428
02:41:56,420 --> 02:41:57,940
I don't know man

2429
02:41:57,940 --> 02:42:00,500
I don't know is wait swing swinging a mess with this thumbnail

2430
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:03,540
Try again try again

2431
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:05,780
uh

2432
02:42:05,780 --> 02:42:07,780
Submit one every week

2433
02:42:07,780 --> 02:42:09,780
Until we use it and then you win

2434
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:13,620
Uh next one is another integer link

2435
02:42:14,260 --> 02:42:16,020
Uh-huh

2436
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:21,060
Some cake it's time for some cake my dear. It's time for some cake my dear. It's time for some cake my dear

2437
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:24,420
Um, I still don't know what these drawings are from

2438
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:27,860
Have we not got any like comments?

2439
02:42:28,820 --> 02:42:30,820
You know about it

2440
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:33,140
I have not

2441
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:35,540
I I never I didn't uh read the

2442
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:40,900
Comments on last weeks or two weeks ago's episode yet. I've kind of been meaning to and I haven't done it

2443
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:42,900
So maybe somebody did

2444
02:42:43,140 --> 02:42:45,140
Say an answer, but I haven't seen one

2445
02:42:46,580 --> 02:42:48,580
And yeah, I still don't know

2446
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:51,060
Uh, and I I know

2447
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:55,300
Somebody somebody knows somebody knows what this what these these

2448
02:42:56,180 --> 02:42:59,220
Big boob cat girl ms paint characters are from

2449
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:07,940
Uh, but it's not me next one is called sorry if it is too fast. Also. Do you know good text to speech?

2450
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:10,500
three two one go

2451
02:43:11,140 --> 02:43:13,140
I'm so baffled and frustrated with all this AI art today

2452
02:43:13,620 --> 02:43:16,660
Artists who stand against AI art are like workers who stand against automated factories

2453
02:43:17,220 --> 02:43:19,940
No, shit. It is bad for you, but guess what it is good for humanity

2454
02:43:20,340 --> 02:43:23,780
Let's imagine a scenario where AI development is so rapid and good that it can literally replace an artist

2455
02:43:24,260 --> 02:43:28,980
Like you think of an image and it creates it from your head or even better and stylizes it and you can transform it in any sort of way

2456
02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:32,340
How is this bad for artists? Sure, you maybe don't have a career anymore

2457
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:36,500
But now directors writers programmers and authors can quickly and affordably create any visualization they need

2458
02:43:36,900 --> 02:43:40,740
It frees aspiring non-visual creators from necessity of having a bunch of money and connections to make their work seem

2459
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:45,220
In the old day musicians could not record without gatekeepers or record labels who would give them access to recording studio

2460
02:43:45,620 --> 02:43:48,420
Now digital software costs nothing and allow you to produce top-notch recordings

2461
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:50,020
The same is with art

2462
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:54,340
But benefiters are other creative people having said that artists are not just factory workers

2463
02:43:54,820 --> 02:43:55,940
They are creators too

2464
02:43:55,940 --> 02:43:57,940
Yeah, I cannot replace them 100%

2465
02:43:58,100 --> 02:44:01,780
Because even as hired contractor artists job can be to elaborate on design produce concepts experiment

2466
02:44:02,100 --> 02:44:04,180
I personally have an artist that makes art for my video game

2467
02:44:04,180 --> 02:44:07,300
And there's so much creativity that he brings even though I have a pretty solid vision of how things should be

2468
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:10,820
And if I can replace such artists too aimed at almost the real intelligence

2469
02:44:11,300 --> 02:44:13,300
And if it is a final point of AI development

2470
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:17,860
It seems like those artists from art station flash mob want to sacrifice the ultimate progress of humanity for the sake of their job security

2471
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:19,220
How painful

2472
02:44:19,220 --> 02:44:24,900
Who will god i mistake on this podcast his opinion on such topics was always so on the other side from years that it created interesting conversations

2473
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:26,580
who will

2474
02:44:26,580 --> 02:44:28,580
Wait, what was that last bit?

2475
02:44:29,380 --> 02:44:34,900
Uh, I wish Nate was on the podcast because his opinion was so different from your guys that would create interesting conversations

2476
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:38,100
And then he said it. Ooh

2477
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:44,100
I guess I mean, what do you mean like?

2478
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:49,380
I don't think he would be on these opposites. It wouldn't be on the opposite side for me. I think we'd be on the same

2479
02:44:49,380 --> 02:44:51,380
I think he was probably

2480
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:53,380
Well, you know, actually, I don't I don't know

2481
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:56,180
I think he would probably agree with me that automation is good

2482
02:44:56,820 --> 02:45:00,500
I think that the reason I push back against it is just because

2483
02:45:01,540 --> 02:45:05,220
Um, I think it's good to argue for your job security

2484
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:06,820
because

2485
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:10,500
Uh, yeah, what are you gonna do if there's no way for you to make money?

2486
02:45:11,060 --> 02:45:12,420
That sucks

2487
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:16,420
There's no there's no system in in place to allow for people

2488
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:20,340
To be okay with their job security being threatened

2489
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:26,100
They need money to live and they need a lot of money because things are so expensive right now because of the war and other things

2490
02:45:26,820 --> 02:45:28,820
I would say I mean, I I guess the one

2491
02:45:29,860 --> 02:45:34,420
Thing I would maybe say about that is that uh, it's it is yeah, I do think it is good

2492
02:45:35,460 --> 02:45:38,180
Even though even though it might cost some people jobs

2493
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:39,860
I do think it is good

2494
02:45:39,860 --> 02:45:43,380
To remove the need for it's it's a net good to remove the need for labor

2495
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:49,140
Even if it eliminates jobs because I think reducing the need for labor is good with with the understanding

2496
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:54,820
That like the thing that replaces that labor can't be privately owned by some

2497
02:45:55,220 --> 02:45:57,220
Capitalist it has to be something that

2498
02:45:57,780 --> 02:45:59,780
It has to be available to

2499
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:01,060
people yeah in

2500
02:46:01,060 --> 02:46:07,380
In a in a demo like like what the bitcoin people say what the what the ai people say that it's democratizing art like yeah

2501
02:46:08,580 --> 02:46:10,580
If it actually does that that's good

2502
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:15,060
It it doesn't do that if like you own the software and it's proprietary or if anyone owns it

2503
02:46:15,060 --> 02:46:18,740
If it is out there and anyone can use it and it makes things more. Yeah kind of like

2504
02:46:19,620 --> 02:46:22,820
studio a soft software music software studio

2505
02:46:23,380 --> 02:46:27,060
Made it possible for people to make stuff that could have made it before

2506
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:29,780
Then yeah, it isn't that good even if

2507
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:34,180
It's bad for some people so I agree listen to caveat, but um

2508
02:46:35,380 --> 02:46:41,860
My problem is mostly with capitalism when it comes to like ai making things easier, then yeah, I'd agree

2509
02:46:42,420 --> 02:46:44,420
Yeah, like generally yes

2510
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:49,220
Because like

2511
02:46:49,380 --> 02:46:51,380
I mean

2512
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:58,420
I don't know. What do you what do you think would would you use a software that like you didn't have to like draw you could just

2513
02:46:59,060 --> 02:47:02,020
Type in some prompts and it wouldn't steal anyone's work or anything

2514
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:08,500
But it would just like use some smart things to like just know what you were thinking and like produce the image you were imagining in your head

2515
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:10,740
um, yeah, I would

2516
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:12,740
if there's no like victim and

2517
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:15,700
It's saving me

2518
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:21,300
I don't know like moving my arms around or needing to to be better at drawing

2519
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:26,980
If it if it's like oh you put this chip on the side of your head and you can imagine something and it will appear as an image

2520
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:29,460
It's like that's that would be great. I would love that

2521
02:47:30,340 --> 02:47:31,300
I

2522
02:47:31,300 --> 02:47:34,100
might use it sometimes. I think um

2523
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:38,660
I do think that like draw actually drawing yourself

2524
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:42,900
Probably creates a sensibility

2525
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:49,300
That is irreplaceable in terms of like appreciating

2526
02:47:50,260 --> 02:47:57,300
Aesthetics and that that aesthetic sense is part of what would let you imagine an appealing image in the first place

2527
02:47:58,180 --> 02:48:00,180
also, I mean the

2528
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:05,940
Sometimes an image is enhanced by like especially in physical media like

2529
02:48:06,660 --> 02:48:11,220
The physical material that produces it sometimes like the texture of that material

2530
02:48:11,860 --> 02:48:13,860
forms a part of the

2531
02:48:14,580 --> 02:48:21,860
Image and it's aesthetic and enhances it and AI can't replicate that unless you build a robot to do it in physical

2532
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:23,780
media

2533
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:25,780
I would still I would still get

2534
02:48:25,860 --> 02:48:30,020
It's it's the same way that like, you know, we ascribe value to things

2535
02:48:31,140 --> 02:48:35,060
Arbitrarily and if you know something is hand drawn

2536
02:48:35,860 --> 02:48:38,580
um, as opposed to AI generated

2537
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:41,380
There's there's just an in like

2538
02:48:41,860 --> 02:48:45,140
The viewer the audience will ascribe meaning

2539
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:49,540
Based on that to the to work like even if it's an identical thing

2540
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:53,940
If a computer if a computer can identically create something people

2541
02:48:54,580 --> 02:48:56,580
generally just have affection for

2542
02:48:57,620 --> 02:48:59,620
things that are more personal

2543
02:49:00,020 --> 02:49:06,580
So like yeah, I would I would still draw just because I I like drawing and it's nice to see something that I did

2544
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:10,820
If I could imagine if I'm like, oh, I'm listening to this song

2545
02:49:10,820 --> 02:49:14,580
And I'm imagining a music video and if I could turn that into a real music video

2546
02:49:14,740 --> 02:49:20,020
That would be great because doing all of that extra work to really make a music video for that

2547
02:49:20,740 --> 02:49:22,260
song

2548
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:24,740
would be like months and months of

2549
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:27,540
Backbreaking labor that I don't want to do

2550
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:32,020
Right. I mean, I mean, do you do you think like when you see a music video and you like it?

2551
02:49:32,020 --> 02:49:36,100
Do you think like, oh, I really appreciate what I really appreciate about this music video

2552
02:49:36,580 --> 02:49:39,540
Is that I know that a team of like two dozen people

2553
02:49:39,940 --> 02:49:45,460
Had to like, you know spend weeks and weeks like getting together in a warehouse and setting up sets and setting up shots

2554
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:49,780
And choreographing it all and setting and someone had to edit it and someone no

2555
02:49:50,660 --> 02:49:53,700
Yeah, I mean, I don't think that but like I I think that

2556
02:49:54,740 --> 02:49:57,780
It would matter to me for I don't really feel that way about drawing

2557
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:04,260
Like because things that you're drawing yourself. Yeah. Yeah, like if I felt like a computer was

2558
02:50:04,820 --> 02:50:08,740
I mean, it's a it's a weird hypothetical because it's like

2559
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:11,860
At what point is it really

2560
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:15,060
The computer if it's my imagination like I don't know how

2561
02:50:16,420 --> 02:50:20,580
Yeah, if you I mean you have you have full you have complete control over what the image is

2562
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:24,980
You don't actually have to draw it, but the computer can just translate yet

2563
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:31,620
Can just translate your thoughts exactly onto like like like the way I imagine it in like right now

2564
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:35,220
Is I I imagine the drawing in my head and then I use my motor

2565
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:39,780
Skills with my penmanship to create the drawing with my arm

2566
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:42,820
And then using a computer

2567
02:50:42,820 --> 02:50:46,580
Like interpreters a different way of doing this exact same thing

2568
02:50:47,140 --> 02:50:49,140
So I guess I wouldn't feel differently about that

2569
02:50:51,060 --> 02:50:56,580
I think yeah, I think if if if I like I I could imagine a scenario where

2570
02:50:57,460 --> 02:50:59,940
I would just want something to be legitimate

2571
02:51:00,500 --> 02:51:05,700
Because I know everything is AI generated and I just feel like it would be it'll feel a little special

2572
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:08,180
I if something was not that

2573
02:51:08,900 --> 02:51:10,900
I do think I mean

2574
02:51:11,220 --> 02:51:15,060
Art out of adversity. I I do feel like the the limitations

2575
02:51:15,700 --> 02:51:17,700
And the compromises that come from

2576
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:19,940
producing an image

2577
02:51:19,940 --> 02:51:29,060
Especially in a in a physical medium is like is air is air does give something irreplaceable and and AI can never replicate that

2578
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:32,180
Uh, that's not

2579
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:34,980
And that's something that's mostly in like in like painting

2580
02:51:35,780 --> 02:51:37,140
um

2581
02:51:37,140 --> 02:51:39,140
Digit if you're drawing digitally

2582
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:41,540
Still I think there are you know

2583
02:51:41,860 --> 02:51:47,700
You just people talk about like like happy accidents like sometimes you'll be drawing and you'll draw something that you didn't mean to draw

2584
02:51:47,700 --> 02:51:52,020
You make a mark you you live the line some way and it looks good

2585
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:57,140
By accident and then you go oh, I kind of like that and then you just go with it

2586
02:51:57,540 --> 02:52:00,420
And you know those kind of things only happen if you are

2587
02:52:00,980 --> 02:52:05,780
Fumbling around with your fallible human machine that you are attempting attempting to manipulate

2588
02:52:06,500 --> 02:52:07,940
in order to uh

2589
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:11,780
Give instructions to your computer to interpret into an image on screen

2590
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:15,140
Um, I think that kind of stuff is not

2591
02:52:15,780 --> 02:52:22,580
Reproducible by AI. That's the kind of thing that a person does. Yeah, I also think that the argument that

2592
02:52:24,580 --> 02:52:28,740
Like AI is is is like being held back by artists

2593
02:52:30,020 --> 02:52:32,020
it I feel like AI is not

2594
02:52:33,220 --> 02:52:35,220
trying to progress

2595
02:52:35,220 --> 02:52:41,220
Enough in the in that way because it really it still currently relies on stealing artwork

2596
02:52:41,860 --> 02:52:43,860
in order to train itself

2597
02:52:44,020 --> 02:52:47,940
And people use the ability to steal artwork

2598
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:53,300
Um to like get a specific artist style and then make money off of selling

2599
02:52:53,860 --> 02:53:00,500
I would say it's it's maybe not exactly a lot of grifters in the scene that are sort of also holding it back in a different way

2600
02:53:00,660 --> 02:53:02,660
They're not they're not thinking

2601
02:53:03,060 --> 02:53:06,420
Maybe in the future we could imagine things and make them real because

2602
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:09,380
They just want to make money right now

2603
02:53:10,340 --> 02:53:12,340
Yeah, yeah

2604
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:14,340
and that's

2605
02:53:14,420 --> 02:53:16,420
If like if that's the

2606
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:20,180
When that's that's the whatever we have now cannot be the end point because it sucks

2607
02:53:21,140 --> 02:53:23,140
It is not

2608
02:53:23,220 --> 02:53:25,220
It's not good enough. No, it's not good enough

2609
02:53:26,660 --> 02:53:28,980
It's it's not it's not good enough

2610
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:35,540
As far as I can see it's not really good enough that it can exist as like a standalone thing

2611
02:53:36,500 --> 02:53:38,660
That produces things on its own it needs to be

2612
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:42,740
It can all it can only be used as a tool in like interpreting

2613
02:53:43,460 --> 02:53:49,300
An artist's work and extrapolating from an artist's work and to do you either have to produce what it is interpreting

2614
02:53:49,700 --> 02:53:55,540
Or you have to steal it from someone else and interpret what something someone else made and seems like that's where it's at

2615
02:53:57,140 --> 02:54:00,660
Um, which is fine. Um, I mean not the stealing part

2616
02:54:02,260 --> 02:54:04,900
Okay, uh, I think you want to go to the next one. Yeah

2617
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:11,620
You there? Yeah. Okay. Uh, next one is the cringis three two one go

2618
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:13,940
Yeah, what job is she?

2619
02:54:13,940 --> 02:54:15,380

Okay

2623
02:54:25,540 --> 02:54:28,260

The latest episode of the pcp

2625
02:54:32,340 --> 02:54:40,900
No, fuck you Ben made a fool of himself from the comics. Oh my god. It was kind of cringe. Fuck you

2626
02:54:41,860 --> 02:54:43,860

Kring confrontational Kringis signing out

2630
02:54:55,700 --> 02:54:59,380
Borderlands the game. I guess so I haven't played it

2631
02:55:00,100 --> 02:55:02,100
But I've seen it

2632
02:55:02,820 --> 02:55:04,100
Uh

2633
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:06,980
I didn't know deadly comics thinks I'm cool

2634
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:12,900
When I asked him why don't girls like me he thought I appreciate this man's honesty

2635
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:16,100
He's relatable

2636
02:55:21,460 --> 02:55:26,020
People don't understand that I'm doing a bit people don't understand that anytime I do anything embarrassing

2637
02:55:26,580 --> 02:55:31,060
It's a it's just a bit just a character and I did it. I was just playing a character

2638
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:34,740
I was just doing a bit. I was doing it to get a laugh

2639
02:55:35,700 --> 02:55:39,220
And if you don't appreciate that then you don't deserve it, okay

2640
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:44,740
Then I'll cry if you don't appreciate that then I'll cry you shit myself. I'll cry a little bit

2641
02:55:45,140 --> 02:55:48,900
Yes, I will cry. Yes, I'll cry out of pity for you. I'll cry out of pity for that

2642
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:51,380
You don't get my human humor. You can't appreciate it

2643
02:55:52,260 --> 02:55:53,860
And I'll shit myself

2644
02:55:53,860 --> 02:55:55,860
in protest

2645
02:55:55,860 --> 02:55:57,700
It'll be deliberate

2646
02:55:57,700 --> 02:55:59,700
And it'll be a part of the bit, but you won't get it

2647
02:56:01,540 --> 02:56:09,140
You'll go it'll go way over your head. Okay. Next one is called. It's too big for my own good always cause a tiny bit of bleh

2649
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:14,100
What a world at humble brag dot com three two one go

2650
02:56:15,220 --> 02:56:17,620
What does your perfect christmas look like?

2651
02:56:18,980 --> 02:56:21,780
Mine looks like doing my wife by the fire

2652
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:26,500
And not hurting her massive penis

2653
02:56:31,300 --> 02:56:33,300
That would be a christmas miracle

2654
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:37,540
I I missed what he said. He said what does your perfect christmas look like?

2655
02:56:37,620 --> 02:56:42,100
Mine looks like doing my wife by the fire and not hurting her with my massive penis

2656
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:47,460
Oh, I thought he said not hurting her a massive penis. I thought it was a twist. I think

2657
02:56:48,260 --> 02:56:53,060
He's saying he hurts her. He's humble bragging about his penis is too large to

2658
02:56:54,580 --> 02:56:56,580
Engage in copulation with his

2659
02:56:57,220 --> 02:56:59,540
wife without uh causing injury

2660
02:57:01,460 --> 02:57:05,780
That's abuse that's spousal abuse right there. Not if she's gonna have to quit quit it

2661
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:07,060
You're gonna have to cut it out

2662
02:57:07,060 --> 02:57:10,020
Not if not if she's you're gonna have to hit it and quit it my friends

2663
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:14,420
Not if she likes it and is consent there's consent for injury

2664
02:57:15,140 --> 02:57:17,140
Then it's good actually

2665
02:57:17,700 --> 02:57:19,700
It's better

2666
02:57:19,700 --> 02:57:24,500
That's all I have to say. He's gonna sign a waiver. Congratulations on your huge penis

2667
02:57:24,980 --> 02:57:28,260
But uh, you know, sorry to hear about your weak wife

2668
02:57:31,220 --> 02:57:33,380
Sorry, you have sorry you have to deal with that

2669
02:57:33,460 --> 02:57:37,780
I'm sorry. You have this problem that you have to deal with or your wife keeps getting injured by you

2670
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:40,020
You know, that must be really hard on you

2671
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:43,860
Uh, next one is called moider or assassino

2672
02:57:44,580 --> 02:57:46,580
three two one go

2673
02:57:46,980 --> 02:57:49,700
I'm not a crazed gunman. I'm an assassin

2674
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:53,300
Well, one is the job and the other's mental sickness

2675
02:57:54,100 --> 02:57:55,620
Thank you for your

2676
02:57:55,620 --> 02:58:01,620
Reference. What is that a reference to I've heard that before it's from the tf2 meet the sniper video

2677
02:58:03,620 --> 02:58:06,900
You know those it's not even it's not even that funny of a line really

2678
02:58:07,780 --> 02:58:10,740
Yeah, I mean it's okay. It's characterization

2679
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:12,820
um

2680
02:58:12,820 --> 02:58:14,820
Next one is uh

2681
02:58:14,980 --> 02:58:23,140
My name's your link. Yes. There we go. Uh, don't do a reverse image search of this picture worst mistake of my life

2682
02:58:24,340 --> 02:58:28,740
I can't do it on firefox. How do you do it? Well now I gotta do it

2683
02:58:30,580 --> 02:58:33,300
I mean, I'm seeing a bunch of the same images

2684
02:58:33,940 --> 02:58:35,940
I'm seeing a bunch of other

2685
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:38,260
pictures of dinosaurs

2686
02:58:38,740 --> 02:58:44,340
Oh, I just realized the murder or assassin thing was referencing when we were talking about that in that previous episode

2687
02:58:45,300 --> 02:58:47,940
Like what is considered a murder or an assassination?

2688
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:51,700
But that was clear that up. It's just a reference

2689
02:58:52,340 --> 02:58:56,820
Uh, okay. Well, I yeah, I do remember that actually so I see the

2690
02:58:57,940 --> 02:59:02,900
See what they're going for. Um, yeah, I'm gonna admit. I don't like see anything

2691
02:59:03,860 --> 02:59:06,820
I don't see or really see anything in the in the

2692
02:59:07,860 --> 02:59:09,060
search results

2693
02:59:09,060 --> 02:59:14,420
I mean, I almost feel like maybe I should find just the original image without the caption and reverse search that

2694
02:59:15,540 --> 02:59:17,540
Oh

2695
02:59:18,340 --> 02:59:20,340
Um, I think it might be because

2696
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:23,300
I think it might be the name

2697
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:28,340
What's the name it's it's uh, I think you'll understand when I say it

2698
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:33,940
I think it is called or at least it is someone's called the niger the Niger sorus

2699
02:59:34,660 --> 02:59:36,660
You get it

2700
02:59:36,820 --> 02:59:39,540
n i g e r c a u

2701
02:59:41,860 --> 02:59:45,220
I mean, okay, he looks pretty shocked to hear this

2702
02:59:45,780 --> 02:59:52,020
Yeah, he's a fan. I can't believe they they caught like a real like like dinosaur that's alive with skin

2703
02:59:53,060 --> 02:59:55,060
Yeah, and then they called him a slur and it offended him

2704
02:59:55,620 --> 02:59:58,180
He's like you can't believe he was I can't believe he was such a live

2705
02:59:58,900 --> 03:00:03,060
Okay, it is a real dinosaur. Okay. All right. I get it because it was discovered in

2706
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:07,620
Niger gado gado fawah in Niger. Yeah somewhere

2707
03:00:08,420 --> 03:00:11,380
Well, that was a funny joke. Uh, you got me

2708
03:00:13,540 --> 03:00:19,220
Uh, the next one the dinosaur youtube guy loves those silly little pictures three two one go

2709
03:00:20,180 --> 03:00:22,180
Hey y'all, it's fucking

2710
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:32,340
4 20 in the morning. Let's go. Let's go. I just finished the eight hour unique name of sorus video because I hate myself

2711
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:38,820
And I'm an idiot not the dinosaur guy even though he has sorus and it was bad. It was a fucking fugue

2712
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:41,460
I don't know what to do

2713
03:00:42,420 --> 03:00:48,260
Every now and then he'd talk about the folding ideas line go up and it was like a moment of clarity of like

2714
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:50,340
Oh, that's a point that makes sense

2715
03:00:50,500 --> 03:00:56,420
And then he'd just show more he showed so many tweets. I know you're probably sick of talking about this

2716
03:00:56,900 --> 03:00:58,820
but I was like

2717
03:00:58,820 --> 03:01:00,820
Is it as bad as they say?

2718
03:01:01,380 --> 03:01:05,300
I guess. Um, yeah, I mean I haven't watched it and I never will my

2719
03:01:06,180 --> 03:01:13,300
Impression of it is that yeah most of his argument boils down to like some people said some things that he thinks are mean

2720
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:20,100
Hmm and that that makes NFTs good actually because people that don't like NFTs are mean

2721
03:01:21,940 --> 03:01:23,940
Yes, I remember

2722
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:29,380
Skipping around to see if he mentioned the line goes up video

2723
03:01:30,020 --> 03:01:33,940
Yeah, and then he did and his response to something was like, well, that's stupid actually

2724
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:38,100
So I was like, okay. Do you remember what it was? I don't remember. I don't remember

2725
03:01:38,660 --> 03:01:40,660
I think it was just sort of like a weird

2726
03:01:41,220 --> 03:01:43,860
Interpretation of what dan Olson was saying

2727
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:48,500
And so I'm like, okay. I can disregard this whole video. And so I didn't watch the entire thing

2728
03:01:49,220 --> 03:01:50,820
the um

2729
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:56,820
It's funny when you say the dinosaur youtube guy, I do not think of unique nemosaurus. I think of tray the explainer

2730
03:01:56,820 --> 03:01:58,820
Do you know tray the explainer?

2731
03:01:58,820 --> 03:02:00,100
No

2732
03:02:00,100 --> 03:02:02,100
I mean he has a

2733
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:04,100
Fucking dinosaur

2734
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:08,020
Does he explain that

2735
03:02:08,660 --> 03:02:10,580
Uh, probably

2736
03:02:11,540 --> 03:02:15,540
Probably at some point, uh, he's good. He does a lot of like like archaeology

2737
03:02:16,500 --> 03:02:20,580
And like history and like anthropology sort of stuff. Uh, and he's good

2738
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:25,860
Next one is called one of adult swim unmisses three two one go

2739
03:02:27,460 --> 03:02:31,540

2748
03:03:01,220 --> 03:03:05,860
I do not looking at it my immediate impression is that I do not want to watch it

2749
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:12,020
Michael cusack is the guy uh, half of smiling friends. Yes

2750

Um, I could be good

2756
03:03:27,700 --> 03:03:30,820
Uh, it could be good. The you know, it's one of these

2757
03:03:32,020 --> 03:03:35,540
It's got that look about it. It's got that look about it. That is so

2758
03:03:36,340 --> 03:03:42,420
It looks like looks like one of these fucking uh, you know adult animation with uh, you know

2759
03:03:43,700 --> 03:03:48,740
Simple animation and I have nothing against that other than every fucking show looks like that

2760
03:03:50,500 --> 03:03:52,500
And I just hate media

2761
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:58,180
Yeah, when are they gonna make when are they gonna make um, uh, uh

2762
03:04:00,420 --> 03:04:02,420
Thunder cats

2763
03:04:02,660 --> 03:04:04,660
They're gonna make thunder cats

2764
03:04:04,900 --> 03:04:12,500
Exactly, that's exactly what I'm saying. The next voicemail is from at killer prince 9 30 3 2 1 go

2765
03:04:13,620 --> 03:04:17,220
You know what fuck off. I didn't like the last guy's tone

2766
03:04:18,660 --> 03:04:21,540
I heard the next guy also skin babies

2767
03:04:22,180 --> 03:04:24,580
What you didn't like the next guy's turn

2768
03:04:25,700 --> 03:04:29,860
And he's killing babies the last guy's tone. He didn't like the last guy's tone

2769
03:04:30,820 --> 03:04:33,940
Oh, it's like it's just talking about whoever came before

2770
03:04:35,700 --> 03:04:37,700
This one is called at killer prince

2771
03:04:38,900 --> 03:04:43,780
Does he does he know that prince isolation roasted him like how would he know that?

2772
03:04:44,900 --> 03:04:46,420
uh

2773
03:04:46,420 --> 03:04:50,020
A e-guest is a big guest. It paid off though

2774
03:04:52,500 --> 03:04:55,700
Well killer there's no killer prince prince is a rowdy

2775
03:04:56,180 --> 03:05:00,980
So what's going on? Is this just a weird coincidence? I'm not probably okay

2776
03:05:01,460 --> 03:05:07,380
Well, the next one is an imager. So let's fucking look at it. Why don't we teacher?

2777
03:05:07,460 --> 03:05:12,100
I'm giving you easy homework this time even a complete dumbass will be able to solve it

2778
03:05:12,500 --> 03:05:14,500
Kid named complete dumbass

2779
03:05:16,980 --> 03:05:18,980
If you're

2780
03:05:20,500 --> 03:05:22,500
If you're not aware

2781
03:05:22,900 --> 03:05:26,980
That is tectonic improv from the uh, uh, linkara

2782
03:05:28,660 --> 03:05:30,660
Atop the fourth wall lecture

2783
03:05:30,660 --> 03:05:34,500
Which you should watch if you have not watched it. It's good. It's a good lecture

2784
03:05:35,380 --> 03:05:38,020
Um, all right. Next one is another imager

2785
03:05:39,300 --> 03:05:41,940
I was just green it was green verification

2786
03:05:42,580 --> 03:05:44,580
Because of slime. Oh, right

2787
03:05:45,300 --> 03:05:47,300
Okay, this is um

2788
03:05:47,540 --> 03:05:51,300
Elon I can't do it. I want to keep it alive not only uh, even if you laugh at a lot of

2789
03:05:52,260 --> 03:05:54,260
I'd be happy to do it for $40

2790
03:05:55,540 --> 03:05:57,860
Great. I also dozen years running a podcast

2791
03:05:58,340 --> 03:06:00,260
If you even if you laughed out loud at this

2792
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:05,060
I am a hundred percent certain I could be the very at very least help immensely with prioritizing

2793
03:06:05,620 --> 03:06:08,420
rollouts that maximize growth in the shortest time frame

2794
03:06:08,820 --> 03:06:14,740
And I would be happy to do it for $40. Why $40? I know the the cornering said he would do it for free

2795
03:06:14,980 --> 03:06:23,460
Uh, well, you know, he's got some dignity $40 worth. I have I have exactly $40 worth more dignity than

2796
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:26,180
Than the quartering that sounds about right

2797
03:06:26,980 --> 03:06:31,780
Anyway, next one is uh, I can make the sound better, but the explanation was great in

2798
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:34,660
three two one go

2799
03:06:35,220 --> 03:06:39,220
All right. So what you're gonna do is take your dominant hand

2800
03:06:40,020 --> 03:06:42,020
pinch your own cheek

2801
03:06:42,180 --> 03:06:44,180
The closest to the hand

2802
03:06:44,980 --> 03:06:46,980
a little bit back

2803
03:06:47,460 --> 03:06:48,980
Not on the

2804
03:06:48,980 --> 03:06:50,980
right beside the mouth

2805
03:06:51,140 --> 03:06:55,460
You open your mouth on the same direction only a little bit

2806
03:06:56,260 --> 03:06:58,260
and you pull it

2807
03:06:58,420 --> 03:06:59,380
and

2808
03:06:59,380 --> 03:07:01,380
reach back and repeat

2809
03:07:05,060 --> 03:07:07,860
Not it I get it. No

2810
03:07:08,580 --> 03:07:10,580
Uh

2811
03:07:12,180 --> 03:07:17,220
I'm not doing it. I mean, oh, I also didn't understand the instructions because I'm a visual learner

2812
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:22,100
Um, I don't know what I mean. I heard him. I heard him making the sounds

2813
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:30,980
I don't know how I'm making it correctly right now. I'm trying. I'm trying my best

2814
03:07:32,100 --> 03:07:34,100
Oh, it's mr. Plankard

2815
03:07:34,420 --> 03:07:36,420
All right, we're gonna watch

2816
03:07:38,660 --> 03:07:41,300
That's my best. That's my best. This is my best shot

2817
03:07:42,340 --> 03:07:46,180
Next one is called unnecessary correction to a forgotten conversation

2818
03:07:46,820 --> 03:07:51,220
Really just recommending isokan again though at anime.base three two one go

He did work on space dandy and azokan and you should fucking watch azokan

2823
03:08:04,820 --> 03:08:10,420
It's short and it gets the creative passion flowing. It makes me come every time everybody says it's really good

2824
03:08:10,740 --> 03:08:12,740
And I should probably do

2825
03:08:12,820 --> 03:08:18,580
It's a nice little show. I I like them. I like us. Uh, us. Is that is the is the devil man cry baby

2843
03:09:27,940 --> 03:09:29,940
Oh

2844
03:09:33,220 --> 03:09:35,220
This frog doesn't understand

2845
03:09:54,260 --> 03:09:57,300
What the fuck what the fuck

2847
03:10:01,220 --> 03:10:06,180
I still don't have an answer. I don't know. You still don't know what the funny fuck is going on

2848
03:10:07,780 --> 03:10:09,780
Sorry, man

2849
03:10:10,500 --> 03:10:15,300
Next one's another imjolink. All right, let's uh, let's freaking do it

2850
03:10:17,700 --> 03:10:19,700
They're all women now

2851
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:22,180
Yeah, lol, lol

2852
03:10:22,740 --> 03:10:24,180
Uh

2853
03:10:24,180 --> 03:10:26,180
Haven't seen that picture in a while

2854
03:10:26,900 --> 03:10:28,900
That was from

2855
03:10:28,980 --> 03:10:30,980
Probably like 2017 or something

2856
03:10:31,460 --> 03:10:35,220
Wow 100 years ago that approximately a hundred years ago

2857
03:10:36,020 --> 03:10:37,140
uh

2858
03:10:37,140 --> 03:10:39,140
next one

2859
03:10:40,340 --> 03:10:42,820
Lamal next one is an

2860
03:10:43,620 --> 03:10:49,300
Injure album. Oh my god a whole a whole freaking album. I think it's just one image. Yeah, okay

2861
03:10:49,380 --> 03:10:51,380
Sasuke

2862
03:10:53,140 --> 03:10:57,380
When are they gonna get back to Sasuke? When are they gonna get back to him?

2863
03:10:58,260 --> 03:11:03,860
I mean true. That's this fucking tiger man. Probably some filler episode loser

2864
03:11:04,900 --> 03:11:07,700
That's what happened. It's just like Sasuke left

2865
03:11:08,500 --> 03:11:13,460
They tried to get him back. They failed and then there was a bunch of filler until shippuden

2866
03:11:13,460 --> 03:11:18,740
No, I mean there was a bunch of filler in shippuden

2867
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:24,580
No, no, no, there was like two like a hundred or something episodes. Maybe not that many

2868
03:11:25,300 --> 03:11:29,300
Um between the ending of the arc where Naruto

2869
03:11:30,020 --> 03:11:32,020
uh, neji

2870
03:11:32,340 --> 03:11:33,940
Choji

2871
03:11:33,940 --> 03:11:40,100
Fucking dog boy and uh, shikamaru. They all go to get Sasuke back

2872
03:11:40,340 --> 03:11:48,660
And I maybe messed up who was there, but like they fight a bunch of urochumaru's like underlings and stuff

2873
03:11:49,860 --> 03:11:53,380
and uh, they don't and then it ends with um

2874
03:11:54,340 --> 03:12:01,380
I think it ends with Naruto and Sasuke at the waterfall and they have that epic battle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then that's like the end of

2875
03:12:02,180 --> 03:12:04,180
Main Naruto, right?

2876
03:12:04,180 --> 03:12:07,780
Yeah, but in the anime there's a bunch of episodes after that, which is nothing

2877
03:12:08,500 --> 03:12:12,660
That's the filler like dead zone. I'm like, when are they why are you fucking around?

2878
03:12:12,660 --> 03:12:14,820
I just watched them all because I didn't know what filler was

2879
03:12:16,660 --> 03:12:18,660
I thought it was all important

2880
03:12:20,580 --> 03:12:24,420

Very prescient and you know very very good that I complained about the exact same thing again on this episode and now here it is

3000
03:19:28,260 --> 03:19:30,260
An answer to my prayer

3001
03:19:30,340 --> 03:19:32,340
I mean at least I've got a gun

3002
03:19:32,500 --> 03:19:34,500
What is here in your mouth?

3003
03:19:34,740 --> 03:19:39,620
No, the knife is in my other knife. Yeah, no, I was wondering what it was. It looked like a green thing

03:19:49,380 --> 03:19:52,580
Like it, uh, thank you for the voicemail

3007
03:19:54,900 --> 03:19:59,780
I think that's it. I think that's our last one unless unless we got new ones. We did we just got one a minute ago

3008
03:20:00,020 --> 03:20:02,020
You serious? Oh, it's an amateur

3009
03:20:02,500 --> 03:20:03,700
Yeah

3010
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:06,980
One minute. Holy fucking shit. What literally a minute ago

3011
03:20:09,780 --> 03:20:11,780
So, I mean, yeah

3012
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:19,380
It's sparkling sparkling water here. It's literally right there. It's literally

3013
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:23,540
That's what he bear wobbly at

3014
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:30,580
Oh, you know what I was saying

3015
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:34,580
It's literally I could just grab it

3016
03:20:35,780 --> 03:20:39,460
But you're you're happily striding the other direction

3017
03:20:40,260 --> 03:20:47,940
There's water on the sweaty ass. Yeah, that's sweat drink the sweat from the ass. So I mean, it's not like there's no argument for the ass

3018
03:20:48,660 --> 03:20:50,260
but um

3019
03:20:50,260 --> 03:20:52,260
It's sparkling

3020
03:20:52,260 --> 03:20:54,420
Yeah, but what flavor though if it's if it's

3021
03:20:55,300 --> 03:21:00,580
If it's cran raspberry, uh, if it's if it's tropical, I would if it's tropical. I would probably go for it

3022
03:21:01,460 --> 03:21:03,460
Or your strawberry kiwi

3023
03:21:04,100 --> 03:21:06,260
That that does that does tip the balance a little bit

3024
03:21:06,660 --> 03:21:08,660
Okay

3025
03:21:10,020 --> 03:21:12,020
Well, that was the last one. Yeah

3026
03:21:13,460 --> 03:21:15,860
All right, how do we feel how do how do we feel after navigate?

3027
03:21:17,060 --> 03:21:21,620
Navigating that gauntlet and I feel pretty good. We're almost well with three and a half hours

3028
03:21:22,660 --> 03:21:24,820
Pretty good size for an episode

3029
03:21:25,780 --> 03:21:30,260
Uh, hey, you know what you know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna put a link in the description

3030
03:21:31,140 --> 03:21:33,140
I'm gonna link the

3031
03:21:33,940 --> 03:21:35,940
Minecraft

3032
03:21:36,500 --> 03:21:38,260
PCP

3033
03:21:38,260 --> 03:21:39,300
Uh

3034
03:21:39,300 --> 03:21:40,660
Minecraft

3035
03:21:40,660 --> 03:21:42,660
Yeah, because I said last time

3036
03:21:42,740 --> 03:21:45,300
That the server is free and open now and that's true

3037
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:49,780
And I think the problem is just that maybe people don't know how to get to it because a couple people have asked me like

3038
03:21:49,860 --> 03:21:51,860
How do I get into the server?

3039
03:21:51,940 --> 03:21:55,860
So I'll just put a link in the description to like click that and it will join you to the

3040
03:21:56,660 --> 03:21:58,660
mind the pcb Minecraft server

3041
03:21:58,820 --> 03:22:04,260
And I think you will have access once you're in there, but if not, I'm sure maren can just give you the role

3042
03:22:04,980 --> 03:22:09,140
Because because to get it you have to get in there and you have there's a whole there's like a document

3043
03:22:09,220 --> 03:22:11,780
There's posts that explain how you install it

3044
03:22:12,740 --> 03:22:14,500
uh, and then

3045
03:22:14,500 --> 03:22:16,500
You know, that's the the hard part

3046
03:22:16,660 --> 03:22:17,860
so, uh

3047
03:22:17,860 --> 03:22:21,540
Just in case anyone wants that wants to get jump into the pcb server, which is free now

3048
03:22:22,100 --> 03:22:27,060
Belongs to the people. Yes. Um, I will link it. I will link that in the description

3049
