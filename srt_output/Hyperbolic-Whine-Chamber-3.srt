00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Hello everybody and welcome to another fantastic episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber. April

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:18,000
Fools, it's probably gonna be pathetic. Today, we are drinking Magner's Irish Pair Cider.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,280
Imported since 1935. I don't know anything about this, but I just got it. Today's wine

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:36,080
has been funded by Michael Perrin at Crackkissie on Twitter. So if you want to go say thank you

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:47,120
for the wine, go to at K-R-A-K-I-S-S-I on Twitter. They're cool. They provided some money for the

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,920
wine fund and this was the first acquisition of that that fundage. I actually didn't even realize

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,920
this was there. I was digging through and just noticed it and I was like, oh, why did PayPal

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,440
not email me about this? You fucking bastards. Alright, so today we're going to be talking about

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:18,560
God and religion. Oh boy. I hesitated whether I wanted to talk about this, but I do. And I do

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:27,520
because I feel like I have a perspective that is at least I haven't seen voiced very often. And

11
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,240
because of that, I kind of wanted to give my two cents. Before we do that, I'm going to

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,680
get to take a first sip of the Pair Irish Cider and see how it is. Smells nice.

13
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:49,760
It's very, very sweet and barely tastes the alcohol at all.

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,160
Interesting. I actually kind of like this one.

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,280
Okay, so I don't want to even start this. Oh my God. So I guess maybe some background

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,920
would probably be appropriate to kind of explain where my current position is on like

17
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,520
God and stuff. So I was raised, I was raised Catholic, I was raised Roman Catholic.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,960
I went to church every Sunday and every holy day from when I was,

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:30,720
assumingly from when I was born until I was 16 years old. And at least four of those 16 years,

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,320
I was being forced to church against my will because I was not a fan of it.

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,880
Roman Catholicism, at least a brand that was taught in this house,

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,800
never really appeared much, appealed much to me, I should say. It was always kind of like the doom

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,280
and gloom fire and brimstone. You're gonna burn in hell if you don't follow everything like completely

24
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,760
100% by the book, you know, the book. My mom, who was the super religious one in the house,

25
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,720
would consistently say when we were kids that she loved us but loved God more and things like that.

26
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,560
My big problem as a kid, I first started really not being into the whole God thing because when

27
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
I was a little kid, I never really considered it much. It was just something we did, you know,

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,400
I never kind of sat down and examined the spiritual and philosophical nuances of the Catholic doctrine.

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,760
I don't think much 8 to 10 year olds really do that. I just kind of, you know, went to Sunday

30
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,840
school, went to CCD, went to church, knelt, stood, bowed, whatever we were supposed to,

31
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
had a little way for thingy and then, but I got donuts after the fact. We always get donuts

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,920
after the church would provide them or we'd go down the street to dunks and get a big fucking

33
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:06,160
donut and then I'd be happy happy. The problem is that it's on a Sunday and that's 50% of my weekend

34
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,920
as a kid when you're going to school and I don't want to wake up, I want to sleep in late, you know,

35
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,840
because I've already got up early the day before because I gotta fucking watch Saturday morning

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,120
cartoons, you know, fucking Pokemon and Spider-Man and I'm gonna mute my computer. But I just found

37
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,280
church to be an annoyance is really where my initial disdain for going to Mass came from. I just,

38
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
I didn't want to go because I was too busy playing video games, I wanted to sleep in and it was just,

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,080
it was annoying. It was an hourth long thing and my mom's like a parish hopper, at least she was

40
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,640
back when I was going to church. So we would go to different parishes all the time. There was a

41
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,560
small window of time where we went to Mass in Latin, which was really weird. So the whole Mass

42
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,560
was in Latin. Nobody had any idea it was being said. We just listened to a priest and the priest,

43
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
I guess when this is like, super hardcore is when you have the Mass in Latin is the priest

44
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,520
isn't even allowed to look at you like he has to look at the tabernacle and tabernacles where like,

45
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,480
you know, the Eucharist, like the holy like the body, but the little way for things are. So

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,760
didn't even get the eye contact, he would be saying the Mass to Latin away from us,

47
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,360
you would see wouldn't hear him very well, which didn't really matter because he was speaking Latin.

48
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,600
That was like an hour away. The Mass was an hour and a half. So you're burning three hours there

49
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,040
an hour and an hour and a half there and an hour back. Near the tail end, we would go a couple

50
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,560
towns over. So it would be like a half an hour there. Mass then half an hour back and because

51
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,720
my mom was super religious, we'd have to say a rosary in the car on the way in and back. So it

52
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:49,760
was it was it was like two hours of like prayer. And and we just was me and my sister at the time.

53
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,600
We neither of us were into it. Just just we didn't either of us. We were annoyed by it. It wasn't

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
it wasn't really ever sit down like I have issues with the doctrine. I just didn't like it. And

55
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,440
eventually at 16, my father, who used to be religious, got out of it and kind of has like

56
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,360
his own sort of like kind of like weird personal kind of pseudo spirituality. I approached him

57
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,200
because I had to go get confirmed and confirmation is like when you become an adult in the church

58
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,600
or whatever and the Christian or at least a Catholic thing, but you have to stay at church

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
like overnight. You got to like go in, do a bunch of prayer stuff, a bunch of like Jesus

60
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
activities and you got to stay overnight and you do something the next day and then you're

61
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,880
confirmed. I'm just like, No, no, I can't I can't do a whole weekend of church. And the problem was

62
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,080
like, you have to this is what the confirmation was when I first started to really kind of think

63
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,680
about the doctrine itself. I didn't just sit there and go through the motions because like they made

64
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,360
a big deal out of the fact that like the priests and the people who were talking about confirmation

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,240
are still going to CCD and crap at the time. They made a big deal about how like, this is a big

66
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,760
deal in this faith, you know, if to be confirmed means like you're you believe in all of this,

67
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,800
this is something really important to you and you're kind of like making a contract with God

68
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,560
like with your soul and all that stuff. And and that was my first way to call like, wait a minute,

69
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,720
none of this jives with me. I'm just going through the motions I'm being told to, you know,

70
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,520
and and it was the first time I really realized that like faith was a choice because I didn't

71
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,920
have a choice in my house and have a choice to go to church. I had even though I'd expressed the

72
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,640
fact that I wasn't really interested in it. It was always like a firm no, like you have to go

73
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,440
like this is this is you have to do this, you know, and I don't really blame my mom for that

74
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,600
because if she she's knee deep in the whole thing. And so she was worried about my eternal soul.

75
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,480
So I don't blame her for being adamant about it. But then you'd go to the priest and the church

76
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,360
and stuff and they would tell you that like, this is your choice. And if you don't want to do it,

77
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,120
you shouldn't do it. So that's when I started to sit back and really like think about things like,

78
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,400
wait a minute, none of this really resonates with me, you know, I've never it's never been

79
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,120
something that like I've been gung ho about, like I know the rules, I know the ins and outs,

80
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,680
like I've been to CCD and I've been to mass, I know all the stuff to achieve, you know, at least

81
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,040
at a basic level. But I don't know if I really believe it, I can recite it, but I don't know

82
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,120
if it resonates with me. And now you want me to go through this like really big, like, ritual,

83
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,560
that's a huge deal in this faith. And literally, it's to confirm your belief. And I have no faith

84
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,960
to confirm. So it felt really wrong to me just from a moral standpoint. I didn't because like

85
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,760
none of these people in church that I knew and I knew a couple people of this one and the pastor

86
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,520
at this church who went to was actually a really nice guy. I just felt bad going up there lying

87
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,320
to him, because he was a good guy. And it was just like, I don't I don't feel like this is right.

88
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
So I approached my dad, because he was the only one I could talk to about this and be like, Dad,

89
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,640
I don't really want to do this. Like this is an overnight thing. And they're trying to

90
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,440
fucking confirm. And I don't I don't think I can confirm without lying, like, should I lie in a

91
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,080
space of God, like that seems that seems wrong, even by their rules, you know, like this, I don't know.

92
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,960
Long story short, there's a huge fucking fight between me, my mom, my dad. I eventually got out

93
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:32,400
of going to confirmation. Stop going to church at 16. Big riff between me and my mom for a while,

94
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,240
kind of at this point, we've patched up. She's really not even as religious as used to be anymore.

95
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
It used to be bad, like I couldn't read Harry Potter, because it was the devil, I couldn't play

96
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,200
Magic the Gathering, because that was the devil. So she would guilt me into giving up my cards that

97
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,920
I'd like saved up my allowance to buy. And my Harry Potter books disappeared. And I never got to

98
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,800
read past the prisoner of Azkaban. So happened to this day. Very, very religious. So I got out of

99
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,600
it. And then when I was when I was no longer like in it, I started really kind of reflecting on all

100
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,120
the things that they were talking about. And it's like, I don't really think this is true, you know,

101
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,160
and it really it affected me for a long time. You know, my first relationship, my first girlfriend

102
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
suffered because like, I always felt guilty about having sex and stuff, because like, you know,

103
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,760
in the Christian faith, like, no sex before marriage and all this things. And it took a while

104
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,200
to kind of like, let myself forgive myself for it. And even to this day, there's always like

105
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
thoughts of just like, you know, like, what if I'm going to burn in hell? Like, I've been a very

106
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,160
bad Catholic, you know, I think I've been a good person from kind of like a universal morality

107
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,800
kind of standpoint, but in terms of like following the Catholic doctrine, I'm way off the fucking

108
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,720
beaten path. But my history, I could go into more detail. But that's not really the point of this

109
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,760
podcast. I'm already like 10 minutes in, I've kind of just barely set the stage. I want to talk more

110
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,680
about not any specific faiths. I want to talk about like more like, like, not heady, but basic

111
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,760
concepts. God in general, right now, I'm not really a big fan of labels for anything. But if

112
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,000
you want it to kind of like understand my perspective in like a few words, I guess the best description

113
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,240
right now would be an agnostic atheist. I don't believe in a God. I don't think there is a God

114
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,640
just just based on just my observations. And I know that's the complete opposite of God like

115
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:31,120
God is faith. So God defies observation. But the problem with that for me is that everything else

116
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,080
in the entire world is based on science and observable phenomena. And the fact that there is

117
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:45,680
like this big ruling kind of energy and system in place in Judeo Christian faith, and then you

118
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,440
have to take it on faith, it just seems so convenient that there's a loophole for everything. And this

119
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
was really the first thing that I really honed in on with Catholicism, especially because I was

120
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,680
most familiar with it, that really rubbed me the wrong way, is that it was so interesting how the

121
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,640
faith had a way to skirt any sort of questions you would have. There was no arguing it. It was

122
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,080
always some sort of weird kind of sidestep, faint dodge to any questions you had, you know,

123
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,760
that he works in mysterious ways line. And at the same time, it was always interesting to me to

124
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,880
consider how archaic religions were kind of seen as a joke and nothing more than entertainment.

125
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,320
And it was always a bizarre concept to think of like, well, you know, we look at like the Egyptian

126
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,400
gods like Horus and the Greek gods like like Zeus and stuff and their characters, their fictional

127
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,280
characters, we they're the same thing as like, you know, Harry Potter, or, or like Luke Skywalker

128
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,760
stuff, they're their fictional characters that can be like repurposed and reinterpreted and

129
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,080
used in fiction all the time. But Jesus Christ isn't Muhammad isn't you know, these characters

130
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,360
these these characters aren't characters, they're historical figures and all this stuff is true.

131
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,120
And it always just felt really odd like why is this we're so sure that this is bullshit,

132
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,480
but this isn't bullshit, but they both have just as much like realistic viability. The only difference

133
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,400
is that one is accepted as spirituality, and one has long been rejected. So it's 2000 years from

134
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,320
now is Jesus going to be you know, parodied and like, you know, you're going to have like

135
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,880
fucking like a God of war video game and VR where you fight Jesus or something instead of like the

136
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,480
Greek gods, like, like who knows like, like, that's the whole thing. It just it just seems

137
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,920
the faith seems very convenient. And it always it feels like Catholicism and its kind of current

138
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,840
incarnation was developed back in medieval times to control people. And to siphon wealth off of

139
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,520
people, you know, like you have to live in poverty, because that's going to make you yours is the

140
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,520
kingdom of heaven, the meek shall inherit the earth and all that stuff. So give us all your money,

141
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,920
give your money to the church, give it to God, and by extension, give it to us the clergy,

142
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,280
and you live in an abject poverty, but that's a good thing. And you'll be rewarded when you die,

143
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:15,680
you know, but who fucking knows? Because once you're dead, it doesn't fucking matter anymore. It's

144
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,480
just it just seems really convenient, you know, like, how can you and people make these I don't

145
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,520
want to like get too bogged down this because again, I'm still just kind of setting the groundwork

146
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,720
of of the Vatican is a great example of like, almost the hypocrisy of the faith, you know,

147
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,720
like how can you have a city like the Vatican, but your tenants say you have to live in poverty.

148
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,520
And I know the current Pope is kind of like, in fact, I am aware of that hypocrisy. But it's

149
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,680
just like the whole thing just collapses upon inspection. The point I really wanted to make

150
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,880
with this, though, is that I'm not an atheist. I'm an agnostic atheist. And I wonder if there are

151
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,520
anybody listening or anybody in general, I'm sure there is, but like, I've never really talked to

152
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,880
anybody who kind of thinks about God the way I do. And so much that I'm not an aggressive atheist,

153
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,680
you know, you kind of go online and you and you and you look up atheism. And there are these people

154
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,680
just like, fuck God, God is bullshit. God is stupid. God is a terrible idea. And you're invisible

155
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,720
man in the sky. And if you believe in God, you're an idiot. Science is all that matters. God is

156
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,920
nothing but fairy tales. And you're a dumb ass. And the atheist community quote unquote, or just

157
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,040
atheism, the most vocal atheists are people like that. And then you know, I'm there's probably

158
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,080
the every man atheists who just like, Yeah, I don't really believe in that. And they kind of go on

159
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,840
with their day. The reason I use a term agnostic atheist is because I don't think there's a God,

160
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,440
but I can't prove it. There's just as much proof that there isn't God, that there is God.

161
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,680
Because that's the whole thing that's kind of going back to the loophole thing I was talking

162
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,400
about God by definition is unprovable. So any any sort of tangible evidence we can have that would

163
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:09,680
prove God would just be dismissed by the religious as not God. It's like, Oh, we found we we figured

164
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,440
out the the existence like the the the existence of the the big bag we proved it we have proof.

165
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,320
And like this is what it is. And like this is what God was. And then just like but that's not God,

166
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:28,720
you know, like even even the fact that like someone could like, God could come down to earth,

167
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,480
have a physical embodiment, and not be any of the faiths that we've ever had, like, you know,

168
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,680
like, because who the fuck do we know what God is, if God is like this big immortal thing.

169
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,600
But let's say, let's say God is real, and God comes down to earth in a physical body,

170
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,280
and says, I'm God, I'm going to do all this crazy shit. And yeah, I'm God, like now you know,

171
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,080
you know, all you people been asking for proof of God, here I am. I think the atheists would still

172
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,000
be like, fuck you, you're not really God, you're just an imposter. And then the religious would be

173
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,280
like, no, God is this God is God is our faith. And then whatever you are, you're not true, you're

174
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,640
like, you're like the devil trying to trying to trick us, or, or you're not God, you're something

175
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,320
else, you know, by the fact that you're here physically, disproves that you're God, you know,

176
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,880
even I think the super religious who believe in things like the rapture, and like the second

177
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
coming itself, I think of the second coming actually happened, they probably wouldn't believe it was

178
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,280
the second coming, kind of got sidetracked. But that was a point I did want to make. My perspective

179
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,440
is that I'm an atheist under duress. And what I mean by that is that I don't hate God. I actually

180
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:44,320
would prefer if there was a God, I just can't find any reason in my heart of hearts to truly

181
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,720
believe that I would I because because if there is a God, everything has a purpose. I have a purpose.

182
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,760
My pain has a purpose. My suffering has a purpose. The suffering I see around me has a

183
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,600
everything is happening for a reason. Everything that's chaos instantly becomes order.

184
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,720
Everything is going completely according to plan. Nothing is wrong. Everything that's happening is

185
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,840
just this huge big like supernatural chess game that my tiny little mortal head can't understand.

186
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,680
But everything's fine. So I don't have to worry about it anymore. I just got to do me to the best

187
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I can and know that I'm being guided subconsciously by a divine entity that's going to lead me to

188
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,360
exactly the right place I need to go. That would be great. I would prefer that even if it would kind

189
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,600
of give up a bit of my autonomy almost, but the the idea that everything's good, that everything's

190
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:46,480
fine, that there's nothing wrong. I find that very appealing. I would love there to be. I'm

191
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,360
envious of people who have faith because they must be so much more sound of mind, so much more calm,

192
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,960
so much more collected because they believe, truly believe that there's a guy up there making

193
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,640
sure everything's okay. I would love that. But to go back to what I said about how faith seems so

194
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,120
convenient and how all these old dead faiths are just jokes now and that everything that

195
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,560
throughout human history that was once attributed to God has been shown to be a natural understandable

196
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:25,200
phenomenon. It just, I can't believe because it seems ridiculous given the circumstances

197
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,920
to continue to have belief. I would love to, but God itself, religion as a concept seems like

198
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,000
a desperate ploy by humanity to have something bigger, to have that control. I think everybody

199
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,640
wants what I just described to know that everything's okay. The difference between

200
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,440
the religious and myself is that they can find a way to buy into it. And as much as I want to buy

201
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:57,280
into it, I can't. So I'm an atheist under duress. I don't want to be an atheist. I just have no choice.

202
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,360
I don't know if other people feel like that. I don't know. I've never talked to anybody about

203
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,360
faith really all that much, but like even just in casual conversation, all the atheists are always

204
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,000
just like, fuck God. And I just, I can't get mad at religious people. Like they do some stupid

205
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,120
shit sometimes when they bring their, their, their faith into like politics and into like,

206
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,480
you know, people's lifestyle and shit like that. But just like when they're doing their own thing,

207
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,560
go for it. Like you're definitely more mentally healthy than I am. I'm on antidepressants seeing

208
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,920
a therapist suicidal because my life's falling apart. And I don't think I can't bring myself to

209
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:41,040
believe that there's any greater purpose than just some crazy bullshit genetic fucking cocktail

210
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,840
random chance fucking destroyed doomed universe around us. And there's nothing to live for. And

211
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,160
I have to build my own fucking destiny and my own fucking purpose with my own bare hands.

212
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,720
And every day I don't do it, just another day closer to my own death when I turn into nothing.

213
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,560
And that's it. The universe is big and vast. And I am pointless and have no purpose. And I

214
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,160
just have to sit here and try and forge my own purpose in this tiny little speck of existence

215
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,520
I have before I'm dead and everything is forgotten and no longer exists. There's no afterlife.

216
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,240
This is all I have. And right now it's really shitty. That's terrifying. I would love to have

217
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,920
the comfort of faith. I'm envious of people who have the comfort of faith, but I can't do it.

218
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,800
I don't know if I even want to, if I could, because I'm so kind of, I don't want to say logically,

219
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,880
but just like observationally grounded. But I can see the appeal. I can understand the appeal.

220
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,480
I'm envious of the appeal. So that's my thing on God. That was the big point I wanted to make.

221
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,640
This is a very ranty video. I would love to believe in God. Because I think there would be this kind

222
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,480
of like a placebo effect. There would be a placebo effect of if I was truly confident

223
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
that I was being guided by God or I had God on my side and that everything was happening for a

224
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:11,360
reason, I would probably self actualize better than I do now. Because the stresses and the

225
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,280
depression and the anxiety that I have right now would be at least partially lifted because of that

226
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,920
faith. So even if there was no God, just the belief in it would probably allow me to function on a

227
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,120
higher level than I am right now. Because my mind would be less burdened with all these heavy,

228
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:35,040
fucking crazy, deep philosophical ideas and the horribly bleak outlooks that my scientific

229
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,800
based perspective leads to with those questions. I don't know. That's really all I got. I kind

230
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,440
of want to talk about this for a while. Not exactly the most welds put together podcast,

231
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,760
very rambly. But there you go. Wanted to find about God? Wanted about God? Let me know in the

232
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,280
comments if you hated it. I'm Tommy Oliver. Thanks again to Michael for the wine. It was actually

233
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,040
a good choice. I like it. So if you want something really sweet that barely tastes like alcohol,

234
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:14,160
Magner's Irish Parasiter. Not a bad choice. Take it easy, guys.
