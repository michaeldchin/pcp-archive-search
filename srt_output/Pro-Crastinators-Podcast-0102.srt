00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, and let me just tell you today, if you thought

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,880
your grandfather dying was bad, if you thought your dog shooting himself was bad, you are

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,240
not prepared for this travesty of pure unbridled misery we have for you today on this Pro Crastinators

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,200
Podcast. We have a devilish person just sitting within our ranks right here. We'll get into

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,000
a moment here, but before we break out your bones, before we break out your back, and before

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,320
we break out your literal tomb that we have here for you today, let's go over the normal

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
people who you already know and you're so sick of hearing that you might as well unsubscribe

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,000
right fucking now. We have Nate, we have Nate, who cares? Toblerone! Yeah, you see that? Stuff

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,600
like that, stuff like that happens on the podcast. Your spine is the Toblerone. Okay, go on. We

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,280
have Ben. Minecraft. This is what you're getting into. This is today's episode, a hit bone. Yes,

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:12,480
it's me. We have Tom. Insert meme here. We have Mage. MC Mage, new channel. MC Mage. We have

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,520
fucking legendary YouTube and my personal hero. How the fuck did we get this guy? Fit MC! How do

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,520
you do, fellow kids? Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah! All of the fellow kids have MC in their username.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,880
Oh, okay, okay, okay. Let's get into backstory for this guy because this guy is fucking important.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,280
He's crucial to understanding this entire topic. MC is a fucking dope ass YouTube like

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,880
Minecrafter who I found myself and I was a fan of for like a year and a half and it was great and

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,560
it was fantastic and I can't like just by one day by chance he commented on a piece of the episode

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,320
and I blew my fucking mind and I had to like refresh the page like two times make sure I wasn't

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,960
fucking dreaming. Here he is. Would you like to describe what you do, Fit? I'm a mind man,

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:11,920
you see. I'm a block boy, as they say. For the past year and a half, I've been convincing people

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,120
that I'm actually a YouTuber but I'm not. I'm just a guy that holocausts children on a Minecraft

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:29,200
server. That's all I have. Hey, Fit, can I just, I'm just gonna address the elephant in the room,

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,000
just rip this band-aid right off. What are your feelings about mining at night? Oh, thank you.

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,680
There's gonna be some divisions right off the bat. Yeah. Your words will scorch the earth.

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,160
I mean, I love Minecraft but the community is just something you tolerate, you know.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,120
Oh, that's true. That's true. You know, when you live by anarchy, you can't combat at all. You

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,240
can't possibly hope to combat at all. Now, as I'm sure you realized, I'm sure you realized your

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,560
viewer, today's episode is indeed Minecraft. And of course, what is Minecraft? No one knows. We have

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,840
to consult the only good book that there feasibly is UrbanDiction.com. And let me tell you, I read

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,600
a few of these before the show to get myself immersed. Let me tell you that this is like

31
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,280
rivaling on NICE. These are the worst definitions we have to work with. So I'm just gonna read a

32
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,360
couple here. Minecraft, cheap and legal alternatives to drugs. This shit will sap your life away.

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,840
Minecraft, a kick-ass game that is being built slowly. The creator is notch and he programs the

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,000
game. Not anymore, bitch. I specifically like the words here. Person one, hey. Person two,

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,640
shut the fuck up. I'm playing Minecraft. There's like five different ones about it being a drug.

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:05,040
You get the point. It's a fucking video game. I went to knowyourmeme.com and that has a vastly

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,680
superior definition. It's just Minecraft is an indie Java video game created by Marcus Persson.

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,520
It is a sandbox mining slash building game which the players gather, blah, blah, blah,

39
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,040
various resources combine them, blah, blah, blah, developed a lot of online following, blah,

40
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
blah, blah, YouTube videos, blah, blah, blah. It was released during Minecraft, 2000.

41
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
Mate, shut the fuck up. I'm playing Minecraft.

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
A video game. The video game. We need to lay down some fucking groundwork here. We need to lay

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
down what the fuck is going on. We need to have some frame of reference going on and there's no

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,120
better frame of reference than how much of a new fag are you. What update did you guys join on?

45
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Oh, Jesus. If I'm not mistaken, you literally first played Minecraft on a stream, right?

46
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,040
If you go into... Yeah, what channel can they find that video on? Where do those exist now?

47
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,000
Given Gaming, somewhere. One of the Minecraft streams there, Nate, tries to play Minecraft

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,440
and he learns about Redstone and he's really excited about various very mundane things and I

49
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,680
laugh at him. That's right. That was like a year ago or something. Yeah, fucking incredible. I have no

50
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,600
idea what that was. That was easily... That was a 1.10 or... Something like that.

51
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:26,560
It was pretty hilarious because I am a noob. I'm a Minecraft weakling and even I was rolling my

52
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
eyes at the things Nate found to be like, huh, it's really interesting how mine can do this and

53
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm like, where have you been? It's 2017. When I learned that you could put obsidian in a block

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,800
and spark it with a flame and turn it into a portal, it literally devastated my soul on a

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:51,040
deep, fundamental level. I remember the specific update I joined on. It was beta 1.6 when they

56
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:59,440
added dogs and I played exclusively within a browser. I played only Minecraft in a browser,

57
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,520
which is extremely rampant at the time. You could just upload the files of Minecraft.

58
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait. A browser on your computer? Yeah, yeah. Well, hang on, I don't understand.

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,480
How did you do that? This is an exclusively 3DS game, as I understand it, and I was going to say

60
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,280
how impressive it was that all this stuff on 2B2T was built on a 3DS. That's really, you know,

61
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,840
that's impressive. That's impressive stuff. I think you're thinking of the mobile hit smash

62
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,040
game, Jurassic Park Alive, where you can go and run across your own GTS world and capture dinosaurs.

63
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,760
That's fine. Yeah, and I remember, I remember, I remember my first moments playing Minecraft

64
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,200
very vividly because it was like a nightmare. It was like a real-life nightmare where I joined

65
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,400
and then it turned night time and then just a skeleton appeared in my peripheral and I had no

66
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,920
idea there were monsters or that like night time was a feature. I was just walking around just

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,880
hanging out and then there were very, it was terrifying. It was fucking terrifying and I'll

68
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,600
never, I'll never forgive you, Notch. I'll never fucking forgive you.

69
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,640
I, I think I started playing Minecraft in a browser as well. I think I was in college or

70
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,560
something and I just like fucked around with it and I made no headway and I found it frustrating

71
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,480
and opaque, so I gave up really quick. And then like ever, like once or twice, like a friend of

72
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,960
mine would be like, hey, I play Minecraft, join my server, and then I would jump in for a little

73
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,880
bit, fuck around for like a day, and then give up and I'll play it again for like two years.

74
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,560
I played on, I played on Hippo's server for a little while, a while back, before I think the

75
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
server is dead now, but I made, I was very proud of myself. I made a little hut. I just like built

76
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,280
a little stone hut right next to Hippo's aquatic base and I hope it's still there. Sometimes I

77
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,920
think about it like, man, I hope that that little hut didn't get destroyed and taken apart for its

78
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,480
pieces. But I remember the one time that I almost was in danger of getting into Minecraft legit,

79
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,920
it was during the pony day. The extreme perilous danger that is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The sort

80
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,680
of Damocles was almost whatever. It was during the pony days when we were, it was in the, it was in

81
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:14,720
the heyday of the torrent of quality content that was t-bat plays. Oh no! I spent, no listen,

82
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,800
okay, because, because that was around the time that I had just gotten into a Shadow of Israfel

83
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,600
in the Yogscast and I had watched all of Shadow of Israfel and thought that it was the coolest

84
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,880
thing ever. Was it going to be those embarrassing podcasts we put up early?

85
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:39,120
Wait, shut up. So I, I spent like weeks, I spent like weeks trying to figure out a way

86
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,040
to get a modded version of Minecraft where we could be ponies, we could be phantom horn and keg

87
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,480
standard, and I thought that we could do like a, like a, like a Shadow of Israfel kind of thing.

88
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,080
I'm having, I'm having the flash, I'm having the key, so I'm slaying for views.

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,760
If I tried to Google and like there were some like pony mods of Minecraft, but they sucked

90
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,280
and like they didn't, I don't know, and I couldn't figure out how to make it work.

91
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,720
Do you remember? Oh yeah, it was the summer of 2010. I was just your typical college broham

92
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,120
and I was browsing V on 4chan and that's back when Notch himself was actually advertising on V.

93
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,440
I remember those days. Yeah, so he was posting some threads, so I decided to check the game out

94
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
and like I thought it was pretty sweet. I'd never played anything like it before.

95
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,240
I thought it was awesome. And then here I am, eight years later, God, literally the most powerful

96
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
Minecraft player of all time. Making that sweet bank.

97
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah. Holy shit. Oh my God, the return investment on that must be fucking insane.

98
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,840
It's because you're paying for a beta and stuff, you know, so yeah.

99
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,240
How much does Minecraft cost nowadays? $26.95. I just bought it. I think I paid $20 for it.

100
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,360
Yeah. Why is the price going up as opposed to down? I mean like, you know, I guess with the

101
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
update. Well, I think it's probably because when Microsoft bought it, they're like, hey guys,

102
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
let's jack this price up a little bit. I guess so. Well, whatever, whatever.

103
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,160
Also inflation question mark? Let's not open that. Let's not bring your fetishes into the

104
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:32,400
equation right now. Mage, when did you get into Minecraft? Oh gosh, when was Minecraft created

105
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:39,600
exactly? Like 2008, 2008? It went real in 2011. Because like, I think that's around the time I

106
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,240
got into it, 10 maybe, 2010, maybe nine, I'm not sure, because I remember a friend got it for me

107
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,960
because there was no way for me to buy it at that point. I was still living in no Athenian, no credit

108
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:57,920
cards, whatever. And yeah, he got it for me. It was like $17 ish at that time. And yeah,

109
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,960
and that's how I got into it. I remember I was the only one who could figure out how to host a

110
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,320
gosh darn Minecraft server with, what's that program? I hate that program. What's it called?

111
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,560
Windows Movie Maker. No, no, it was like...

112
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,280
Mine's over.

113
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,560
Hamachi, there we go.

114
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,600
I host my Minecraft server on my TI-83 calculator.

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,640
Yes. Got to launch that Mirage OS first.

116
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,960
Guys, no, no, no, no, guys, do you know Hamachi?

117
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I try to set that up. Little did I do, it was way more complicated than just

118
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,400
doing it normally.

119
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,960
Back then, yeah, Hamachi was like the only way you could really do it, and it was awful,

120
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,560
and I was the only one who could figure it out.

121
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,840
I tried fucking with Hamachi to post brutal doom with some of my friends, like to play

122
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,160
cooperative online, and that was hell on earth, and I hate it.

123
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm never touching how much you can get no more.

124
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,240
Well, well, Mirage, that's interesting to know when you got into Minecraft,

125
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,360
but when did you then upgrade your life from Minecraft into one of the many shittier version

126
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,240
clones that you love so dearly?

127
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
Yeah, that's shitty, oh my gosh.

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,680
I think I've played one with you. It was almost like a weird hybrid, like,

129
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,040
terraria Minecraft weird fantasy fucking...

130
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,840
Wait, pets.

131
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
Oh, yeah, like pets.

132
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,080
It was just the pets.

133
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,400
And Mirage, aren't you also big into paladins?

134
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,360
You were the one telling me I was trying to get into paladins.

135
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,080
Oh my god!

136
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,200
No, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't like paladins anymore.

137
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,520
They changed the name.

138
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,760
Mirage, are you the one into angry birds?

139
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,480
Always talking about angry birds this and angry birds that.

140
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,600
I'm frankly sick of hearing about it.

141
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,480
Are you the person who's always trying to advertise Jurassic Park alive or all my friends?

142
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,720
That's a classic. A classic is a classic, my dude.

143
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,000
You guys need to stop.

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,160
Mirage, tell us about some of the many fine Minecraft alternatives out there.

145
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,440
Creative versus good.

146
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,160
I mean, like, vanilla, like in comparison to vanilla Minecraft, I much prefer great

147
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,360
gradeverse. It's a lot prettier looking, at least for me.

148
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,120
I like the building aspect. I like the pets I can have.

149
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
Like, every single creature can be turned into a pet and I love that.

150
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,800
It's a favorite thing to do.

151
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,120
And I honestly don't know how to sell the game.

152
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
Just like, check it out. It's free. There we go.

153
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
That's the best seller.

154
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
That's a good one.

155
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
It's Minecraft, but free.

156
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,240
That's pretty good.

157
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,720
That's pretty good.

158
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
That's pretty good.

159
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Minecraft, but does everything Minecraft can do, but better than for free.

160
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
But better than for free.

161
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,720
Yeah.

162
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,960
And it can host servers so easily, you just make a world and like you host it and there you go.

163
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,720
It's up forever and everyone can join.

164
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,080
Do you offline or online?

165
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,760
You don't have to host it yourself.

166
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,960
I mean, you can host the servers really easily, but you know, there's no one to play with.

167
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,040
You can play it.

168
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
Hello.

169
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
All right. Who else we got?

170
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,160
Tom.

171
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
Tom, what did you first play the game?

172
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,520
Yeah. Oh God.

173
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,200
So I first played Minecraft in 2014.

174
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,560
And I was playing...

175
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
All these fucking new fags. Jesus Christ.

176
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,280
I started in 10, so...

177
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,200
So I, my friends were like,

178
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,720
yo, we're going to play Minecraft.

179
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,840
Do you want to play with us?

180
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,120
And I'm like, I've never played Minecraft in my life.

181
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,680
And they're like, well, you need to fix that immediately.

182
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
And I was like, uh, fuck.

183
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,280
So they made me buy Minecraft for $20 when it was 20 bucks, which sucked.

184
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,680
We made you a fucking knife point.

185
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,520
Yeah, they're like, dude, you're being...

186
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,440
But we're going to stream, we're going to play weekly.

187
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,000
It's going to be a thing.

188
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,720
It's going to be awesome.

189
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,760
And you're going to be part of it.

190
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,400
Like, okay.

191
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,800
So I started playing Minecraft.

192
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
And those friends would go on to become the Yogscast.

193
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,560
If only, yes.

194
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,120
Exactly.

195
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, oh, they wanted to get you in.

196
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
Tom, you're like, no, I don't see a future in this.

197
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,480
I don't think it's going to go anywhere.

198
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
They're like, well, suit yourself, dude.

199
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,840
My business savvy continues to be impeccable.

200
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,400
So we were going to play, and I was very confused when I started playing the game,

201
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,880
because I'm like, why is everything so confusing?

202
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
Like, why does everything look so shit?

203
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
And they were just like, no, that's like...

204
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:44,960
They're like, that's like...

205
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
This is not even real life.

206
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,040
Like, what the hell?

207
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,920
What are these pixels?

208
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,000
They're like, no, like, no, dude, that's the aesthetic.

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm like, but like, there's like these weird, just like,

210
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
everything's so patchy and weird.

211
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,120
I don't understand.

212
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,520
And we were playing for like two hours.

213
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,960
And I was just very confused.

214
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,400
We learned to find out later that there was like a glitch with my computer,

215
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,240
and like half the textures weren't displaying.

216
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
And that's why I was so utterly bamboozled.

217
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
That's why everything looked...

218
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,560
Because I knew it was supposed to look shit,

219
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,240
but I'm like, is it supposed to look this shit?

220
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Like half the textures just weren't loading.

221
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,160
So they're just like, you just have to combine these two things.

222
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
And I'm just like, but they look the same.

223
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
And they're like, what are you, retarded?

224
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm like, I guess.

225
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,240
So that was my one and only experience with Minecraft,

226
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,080
because I could never get it to work my computer.

227
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,120
And I haven't tried since.

228
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,680
And I guess I still have a license floating around somewhere,

229
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,760
but I don't even know how I would access it at this point.

230
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,840
What kind of computer do you have,

231
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,320
where you can't fucking run Minecraft?

232
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,280
Well, that's the thing.

233
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,120
The computer was a quad-core i7, a GeForce GTX,

234
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,640
like 650 at the time, like 16 gigs of RAM.

235
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,480
It should have crushed Minecraft,

236
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,400
but no, it was not meant to be.

237
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,880
How bizarre.

238
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,840
How mistake.

239
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,280
Hey, remember when we got into Terraria for a little while there?

240
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,360
Terraria is like Minecraft, but just better.

241
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,040
That's, there you go.

242
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,600
There you go.

243
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,080
Better than for 9.99.

244
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,760
I'll just say, let's just do the Terraria real quick.

245
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,720
Terraria is just 2D, and it's more fun to play.

246
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
At least it was the vanilla Terraria.

247
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,280
It's more of a game game.

248
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,320
That's what I'm trying to say.

249
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,200
That's what I'm trying to say.

250
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,400
It's more of a game, but that's fine.

251
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Okay, whatever.

252
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,240
Let's get this right one later.

253
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,280
I don't like it.

254
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,200
Wait, do we hear about Gibbs Origins?

255
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

256
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,400
Oh, yeah.

257
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,080
I saw Minecraft over my little brother's shoulder.

258
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,520
He was playing the Alpha, and he was putting cobblestone blocks around,

259
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,560
and I was like, what's that?

260
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,000
And he said, it's Minecraft.

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,640
You should get it.

262
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,760
It's really fun.

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,480
You can build.

264
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
And I'm like, oh, okay, yeah.

265
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,920
Look, you know, brushing it off, because, you know,

266
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
my little brother is playing it.

267
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
Therefore, I must be gay, so I'm not going to get into this.

268
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,080
Then I continue to see it, and I'm like, you know what?

269
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
That looks pretty fun.

270
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,880
And I could hear the Minecraft music,

271
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,840
because that was from an era where people, you know,

272
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,240
they still just listened to the music in the game.

273
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,280
And I got it in the beta, and I played it forever,

274
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,040
and I love it.

275
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,440
And it's my favorite thing, and I still love it.

276
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,480
And my biggest, like, Minecraft YouTube thing

277
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,360
was always X's Adventures in Minecraft.

278
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,680
That really got me into, like, do you remember that?

279
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,720
Me too.

280
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
Me fucking too.

281
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,360
Dude, I remember X-Base.

282
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,040
I remember fucking X's Adventure.

283
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,840
I love fucking X's Adventure.

284
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,600
X's Adventures in Minecraft.

285
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,360
I had already been following him,

286
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,960
because he made, like, World of Warcraft,

287
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,760
like, how-to-tank videos, and I was like, I need to know that.

288
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,720
And I just liked the way he talked and his voice.

289
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,560
And then his Minecraft series started,

290
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,840
and I was like, you know, he was in there on the ground floor,

291
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,640
but he sort of didn't blow up because of Minecraft,

292
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,760
unfortunately.

293
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,600
But his, like, journey through exploring Minecraft

294
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,160
in the early days and figuring stuff out and building X-Base,

295
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
it was... it is my favorite.

296
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,720
Hey, I just want to...

297
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,320
Starting to interrupt, I just want to let you know,

298
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,760
I just paid for...

299
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,000
I've been stealing Minecraft for a very long time.

300
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Before this stream, I decided I would finally buy it.

301
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,080
I have just logged in to 2B2T for the very first time,

302
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,960
and looking around at this gigantic hellscape,

303
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,440
and it is... I see Swastikas.

304
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
I see Rachel Slurs.

305
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,400
Should we transition?

306
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
Should fit give us the rundown of 2B2T?

307
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Well, let's take a little...

308
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,960
I feel like we all...

309
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,040
We can all get into the nitty-gritty of what we like about Minecraft.

310
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,360
I think it's time to transition over to Minecraft Server,

311
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,480
because that's where I spent the bulk of my time.

312
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
It's time to transition to Minecraft.

313
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,280
We've been waiting for this for a while.

314
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,400
I think all of us can agree that Minecraft Servers

316
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
is where we spend most of our time.

317
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,560
I'm not going to play some fucking shitty ass single-player game.

318
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,960
I love the single-player of Minecraft.

319
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,760
There's a single-player game?

320
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,400
It is so fun.

321
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,760
What the fuck?

322
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
But multiplayer is obviously where we go,

323
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
and Servers are fucking great.

324
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,920
I spend most of my time.

325
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,160
And there's very one particular server

326
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,720
that my friend Mark showed me many moons ago

327
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,840
called 2Builders2Tools.org.

328
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,320
And that's why I found this boy here, Finn MC.

329
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
Finn MC, I think you are like a professor.

330
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
You have like a PhD in this server.

331
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,920
So please, please explain it to us in the way that you do.

332
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,560
Okay.

333
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,040
Well, if there's any listeners that are not too familiar with Minecraft,

334
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,640
basically 90% of players, if you play through single-player,

335
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,800
you're going to have the same kind of experience.

336
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,200
You're going to build a base, make some food for yourself,

337
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,120
and then eventually kill the dragon.

338
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,920
Well, he has 90% of single-player for most people.

339
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,440
But when you get to multiplayer servers, there's a no pun intended.

340
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,400
There's a huge spectrum of different multiplayer servers

341
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,120
you can play on.

342
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,080
On the one hand, you've got like the kid-friendly mini-game servers

343
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
where you're like playing with your friends

344
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,240
and talking about it the next day at school.

345
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
And then you've got my side, all right.

346
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,200
Yeah.

347
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
The side that is actually really-

349
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,040
The heavier side of the spectrum, if you will.

350
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,440
So for those of you that don't know,

351
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,680
2Builders2Tools or 2B2T.org is the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft.

352
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,240
And I believe the second oldest server overall.

353
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,880
And it's-

354
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Holy shit.

355
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,000
It's a server that has no rules, which means you can hack,

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
you can cheat, you can steal.

357
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,920
There's no censorship.

358
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
There's no admins at all.

359
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,000
It's just survival Minecraft.

360
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,320
But the map is like almost eight years old at this point.

361
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,480
And it is just insane.

362
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,560
Well, hey, I've got a question fit.

363
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,320
I mean, okay, so if that's the case, how did they make money off of it?

364
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
I mean, we got how someone's got to be-

365
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
If there's no profit motive, why would anyone ever be interested

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,920
in doing anything?

367
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,640
I don't understand.

368
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,080
Please explain.

369
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,800
Please explain.

370
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,840
Oh, yeah.

371
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,080
Well, for the first few years of the server, I mean, it was a very small server.

372
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,680
I'd say the most players that ever had, like as an active player base,

373
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,040
was about 100.

374
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,840
And the entire server ran off player donations.

375
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,560
The admin of 2B2T, his name is Housemaster.

376
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,640
He's this really mysterious guy that no one really knows much about,

377
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,520
except that he's from Sweden.

378
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
He never intervenes and it only will do it on the most extreme circumstances.

379
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,920
He's just this like bizarre shadow figure that like, I don't,

380
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,840
like how many people have ever even seen him, like in the world?

381
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,160
I have, I've seen a like a small leaked picture of him and that's about it.

382
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
Just a picture of the gray.

383
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,960
He's just like, he's like Bigfoot.

384
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
You know, I'm sorry to interrupt again, but I'm just,

385
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
I am currently exploring 2B2T for the first time here.

386
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,080
I've walked up to a skybridge and there was just a towering wall of lava

387
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,400
as far as the eye can see on either side.

388
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,640
That's just, it's impenetrable.

389
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,520
I have to go back.

390
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,320
I have to kill myself.

391
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,680
Fascinating.

392
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,840
You're going through the stereotypical first night on 2B2T.

393
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,720
You're a new player.

394
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,800
I guarantee you, just wait a couple minutes.

395
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,320
Someone will be by in Diamond Armor, running 100 miles an hour.

396
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,800
I can't wait to get demolished instantly.

397
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,000
I really look forward to it.

398
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,840
Oh, that sounds great.

399
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,920
Nate, I want, it needs to sink in for you.

400
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,880
You are not playing against like the best Minecraft server.

401
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,480
Like, you know, you don't, like, they have Diamond Armor fully enchanted.

402
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,840
That's not the problem here.

403
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,680
The problem is speed hacks and like one of the hills and like running across the map

404
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,960
at like insane speeds where you can't even fucking process them.

405
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,320
Oh, and when you go into the nether, like, like, like people will just be like

406
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,880
right up to you with fucking beds placed in the middle of your sleeping

407
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,800
and like just blowing you up instantaneously.

408
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,760
Well, listen, Munchie, I'm sure, I'm sure that's going to be really effective,

409
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,680
but I've got my own life hack right here.

410
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
No, the steak weed, bro.

411
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm going to fucking blitz the fuck out.

412
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,280
Nobody can keep up with me.

413
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,560
Okay, that's, that's my joke.

414
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,200
I do weed.

415
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,120
The only way to like see speed hacks properly is to smoke weed.

416
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,520
That's slow down time.

417
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,000
That's right.

418
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,800
My viewers, I get this and I've explained 2B2T to many people before

419
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
and they've seen less than press than they should be.

420
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,400
So I just want to hammer this home for the normies in the audience.

421
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
You may be thinking, what's the deal?

422
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,560
Eight years?

423
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,200
That's fine.

424
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
I'm more than eight years old.

425
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,120
That's fine.

426
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,280
Okay, but you have to understand this.

427
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,640
Minecraft is a game where you can like, you can destroy and you can,

428
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,920
you can build anything.

429
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,400
You have complete like control to like tear form your reality.

430
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,600
And because it's no rules, you can tear form anything.

431
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,320
So just imagine the abuse that these four chain freaks and geeks have done

432
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,080
to not just the spawn area.

433
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
The spawn area's got the worst, obviously,

434
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,040
but just like for millions upon millions of block outwards from spawn,

435
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,920
the amount of griefing and like dynamite and just fucking unholy concoction

436
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,000
see people have made over the course of eight fucking years.

437
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,680
It's fucking unbelievable.

438
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,520
There are entire there.

439
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,560
My favorite thing about about fucking 2B2T is because it's obviously like a cruel wasteland

440
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,800
where you'll get fucking sodomized for asking for a nickel.

441
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,160
And that's just the way things are.

442
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Oh God, I got to the top of staircase.

443
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,520
There was an intentional hole.

444
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
You know, dude, exactly, exactly.

445
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,520
But my favorite thing is like there are people dedicated to just helping out new fags.

446
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,040
And the two things that are the most evident of that are near spawn,

447
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,920
there are just like patches of watermelon you pick up because

448
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,000
watermelons are the new fag food.

449
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,120
And my favorite thing are the never highways.

450
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,280
There there are near the top of the ceiling of in the nether.

451
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,360
There are just like like two by two hallways that stretch out for like thousands upon

452
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,000
thousands of millions of blocks that stretch out farther than you could ever like hope to

453
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
walk in a single set, you know, session.

454
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,160
And they will help you get away from spawn as fast as you can.

455
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
And those are like maintained.

456
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,000
Like there are there are people who like intentionally like,

457
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,480
you know, try and keep up the appearance of those and try and fix them

458
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,920
when people try and destroy them.

459
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,560
It's great.

460
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:02,960
It's great.

461
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,760
It's a great community.

462
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,280
It's totally crazy.

463
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah, I mean, we even have it to the point where each cardinal direction,

464
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,200
if you're on the nether highway, it goes to the world border.

465
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Millie.

466
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,680
Oh my god.

467
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
I haven't played in a while, but I remember they were working in that when I got this.

468
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,760
This is fascinating to me.

469
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,520
Like I'm not super interested in Minecraft as a game per se.

470
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,000
Maybe I just haven't tried it enough, you know, with like working graphics,

471
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,320
but like just the concept of there's a decade of just like culture and society and just like

472
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,880
like custom built around like like a virtual space and how it's just like slowly evolving

473
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,240
and the fact that like it's being done because it's different than something like World of

474
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
Warcraft where like, you know, people have been playing forever, but like that's like a static

475
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,000
world where like this is just like everything is entirely user generated and like susceptible

476
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
to be destroyed at a moment's notice.

477
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,960
And there's just like this undercurrent of just like some like underlying knowledge

478
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
that like the people who've been there forever just kind of understand.

479
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,000
It blows my mind.

480
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,640
It's so cool.

481
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,240
I just want to like listen to it forever.

482
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
When I first heard about it, it really, I haven't like looked into this either,

483
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,920
but like Eve online, as I understand it, has a completely organically generated like gigantic

484
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,280
factional system divided between like two huge organizations.

485
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,760
And that's just such a fascinating thing that that can exist in these virtual spaces

486
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,840
we've created and people like really give a shit about it and adhere to it and have

487
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,160
these kind of in groups that are completely separate from the real world.

488
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,360
They're only virtual dope, fucking dope.

489
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,720
Fit, I have a question.

490
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,360
How do you feel?

491
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
What are your thoughts on Dwarf Fortress?

492
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,880
Oh man, I have never actually played it, but I've seen it being played and I'm just like,

493
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
this game is not for me.

494
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
I can't, it's like fun losing, right?

495
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,160
That's the motto.

496
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,720
Like it's fun to lose.

497
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,760
Yeah, losing is fun.

498
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,560
Losing is fun.

499
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
I mean, I'm not great at Dwarf Fortress, but I've played, I've played some of it.

500
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,600
And all right, so since Munchy introduced me to your channel this past a little while ago,

501
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,840
I've listened to a bunch of your videos, especially like the ones that go into like,

502
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,040
you know, like the history and the lore of the server and stuff.

503
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,400
And listening to like, listening to like an account of like how like,

504
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,280
you know, the wars played out or, you know, how all these different like characters or people

505
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,680
had effects on the culture or whatever, it reminds me of something that I really like

506
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,560
about Dwarf Fortress, which I like even more than playing it.

507
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,400
Like, I really like listening to or like reading like, like stories of like,

508
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,280
how like a world played out and like how a Dwarven society fell.

509
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Just like a procedurally generated like, story of like a world and stuff.

510
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,200
And like, the like a blow by blow of like how things, how things progressed in like a bizarre way.

511
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:50,080
Now, I don't, don't take this the wrong way, but bit to be to whatever the fuck this thing

512
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,720
his name is like, he fucking up is literally the Dark Souls of Minecraft.

513
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,560
Well, I'm sure that a lot of servers are like that.

514
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,000
But like, as I was watching your lore videos, I just kept thinking that this world is exactly

515
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,400
like what a Dark Souls setting is like.

516
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,240
It's like a ruined world where there are pockets of civilization that still exist,

517
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
and you can seek them out and find them.

518
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,880
And basically the fun of it is like exploring the lore and finding out what transpired here

519
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,160
to make the world into the twisted shell of itself that it is now.

520
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,760
And you're basically the Vati Vidya of B2BT.

521
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,600
Whatever the fuck it is.

522
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,200
What is the name of the server?

523
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,800
I don't know any of those.

524
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,680
Okay. Well, point is it's fucking awesome.

525
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,120
And it's super cool.

526
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,160
And it is Dark Souls.

527
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,200
And I like Dark Souls.

528
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,080
Please, I implore you all check out Fitzchannels.

529
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,520
He has a bunch of playlists.

530
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,440
He doesn't just do 2B2D, he does, you know, he does other stuff now.

531
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,200
But how I got into him, and I think a lot of people did, was 2B2D.

532
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,440
And they're fucking iconic videos.

533
00:28:51,440 --> 00:29:00,640
I especially love, my absolute favorite is of course the Pop Bob video and the Valley of Wheat video.

534
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
I like the history of the super weapons.

535
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,400
That was definitely, my favorite by far of the ones I watched was the finally reaching the border wall.

536
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,920
That video legitimately brought me to tears.

537
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,160
Because it was so emotional and like seeing all these people, because like, okay guys,

538
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,680
just so you understand, it is over four million blocks or something.

539
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,440
It might have been four in the ether to get all the way into the final border of the server.

540
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,400
And to get there requires a month, months long real world investment of every day,

541
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,800
walking there with all the most biggest enhancements for speeds you can get.

542
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,320
And when you finally get there, and there's all these people waiting for you specifically fit

543
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,320
to have a celebration about you, this guy that they like love and respect.

544
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,920
All these people were willing to put in all this work to get all the way out there

545
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,760
in order to have a fucking party for you at this landmark event of you reaching the border wall.

546
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
That was like brotherhood.

547
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
It's fucking brotherhoods with that.

548
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,560
Nate, you know, that's gonna be every single day for Mexicans when they reach the border wall.

549
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Brotherhood.

550
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
Walking across, you know, Vipitana, Patalinsa.

551
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
That's what they're gonna have every single day.

552
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
Incredible.

553
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,560
Just another great reason to build that wall.

554
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,680
Just another great one.

555
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,280
So that they could have that emotional fulfillment when they finally reach it.

556
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,040
We want to be able to let them nether orb hack past the border wall temporarily

557
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,560
and unlock their camera and see what's going on on the other side of that wall.

558
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
You know, why rob them of the joy?

559
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
We can't. We can't do it.

560
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Yeah, so I mean, I think I'm the only one here besides Nate very recently who's actually played on 2P2T.

561
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,560
And I found out about it through a friend.

562
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,560
And we, like, here's how the 2P2T experience has gone for me.

563
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Whereas, like, I'll join Spawn. I'll immediately be like, I'll have like whiplash.

564
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Because this is unlike any other Minecraft server I've ever been in.

565
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Like, you know, you'll have that pussy shit where like Spawn is like made out of Obsidian.

566
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Like, hardcoded where you can't destroy Spawn.

567
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:12,560
This, you spawn in some like random fucking cobblestone tower, like 50 feet into the fucking sky.

568
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
With like lava surrounding all the sides.

569
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,560
And then, like, if you're lucky, like I was, your friend will show up

570
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,560
and it is fucking fully enchanted diamond armor, like on his horse.

571
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,560
And be like, hey, like, I've come to get you. We have to get out of here fast.

572
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,560
I've brought you watermelon. We have to run before they get us.

573
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,560
So, like, running through the night in this like fucking war-torn countryside,

574
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,560
you have to like search for the nearest Nether portal.

575
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Like, hopefully your friend has brought Flint and like get it as fast as you can.

576
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,560
You have to vaid all these fucking bedbombing terrorists.

577
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Like, like, like run a thousand miles in this fucking scorched hellhole.

578
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,560
And like hopping between Nether portals so you can like raid various bases on your way there so you can get supplies.

579
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Because God knows, like, like he doesn't have the supplies, they can carry two people.

580
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,560
And finally you get you, finally you get to the base.

581
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,560
And his base, like, was like built at the top of this, like, like, how do I describe it?

582
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Like, like, like a chunk loading wrong.

583
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,560
So it was just like ocean and then like very, like, like, hardly cut.

584
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Just there was earth now, like, like, like low chud, uh, a chunk loading error.

585
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,560
And it was being like a giant, like, like Jerusalem, like, like cathedral type building.

586
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,560
It was fucking insane. It was absolutely fucking insane.

587
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:34,560
And, and oh my God, the feeling that you get, the feeling that you get when you fucking, when you see another player tag

588
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
and you can't tell who it is yet.

589
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Oh, you don't know it's friend or foe.

590
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Yeah, you just know someone's there.

591
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,560
And you instantly crouch, but it doesn't even matter because they all have like, like, tag, like trackers.

592
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,560
We can obviously tell where you are, but you just instantly crouch and you start to sweat in real life

593
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,560
and fear for your Minecraft possessions more than you've ever feared for your real life possessions.

594
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Your entire fucking life.

595
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,560
This sounds fun. We should, we should definitely do like a procrastinator's like all go on the server at once and try to survive.

596
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,560
That's a slippery slope, Pipo. That's how you, that's how you get a new fag invasion.

597
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:16,560
That's how you get a, that's how you pollute and, you know, cancerize the society. That's a slippery slope.

598
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Well, I guess there's an argument to be made that, uh, not to be mean or anything,

599
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,560
but I suppose you probably get a lot of detractors, you know, of the hardcore people, which I can sympathize with,

600
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:32,560
who aren't too fond of you popularizing, uh, fun, you know, like servers that they don't so much want the new fags to be exploring.

601
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,560
But, you know, you're a historian as I see it.

602
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,560
And so everything you've done is like a chronicling of the events here.

603
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
So, I mean, how do you deal with that?

604
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,560
What do you say to people who criticize it for that, if you even get that?

605
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Well, it's, you know, it's totally understandable because 2B2T was born from 4chan culture,

606
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,560
which is very anti anything popular.

607
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Yeah.

608
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Secret clubs.

609
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,560
A lot of, yeah, it's like a secret club. So when a lot of players come on,

610
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,560
they try and act cool by saying like, oh, I hate YouTubers. I hate this, blah, blah.

611
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,560
But at the end of the day, whenever a YouTuber does invade, kind of like what's going on right now,

612
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,560
it's some of the most fun us old players have just by going to spawn and killing all these new players.

613
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Makes sense.

614
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Marsha was talking about bed bombing earlier, if you don't know.

615
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,560
So basically, in normal Minecraft, you fight with a sword and a shield and a bow.

616
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,560
On 2B2T, you fight with beds and end crystals.

617
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Because since everyone is walking around in full protection for armor stacked,

618
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,560
and also they have what's called a totem of undying,

619
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,560
just like a fairy in a bottle from Zelda if you die and bring you back to life,

620
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,560
the only way to kill someone is to blow up a bed or a crystal next to them

621
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,560
and just deplete their totems until they are fully out.

622
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,560
It's just, I still have PTSD from the war of all these explosions going on around me.

623
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,560
And it's like whenever an eight year old comes up to me to start talking about Minecraft,

624
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
like I like pigs and stuff.

625
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,560
I just start thinking of my time in the trenches and all those explosions going on.

626
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
The bed bomb's going up left and right.

627
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,560
You haven't seen the shit that I've seen.

628
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Have you been able to sleep in a bed after that?

629
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,560
He exclusively can sleep in race car beds because he has no negative associations with those.

630
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Oh my god, there are so many times where I've seen someone race by in the nether

631
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:43,560
and I knew that my time was numbered and I had to reach fucking safety immediately.

632
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Oh my god, because the nether highways are such tight corridors,

633
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:56,560
you'll just see an intersection up ahead but you can't properly see it.

634
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,560
So just imagine you're walking on this tight corridor, there's an intersection coming up.

635
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,560
You just see this guy with no diamond armor on, don't even fucking care about it, running at full speed.

636
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,560
You see his tracker come up and immediately disappear over the horizon.

637
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,560
And then you see him stop and look back at you and then you know you're going to start a great chase

638
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
unlike any fucking other.

639
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Well hey listen, Minecraft's all fun and games, but it's time to get to the most important question here.

640
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,560
How exactly is Minecraft helping us make Starfleet real?

641
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Like what are we doing here?

642
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Nate, throw it in the garden.

643
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
You can fuck up.

644
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
I just want to model the Enterprise.

645
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
This is such a good episode.

646
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Do you remember that one guy who built a one to one of the Starship Enterprise in Minecraft?

647
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,560
And then Inspector Gadget made fun of him on that mic.

648
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Yeah, I remember that.

649
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
How fucking terrifying.

650
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Fit, fit, fit. I want to know.

651
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,560
My first base was this watermelon castle thing I made.

652
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,560
What was your first base you made in 2B2D?

653
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,560
It was a dirt hut because I was surviving on zombie flesh and this was back in 2013.

654
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,560
And then I think I made like a little fishing hut next to a river and then I walked a hundred thousand blocks overworld

655
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
just to get established.

656
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Why overworld?

657
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Because you know when you're a noob and you're not familiar with like the nether and stuff

658
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,560
because when you're brand new you don't know about the nether highways,

659
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,560
you don't know where all the little secret shortcuts are that let you get in and out.

660
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:38,560
So you get that from just years of experience and sort of like mentally mapping out where things are on the server.

661
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Is there like a, if one Minecraft block is one meter, how big is this server?

662
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Like in terms of like real worlds.

663
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Oh, okay. So, well first of all, to give you a real idea of how big this server is

664
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,560
I want to talk about how much disk space it takes up.

665
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Most of the Minecraft worlds, if you plan it for a long time, it's probably going to be measured in gigabytes

666
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,560
like my original Minecraft world that I still have that I plan on is about four gigabytes.

667
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,560
2B2T is measured in terabytes.

668
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,560
It has been played on by I think 200,000 players at least once

669
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:28,560
and it's just, like I said, the highways go all the way to the world border in the nether.

670
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Some players have walked millions of blocks overworld and it's just all this terrain has been generated

671
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:43,560
and what you can do is because it's such an old server, whenever Minecraft updates to add like new biomes and stuff

672
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
there's these violent chunk borders.

673
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,560
When you go from one Minecraft version to another and then following these chunk borders,

674
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,560
you can walk out hundreds of thousands of blocks to find people's bases.

675
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
It's crazy.

676
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Yeah, damn.

677
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,560
It's not like those like 30 million blocks or whatever are like uninhabited.

678
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,560
After you get to a certain point, like, oh, there's just no civilization out there.

679
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Like the top tier players, I'm forgetting, there was a giant city with a bunch of pro top tier players.

680
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,560
I'm forgetting if I can was that Jared found legendarily.

681
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Oh, MC, yeah.

682
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Yeah, MC, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

683
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
That was like millions of blocks out.

684
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,560
No matter where you go on the server, there will be someone who has tread before you

685
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,560
and that just makes it even more interesting because you can always find just little relics of like someone being there

686
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,560
or like a block misplaced or something.

687
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Oh, this is the scariest 2B2.

688
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Oh, actually, did you want to answer?

689
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Do you know off the top of your head how big it is in real life, 2B2T?

690
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Well, assuming, well, Minecraft world, I think isn't it at its biggest?

691
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,560
It's like 60 million by 60 million blocks.

692
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
I think so.

693
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
I think so.

694
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Yeah, so just honestly, 60 million by 60 million is what it is because there are players that have generated those chunks all the way out to the world border.

695
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Hypothetically, yeah, so.

696
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
I don't know.

697
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
It's fucking crazy.

698
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
It's nuts, man.

699
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,560
But the scariest moment that I had in 2B2T was I had not played for a while.

700
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,560
You know, I just like left, you know, my base there, you know, I had not played for like a month or two.

701
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,560
Then I joined back.

702
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:31,560
I walk out, you know, I walk outside and there's a sign left by someone like, like, hello, it's me so and so, found this deserted base, just took what I could.

703
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Nice, nice looking base here.

704
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
You know, I left on this date.

705
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:42,560
And like, I don't even know, like, like, like, imagine coming home to your house and like all of your furniture is just like slightly shifted.

706
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,560
And you know that someone's been there and they haven't done anything malicious.

707
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
You just know it's out of place.

708
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
That's what I felt.

709
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,560
This person, this person, like, invaded my Minecraft base, like, thanking it was deserted.

710
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,560
Like, they didn't blow it up or anything.

711
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,560
They just came in, they like, like, took some of my diamonds and shit, which was fine.

712
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
That's just, you know, the name of game.

713
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,560
But it was just so fucking terrifying knowing that, like, I could have been logged in and, like, he could have easily killed me, probably, because I'm shit.

714
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,560
Like, like, I nearly avoided death by, like, playing dead.

715
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,560
And, like, him thinking this was an abandoned base.

716
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Well done, dude.

717
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Like, like, yeah.

718
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Hey, hey, I just did a quick calculation.

719
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
I looked online.

720
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Apparently, a Minecraft block is one meter.

721
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Is one meter is the cannon distance.

722
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,560
So 60 million meters is equal to 37,000 miles.

723
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,560
So I guess you could say that it's roughly, like, 37...

724
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Fuck, let me do the fucking math here.

725
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,560
This times this, fucking times this.

726
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,560
It is one...

727
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Wait, one billion...

728
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Wait, fuck.

729
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
I gotta count the fucking places here.

730
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Okay, one trillion.

731
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
Three hundred and eighty-nine billion.

732
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,560
Nine hundred and sixty-seven.

733
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,560
Seven hundred and seventy square feet.

734
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Jesus fuck.

735
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

736
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
You said that it's, um...

737
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
How big is the Earth?

738
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,560
Well, the Earth...

739
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
I don't know.

740
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,560
The Earth surface area is almost two hundred million square miles.

741
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
Okay, well, this isn't me...

742
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
Wait, this isn't miles?

743
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
Fuck.

744
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
I don't fucking know.

745
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,560
Hold on, hold on.

746
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
It's really big, guys.

747
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
It's really, really big.

748
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
It's really, really big.

749
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
I'm figuring this out.

750
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Everyone continue.

751
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,560
In like five minutes, I'll jump in with some factoids.

752
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
No one cares about it anymore.

753
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Some mad facts.

754
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Yo, let's talk about how else this game is literally Dark Souls.

755
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Uh, how about, uh, how cool it is?

756
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
That's pretty Dark Souls, right?

757
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Thank you, thank you.

758
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
That's my contribution.

759
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Yeah, there you go.

760
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Speaking of loading chunks, I remember, unlike, like a month...

761
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,560
I prefer blowing chunks, if you know what I'm saying.

762
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,560
Dab, dab, dab, go on.

763
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,560
But before I left, like a month or two, there was an Elytra hat going on where this guy

764
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,560
was like, like, staying in air with the Elytra perpetually.

765
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,560
And he was going so fast that he was constantly loading chunks.

766
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,560
And so the server would have, like, lag in order to accommodate him loading new chunks,

767
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
like, creating, like, generating new land.

768
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,560
And so the server was always on, like, one or two ticks, because there was just, like,

769
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:08,560
like, one or two guys just flying around at, like, like, like fucking, like, sonic speeds,

770
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,560
like, breaking the sound barrier and their fucking wings, creating new land to inhabit.

771
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
It was a fucking nightmare.

772
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
It was really incredible.

773
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
They're also, oh my god, lag.

774
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Lag is so fucking integral to the history of 2B2T.

775
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,560
People alternatively, like, like, like, like, like, like, the newest and best lag machines

776
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
in order to crash the servers.

777
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Yeah.

778
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
You made a pretty good lag machine.

779
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,560
Or were you showcasing, I remember there was a video where you were showing off a lag machine.

780
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,560
I think you were at Offtopia's base, maybe?

781
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Yeah, yeah.

782
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
Yeah.

783
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,560
And what's crazy is when you come across, like, the ruins of a lag machine, like, on 2B2T,

784
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,560
people consider that like an actual relic, like, whoa, this used to crash the server,

785
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,560
and now it's in ruins, and it's got vines growing on it.

786
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Like, it's just this weird pseudo, like, lore thing going on.

787
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
I don't know.

788
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,560
It's just, it's so hard to describe 2B2T to fucking normies.

789
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
It's just.

790
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
Yeah.

791
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,560
Yeah.

792
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,560
The surface area of the Earth is 196 million square miles.

793
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,560
The surface area of this Minecraft server is 138 million square miles.

794
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,560
So it is smaller than the Earth, but not by that much.

795
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Okay, all right.

796
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
It's like 70% of the Earth.

797
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Do you remember that, like, most of the Earth is covered in water, so?

798
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Well, yeah, so it's probably been.

799
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
How much of it that?

800
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
Most of it.

801
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,560
Oh, okay.

802
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
Was Gabe gonna say?

803
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

804
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,560
It sounded to be really cute that there were vines growing on it,

805
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
because vines don't just grow on stuff.

806
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,560
Somebody has to place them there.

807
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
Somebody has to, like, put them there.

808
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Oh, somebody was like, ooh, I want to make these look really rustic.

809
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
I want to really make the souping look rustic.

810
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
Yeah, that's very possible.

811
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,560
I think they do grow on the south, but now.

812
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,560
I could be wrong.

813
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
Do they?

814
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,560
They do spread to a degree, and if they're hanging,

815
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,560
like, they will drop all the way down to whatever block they eat.

816
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,560
So, like, at spawn, you've got vines at sky limit growing all the way down to bedrock.

817
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Fuck.

818
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
It fit.

819
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,560
I think I said my favorite story,

820
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,560
because these really are, like, Bible-esque parables that you have

821
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,560
of, like, legendary figures.

822
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Like, they're, like, larger than life.

823
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
My favorite is Jang and the Valley of Wheat.

824
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,560
That's just, like, that's, like, literally a Bible story

825
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,560
where, like, this guy meets another guy in the nether,

826
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
and they, like, found, like, a city together.

827
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Damn.

828
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Please go watch the Jang and the Valley of Wheat fucking story

829
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
on Fit's channel.

830
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,560
What is your favorite story from 2B2T Fit?

831
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,560
My favorite story.

832
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,560
Oh, man.

833
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
I don't know.

834
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,560
I know.

835
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,560
There's so many.

836
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,560
There's so many, and it's just, um...

837
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
I honestly can't give you an answer right now

838
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,560
because there's just so much, and I have to, like, think back

839
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
because I've just put out so much 2B content

840
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
and just been on the server for so many years.

841
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
I don't know.

842
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,560
How about just a good one that's on top of your head?

843
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,560
I've got to think.

844
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,560
What's the most, like, tragic story you can think of?

845
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Oh.

846
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
That's a good one.

847
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
That's a tragic story on this fucking set.

848
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,560
I'm going to open the old player vault for this one.

849
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,560
There was a player that joined 2B2T a long time ago,

850
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,560
and this player name was, it was Chris Leighton,

851
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,560
and he kept going around the server telling people,

852
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
I'm the king of 2B2T.

853
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
You mad?

854
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,560
And he would just scam it.

855
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
Yeah.

856
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,560
Well, turns out Chris Leighton used his real name

857
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,560
as his Minecraft username,

858
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,560
and so he was got so hard that he never returned to 2B2T.

859
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,560
And it's just, that's the thing about 2B2T,

860
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
it is a very toxic place.

861
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,560
I mean, people have, like, fucked with each other in real life

862
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
over a block game.

863
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,560
Like, it gets intense.

864
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,560
It gets intense.

865
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,560
If you join and you have, like, any sort of trace

866
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,560
to your real world identity, you're fucked.

867
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,560
Damn.

868
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,560
I guess they really were mad, after all.

869
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,560
Oh, god.

870
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,560
Oh, oh, this isn't on your channel fit,

871
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,560
but my favorite piece of, like, overall content

872
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,560
that you have produced was a dramatic reading you did

873
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,560
of a conversation between Pop Bob and Jared 2013.

874
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
Oh, yeah.

875
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,560
Where they just insulted each other back and forth.

876
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,560
Yeah.

877
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,560
Oh, man.

878
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,560
So it's, yeah.

879
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,560
It's hard to, like, explain this to outsiders

880
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,560
who don't know these people,

881
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,560
but 2B2T before it got, like, quote unquote, internet famous,

882
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,560
was just home to degenerates.

883
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Like, you either played on it

884
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
because you had a sick curiosity like I did,

885
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,560
or it became your life if you had no life.

886
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,560
And the way these players would talk to each other,

887
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,560
just saying the most vile, fucked up shit to each other

888
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,560
and doxing each other, it was just...

889
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
It's all like the PCP in that way.

890
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Yeah, from the sidelines, it was very amusing.

891
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
It was very amusing.

892
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
It was great.

893
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
And, okay, okay.

894
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,560
It's the 4 Chain community for you.

895
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,560
So there's two people.

896
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,560
Pop Bob and Jared 2013.

897
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,560
Pop Bob was, like, this, like, like, impfenous,

898
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,560
like, like, like, the fucking Griefer.

899
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Like, like, Pop Bob's name is still, like, fucking,

900
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,560
like, ring throughout the cosmos as the Griefer.

901
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
He had a lightning hack where he can, like, you know,

902
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,560
like, like, understand where you are when lightning struck.

903
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,560
It was fucking, it was insane.

904
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,560
And I'm gonna show a little bit of my naivete

905
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,560
from what I can understand.

906
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,560
I have not looked into this person as much,

907
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,560
Jared 2013.

908
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,560
What I can tell is just, like, a huge asshole meme-er.

909
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Sounds about right.

910
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Yeah.

911
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,560
Yeah, okay.

912
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,560
He's just a fucking meme who, like, he's just, like,

913
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,560
yeah, he's just a meme-er.

914
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,560
He did some important stuff, like, basically,

915
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,560
like, I don't think about him as, like, a real person.

916
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,560
He's just a huge meme, which is fine.

917
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,560
And great.

918
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,560
But yeah, him and Pop Bob had this, like,

919
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,560
legendary conversation.

920
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
One line says,

921
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,560
Go sniff paint, you brain-dead kike.

922
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,560
I really like that one.

923
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
It's just fucking great.

924
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
I mean, I could stay here reminiscing about

925
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,560
all these fucking great times forever.

926
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,560
Like, the problem with 2B2D is, it's just so fucking big.

927
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,560
You can't talk about it in any, like, you know, reasonable way.

928
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,560
Like, we have not scratched the surface.

929
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,560
We've talked about, like, maybe, like, six stories here.

930
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,560
Like, that's literally nothing.

931
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,560
That is literally nothing.

932
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,560
There are countless stories that you could make.

933
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,560
You could be 2B2 famous if you really tried to.

934
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,560
You have the autonomy to do anything in this fucking game.

935
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,560
And you could make a name for yourself if you really fucking did.

936
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,560
I mean, that's the amazing thing.

937
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,560
I just, right now, just because I wanted to have a little experience

938
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,560
of playing it, just bought Minecraft,

939
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,560
even though I'd been resisting that for fucking years,

940
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,560
and just jumped right into the server,

941
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
and bam, there I am.

942
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,560
It's real.

943
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,560
It's real.

944
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,560
The legends are all there.

945
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,560
I've done it.

946
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,560
Your contribution so far is probably, like, you know, like,

947
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
stepping on grass.

948
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,560
I ate shit and died is what I did.

949
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Humble beginnings.

950
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,560
At the very least, Nate, you've added to that fucking terabyte,

951
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,560
you know, file size.

952
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,560
You are now a new player ID that the game has to keep track of.

953
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,560
There you go.

954
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,560
Your name is etched inside of there for fucking ever now.

955
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
What is it?

956
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,560
Memeboyblue will live on forever in those annals.

957
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,560
Memeboyblue.

958
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Memeboyblue.

959
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
There he is.

960
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
That's what's cool about 2B2T.

961
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,560
What I like about all fucking multiplayer games is just the ability to,

962
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,560
like, with your friends, like I played 2B2T with,

963
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,560
with your friends to just be able to bond over doing some of the game.

964
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Video games, multiplayer video games are literally like World War I,

965
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,560
aka good.

966
00:50:52,560 --> 00:51:00,560
There is no greater way to bond with your fucking friends

967
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,560
than having a common goal that unites you against an adversary

968
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,560
in order to fucking defeat it.

969
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,560
That's just common odds.

970
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
That's what you fucking do.

971
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,560
Watchmen was literally based on 2B2T in that respect.

972
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,560
Watchmen was.

973
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,560
Yeah.

974
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,560
Yeah, because ultimately they hold the unite against a fake opponent

975
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,560
so that they wouldn't kill each other, you know?

976
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,560
Having an external opponent is what unites people.

977
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,560
It brings people together.

978
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,560
Yes, basically.

979
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,560
And that's why all of my best friendships have been forged

980
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,560
in fucking Minecraft or fucking, you know, TAF2, all that shit.

981
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,560
It just, it just, it's the perfect, honestly, God, believe this.

982
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,560
It's like the perfect way to spend time with your friends.

983
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,560
Like having, like, like, like an understandable, like, realized goal

984
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,560
and like being able to talk about whatever you want,

985
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,560
just like in this pointed, directed conversation.

986
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,560
It's fucking beautiful.

987
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
I love multiplayer games.

988
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,560
I literally, I, multiplayer games are better than skill player games.

989
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
That's a real thing that I actually think.

990
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,560
These can be with your fucking real ass friends and doing share.

991
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,560
I, the moments I have playing fucking Terraria or TF2 or fucking, you know, CSGO for a while,

992
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
they're beautiful.

993
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,560
They will never be taken away from me.

994
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,560
I don't remember mining coal and mine.

995
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,560
I don't fucking care about that.

996
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,560
I care about, I care about finding old bases in 2B2T and destroying them completely.

997
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,560
That's kind of shit that I care about in games.

998
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,560
Yeah.

999
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,560
I don't know.

1000
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,560
I want to know, like, like, who, who, Ben, you are, you are now officially 30 years old.

1001
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,560
You are 30 years old.

1002
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,560
Yes.

1003
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,560
As of today.

1004
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Happy birthday, Ben.

1005
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Happy birthday.

1006
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Yes.

1007
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
Splendid.

1008
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,560
Do you have any memories playing online?

1009
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
At all.

1010
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,560
At all.

1011
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
Or are they gone?

1012
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,560
They're fading fast.

1013
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,560
They're fading fast.

1014
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,560
Yeah.

1015
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,560
Wait, do I have any memories of what now?

1016
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,560
Of, like, playing online is the difference because I get the impression that this is a fairly,

1017
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,560
like, new person, you know, new age, Gen Z thing, to, like, want to spend time with your

1018
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,560
friends in video games.

1019
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:56,560
The multiplayer game I probably played the most of was Team Fortress 2 for a while.

1020
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,560
Yeah.

1021
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Yeah.

1022
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,560
But I didn't, I didn't play it with friends.

1023
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,560
Like, I didn't have no anyone else that was playing it.

1024
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,560
So I fell off.

1025
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,560
I don't know.

1026
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,560
Like, I had friends that tried to get me into Minecraft and I didn't stick to it.

1027
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,560
I had friends one summer in college when I was home.

1028
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:17,560
I, yeah, I played World of Warcraft for one summer because it was, like, just the way to

1029
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,560
hang out with my friends.

1030
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,560
So, and it was, and that was cool.

1031
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,560
And then, so that was, like, like, playing through the game and, like, leveling up was

1032
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,560
fun.

1033
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,560
And then I got to the end and, like, I hit max level and it was, oh, time to start

1034
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,560
raiding and I realized that I hate World of Warcraft and I stopped playing it.

1035
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,560
But I didn't need it anymore because now...

1036
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,560
You realize that you hate it once you beat it, yeah.

1037
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,560
I mean, that was similar to my experience with League of Legends.

1038
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,560
I just played it so I could stay in contact with my friends.

1039
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,560
Yeah.

1040
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,560
For the most part, yeah.

1041
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,560
Yeah.

1042
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,560
I played them, I played with friends, friends tried to get me into League of Legends as

1043
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,560
well and I quickly realized that I just wanted none of it.

1044
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,560
I remember very well.

1045
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,560
You played Warwick and then you said, wait, there are other characters to learn besides

1046
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,560
Warwick?

1047
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,560
It's like, it's not enough for me to just kind of get good at using Warwick?

1048
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,560
I have to, like, know them all?

1049
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,560
Fuck this.

1050
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Understandable.

1051
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,560
Understandable.

1052
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
I played, I played a little bit of Halo 2.

1053
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,560
That was my online game back in the day.

1054
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,560
Me and my buddies would play Halo 2 because we played Halo 1 for a long time at my friend

1055
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,560
Mike's house and we just played the same map, Hang'em High, Pistols Only.

1056
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,560
It was the fucking best and then we moved to Halo 2 and we played that all the fucking

1057
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,560
time and I hated that I had to keep buying Xbox Live because I'm cheap as fuck.

1058
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,560
I couldn't understand.

1059
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,560
I tried because I had like two groups of friends.

1060
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
I had like my friends from like...

1061
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
Where's the Xbox?

1062
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,560
I had my buddies from the comic book store because I used to play like cards and shit

1063
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
there all the time.

1064
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:45,560
And we would play Halo and then my friends from like school would play Counter-Strike

1065
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,560
and I hated Counter-Strike because it was hard and I don't like hard things because

1066
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,560
it was...

1067
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,560
My computer also sucked ass.

1068
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,560
I had to run it like at the lowest setting.

1069
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,560
So that was not fun.

1070
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,560
So I played Halo all the time and I remember specifically my last time ever playing Halo

1071
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,560
2 online because we were fucking garbage at Halo 2.

1072
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,560
Like to this day, me and my buddy Mike, I just hung out with him yesterday.

1073
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,560
We were terrible at games and despite the fact that we like to be good at games, no

1074
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,560
matter how much effort and practice we put into it, we never get better.

1075
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,560
And that started all the way back with Halo 2.

1076
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:23,560
I remember the last day we both played Halo 2 was when we were just pubbing, being fucking

1077
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,560
retarded, trying to get good, trying to maximize our rocket jumping and BXR and still couldn't

1078
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,560
do it correctly.

1079
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:35,560
And then we just joined this random match and these two little kids completely dominated

1080
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:40,560
us and they just spoke Spanish the whole time it happened.

1081
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Yeah, it was munchy.

1082
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
It was munchy.

1083
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
Exactly.

1084
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,560
And we had no idea it was going on.

1085
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
And from that, we were so shamed forever.

1086
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,560
We hung up our controllers for the rest of the time.

1087
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,560
You know what?

1088
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,560
It's good for a man to know when he's wasting his fucking time.

1089
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
Yeah.

1090
00:55:53,560 --> 00:56:00,560
Tom, I want to let you know that I have PCSD when anyone even mentions the word Halo.

1091
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,560
Like, the room fills with like a ball smell and all I can smell is balls because the only

1092
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:12,560
person I ever played Halo with was my cousin who just always smelled like balls and whenever

1093
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,560
he would kill me because he wouldn't teach me how to play would just say, ah, sick, you're

1094
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,560
shit.

1095
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,560
That was my only experience with it.

1096
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
We learned a lot from it.

1097
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:28,200
The word I would most associate with Halo is, this kid just screams Nate because my friend

1098
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,200
Mike's brother, his Nate, because he would throw grenades, but yell Nate really obnoxiously.

1099
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
Oh, Nate.

1100
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Lesson grenade.

1101
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Okay.

1102
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
Okay.

1103
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,640
It's supposed to be Nate, but he would say Nate because he's a fucking idiot and we named

1104
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,440
him Windo because at one point he got so mad that we beat him and hang him high he punched

1105
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,200
the window of the house and shattered it and ran outside.

1106
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,200
Oh my fucking God.

1107
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Hell yeah, Windo.

1108
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,200
That sounds like my fucking kind of guy.

1109
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,200
He's a fucking monster guy.

1110
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,200
Oh my God.

1111
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,200
Oh my God.

1112
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:06,200
The fucking dueling your friends in Team Fortress 2 is the most sadistic pleasure you can ever

1113
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,920
derive from your fucking life.

1114
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,960
It's worse than real life torture.

1115
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
I have concluded.

1116
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,600
There are many duels that I've done in one.

1117
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:21,360
I have concluded that being your friend in Team Fortress 2 and them screaming at the top

1118
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,720
of their lungs trying to fucking kill you is the worst thing you can possibly do to another

1119
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,720
living being.

1120
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,440
Like no matter the friend, no matter if your friend is short tempered or not, in Team Fortress

1121
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:37,200
2 there's just something about it where they will just try so fucking hard to kill you

1122
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,200
with all their might.

1123
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,920
Like new friends, old friends, doesn't matter, all will fucking scream at you in Team Fortress

1124
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,920
2 duels.

1125
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,800
It's not really a similar experience to this fit.

1126
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,280
TF2 is just nuts.

1127
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:56,680
I mean, I am not one that is quick to violence, but when you hear that domination jingle

1128
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:04,800
and then someone congas over your dead body, it's really hard to just stay calm.

1129
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,200
You know, I've never been able to do that.

1130
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,160
I always rage-quit every FPS, every single one.

1131
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,040
My friends, I forget what game we were playing.

1132
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,520
It was some game along these lines.

1133
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,320
And so like the match was over and like one of my friends won and one of my friends lost.

1134
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:26,640
And like the one who, like, so everything was like perfectly calm, like uncomfortably

1135
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,840
calm after this like victory of one and the loss of the other.

1136
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,640
And that just kind of went on for a minute or two until like a discussion began about

1137
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,400
whether or not it was more cold-blooded to be like an up close and personal like soldier

1138
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,160
who has to kill soldiers like Kloestrum or if it's more cold-blooded to be a sniper.

1139
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
And this discussion-

1140
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,960
What's more cold-blooded?

1141
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,360
What's more cold-blooded?

1142
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,400
This discussion has gone down the annals of my friendship history as one of the most climactic

1143
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,880
and earth-shattering moments of all time.

1144
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
And you know-

1145
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,960
I'm sure you must have concluded that snipers are pussies.

1146
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,280
You must have concluded that, yes.

1147
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,960
Well that they're like, well that they're like the more, okay, see one of the, the friend

1148
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,040
who won kept saying like, nah dude, it's way more bass, like get up close and personal

1149
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,720
and like fucking just shoot him right there.

1150
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,120
But the other friend who had lost like slowly but began to emerge with this deep burning

1151
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,600
rage, like it's obviously going to be the sniper because he has to like study him and

1152
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,640
like learn about him and like know his family and friends and like intimate, like get intimate

1153
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,640
with him.

1154
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,200
So obviously he's the one who's more cold-blooded, you stupid motherfucker, it's obviously the

1155
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
sniper.

1156
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,320
If you're killing a million people, all your friends are dying, you're going to be, your

1157
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,240
anxiety is going to be so high, you have to be the snipers, obviously the one who's

1158
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,480
more fucking cold-blooded.

1159
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,360
And then he like kicked the wall and like broke a lamp and ran away.

1160
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:46,320
Not one, not one, not one, like which is cooler or more honorable, no, cold-blooded-

1161
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,320
Yeah, it was cold-blooded.

1162
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,320
He was more cold-blooded, that's right.

1163
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,320
That's right.

1164
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
These are serious questions, clearly.

1165
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,320
Yeah, yeah.

1166
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,880
But it all derives, the rage there obviously derived from the game.

1167
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,880
I think it might have been legal legends or something, I can't remember.

1168
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,680
I still, I said this before about how like I have met all of my like good friends over

1169
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:12,040
like Cube Fortress 2 or Minecraft and I remember the first time that I met like a lifelong friend

1170
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:18,160
that I still talk to to this day, I met him on an Australian furry server that I had just

1171
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:27,560
like randomly joined and he and another person I know, yeah, randomly, they're both like

1172
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,760
arguing about like the 2012 presidential election, like at the top of the lens, like

1173
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,760
all of the furry add-ons were like telling them to stop, but they just wouldn't do anything

1174
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,320
they made them angry.

1175
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,880
And it was great, and that's why I met, there's just, it's beautiful, multiple video games

1176
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,880
are just fucking beautiful, because all the things that you can do and all the things

1177
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,040
that you can be, that's why you come to the Oasis, you know, that's what people say in

1178
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,440
this Steven Spielberg hellhole, it's incredible.

1179
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:04,840
In terms of like MMOs, I used to play a shit ton of MMOs, but like RPG MMOs are, MMORPG

1180
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:11,120
is mostly fantasy ones, I would hop from one to another life within a month or so.

1181
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:18,120
I played like, I probably played all of the old MMORPGs that are out there still, if you

1182
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:23,000
have even closed, I think City of Heroes used to be a really good one, it's not a fantasy

1183
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,760
one, it was a hero one that was like the best game ever, but they closed it, I'm so sad.

1184
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,560
And another one was Shin Megami Tensei Imagine, which was based on the Shin Megami Tensei

1185
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,560
series.

1186
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
Oh, they made an MMO of that?

1187
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,560
Is that official?

1188
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,280
Yeah, yeah, it was, and like, they changed publishers at some point as well, and I didn't

1189
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,400
even know about the Shin Megami Tensei series when I got into the game, everything was like

1190
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,960
completely new to me, and it was like, it was amazing, I loved it, and then they closed

1191
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,800
it as well, and I was like, sad.

1192
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:59,280
What was that game, didn't like we all play some game with you one time, like we all got

1193
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,320
in some MMO.

1194
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,720
Whatever many MMO journeys, yeah.

1195
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,400
Eatin' Eternal, I'm pretty sure that one was, it was really cute.

1196
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,720
Eatin' Eternal, it was a eating simulator, just eatin' eternally, there you go, it's

1197
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,640
an inflation, again, your inflation fetish comes raring again.

1198
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,560
Stop this, no, do not, do not.

1199
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,280
Try to flood this fucking server with inflation, I'm not gonna stand for it.

1200
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,880
I know, I don't, stop, I don't have the courage to stop this abuse.

1201
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,880
No meme.

1202
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
No.

1203
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,880
Well, hey.

1204
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Hey, should we use your questions or?

1205
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Hippo's good shit.

1206
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Okay.

1207
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That he's playing?

1208
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Yeah.

1209
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:42,240
Oh, in terms of multiplayer, well, my multiplayer game experience was primarily when I was growing

1210
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:48,480
up with just my brothers playing multiplayer PlayStation 2 games, two at a time.

1211
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:55,840
Things like Worms 3D, which is the first three-dimensional Worms game where you're going around shooting

1212
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:01,400
things and it's like really laggy and slow and terrible, but me and my brothers would

1213
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,200
hang out in that and that would be like the way we hung out, kind of, instead of going

1214
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,600
to the park and playing the B-ball or the football.

1215
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,600
Yeah, fuck that shit.

1216
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,840
It's all about the fucking Worms.

1217
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,240
We got the Worms, we would build- Fuck basketball, Worms are good, fuck basketball, Worms are

1218
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,240
good.

1219
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:25,320
All right, enough of that, but we would spend hours in those like levels not killing each

1220
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:32,360
other and instead using the girder tool to build fortresses, which we would then flood.

1221
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:38,280
It never really became about the game, it was always just about, you know, fucking around.

1222
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:44,000
We would invent this game called, I don't remember what it was called, but it was like

1223
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,560
you have to kill yourself over and over and to try and minimize your score, like whoever

1224
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:55,280
has the least points and it would go into minus points and we would just do that and

1225
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,760
you can't win by getting minus points, so we just kept going forever.

1226
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,360
With that- Yeah, sorry, go on, go on.

1227
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,160
The reason I say that is that a lot of my like multiplayer experience was not with anyone

1228
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,160
over the internet.

1229
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:14,960
I never really liked talking to people in like RuneScape or World of Warcraft because,

1230
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,880
you know, much against like the popular belief, people in RuneScape are actually retarded

1231
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,120
and I don't like them.

1232
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,520
Are they fucking super geniuses playing like the most advanced MMO?

1233
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,680
No, they're actually very fucking stupid and I never liked anybody in RuneScape, I never

1234
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,680
got along with anybody.

1235
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,280
You need to buy a GF.

1236
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,280
Yeah.

1237
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:39,800
They are so expensive, I actually did go on a GF thing, but I didn't buy a GF, somebody

1238
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:45,500
says, I'll be your GF and I was like, whoa, excuse me, for free, yes, and then we threw

1239
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,640
snowballs at each other and she cried and ran away and I was like, I didn't know what

1240
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,640
I- You didn't treat her right, man, you didn't treat her like a queen.

1241
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,640
That was your problem.

1242
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,640
I didn't use the right emotes, I don't think I had the right emotes.

1243
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,640
Yeah, that was the problem.

1244
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:04,480
Hey, uh, did you ever play the Ratchet and Clank 3 online multiplayer?

1245
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,760
I would have, I didn't have- You needed that like extra box or whatever thing, yeah.

1246
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,960
I think when Ben and I bought- Yeah, I didn't get the attachment, I played that with my

1247
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:19,520
brothers as, again, it's like a multiplayer, I played with them and it was like even Minecraft,

1248
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,520
like we would have our own server and we would like build our own individual towns and then

1249
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,680
connect them with like mine cart, rails and create train stations, just the three of us.

1250
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,680
Mine, comp, excellent.

1251
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:35,280
And we would, yeah, very good.

1252
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,120
And like when it comes to online stuff, like getting into like making friends and like

1253
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,640
random people, meeting people, I've always shied away from it, I'm a very shy boy, I'm

1254
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,680
a very like baby lad and I don't like talking to strangers on the internet, they may like

1255
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,040
take me in their van and I don't like it.

1256
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:57,560
It's only very recently that I've started to just, you know, well actually, I've never

1257
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:03,000
done it in TF2 or Minecraft, making a friend, it's always been through something else like

1258
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,960
fucking my YouTube channel or like associating with someone who is also a YouTuber, like

1259
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,160
it's, I don't know, I have one person from World of Warcraft that I actually considered

1260
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,560
a real friend and I could probably still talk to them.

1261
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,680
I can relate, like with all the MMOs I've played throughout my whole life, I never really

1262
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,960
made friends, like I think one time, twice maybe, I joined some guilds and made friends

1263
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:33,320
there, but when I cut the game, the friendships just kind of sizzled out and yeah, I never

1264
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:39,440
really, I usually play solo on MMOs as sad as that sounds.

1265
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:47,080
I do too, I like soloing like lower level raids from earlier expansions by myself because

1266
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,480
getting a group together is a hassle and nobody is good.

1267
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,360
I remember when I first started playing World of Warcraft, I didn't know what I was doing

1268
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,520
at a deep social anxiety about like trying to like be good at the game because I just

1269
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,520
didn't understand it.

1270
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,160
I mean, I played for like two weeks or something, but still, yes, deep fears, deep fears.

1271
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:10,840
Oh, coming back to Minecraft, the only multiplayer server I've ever played on Minecraft was Pixelmon,

1272
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,840
which was a Pokemon.

1273
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,600
I trusted that I really wanted to do that, but I couldn't get to work.

1274
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,160
It worked for me and it was like, I had a blast, it was really fun, it was like playing

1275
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,160
Pokemon in Minecraft.

1276
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,880
You could build stuff and catch Pokemon and you can like live outside and be surrounded

1277
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,680
by like Shutenabu Saber Lies and that was perfect.

1278
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,680
I loved it.

1279
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,680
Damn.

1280
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,680
Nice.

1281
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
I remember when Minecraft was fun.

1282
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:41,200
Sadly, Pixelmon got shut down because Pokemon people shut it down.

1283
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,040
So all the good things in my life has been shut down, so.

1284
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,040
Only your life remains.

1285
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,280
It was the kids of death for all these things.

1286
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,280
It's made shows up.

1287
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,280
It's days and numbers.

1288
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,280
So 2BPT going to get shut down soon.

1289
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:57,920
I keep saying that you're like a second person that says that to me this week that like whatever

1290
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
I touch is dead.

1291
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
He's dead.

1292
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,920
Can't wait for the PCP to get permanently demonetized.

1293
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,440
Whatever Mage touches turns purple.

1294
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,440
Yes.

1295
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,440
Oh, God.

1296
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,960
There's only one thing more I want to say on the subject of stories of multiplayer games.

1297
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,960
Before we move on to questions here.

1298
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:20,840
My earliest multiplayer game memory that I have is Ethan.

1299
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,840
We all know Ethan.

1300
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,800
We all know he's the legendary person of Best Boy here.

1301
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,800
Pukiboy himself.

1302
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,800
Yeah.

1303
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:33,040
Before I knew what he looked like before I heard him, I was playing Minecraft with him

1304
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,960
and he was like, hey, we should join a tiny chat and then we should like we should like

1305
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,680
see what each other sounds like.

1306
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,880
So I turn on my mic in this fucking tiny chat, which if you know tiny chat, fucking

1307
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:49,120
press one for tiny chat.

1308
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,920
And I was like, hello.

1309
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,920
And he was like, ha, your voice sounds gay.

1310
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,880
And then he turned on his voice and his voice was even higher.

1311
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,640
And that was the beginning of our fucking friendship.

1312
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,800
What was building Minecraft gay bath houses and you know, all the associated war.

1313
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,800
It was fantastic.

1314
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,600
And that's why I met fucking editor of the spicy row pack was through fucking Minecraft

1315
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,080
and my best boy.

1316
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,880
I love him with all shout out.

1317
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,880
Yeah.

1318
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,400
So fucking multiplayer games.

1319
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,400
Good shit.

1320
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,720
That's that's how I made most of my fucking friends.

1321
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:23,400
What is the PCP but a real online multiplayer game?

1322
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,400
Yeah.

1323
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,400
Where are you going?

1324
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,400
PCP MMO.

1325
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,400
That's the real question here.

1326
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,840
The fucking currency that you can buy stuff with will be the PCP and will be a real cryptocurrency.

1327
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,800
It's going to start with the rowdy fuckers.

1328
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:38,800
Once I fucking gamify the rowdy fuckers cop killers, that will be the beginning.

1329
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,800
Yeah.

1330
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:44,720
Day by day, you'll gamify it more and more until it is just a real video game.

1331
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,720
That's the plan.

1332
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,220
That is actually the plan.

1333
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,600
It's just going to have so much feature creep.

1334
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,440
Like the creature, the features are just going to creep in.

1335
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,480
So they're just they're never going to stop creeping in.

1336
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,080
Just like creepers, you could say from there.

1337
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:08,320
You might, you might say just like that song about creepers that's like click, click, boom.

1338
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,680
I play Minecraft every day, but not at night.

1339
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,680
I love that.

1340
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,680
I certainly love the radio.

1341
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,680
There you go.

1342
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,680
That's it.

1343
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,680
All right.

1344
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,680
We're done.

1345
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,680
Jesus Christ.

1346
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,680
We get to the fucking questions now, please.

1347
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,680
I'm dying here.

1348
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,680
I'm dying.

1349
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,200
I mean that we're floundering is what I'm saying here.

1350
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,200
That's what I'm saying.

1351
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,200
Can I tell you a secret?

1352
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,200
Okay.

1353
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,200
Can I tell you?

1354
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,200
Can I tell you a secret guys?

1355
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,200
Okay.

1356
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,200
No.

1357
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,200
I once had a Minecraft channel.

1358
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,200
Oh, no way.

1359
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,200
What?

1360
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,200
Oh my God.

1361
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,200
Yes.

1362
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,240
Yes.

1363
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,240
Is it called purpleminecraft.org?

1364
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,240
No.

1365
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,240
It is called Fiddim C.

1366
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,240
No.

1367
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,240
I wish.

1368
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,240
No.

1369
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,240
It was terrible.

1370
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,240
I think it has like eight subscribers right now.

1371
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,240
Is it still up?

1372
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,240
It was like terrible audio.

1373
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,240
Yeah.

1374
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,240
It had like six videos and then I quit.

1375
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,240
Well, you tell us a little bit.

1376
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:56,320
Or do you want to be a fun game to see who can get it first?

1377
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:01,320
I won't say the name now because I want to review the videos to see if I reveal any personal

1378
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
information on them.

1379
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,320
Okay.

1380
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:08,800
By the time the video goes up, if it's okay content, maybe you'll be linked in the description

1381
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,800
if I remember.

1382
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,800
Yeah.

1383
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,800
All right.

1384
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,800
Cool.

1385
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
The hunt begins.

1386
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,300
Whenever someone brings up that they have like a Minecraft YouTube channel, I always

1387
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:21,040
feel really bad because it's like there's been tens of thousands of Minecraft YouTube

1388
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,440
channels that have tried to get their feet off the ground and failed.

1389
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,960
And then you got me some mid-twenties fuckboy that just comes along and makes a couple videos

1390
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,520
and it just blows up randomly.

1391
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,960
Hey man.

1392
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,960
Well, that's life.

1393
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,280
You're in the right place at the right time, I guess.

1394
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:42,240
The whole Minecraft YouTube genre is like full of people who just make one thing that

1395
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:48,320
suddenly it becomes a new trend like that fucking, the realistic Minecraft with the green

1396
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,400
screen hands that we were looking at the other day.

1397
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,800
And you know, furthermore, there's a whole genre of Minecraft videos where a guy just

1398
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,720
green screens his hands and he pulls a realistic Minecraft.

1399
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,520
I mean, if you're putting yourself up against like every individual Minecraft channel out

1400
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,280
there, like you're putting yourself up against people who's just videos just like, I welcome

1401
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:12,240
to number 25 Minecraft mining dirt, let's play it today, we're going to spend 25 days

1402
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,240
mining dirt.

1403
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,240
You know, it's just like...

1404
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,240
That was basically my channel.

1405
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,240
Yeah, there you go.

1406
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,240
But you do real shit.

1407
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,240
You do lore.

1408
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,400
You did the deep web hacks and stuff.

1409
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,080
That's just got a more, more panache, more style, plus you do a bunch of stuff.

1410
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,640
Nate, will you please read the pity question from the Twitter, please?

1411
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,600
Okay, let's let's let's shift over here, read a little pity question.

1412
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,640
Um, what do we got here?

1413
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,640
What do we got here?

1414
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,640
Please pick a good one.

1415
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:38,640
Okay.

1416
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,640
Here's one that's not terrible.

1417
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:45,440
At owl1373, this might be an obvious question, but bear with me here, asks, during the robot

1418
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:52,040
uprising, which PCP member will be most likely to be mistaken for a robot?

1419
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,720
Why do you always...

1420
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,400
That's a good question.

1421
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,400
You just insist.

1422
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,360
You just insist on reading the worst fucking question.

1423
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,360
That's not...

1424
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,360
There possibly is.

1425
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,360
That's the end.

1426
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,360
Me.

1427
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,360
Davoo.

1428
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,360
We'll see.

1429
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,360
There you go.

1430
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,360
Davoo.

1431
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,360
Yes, it's Davoo.

1432
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,360
No one has seen me.

1433
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,360
No one has seen me.

1434
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,360
I could be just like an app on your phone.

1435
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,360
Oh, yeah.

1436
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,360
Mage could be essentially an AI.

1437
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,360
Have you guys seen the new iMage?

1438
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:22,520
The new update really fucks everything and destroys the feng shui.

1439
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,520
It's called the touch of death.

1440
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,520
Oh, jeez.

1441
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,520
No.

1442
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,520
That was terrible.

1443
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,520
That was terrible, Nate.

1444
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,080
That was a good question.

1445
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,580
You just had a bad attitude.

1446
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,080
That's your problem in life, my friend.

1447
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,080
You got a bad attitude.

1448
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,080
Happy to be...

1449
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,080
Look at John Lennon says, final verdict.

1450
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,080
Is it safe to mine at night?

1451
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,080
A vastly superior question.

1452
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,080
Oh, jeez.

1453
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,080
It's not...

1454
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,080
It's the most obvious question in the world.

1455
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,600
Well, it's a complicated question.

1456
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,800
It's not safe, but you should probably do it anyway.

1457
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,800
Well, listen.

1458
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,720
You know, it is your own mind at night on hardcore mode.

1459
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,400
Mining at night is, in fact, against God's law.

1460
01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:06,360
But that being said, if you live in anarchy, if you live in a world of madness where you

1461
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:15,760
are hidden from the light of God's love, like on 2P2B, or whatever, no, wait, I'm sorry,

1462
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,760
whatever.

1463
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,760
Did you actually make a mistake?

1464
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,760
I thought that was a joke.

1465
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,760
No, wait.

1466
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,760
2P2T, right?

1467
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,760
2P2T.

1468
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,760
2P2T.

1469
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,760
2P2T.

1470
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,760
2P2T.

1471
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,760
2P2T.

1472
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,760
2P2T.

1473
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,760
There you go.

1474
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,520
If you're on there, you are hidden from the light of God's love.

1475
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,240
And so, like, I'm not saying that you should do it, but I'm saying that you can get away

1476
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,240
with it.

1477
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,240
But you shouldn't do it anyway.

1478
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,240
It is a sin.

1479
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,240
It's, of course, a sin.

1480
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,240
You probably should do it, though.

1481
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,240
Oh, my God, that reminds me.

1482
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,920
A few years ago, there was this troll account on 2P2T.

1483
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:50,480
His name was Build Smash, and he basically masqueraded around as this in real life missionary

1484
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,480
for God.

1485
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:59,160
And you would constantly post Bible passages and try to correct people on their, like,

1486
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,080
arrogant, sinful ways.

1487
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,160
Oh, it's like me when I was, like, 13.

1488
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,660
That's exactly what I used to do.

1489
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:08,120
Do you remember Bible Bot?

1490
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,760
Bible Bot was an offshoot of Build Smash, and it's like, it was the greatest troll of

1491
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:18,400
all time because you've got all these Edgelord Fedoras, and you're trolling them with God.

1492
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,400
It is.

1493
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,120
It was the worst thing you've ever seen.

1494
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,120
Oh, man.

1495
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,120
They just can't resist the bait at that point.

1496
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,280
Bible Bot is fucking legendary.

1497
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,680
I fucking love Bible Bot.

1498
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,680
Not Ethan.

1499
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:34,440
He made a discord version of Bible Bot that's still in the works now, but you can do X-Mesh

1500
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,560
Point Verse and shit like that.

1501
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,560
It's fucking dope.

1502
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,560
It's dope as hell.

1503
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,560
I love Bible Bot.

1504
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,560
Dude, that's sick.

1505
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,560
I'm going to scroll up here.

1506
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,560
I have a question.

1507
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,560
Yeah, I do.

1508
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,560
Okay.

1509
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:48,160
By Giffy or Giffy, what do you miss most about old school Minecraft?

1510
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,160
Good question.

1511
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,880
The no hunger meter.

1512
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,840
I miss the oof sound that Steve used to make.

1513
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,840
Is that gone?

1514
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
That's a classic.

1515
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,840
Yeah.

1516
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
Now it's just a cracking of a bone.

1517
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,840
Oh, that sucks.

1518
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
Oh, I hate that.

1519
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,960
How old school are we talking about, though?

1520
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,200
I miss, I mean, like early beta.

1521
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,520
What I miss is the lack of choice.

1522
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,720
There's too many blocks, too many colors.

1523
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:22,080
I can't decide on how to like build my base and I always default to cobblestone and wood

1524
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,160
because I'm just an idiot and I can't be able to like plan out how to find and get

1525
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,160
all these fucking materials.

1526
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:33,160
We didn't talk about Minecraft the actual game, but I want to put on the record that

1527
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:37,000
I think Minecraft was like pretty shit and like not like fun is like a game.

1528
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,720
I love to play.

1529
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,720
I love to play.

1530
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:44,240
I have to agree because I've never stuck with it whenever I tried to play it because

1531
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:50,440
I just I would always get in there and then suddenly realize like, wait a minute, it's

1532
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,440
I've done this before.

1533
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,920
I just got to break some trees and build a hut.

1534
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,200
That's why I don't want to do that.

1535
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,600
I loved Minecraft.

1536
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,160
I love the last time I sincerely and truthfully loved Minecraft like vanilla Minecraft.

1537
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:07,040
I play when the horses came out and my biggest goal was like to make like the biggest stable

1538
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,640
with all every single type of horse in it.

1539
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,640
Oh, that's nice.

1540
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,640
Beautiful.

1541
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,640
It was so fun.

1542
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,560
I distinctly remember the most fun I ever had playing Minecraft and it was I was like

1543
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,520
I was playing single player because single player is superior to multiplayer.

1544
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,520
That's gay.

1545
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,640
It was just I was just dicking around and then I was just like on the wiki because I'm

1546
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,680
a total noob learning about like various stuff you can do.

1547
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:30,760
And I decided for myself, I want to build a sugar cane factory.

1548
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:36,000
Once I decided upon that to then have to explore the labyrinthine system to get like all the

1549
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,920
components necessary to make that happen.

1550
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:43,960
To make that thing assemble, I needed like I needed like nether or whatever and like

1551
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,800
I didn't even know what that is or that the nether even existed.

1552
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,680
So I had to like learn about that and how to get there and construct like an obsidian

1553
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:54,600
portal like having a goal for yourself like that and then doing what it takes to get there

1554
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,760
and exploring the mechanics that way.

1555
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:01,760
That is the most fun you can have playing Minecraft in my opinion.

1556
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:07,200
Dwarf Fortress was the same like I never like I would like set up you got to make goals

1557
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,200
for yourself.

1558
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,320
You got to be like, okay, well, how do I build a farm and then you go and you look up how

1559
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,120
to build a farm and you try to make it happen.

1560
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,960
How do I set up an army?

1561
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,280
You go and you look you do research and then you like try and make it happen.

1562
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,280
Yeah.

1563
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,280
Yeah.

1564
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,960
I guess I never really set had like a goal for myself.

1565
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,960
That's the big bump.

1566
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,960
Once you get that, it gives you a sense of purpose.

1567
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,160
I want to say a thing quickly.

1568
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,320
I just I just remembered one single complaint I have on Minecraft still to this day.

1569
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,200
Like, you know, Apple is a Minecraft, right?

1570
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,760
They were like, they're from almost the very beginning.

1571
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,200
If not the very beginning, right, we still don't have Apple pie.

1572
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,400
That is I am upset if that's true.

1573
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,760
Are there pies?

1574
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,160
The community needs to answer for this.

1575
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,160
Yeah.

1576
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,160
Like pumpkins came out.

1577
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,920
I think and there was pumpkin pie or something.

1578
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,920
Right.

1579
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,920
Wasn't there?

1580
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,920
I haven't played.

1581
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,920
Yeah.

1582
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,920
Exactly.

1583
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:54,920
See, well.

1584
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:55,920
And there's cake.

1585
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,920
That's true.

1586
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:57,920
That's true.

1587
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,920
I said Minecraft is shit.

1588
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,000
I had one very specific reason in my mind is because they keep adding shit that I don't

1589
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
care about.

1590
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,880
It just blots up the game as opposed to adding things that I actually care about.

1591
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,880
Like, OK, back in the old days, there was just like dirt and there was just like, you

1592
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,920
know, like stone in the underground, like those were your blocks.

1593
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:19,600
Now there's like different types of stone, but they both look like shit.

1594
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:24,160
Like they look absolutely awful and you would never want to use them.

1595
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,880
And they're just like, I wouldn't be opposed to have like a different type of stone, but

1596
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,920
just make it look like an actual human.

1597
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,080
They're not like a weird AI.

1598
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,080
It looks fucking abysmal.

1599
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,560
They keep like weird, awful things that I just think are stupid.

1600
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,560
Add good things and then I like it.

1601
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,200
There's just too much choice.

1602
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:48,280
When it comes to like designing a castle or designing an interior of a place, it's you

1603
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,920
can do anything.

1604
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,920
Anything now.

1605
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,920
You can have multicolored carpets.

1606
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,560
Can we all agree that there's not enough purple in Minecraft?

1607
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,560
There's scant.

1608
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,560
There's scant.

1609
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,560
But you know what I will say.

1610
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,560
There's not enough.

1611
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,560
I will say.

1612
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,960
There was another question that is relevant to this.

1613
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,880
It was a fun bill asked, what is your favorite Minecraft block?

1614
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:11,720
And my answer was definitely obsidian, even though it's like the edgy, like literal Sasuke

1615
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,720
choice.

1616
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,720
Obsidian too.

1617
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,720
Yes.

1618
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,720
Obsidian is purplish and it makes the purple port.

1619
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,720
Old style cobblestone.

1620
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,320
Old style cobblestone with the black lines.

1621
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,320
Oh yeah.

1622
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,320
What did you say, Fit?

1623
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,320
What did Fit say?

1624
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:26,320
My favorite is one thing you just are adding now for the next update, the Sea Pickle.

1625
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,320
The Sea Pickle.

1626
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,320
The Sea Pickle.

1627
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,320
The Sea Pickle.

1628
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,320
Is the greatest.

1629
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,320
I'm not aware of this.

1630
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:36,640
Okay, so they're adding so much new stuff in this update, but it's like too little, too

1631
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:42,440
late because it's been eight years already, but they finally added spears and you can

1632
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:50,080
do a fucking taboon jump in the rain and it's baller as fuck and I've been waiting for

1633
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,080
it so long.

1634
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,080
Dude, I saw the Trident.

1635
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,080
I saw the Trident video.

1636
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,080
It was nuts.

1637
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,080
That's sick.

1638
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,080
God damn.

1639
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:00,280
It's like all this cool shit, but now Minecraft is like going way down a popularity.

1640
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,680
It's just too little, too late.

1641
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,840
Like they didn't get it yet.

1642
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,440
Best block mossy cobblestone.

1643
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,440
That's a good one.

1644
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:13,480
Oh dude, I remember whenever me and my friends find like a dungeon and be like, take whatever

1645
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,480
you want from the chest.

1646
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,480
I don't care.

1647
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,880
Just give me the mossy cobblestone.

1648
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,440
I only ask for the mossy cobblestone, that's all I care about.

1649
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,200
Please, sir, extends out his hands.

1650
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,560
Please, sir, just one more mossy cobblestone to sustain me, please.

1651
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,560
This cake kind of like a block.

1652
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,920
I'm looking at the sea pickle and this looks fucking gross, but like really funny.

1653
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,920
Okay, I also like cake.

1654
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,840
Actually, I'm not sure if that counts, but whatever.

1655
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,840
My favorite.

1656
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,840
Well, it's my second favorite.

1657
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:45,360
My favorite block and which I made, like my first 2B2D base was made entirely out of

1658
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,000
this material was like melon brick.

1659
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,720
I love the melon brick and you can like make your food into like a constructable material.

1660
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,720
Well, hang on.

1661
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,720
Question, question.

1662
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,160
Is that a brick or I thought that those were just literally like melons, like they just

1663
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,160
are cubes.

1664
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,760
Yeah, they could be used as construction material.

1665
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,760
Yeah.

1666
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,760
Yeah, well, sure.

1667
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:04,760
Okay, okay.

1668
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,600
It's just when you said brick, I thought you had to go through a process to convert

1669
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,200
a melon into a brick and that's all.

1670
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,200
No, no, no.

1671
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Okay, all right.

1672
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Yeah, I'm just saying as opposed to like the edible thing.

1673
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,840
So it's a literal edible house that you can just eat if you want to.

1674
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,840
Exactly.

1675
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,840
It's beautiful.

1676
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,840
That's sick.

1677
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,000
Cakes and melons are the only food sort of things that you can put down, right?

1678
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Yeah.

1679
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
What's that?

1680
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Cables.

1681
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,720
What's kind of cool about cakes is that on 2B2T when the lag is so severe that you can't

1682
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,920
even eat, cakes are the only way to stop yourself from starving to death.

1683
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,920
Why cake?

1684
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:41,200
Unless they're a right click and you instantly fill up your hunger bar, whereas with the other

1685
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,960
foods you have to have the eating animation.

1686
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:49,120
And it takes like five minutes sometimes if the TPS is below.

1687
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,840
So like you'll be trying to eat it, but your stamina will be like ticking down and you'll

1688
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,520
just like die before you can actually get the thing in your face.

1689
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,520
Yeah.

1690
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,520
Okay, all right.

1691
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,520
Cake is OP.

1692
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,520
Word.

1693
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,520
Cake is dead.

1694
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,120
I changed my mind.

1695
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:07,320
My actual favorite block is the sign, mostly because of like the history and the memories

1696
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,720
that can invoke when you go back to a place that you remember writing a sign in and you're

1697
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,720
like, oh.

1698
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,720
Oh, yeah.

1699
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,080
That happened upon a sign.

1700
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,640
The literal words I wrote like five years ago.

1701
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,720
I happened upon a sign just at the beginning of 2B2T, right?

1702
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,720
Yeah.

1703
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,720
Yeah.

1704
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,720
All right.

1705
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:34,200
We've come full circle that just said a little arrow not sucking dick 2018.

1706
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,200
That was it.

1707
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,200
That was a whole scene.

1708
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,200
It was good.

1709
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Okay.

1710
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:42,120
I feel like everything I said Minecraft is actually the best video game ever made because

1711
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,120
of this.

1712
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,120
That's what happened.

1713
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:50,360
I remember distinctly saying to one of my friends, dude, you should be able to like write books

1714
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,360
like like write.

1715
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,360
Oh, yeah.

1716
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,360
Wouldn't it be cool to do that?

1717
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,880
And they're like, oh, that's never going to happen.

1718
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,400
And I was like, yeah, you're right.

1719
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,840
Next time you can write in books.

1720
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,200
That is a game changer right there.

1721
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,960
That is a game changer.

1722
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,200
I just remembered with the books one time I had like I hosted a little server like it

1723
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,880
was a bit of a role-play server between me and my friends and I wrote the whole story

1724
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,160
and they had to follow the story and they had to find books to continue the story and

1725
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,160
stuff.

1726
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,160
It was really, really fun.

1727
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,160
That's awesome.

1728
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,160
That sounds fucking sick.

1729
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,160
Hey, hey, somebody was just talking about a feature creep.

1730
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:23,920
I just wanted to say that a feature creep is literally what completely broke Terraria

1731
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,400
and made Terraria boring and shit because it no longer...

1732
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,560
You literally have no fucking brain cells left in that game.

1733
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,560
No.

1734
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,480
No, Terraria originally had a very clear path line that went from like your base house

1735
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,920
then you go to like Jungle Biome once you've built yourself up and you've mined some decent

1736
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,360
ore from underground then you eventually get to like the...

1737
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,360
I don't even remember like other stuff happens then you get like to the fantasy realm and

1738
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,280
then there was a linear path that was fun.

1739
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,080
The feature creep literally did not affect that.

1740
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:53,280
It made it so bloated and clunky and annoying.

1741
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,800
The features they added didn't add any new fucking biomes.

1742
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,920
All they fucking added was more shit to do.

1743
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,920
The fucking...

1744
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,600
The beehive was a new one.

1745
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,600
That's one.

1746
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,600
I don't know.

1747
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,600
That's just in...

1748
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
That's just in the...

1749
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,600
Okay.

1750
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:11,600
That's just a small structure that is inside of the Jungle so you need to go there anyway.

1751
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,600
Pasha.

1752
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,600
You're fucking fag.

1753
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,600
Terraria is perfect.

1754
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,400
Okay, to be fair I haven't actually played Terraria since those updates but it just looks

1755
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,400
shitty.

1756
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,400
Just looks shitty.

1757
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,400
You're fucking rude.

1758
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,400
Oh yeah.

1759
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,400
Oh, I log into Terraria.

1760
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,400
Oh good.

1761
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,920
I got like the Santa DLC in my fucking chow...

1762
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,920
DLC!

1763
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,920
Thank you Terraria.

1764
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,920
Thank you Terraria.

1765
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,920
You're fucking dead, Nate.

1766
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,920
It's basically DLC.

1767
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,920
Only spree.

1768
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,920
You don't fucking know fucking shit.

1769
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,200
Base Terraria was OP and GG to you, Munchie.

1770
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:41,400
Speaking of Terraria, I think it's the same people who made a new game called Staxel which

1771
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:46,400
is kind of like Stardew Valley and Minecraft had a baby and that's a game I like playing.

1772
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,400
Didn't...

1773
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,400
I didn't...

1774
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,400
Behind babies.

1775
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,800
Didn't the Terraria people make like some like...

1776
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,800
Some like...

1777
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,800
Starbound, my friend.

1778
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,800
Starbound.

1779
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,800
Yeah, some perpetually early access shit hole that I heard was like a big disaster.

1780
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,800
Yeah, I don't know.

1781
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,400
Hey, hey, fucking fucking Ethan himself asked a good question.

1782
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,400
Oh shit.

1783
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,400
Yeah, shout out.

1784
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:10,800
But where do you see the future of 2B2T or more broadly if you prefer Minecraft heading?

1785
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:11,800
Oh, great question.

1786
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:16,480
From my perspective, I've seen several Minecraft slash 2B2T YouTubers switch from to other

1787
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:21,200
forms of content altogether and it seems as though the server slash games decline as

1788
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,200
of late due to the over-saturation of Minecraft based content.

1789
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,200
Hmm.

1790
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,200
What do you think, Fit?

1791
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,200
This is a good ass question.

1792
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,200
What do you think, Fit?

1793
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:33,520
For 2B2T, as long as there's like at least 10 people playing on it and a couple people

1794
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:39,440
pitching in for the server costs, I think it will end once Housemaster just gets bored

1795
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,440
of running it.

1796
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:46,440
But here's the thing, Housemaster has a cocaine addiction and he needs to fulfill this cocaine

1797
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:52,640
addiction so he needs as many shekels as he can get with all the players on 2B2T.

1798
01:26:52,640 --> 01:27:00,160
He will run this as long as he can, but Minecraft itself, I actually think because it's just

1799
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:06,040
a game that you can put on any platform at this point, I think I see it like still being

1800
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:11,360
played by a somewhat relatively large player base for years to come, I would say.

1801
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,360
I agree.

1802
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,360
I agree.

1803
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,360
I don't think it's going anywhere.

1804
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:21,200
I think that the decline of popularity is actually fucking great for specifically 2B2T

1805
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,200
because no one wants to deal with the queues.

1806
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,360
That's like the major thing, they like remove the veteran queue I think I haven't played

1807
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,360
in a while.

1808
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:38,840
But the main thing is, because 2B2T, a lot of people want to join it, but also it's

1809
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:43,120
not a huge servering thing so you can't have any people on it at once, there's a queue

1810
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:48,120
to get in so you can be put in a 100 player queue and eventually that will tick down and

1811
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,600
then when it's your turn you can get inside the server and you can stay there for as

1812
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,600
long as you want.

1813
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:58,640
But anyway, the main thing that I think is good is that once 2B2T becomes a niche thing,

1814
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,480
I think Minecraft is kind of heading like just generally, obviously it will still be

1815
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:08,080
a big game but it's nowhere near the popularity it had and eventually it will die the death

1816
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,280
just became like a niche game.

1817
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,160
That will be great because then the community will be small again and you'll just be able

1818
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:19,760
to have that rich, small, you know everyone on the server and you know what their deal

1819
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,760
is.

1820
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,880
That's great and I love that and I miss that because I joined before the Russia invasion

1821
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,880
and stuff.

1822
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,560
So I really miss that a small, you know like 30 players on at a time in the middle of the

1823
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,560
night.

1824
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,560
I miss that and I think it will be good.

1825
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,360
Hey, I got two questions here to read, they're very important.

1826
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,560
Okay, these won't take long.

1827
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:44,000
First, meme manifest asks a question, do you agree that Minecraft sex mods should make the

1828
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
boobs more seeable?

1829
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Fit?

1830
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Would you care to comment?

1831
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:58,040
Like wait, I was reading a statistic, wasn't it like back in 2014 on point hub like Minecraft

1832
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:06,400
was one of the most searched terms, like what the fuck?

1833
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,800
It's incredible.

1834
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:12,120
I think if this guy doesn't like the way the boobs look in the Minecraft sex mods, he needs

1835
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:16,120
to get on it and fill that demand himself.

1836
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:19,000
He should be the change he wants to see.

1837
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,440
Well you know what, to be fair meme manifest is asking if they should be more seeable.

1838
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,640
So I guess it's a taste question he's asking here.

1839
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,720
I don't know, it's up to you man.

1840
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,320
Why would you have a sex mod?

1841
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:34,800
Have multiple mods man, make a boob slider, you know, let us choose.

1842
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,400
Artificial Academy 2 mod for Minecraft.

1843
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,400
For Minecraft, yeah.

1844
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,320
Oh my god, you know what artificial academy is?

1845
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,320
Of course.

1846
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,320
Of course.

1847
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,520
What a legend.

1848
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:49,520
Um, Mozilla Fennekin asks another question.

1849
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,040
Do you even lift FitMC?

1850
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,040
Do you even lift?

1851
01:29:53,040 --> 01:30:00,040
Oh god, well I mean Nate, you and I are both browsers of the infamous Fit board.

1852
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,840
Infamous, that's right.

1853
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,760
When I first made my channel a couple years back, I'm like well, I play Minecraft but

1854
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:11,840
unlike most Minecraft players, I actually go to the fucking gym, I just call myself FitMC

1855
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,840
and then like, at first my fans were like oh there's probably some fat guy in his forties,

1856
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:21,240
like he's just playing Minecraft all day and then I did my face reveal and they were just

1857
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,240
like flabbergasted.

1858
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,240
Yep, yep.

1859
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,240
Got him.

1860
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,240
Dad's on those haters.

1861
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:32,240
Like a true Fit boy, I have an Instagram account too so I have to.

1862
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,240
Of course.

1863
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,240
Yeah, you have to.

1864
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Congrats.

1865
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:39,760
You know, there was the original title for this episode was going to be fitness and

1866
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,760
Minecraft.

1867
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,280
There's going to be a double topic, extravaganza for FitMC, unfortunately that's lost to the

1868
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,280
wins of time.

1869
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:50,040
But you might just be on the fitness and have FitMC back.

1870
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,040
Oh, that would be legendary.

1871
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,760
Yeah, if you're fucking lucky because you can play your cards right.

1872
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,760
All these questions are true.

1873
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,760
I have a question.

1874
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,760
Oh yeah, yeah.

1875
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,760
Yeah, yeah.

1876
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,800
By Smickelkun, which do you like more, mining or crafting?

1877
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,120
For me, it's definitely crafting.

1878
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,120
I love crafting.

1879
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,280
I like making things.

1880
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,000
But how does one craft without previously mining?

1881
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,480
That's a chicken and an egg problem here.

1882
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,480
No, no.

1883
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,000
See, what do you like more?

1884
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,920
It doesn't mean you can't do the other one.

1885
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:20,080
I assume crafting includes building and architecture.

1886
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,200
I prefer the crafting.

1887
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:25,320
I think I lean more towards the mining personally because you know I'm a guy who loves grinding

1888
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,840
in video games and mining is just like your death.

1889
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:33,320
When you're mining, you can just be mindlessly doing that while listening to some Let's Play

1890
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:37,120
or just content online or something, whatever, man, podcast.

1891
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:43,200
Mining is just like some chill, just tune out and just start whacking blocks and then

1892
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:47,600
with the occasional little dopamine rush when you find something good.

1893
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,320
You're always mining for a purpose.

1894
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,320
You've always got that.

1895
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:55,240
But when you're in the eight hour grind of mining out your expansive underwater pleasure

1896
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:59,040
dome, then it's nice to just zen out and do that.

1897
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:04,720
I have listened to entire podcasts from beginning to end of an entire podcast while mining.

1898
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,720
Sure, me too.

1899
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,720
The problem with mining though is that you're doing the same repetitive task over and over

1900
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:17,280
which means you have a lot of time to think and that usually leads to an existential crisis.

1901
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,480
Crafting is infinitely better than mining.

1902
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,480
Yeah.

1903
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,480
Okay.

1904
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,480
All right.

1905
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,880
If you've got a lot of demons in your head, you're definitely going to lean on the crafting

1906
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,880
side of this thing.

1907
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,880
What's your suit?

1908
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,880
I think it's those.

1909
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:28,880
All right.

1910
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,880
Is anything else here?

1911
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:30,880
You want to say?

1912
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,880
I think we're good.

1913
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:32,880
I think I'm good.

1914
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,880
All right.

1915
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:40,040
Is there anything you would like to plug here at the end here?

1916
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:47,200
In true fashion of being a fitness slash Minecraft YouTuber, follow my Instagram, Fittemps, Sippy

1917
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,200
Cup, boy.

1918
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,200
All right.

1919
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,200
Sippy.

1920
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,200
Hell yeah, dude.

1921
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,200
Hell yeah, dude.

1922
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,200
It's been fucking great.

1923
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,200
It's been fantastic.

1924
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:58,680
What a great time to have you on here.

1925
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:02,640
It's so nice that you like our content in general and you know, been watching what we're doing

1926
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,400
and great to meet you.

1927
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,400
Great to talk to you.

1928
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,400
Yeah.

1929
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,400
I was trying not to fan boy.

1930
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,400
Same.

1931
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,400
Same.

1932
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,400
I still cannot believe we have fans.

1933
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,400
I just can't.

1934
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,400
One day.

1935
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,400
Doesn't matter.

1936
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,400
Here you go.

1937
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,400
Here you go.

1938
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,400
Yeah.

1939
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,400
Oh, it's so true though.

1940
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,400
Hashtags stay humble.

1941
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,880
That meme with the woman being confused and those math problems around her.

1942
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:23,880
Oh yeah.

1943
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,880
Exactly.

1944
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:25,880
Oh man.

1945
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:29,040
So what should we get at the end of Mages OC with like the fans around it, like the names

1946
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,040
and like the ads.

1947
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,040
Just do.

1948
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,040
Mages.

1949
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,040
That's a good one.

1950
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,040
All right, guys.

1951
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:37,680
I think this is the end of this episode of the Procrastiners podcast.

1952
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,680
It's time for plugs.

1953
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,680
It's time for plugs.

1954
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:43,560
There's only one more thing you have to say and that is goodbye.

1955
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,640
Actually, there are a couple things to say.

1956
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:50,600
For example, if you like our bonus episodes, which I might be editing into this episode,

1957
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,600
I can't remember.

1958
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:56,400
We've got like 12 now, pledged fucking five cheap ass dollars, you cheap piece of shit

1959
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,400
to our goddamn Patreon.

1960
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:03,520
We've got, we've got to chill, my dude, Patreon people, five dollars, all the bonus episodes.

1961
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,520
What was the last one?

1962
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,680
I can't remember.

1963
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,680
We just did it the other day.

1964
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,160
We just did a Radcon 3 recap.

1965
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,160
Right.

1966
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,160
We went truly behind the scenes.

1967
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,160
The Radcap.

1968
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,680
That is what I was trying to say.

1969
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:18,240
There's a little bit of private behind the scenes Radcon discussion in there.

1970
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,240
That's good shit.

1971
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,240
Plus all the other ones.

1972
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,800
So it's a cornucopia of good shit.

1973
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,800
And if you pledged as low as one dollar, you get into the Discord chat.

1974
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,600
So give us as much money as you please and you get to hang out with us some more.

1975
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,000
Hey, send us, follow us at TPCraftSnators on the Twitter.

1976
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,400
We do the questions there for free and if you're not paying any money, then you probably

1977
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,400
won't get your question picked.

1978
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,200
But we put out updates in there stuff, so it's good to follow us there.

1979
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,200
And subscribe and like.

1980
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,520
Please buy our indie game that we just had developed.

1981
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:44,520
It's called Minecraft.

1982
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:49,520
It's a sandbox game, you know, Boxlebase.

1983
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,440
But it's not just sand, there's dirt.

1984
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,320
Yeah, it's time to go, everybody.

1985
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,720
Thanks for listening and we will see you next week.

1986
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,720
Bye bye.

1987
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,720
Bye.

1988
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:19,720
I'm supposed to be working right now, I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm not working.

1989
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I'm doing nothing, my dick I'm jerking, myself I'm sucking, I am an asshole, I am a stupid,

1990
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I've got a deadline, don't want to do it.
