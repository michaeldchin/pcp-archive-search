00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hello, and welcome to another episode, a very special episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's been Saint with me. I've got Gibbontake.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello everybody. Before we get to the special guests, LordaGhost Kickstarter is a day or three days away from being finished. Go check that out. It's important.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you haven't heard about it, you should go check it out. LordaGhost Kickstarter is good. It is a matter of urgent importance that you go and check out the LordaGhost Kickstarter link in the description.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We've got special guests. We've got a special guest. This is a guest that I've been wanting on for years. For years, I've been asking for this individual to come on and talk about their work, which we all know and love. It's Laserbot, the man himself behind Tales Get Strolled. Say hello, Laserbot.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hello, I'm Laserbot.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hey, I'm so chuffed. I'm so glad you're here. And with us, we've also got CeCe, who you remember from a previous episode, is the Tales Get Strolled. I like to call him the brand manager.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
CeCe.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hello.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CeCe.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, and we've also got Cyber Shell, who is a funny guy.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm basically just here to witness the episode live. I couldn't miss this. It's Laserbot, guys. I don't think people even understand. This is a big get. How many other podcasts has Laserbot been on? Name one. You can't.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, actually, that's Laserbot. What other appearances have you done? I know you did the interview with Know Your Meme, which I read, and you were on the Newgrounds panel. Have you done any other podcasts or appearances anywhere on the internet lately?

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, I was kind of weird about doing recordings or anything like that. I just now started doing that.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah. I asked you, I think it was after you left, like I put out the lecture, the Tales Get Strolled lecture, and you left a comment. And I think it was after that I asked you if you wanted to come on and you said you didn't have a microphone or you didn't have the setup to do it.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And I said, damn it. I said, three years from now, I'll get them. And it was true. So let's see. I thought we could talk.

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's really been that long.

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, the lecture was three years ago.

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Maybe not. It's been more than two. I don't know. It's maybe less than three.

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe less than three.

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I checked. I actually checked because I just, I was, I checked on YouTube and me and you, Ben, we have the highest two Tales Get Strolled videos. We're the number one and two fans.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is that, is that true? Is that true?

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wait, who's got more?

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You.

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, fuck you. Okay, sorry.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Excuse me.

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Remember, I told you yours had like 400,000 views.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's a lot of based and it's 300,000.

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, it's newer though. It's catching up. Yeah.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's got a higher rate of acceleration.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's all worth it just to bring in new viewers and new fans of this epic saga.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Uh, you, do you, um, uh, I mean, okay, we talked to CC the other week about running the website and stuff and, and he, well, you, you mean you're right here.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You said you were looking to like do physical prints of books and you talked about like an Alex plushie and stuff.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How is, how is that going?

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The Alex more of a joke. I would like to do it, but I have no idea how I am working, you know, physical edition right now.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Actually me and laser bottle working.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, we're working on it together.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He drew.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I was going to ask late.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Go on, go on.

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He drew the cover for it, which turned out pretty good.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, really? Like recently you did?

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, wow.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah. What do you, I mean, what do you think about?

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you thinking about for the physical release laser bond?

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm pretty excited.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I've kind of always wanted to see it released in physical form.

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I've done that.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I've done, I've printed some, some books myself and done kick starters and stuff.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's fun.

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's fun and exciting.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a lot of work, but it's great.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
People love, people love that physical media.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
People are suckers for it, including myself.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I will absolutely buy a, I will absolutely buy a book version of it if it gets made.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I would love to see it for sure.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How big is it going to be?

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, it's like a pretty, there's a lot of pages.

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, we're doing it volume by volume.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was figuring, I was like, that would be insane if you try to fit it on one thing.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That kind of doesn't make any sense because it's still ongoing anyways.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So yeah.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's such a funny like image in my head of like tails gets trolled.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
All of the volumes stack next to each other on your shelf.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I know it would look so great.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The current plan is, I'll go ahead.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, no, I have nothing to say, please.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The current plan is for the first volume to have the first six chapters, but we might

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
need to change that because I'm having some technical difficulties, which I kind of posted

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
about on Twitter yesterday or the day before.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are you talking about the shipping?

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you talking about international shipping?

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, I figured that out.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You can get it a lot cheaper if you print it on Amazon, but the problem is they only

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
give you like a limit of how much, how like the file size you can upload.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I wanted the pages to be in the highest quality possible.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And it ended up being like, um, like 800 gigabyte.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So right now I'm trying to downsize it so it can fit without a sacrificing quality.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The other services.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I have a question.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll go ahead.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have a, this is a little off topic, but I have a question for, I was looking at my notes

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
here and I've got a question for laser bot in, in, in the, it's a tails gets trolled question

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in the interview with the know your meme.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You talked about the, the initial incident, how a friend of yours was getting trolled

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and that incited you to, uh, to make the first bit of tails gets rolled up till the part

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
where, uh, where shadow kills the trolls.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was wondering, uh, who it, who was it?

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you could tell us who was the friend who was getting trolls.

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I would, but I don't know if the person wouldn't want me to.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If that makes sense.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Damn.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But it would be an interesting bit of trivia to know.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's the kind of factoid that I would love to know, but I guess that makes sense.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Um, my other thing I was curious.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was reading through that interview and I was like, hmm, I wonder.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So you said you, you drew it up till the part where shadow kills the trolls and then a friend

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
of yours suggested sonic going dark and killing the, and killing the trolls.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Um, so the, the first bit you drew ended with they bury the trolls and then knuckles

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and shadow do the high shovel.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Was that the end of it at first?

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Cause right now the chapter ends with sort of like a shadowy figure being like, um,

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
what does he say?

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's like, there, it's a, it's that, that double agent.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh no, the troll double agent, the guy with the headband.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Pory.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's Pory.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And he's like, uh, we'll, we'll have to take care of this or something.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That wasn't there initially though.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That was added later.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, it was there, but I, I still wasn't sure if I was going to.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, oh, so even at the beginning, you included the, like the hook.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I kind of left the door open, but I wasn't sure if I was going to continue it.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, oh wow.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So you had poor Pory is one of the most fascinating characters.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Pory is the one that I find the most mysterious and who I'm like always reading through the

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
comic, I'm always seeing Pory and I'm always like, he's, he seems really important, but

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know what he's doing.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We still don't have a lot of like, uh, we don't have a lot of background info on him

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
or, or like true motivations, you know what I mean?

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think that would mean he's like the first non troll original character that appears

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
in the whole thing.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Uh, yeah.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's right here at the end of a chapter one saying, yes, sir.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The guy who says, find out who's doing the stick.

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I assume he's talking to the troll king.

141
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Maybe.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Um, can you.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Tell me about Pory.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's, what's Pory's deal?

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's neckos and spoiler territory, sir.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Damn it.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There's a lot, there's a lot with Pory, uh, later on.

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And he's got a lot of plot as, as in stuff that's coming up.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What kind of animal is that?

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But yeah, it's, it's, it's like the next arc and on.

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's throughout a lot of the story.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He's got a lot going on with his character.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All right.

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll have to, I'll just have to, uh, be content with, with that for now.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Ben was trying to get spoilers out of him.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm trying to get advanced plot details so we could leak them to the press.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If, if I could, if I could.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oil stuff, but I can't spoil Pory.

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Nice.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's fair.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Fair.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If I could, if I could trick you, if I could trick you into some juicy spoilers,

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
then it would, then this episode would be, uh, it would be a must watch, but, uh,

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
all right, they couldn't do it.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Um, wait, if you plead anything you'd like to spoil, I would love to have it spoiled

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
right now.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Um, after the attack on troll city, the next arc is, uh, about shadows plan.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh my God.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's, uh, that's, that's good news.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Another plan.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's great news for us shadow fans out here.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He's been so long spent time making these plans.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It'll be great to see something finally come to fruition.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I will mention that, um, I will mention that, uh, shadow gets a lot more brutal as it goes

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
on.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, that makes sense.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean, that's sort of his character arc, you know, it's just been like, you know,

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
that's the way to deal with trolls is you just kill them.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You just be violent and he just, he keeps doing more violent crazy shit, but it's

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
like, you know, it's against trolls.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So it's okay.

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In, I thought, I thought it was interesting that you said it again in that interview,

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you said that the, the, the cartoon or the, the, the non original characters are basically

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
original characters that just have the skin of a, of a, of a copyright character.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And you all, and you said that the initial idea for the story, it was the three possible

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
responses to trolling tales is just cry about and be a little bitch.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, Sonic is try and make peace and resolve it.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And, and, and, uh, shadow is, you know, go ham and, and fuck him up and kill him.

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And like, you know, fight, fight back.

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So I guess that's like, I guess shadow is kind of the, I mean, right from the beginning

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
he sort of embodies the like the brutal response to any situation.

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So I mean, sounds good.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Sounds good to me.

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Uh, I think, uh, those are about actually wrote, but he actually drew an upcoming, like a preview

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
of an upcoming page with Mario and shadow.

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh my God.

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I think that's part of a shadows plan.

206
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It'd be nice to see him again.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's been a while since we've seen Mario.

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We got that like special, uh, star or whatever.

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's like, I do love the holy star.

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's been a while.

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That was a while ago and it's, you know, I have no problem with it.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's just the comic has a lot of plot threads.

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So sometimes you just have to put someone on Mario for the back burner for the, you know,

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
next 10 chapters.

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You know what I mean?

217
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I forgot about the holy star and that we haven't seen Mario since then until you just mentioned it.

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's been a while.

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's been a little while since I read.

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm, I'm, I'm very excited for Pory.

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've, I've had my eye on him the whole time.

222
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ever since, since doing, I think my reread before I did the lecture a couple of years ago,

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I, I read through it again and I kept noticing Pory and I was like, this guy, he's definitely,

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
he's definitely important.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Uh, uh, he doesn't, he doesn't get as much screen time as like Alex.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He's not as, uh, he's not as, as iconic.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think as Alex, uh, uh, but, uh, he's, he's, I like him.

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I like, he's very mysterious.

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I totally get so, he's so mysterious.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He's so weird looking.

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He's so weird looking, but like he kind of just acts.

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He does have a very striking visual design.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's like, yeah.

234
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Honestly, he's kind of, he has a striking vision.

235
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sorry.

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, I was just, I was just agreeing with you.

237
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I agree.

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Like Pory is a very interesting character.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And if you like analyze the plot, he doesn't really do that much.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean, he, he sort of like, I mean, any character that's sort of like a double agent type character is always very interesting to me.

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So I don't know.

242
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He's just like, I like Pory too.

243
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I agree with you.

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Um, do you, okay.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I, I have a question.

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I wanted to ask about, uh, some like production stuff, but I think maybe if anyone else wants to ask like, plot stuff about

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Tales of Disrolled, maybe now would be the time before I move into that.

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Since we've got laser brought here, you know, for the, for the, now's the time.

249
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I already, I already know more story details than I want to know.

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I've already.

251
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's one thing I've been is like, I, I kind of like enjoy like experiencing it as a fan.

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You know what I mean?

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like I appreciate everything you're doing CC.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Obviously, you know, I already said this a bunch of times for like, you know, it wouldn't have even come back without you.

255
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So it's not like you have a choice and, you know, getting to know these things.

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Cause you have to know them as the, you know, site admin and, you know, art team guy.

257
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So I appreciate that.

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
All the work you've been putting in.

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So it's nice to be able to just appreciate the series as a fan.

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

261
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Well, I actually go out of my way to avoid spoilers.

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like I don't, I don't want to know.

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Like I don't, I tell them not to show me the page they're working on until it's actually done.

264
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Right.

265
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Here's the thing.

266
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I know some spoilers too, but like, I don't know.

267
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I guess this is a question laser body.

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Cause do you remember when the comic originally ended?

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You did a big sort of, I don't know if it was an interview, but you just posted a bunch of plot details on DeviantArt.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Like, oh, here's what I was going to do with the, you know, the man, the man in the ice and all this stuff.

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know if any of that's still canon.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's mainly what I'm referring to when I said, I know too much spoilers.

273
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's like from that.

274
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Right.

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Some of the plots the same, but a lot of it's changed.

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Right.

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
See, that's the vibe I was getting was that like a lot of the stuff you talked about there wasn't

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
necessarily set in stone.

279
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It was more just like, this is what I was planning on doing at the time I wrote this.

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You know what I mean?

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was drafts.

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Right.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Uh, yeah, I wanted to ask you like how far ahead in the, how far ahead of the comic did you generally have like written before, like as you were drawing it?

284
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Uh, was that consistent or did you?

285
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We had most of it either rodent or at least planned in our heads.

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If that answers your question.

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
By, by most of it, do you mean like all the way to?

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, what's how far do you mean all the way to the end and like how close to the end are we?

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, right now in the plot.

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We had a lot of like most of it planned out even to end.

294
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We know how it's going to end.

295
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you're wondering that, um, yeah, there are areas where it's kind of, it's a draft and it kind of needs to be like polished a bit and, you know, upgraded.

296
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I would say flushed out.

297
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

298
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Here.

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So, so here's my, here's my question.

300
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Uh, so you know how it's going to end.

301
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
How close are we?

302
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
How close in the comic are we to the end?

303
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hmm.

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, we're again in it to the end of the first arc with the attack and, um, okay.

305
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So I can't really say for sure how long the rest of it is because, you know, writings kind of it differs because you can have a writing that's really quick, but it'll take like several pages to actually.

306
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You know, capture that in comic form.

307
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's why, uh, that's why a lot of the covers have the earlier chapter covers have things from the next chapter on it because we thought we would get there sooner than we ended up.

308
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, that's funny, but it makes sense.

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That makes sense.

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Right.

311
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Because you have a very strict page limit that you're sticking to for a long time.

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, that's right.

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes.

315
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Uh, okay.

316
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
For example, I remember.

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So we're close.

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, sorry.

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Mm hmm.

320
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
One example.

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, go on.

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It shows the tales and wearing his defenders uniform in chapter four, but the defenders don't appear till chapter five.

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That is interesting.

324
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I actually never noticed that.

325
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Show the show the cover of chapter four on screen, please.

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can just chalk it up to foreshadowing though.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I mean, it is kind of funny though that the specific chapters though, like it shows things that aren't in the chapter, but you know, as long as they eventually appear, it's okay.

329
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah.

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I think that's actually really cool.

331
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And another example, a more recent example is it shows, uh, like a Hindo's demonic form was in like a page, was in the chapter cover from like five years ago, but he only just appeared in the chapter just now or in this.

332
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Right.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There is a lot of foreshadowing in the comic, honestly, like there's a lot of little details that you might, you probably wouldn't notice your first time around.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I, the one I always remember is the sky changing colors just because like in the background of, uh, it's like, it's like randomly happens the background of characters talking, but then like later you see that helps you keep track of like the timeline.

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Because there's a bunch of concurrent events happening all at the same time.

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So then you see that from like Coyote's perspective and he makes the sky green for just a few panels.

337
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know why I just thought that was really interesting.

338
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I love the sky thing because the, the, like Tails gets trolled is kind of, it's famous for its, it's famous for its visual style.

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Of blue sky green grass.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Right.

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So like by change, like a character that changes the skull, the, the, the sculler of the guy, the color of the sky.

342
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's like color coding the whole chapter.

343
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And I was thinking about if you had it in book form, you could like almost look at the side of the book and you could see the edges.

344
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You could see, oh, these are the red pages.

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
These are when, um, you know, that, that beast is out.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Right.

347
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And oh, these are the green pages.

348
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
These are when the tree is out.

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Those are the white pages.

350
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This is when, uh, Damaro's guardian, whose name I forget is out.

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Mila Docs.

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Uh, Mila Docs.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Actually, that's one thing I wanted to ask.

354
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Uh, laser bot.

355
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How is that actually pronounced?

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's a Mila Docs.

357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay.

358
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Mila, Mila Docs.

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah.

360
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I remember for a very long time, people online just called it Satan because that's what like Damaro was calling it.

361
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But it was interesting to like get the Canon name and everything.

362
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It was really interesting to see that fight.

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Uh, finally be illustrated by the art team.

364
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
After like, I'd seen it in the script form many years ago because I just, you know, I assumed we were never going to get any more pages.

365
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So I just read the 23 script.

366
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I was like, interesting, interesting.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It was really cool to see that.

368
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I realized I was, I was going to ask, uh, laser bot, how do you feel seeing, uh, the, the comic now being drawn by guest artists when you were the one that was drawing it?

369
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Um, you know, before, for years and years.

370
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I love drawing, but it's been really awesome seeing all the, uh, awesome fan art that people have been creating and the art team has been creating.

371
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I really enjoy, enjoy it.

372
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Do you, do you ever not, not to like, I don't mean this to like throw any shade, but has there been any like pages where you've seen it and you've been like, I would have drawn that differently.

373
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Like I would, I would have made it look different.

374
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I feel like I would have done that differently in all the pages, but I'm not complaining.

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I did it.

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I think they did a very good job.

377
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Sure.

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Makes.

379
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

380
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I totally, I totally get it.

381
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Um, it is really cool to see the art style of these like, you know, artists and just like seeing all the characters in just these different art styles.

382
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't know why I just get a kick out of seeing the like the original characters drawn in these like more like hyper detail styles, but I do, I agree with you.

383
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like, it's like, you know, a big part of the charm.

384
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I really love laser bots art and seeing it change over time.

385
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So it's like, I love that he also, you know, he contributes to pages every now and then.

386
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So it's not like it's gone completely or whatever.

387
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And obviously doing stuff like that cover.

388
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I appreciate the guest artists who can do a pretty faithful recreation of laser bot style.

389
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But I also appreciate, you know, like that one, you know, really like rendered painterly coyote chapter.

390
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah.

391
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Again, I'm the same way where I agree.

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's like the, like the, the, the hyper detailed style is really cool.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But I also do appreciate the people who can capture the essence of the original style without it being like the same exactly.

394
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But, you know, at least going for like just capturing the style, you know what I mean?

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Like the rougher style.

396
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That one, that one coyote bit, it's not only good art, like it's well painted, but it's also just funny to see it.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Like to have it suddenly switched to this like, kind of Jojo-esque, like, like painted, like oil.

398
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There is something just inherently amusing about like a fight scene starts and the art just gets like insane all of a sudden.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's like, whoa, like if you didn't know anything, our tails get strolled.

400
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Like you didn't know any of the behind the scene stuff.

401
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You just like got to that part in the comic.

402
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You'd be like, what the fuck is going on?

403
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You'd be like, what the fuck?

404
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, yeah, for real.

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, that was kind of sort of the intention with that.

406
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Like, yeah, it's perfect.

407
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And I mean, laser bot experimented with his own art styles in the past to like, he would draw different pages differently.

408
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And stuff.

409
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So it wasn't like that too out of the ordinary.

410
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I remember it was the first time Melodox appears.

411
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I was like, I think I like kind of put my hands down and I was like, okay.

412
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I started out thinking this comic was like, you know, haha, stupid tails got trolled.

413
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
How ridiculous.

414
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, it's bad.

415
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But then I was like, okay, you know what?

416
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We've come, we've gone places.

417
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This this the person making this has really has really has grown and it shows.

418
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I was like, you know what?

419
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I appreciate it.

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Gotta appreciate that.

421
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But I wanted to say, okay, so you say that we're getting close to the end of the first arc out of how many arcs.

422
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you know how many arcs there will be?

423
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
We got the next one, which is the era of shadow.

424
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That's the next arc.

425
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The era of shadow.

426
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay.

427
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah.

428
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then the next one's more getting more into the war.

429
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And then the war arc, which is like, I think that and then I think there's the last arc, which is where it concludes.

430
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Where's all the.

431
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So I think it's four arcs.

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm not 100% sure you said you said there's this this one and then the era of shadow and then the war and then the conclusion.

433
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So that's four.

434
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, I think so.

435
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Okay.

436
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Can you can you elaborate?

437
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Can you elaborate on the era of shadow or the war?

438
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Well, the era of shadows.

439
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Focusing a lot on the shit with shadow and Mario.

440
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And the lot and the trolls kind of whatever ones that are left after the attack kind of trying struggling and trying to recover from the wreckage.

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Okay.

442
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And the war will be between the trolls and the everyone else, I guess.

443
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Right.

444
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I don't want to go too much in spoilers, but.

445
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Okay.

446
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Fair enough.

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But I will mention that troll city isn't the only troll place like, you know, there's.

448
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That makes sense.

449
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The world building has been like it's an interesting to see these locations like like one time we got a nice zoom out of like the map area and had like a nice shot of the jungle and the troll city and everything in relation to each other.

450
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's kind of nice.

451
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So the other arcs.

452
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Well, will the other three arcs be as long as the first arc has been.

453
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm not really 100% sure on that.

454
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They might be shorter.

455
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I don't know, because it really depends on the thing and all that.

456
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

457
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It is still kind of hard just to like wrap my mind around the fact that every single thing that's happened so far has been part of the first arc and then there's going to be multiple other arcs.

458
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's like some one piece level shit and just going to keep going.

459
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah, true.

460
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm not complaining.

461
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't get me wrong.

462
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

463
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
A thousand years.

464
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Tails gets trolled a thousand years.

465
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Hopefully not.

466
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I wanted to see it complete at some point and you know.

467
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah.

468
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
My last question about that is you said you've you said you've know the arcs and you know how it's going to end.

469
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:11,000
At what point did you I assume it was you and Ember Graham came up with it at what point in the comic did you know.

470
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay, we know how it's going to end.

471
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Like when did you come up with that and like get it all figured out like okay I know the whole arc of the comic.

472
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
We a lot of times we would just kind of when we were prettier.

473
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's kind of hard to say when we started but after we started planning ahead which I would say it was.

474
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't actually don't know how to answer that question honestly we just started planning ahead and we started brainstorming on these different plots and as time went on we just kept coming up with stuff.

475
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
For the story and I just kept building building on to it.

476
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Do you I mean was there ever a moment where you were like oh I know how it's going to end like oh that would be a really perfect way for it to end.

477
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Was there a moment where you like figured it out or had the idea or or no.

478
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah we have me and Ember Graham.

479
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It was a when we were pretty far back actually in the comic when we were we came up with the end for it.

480
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Like yeah I think you know you don't you know about what chapter.

481
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
No it's been like so many years when we were working on it.

482
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I can't I can't remember when I first originally came up when we first you know came up with the plot.

483
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Okay but it's but it's been you've known it for a long time though.

484
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh yeah we've known it for a long time.

485
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Fascinating fascinating I love that.

486
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's that's that was my biggest question actually is like how how like how much of the how much of it was made with the ending in mind.

487
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's interesting like the first few chapters clearly are like just sort of riffing on like one singular idea and like it's clearly coming like being made up on the spot basically like it's like the very first few pages is clear they didn't have all this like stuff

488
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:39,000
that stands out with all this lore but pretty early on you can start to see them plant seeds of stuff that would take a long time to get like developed out you know.

489
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The I had I had one other question from going over the interview you mentioned that those initial trolls that were trolling your friend on DeviantArt you made like accounts you made like shadow the hedgehog and tails accounts to

490
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
troll them back do you still have those accounts or like do those still exist.

491
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
No they don't exist anymore.

492
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Damn.

493
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I would love to find them and read like the comments they left or something.

494
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
If they still existed I would.

495
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah it's been such a long time I don't.

496
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't even know where you know the comments it would be or anything like that.

497
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah.

498
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It was 10 years ago.

499
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh there was there was another part you said that I thought this was really funny you said you and Ember Graham you use the conflict with the troll.

500
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This is when you're talking about like after you've been making the comic but some people were basically trolling you for making the comic.

501
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You know the haters basically you said you would use the conflict with the trolls for research purposes to try to make the trolling in the comic as accurate as possible.

502
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It was a dark experiment we conducted for a long time.

503
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The experience was a roller coaster.

504
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I was wondering if you could remember any any particular moments from those those dark experiments that stick out in your memory.

505
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I was really curious about that.

506
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well it was probably when it was happening was probably during the early stages of the comic all the way up to probably the Gary and the moral fires when all that kind of was taking place.

507
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:27,000
But we were trolled all the time or well a lot of people trying to a lot of people didn't really want us to continue the comic they were trying to.

508
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:41,000
This break us down kind of thing and we kind of got into a little troll war with them a bit and we would make posts to provoke them and then.

509
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh no.

510
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
He cut out for everyone else too right.

511
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yes.

512
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes.

513
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I cut out.

514
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I cut out.

515
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh you're back.

516
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You're back.

517
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay.

518
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Where was I.

519
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You said you would make posts to provoke them.

520
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah and we would have debates with them and really if we just kind of wanted to get as much information about the subject as you know because we were we want to know as much about trolling as we could so we can make the trolls in the comic pretty accurate.

521
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I love that.

522
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I love that.

523
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Did you were there are there any like bits of troll dialogue in the comic that you remember were like maybe directly taken from trolls that you were like quote unquote debating with.

524
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm sure there's dialogue in there but I can't remember at this point.

525
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's been a long time.

526
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
There's not.

527
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Okay there's not maybe like any particular troll in the comic that you're like oh yeah that guy was based on a real person who I had to deal with or something.

528
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Or maybe they all were.

529
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The guy with the the my little pony that dude was he asked to be put in there.

530
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Any we kind of made like a little deal with him is I put me in the comic and I'll promote I'll help promote your your comics so we're sorry we'll put this on this pony guy in there.

531
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Wasn't that the guy who hacked the the deviant art.

532
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
No.

533
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
No that wasn't a different guy.

534
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Okay.

535
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I see who was that guy.

536
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The pony guy.

537
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The pony guy.

538
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I can't remember his name.

539
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Scat.

540
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's kind of embarrassing.

541
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's scat.

542
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Wasn't scat.

543
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's scat.

544
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It was scat.

545
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Thank you.

546
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What why did he.

547
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I don't like what was the the deal that you worked out where he was like yeah I can promote your comic if you put me in tails good stroll.

548
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I wonder if we knew that guy.

549
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I wonder if we met that guy at brony con.

550
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't know.

551
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I interacted with him on Facebook.

552
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And I think one of the people Aubrey who's in the tails gets trolled.

553
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Community who I think cyber shell knows he interacted with him to your action might be information about this on the wiki let me look.

554
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't actually think he ever got around to promoting it.

555
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't.

556
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't think we actually left on like positive terms.

557
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So I kind of we I think we just kind of made fun of them a little bit.

558
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah.

559
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh here we go.

560
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Tails gets trolled org slash wiki scat and Fluttershy.

561
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's just a guy.

562
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh it's just a wait this.

563
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Oh it's it's one of those it's one of those like cell phone like avatar creator things.

564
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's just a guy.

565
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't remember this troll.

566
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I don't.

567
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't remember this because I remember being like really confused.

568
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I was like what the hell is up with this brony guy.

569
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't remember.

570
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I don't want to say it.

571
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
This is Nazi brony guy.

572
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I know some guys like that.

573
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Cat is a slender human wearing a black shirt and pants.

574
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Fluttershy is a yellow horse with a pink mane and tail.

575
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Look at that.

576
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
She is usually seen drooling.

577
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Look at the bottom under trivia.

578
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It explains the whole thing.

579
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Scats design is based off a user on laser bots Facebook page who asked to be in the comic laser bot and his brother Ember Graham had made a deal with him to promote tails gets trolled on their social medias in exchange to be in the comic he had irritated the two and as a result was put in the comic in a more mocking tone.

580
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Note that his laser bots old Facebook has been deleted the actual conversations have been lost time.

581
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's so funny.

582
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Amazing.

583
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Amazing.

584
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Now I know.

585
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Man.

586
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Shit.

587
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I think I'm out of questions.

588
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I think I'm out of TGT questions.

589
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Anyone else got me.

590
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh, go ahead.

591
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No, no, you go ahead.

592
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay.

593
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It's not a question.

594
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I was just going to say I think troll face was also based off of real trolls that he encountered.

595
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, yeah, he was.

596
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I like the troll dialogue.

597
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:38,000
There's a lot of shit in there that it does seem like it's sort of, you know, it's very true to life and just them saying random shit like stop feeding like what the fuck that's just like a hilarious like Boba thing to say for no reason.

598
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Stop feed just just.

599
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, they just they just kind of.

600
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah.

601
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That was more based off of how the trolls I've seen on video games aren't, you know, uninstall, stop feeding.

602
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Exactly.

603
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yep.

604
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That's a pretty good summary of what they're like, honestly.

605
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I do appreciate the trolls of like they're not all they don't sound the same, you know, like different trolls have different weird styles of trolling in the comic, which I think is amusing.

606
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
There's quite a variety of trolls out there.

607
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
We wanted to make sure we showcase that.

608
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Also, there's, um, yeah, the Ark without under under bite troll in in troll city, a very, a very out of left field chapter.

609
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That one.

610
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I really like that one.

611
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah, getting to see seeing the trolls as they see themselves.

612
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You know, they're just trying to.

613
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Society is just very amusing.

614
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Just just to imagine an entire city of trolls is just a funny premise in the first place.

615
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And then just yes, the idea of having like a troll often stuff is good stuff.

616
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
They have a they have a they have a kind of troll hierarchy based on these like contests of who can troll harder.

617
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's like, yeah, that makes sense.

618
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I was actually.

619
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, I buy it.

620
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That was actually one thing I was going to mention.

621
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The troll off dialogue was like a laser bot asked like people for suggestions on like what troll dialogue would be.

622
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And he put it in the troll off between silver and under.

623
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh, which is where like the app, the Adolf Hitler thing comes from.

624
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You literally made Adolf Hitler get off his stick phones in the flames of hell.

625
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He grew up the bottle cheap with right swapped quietly in the corner of the shower no longer secure in his position as the world's least likeable human being.

626
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I guess I guess my last thing that I wanted to ask is, you know, recently, it was announced that you were not going to be actively working on the comic anymore.

627
00:38:46,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You were going to be leaving it to Ember Graham and the the guest artists to to to finish it or really to finish like working on the main body of the comic.

628
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I was wondering if you wanted to talk about that and say, I don't know what led to that decision.

629
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Well, there was multiple things that kind of led to that.

630
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
One of them is just like, yeah, I don't know, I didn't really have the same motivation as I did before.

631
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And I kind of just wanted to kind of have a new start and do something new, you know, fresh kind of change things up, you know.

632
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Did you did you just I mean, is it just that you've been working on TGT for too long and you just retired of it?

633
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I think that's a part of it because it's been working on it for a very long time and it's just kind of.

634
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, sure. I mean, yeah, about a decade now, right?

635
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah, when it started.

636
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay, I mean, that makes sense.

637
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Was there anything else? Anything else about it?

638
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm curious because I just heard about it.

639
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I think it was from CC just heard one day like, oh, laser bots out.

640
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I said, oh, and you know, I assume that meant the comic was canceled, but I was glad to hear that.

641
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
No, no, the other guys are going to continue it because the story is kind of written already.

642
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah.

643
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, yeah. Anything else that contributed to that? I'm curious.

644
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Well, the main thing is I already mentioned, but there was some other stuff going on that I just kind of with my brother, I just kind of wanted to do my own thing.

645
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And, you know, a lot was going on in my life and I kind of wanted to.

646
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I just was done with creating Taylor's Troll.

647
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You don't want to go in any more detail than that?

648
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
No, not really.

649
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Okay, fair enough.

650
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So, I mean, do you...

651
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Well, I was surprised just a minute ago when CC said that you had drawn the cover for the book, which I guess means you're not 100 percent out, right?

652
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I am, but he's making hard copies.

653
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's like, okay, I do want to help with that. That's awesome, you know, because I really wanted to see it in the hard copy form.

654
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I completely understand that.

655
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah. All right.

656
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I mean, do you think you'll be doing any more things like that, just like any more like contributions like that, or was that it?

657
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I mean, I guess if they're doing multiple chapters for the books, are you going to do a cover for each one, probably?

658
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm not sure. I don't know, to be honest.

659
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I guess we'll see.

660
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I guess we'll see.

661
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Well, if there's no more TGT discussion, then I did want to ask you about...

662
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You said you wanted to move on to do other things.

663
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I've seen some of your older stuff that's your non-TGT stuff, and I've heard from CC about some of the others.

664
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Like, I watched through all of Micorat on one summer a few years ago, I think.

665
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So I've seen Micorat, and I think at one point you talked about maybe redoing that, although I'm not sure if you have said that recently.

666
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And then the other day, CC mentioned God's Chosen.

667
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
God's Heroes.

668
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I messed up. Right, God's Heroes, not God's Chosen.

669
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So yeah, tell me about what your plans are post-TGT.

670
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:09,000
We actually, when I stopped TGT before I stopped the last time, in between time before the art team,

671
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I was working on trying to make more Micorat and animation for it.

672
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But it was taking too long, and I didn't get around to finishing it.

673
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But we were writing a lot of new stuff with Micorat,

674
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and we plan on actually eventually making maybe less detailed, very simple art comic strips of that,

675
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
so we can release what we have wrote.

676
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Less detailed Micorat?

677
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah, basically kind of how Micorat looks already, you know, the original.

678
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We're going to probably release it in that kind of format, but in a comic strip.

679
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So I don't plan on going back to Micorat, so I kind of want to release what we have of it.

680
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah, you made Micorat a long time ago, like that was before Tails gets trolled, right?

681
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah.

682
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Can you briefly tell me what was the inspiration behind Micorat?

683
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
What was the idea there that you were like, I know, I'm going to make Micorat, like how did you come up with it?

684
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That's a hard one to answer. It kind of just happened.

685
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It was based off of our imagination, but also a lot of things that actually happened.

686
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:47,000
We just kind of put it in a fictional manner that was pretty hilarious because I've seen a lot of, like, what?

687
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's you and your brothers, right? It's you and your brothers.

688
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, back kind of when...

689
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Go ahead.

690
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
No, that's it. I thought that the characters were you and your brothers, but I wasn't 100% sure.

691
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah, it was back in the time where everybody was calling everything gay and so on and so forth.

692
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
You know how that was back in the olden days.

693
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I know. I know how it was. Not that long ago.

694
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
True.

695
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
God's Heroes.

696
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I can talk about that a little bit, too.

697
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah, if that's what you're focusing on, I'd love to hear more about it.

698
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
God's Heroes is me and my brother Shim Shimo.

699
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We've been working on that.

700
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
How many brothers do you have?

701
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm trying to remember.

702
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I thought Shim Shimo was Micah.

703
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, that's him.

704
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Okay, yeah. I thought Micah was the other one and I was like, wait, there's Laserbot and there's Zagar and there's Micah and now there's Shim Shimo.

705
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Okay, they're multiplying.

706
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I have more stippling than that, but those are the ones that I'm doing projects with.

707
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I see. I see. Okay, cool.

708
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Right, so God's Heroes.

709
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:17,000
God's Heroes is like after the TGT, like the whole story, probably in a distant future kind of thing.

710
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Okay, distant future.

711
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I mean, are there cartoon characters?

712
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You know, in TGT, you have Sonic characters and Mario. No, there's not video game characters and stuff.

713
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
There's not any franchise characters in this series.

714
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay.

715
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
They all died out or something.

716
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I can mention the plot to it.

717
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Anything you want to tell me about God's Heroes, I'm here for it.

718
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Anything you want to tell me, I'm excited.

719
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So the planet is the planet that they're on, which is a different planet. It's similar to Earth, but it's not Earth.

720
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's taken over by Satan.

721
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Actually, is there anything different?

722
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So they're not Earth. It's like an Earth-like planet in our different solar system or something.

723
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah, something like that.

724
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Okay.

725
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It still has Canada.

726
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I was just curious.

727
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That's the universal constant.

728
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Wait, who's from Canada?

729
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Cheedleman got his weed from Canada.

730
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh, that's the trouble though.

731
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I forgot.

732
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Okay, yeah.

733
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's not Earth. It's just a similar planet that also happens to have a place called Canada.

734
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's fine.

735
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Well, Telskis Troll is like a different planet than this planet.

736
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh, okay.

737
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

738
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait. You're saying that Tails gets trolled and God's Heroes don't take place on the same planet?

739
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
No, they don't, but they're very connected.

740
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And some of the characters that were on Telskis Troll show up in God's Heroes.

741
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Okay, I have to clarify.

742
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So Telskis Troll does take place on Earth.

743
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's on the version universe of it, I guess.

744
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I don't know.

745
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I guess it's on Earth, but then again, it's so fucking weird compared to all the other Earths that I don't know, to be honest.

746
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You know what? Yeah, that tracks.

747
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That makes sense to me.

748
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Sure, it's Earth, but it's a different Earth.

749
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay, God's Heroes' different planet, same universe.

750
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Got it.

751
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

752
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And they're connected.

753
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Anyways, the plot to God's Heroes, which kind of starts it is, Satan kind of rules over this planet.

754
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And all of the God's servants are hiding in the sewers away from them because they can turn people who have a weak will into sheep servants.

755
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And the sheep servants are all the...

756
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Sheep servants.

757
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah, they're actual sheep, and they're on their phones all the time.

758
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah, okay.

759
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Okay.

760
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And that's just kind of where the story...

761
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Who are they?

762
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
What are they looking at on their phones?

763
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I don't really... It doesn't really go into the...

764
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Just whatever.

765
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Okay, okay, yeah, they're on their phones.

766
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
They're phone drones, basically, and they serve their...

767
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Phone drones.

768
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah, okay.

769
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm for it.

770
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, and their people on the sewers are basically hoping that God comes down and saves them from the Satan ruling the planet.

771
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And that's kind of where it starts.

772
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
The war starts.

773
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, they're trying... They're basically hiding because the planet's already taken over.

774
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Is it... Okay, so like regular people live down in the sewers because on the surface is Satan and the sheep phone drones.

775
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And a bunch of demons. There's a lot of demons everywhere.

776
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And a bunch of demons.

777
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah.

778
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Sure.

779
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And then so there's a war.

780
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It gets eventually to the war, but eventually God sends down a bunch of heroes, which is why the project's called God's Heroes.

781
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And that's the gist of the plot.

782
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah, that sounds like a setup for an arc.

783
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I see. Do you... I mean, can you tell us who the heroes are?

784
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Well, I showed some of the pictures on... Well, I posted some of the pictures.

785
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yes.

786
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I saw some of them on your DeviantArt, I think.

787
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,000
The dramatic one with the guy with the moon and with the big grin and he's smoking a joint, that guy.

788
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:30,000
That's oil guy and the leader of the people that are sent down to help the people in the sewers.

789
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
CeCe, CeCe, do you have the link to the DeviantArt somewhere? I lost it.

790
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah, I also didn't hear...

791
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Did you post that?

792
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I didn't hear what his name was.

793
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Oil Guy?

794
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Oil Guy. Oh yeah, now I remember.

795
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I want to look at these.

796
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's Marin... Not Marin, not Marin Pan.

797
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Eleazar, throw these up on the screen as we name them, I suppose.

798
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Okay, here.

799
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Oil... Oh yeah, Oil Guy.

800
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oil Guy. Can you continue?

801
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You're trying to... Oh, sorry.

802
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah, I'm trying to post the pictures of the heroes.

803
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Well, some of them are the heroes, some of them are the people in the sewers.

804
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's the Raptor. The Raptors won the heroes.

805
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
The guy with...

806
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The Raptor.

807
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yeah.

808
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
The one who's just a dinosaur?

809
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah, the dinosaur.

810
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah, I see him.

811
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
The guy that has a hat and he's got a big nose and he...

812
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That's Skateboard Guy, he's one of the other heroes.

813
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
He has messed up teeth.

814
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah.

815
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, sure.

816
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Skateboard Guy, okay.

817
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The guy that's got bumps all over his head, he's Bumpy Head.

818
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Bumpy Head?

819
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Oh, yep, now there he is.

820
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah.

821
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Those are the heroes.

822
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And the other one is Bomb King, the guy that looks like a...

823
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
He's a bomb.

824
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That's the heroes.

825
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The guy who looks like he's a bomb.

826
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I don't see that guy.

827
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You don't see it? I thought I had...

828
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't think I see that.

829
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I don't see a bomb guy.

830
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I don't know where he is then.

831
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I thought I uploaded that too.

832
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Oh, wait, no.

833
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I do see him.

834
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
No, I found him.

835
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Bomb King.

836
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh, here it is.

837
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Yeah.

838
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I didn't see him.

839
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I didn't see him on the page, but I saw him in the Seamore by Ultimate Laserbot.

840
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Like, recommended pictures for some reason.

841
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah, the link I just posted has all of them.

842
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, okay.

843
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And the other people...

844
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Got it.

845
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The other people are basically the people that are in the Sewers.

846
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
The other...

847
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Got it.

848
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, there's a big O...

849
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Just the normal people.

850
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
There's big O...

851
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Yeah.

852
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Big O.T. isn't the one in his avatar.

853
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Big O.T.?

854
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's on the link I posted.

855
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yeah, that's the...

856
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
My avatar is based off of...

857
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
He's the one that's later on...

858
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
He's the leader of the fan club that's obsessed with the heroes.

859
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh, God.

860
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
This is making me...

861
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
This is reminding me that I really need to get to the dentist soon.

862
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I think I got a cavity.

863
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Um...

864
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Ah, shit.

865
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Amazing.

866
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I mean, since I haven't read God's Heroes yet,

867
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I can't really...

868
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I don't know what to ask,

869
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
but if there's anything else you'd like to share about it

870
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
or anything else you're working on,

871
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I mean, go for it.

872
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Me and my brother, Micah Shimshamo,

873
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
we've been writing it long.

874
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Micah, aka Shimshamo.

875
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
You guys have so many...

876
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You're a laserbot,

877
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
and then Zagar is also Embergram,

878
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and then Micah is also Shimshamo.

879
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Okay, I just...

880
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I got it.

881
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I got it figured out.

882
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Micah's his real name, though, I think.

883
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yeah.

884
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I see.

885
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Yeah, it makes sense.

886
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We've been writing it for a while,

887
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and we've actually been kind of off and on

888
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
drawing the first book.

889
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Oh, does Micah draw, or does Shimshamo draw, too?

890
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah, we've both been drawing it,

891
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
and it's got 10 chapters on there in the first book.

892
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And we got...

893
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
We're like five chapters in drawing it.

894
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
We're doing the sketching to it,

895
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and we'll eventually do the line work and stuff.

896
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But we're actually planning on releasing it all at once.

897
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It's like, this is season one, book one.

898
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That was gonna be my next question,

899
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
is are you gonna release it all in one big batch?

900
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah.

901
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
That's why I'm taking so long for it to be made,

902
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
because we haven't actually...

903
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
We're still working on it.

904
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
That's gonna be the one that takes a while to make.

905
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And then we can take break whenever we want,

906
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and then get back to it, and, you know...

907
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
If you guys can...

908
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
If you got anything to say, you can go ahead.

909
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I was just gonna say, I believe Shimshamo also

910
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
drew some guest panels for Kail's sketch tools.

911
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Neat.

912
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Do you know which ones?

913
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Laserbot probably knows.

914
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
During Nick and Odie and Demarify,

915
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
he had Roadrunner was fucking with Demaro.

916
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
He drew one of the panels to that.

917
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
A few of the panels.

918
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Demaro had a grin, too.

919
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't know which page that was, though.

920
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Let's see.

921
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Might be hard to find.

922
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
There's so many different pages.

923
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah, it's a little hard to find.

924
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm not gonna dig for it right now.

925
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I might link it to you later or something like that.

926
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I actually have...

927
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Sure, if you post it here, we can put it in later.

928
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I actually have the panels on hand here.

929
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh, really?

930
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh, my God.

931
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Very good.

932
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
The first three were Shimshamo,

933
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and the last one was Ember Graham.

934
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Amazing.

935
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I wouldn't have known.

936
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Well...

937
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Hey...

938
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Fuck.

939
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I think I'm all out of questions.

940
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Okay.

941
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Cybershell, Gibbon,

942
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
what do you guys want to...

943
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
We should just shoot the shit for a while.

944
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Okay, no, no.

945
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I just...

946
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I've read Tails gets trolled,

947
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
not all of it,

948
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
so I was sort of...

949
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And it was a while ago as well,

950
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
so I wasn't really prepared to have questions for this.

951
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I do want to say

952
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
that as an artist,

953
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
trying to draw things,

954
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Tails gets trolled is...

955
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It's like...

956
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Strangely inspirational.

957
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It's just the sort of thing everybody wants to do,

958
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
is to have a huge, sprawling adventure

959
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
with all these characters and doing all these fun things.

960
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It just feels fun.

961
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I can imagine it being really fun

962
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
to come up with all this stuff and draw it.

963
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So...

964
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Thanks.

965
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It's a great comic.

966
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
You should feel good about it.

967
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
True.

968
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
True.

969
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Thank you.

970
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I agree.

971
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It is a very fun comic.

972
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
That's a good way to put it.

973
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It's just lots of interesting things happening,

974
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and it definitely does seem like

975
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
they had fun coming up with all this crazy shit.

976
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Oh yeah, it was really

977
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
coming up on plots.

978
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Just coming up with anything you felt like

979
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and just putting it in.

980
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's like...

981
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
For some of my stuff,

982
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I always think it's got to be good.

983
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's got to be incredible.

984
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I always think my stuff's got to be good,

985
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
but you're shit.

986
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You're not bad.

987
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I didn't mean it like that.

988
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I always throw away too many ideas

989
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
because I'm like, that's stupid.

990
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
That's not going to work.

991
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It has to be like a masterpiece,

992
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
like a fucking Leonardo da Vinci.

993
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Like an over-critical kind of thing.

994
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

995
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
But it looks like...

996
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I mean, maybe I am being rude here.

997
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It seems like you have these ideas,

998
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and you're just like, yeah, I'll just do it.

999
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'll just do it, and it just feels great.

1000
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It feels great reading it.

1001
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That is one thing I love about Tales of your Soul,

1002
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
is you really never know what's going to happen.

1003
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It really feels like anything could happen.

1004
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Any normal comic wouldn't just stop

1005
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
to have multiple chapters of a weed party,

1006
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
but that's why I love Tales of your Soul,

1007
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
because it does do that.

1008
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah, we wanted to make sure there was no limitations

1009
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
when we were creating it.

1010
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We just wanted to do whatever the fuck we want and add...

1011
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
That's a great thing about internet creations and stuff like that,

1012
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
is you really have no limits.

1013
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Your only limit is your own imagination.

1014
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Is it fine that I curse,

1015
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
or is that just checking?

1016
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Sorry?

1017
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Huh?

1018
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Oh, yeah, you can say curse words.

1019
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Oh, yeah, okay.

1020
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
It's fine.

1021
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.

1022
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We're a PG...

1023
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
We're a hard PG-13 podcast, I think.

1024
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's safe to say.

1025
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Imagine you're working for Cartoon Network,

1026
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and you're pitching your...

1027
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
You're like, okay, I got this idea for a cartoon.

1028
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's about Tales, and he gets trolled,

1029
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
and they're like, no, we can't do Tales.

1030
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
He's copyrighted.

1031
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
He's like, okay, we'll replace him with some other guy.

1032
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It's like, okay, go on.

1033
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
All right, all right.

1034
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So in my Cartoon idea, this kid gets trolled,

1035
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
and then his friend says, let's go kill the trolls.

1036
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And they're like, okay, we'll do it,

1037
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
but you can't have any blood, and he's like, okay, deal.

1038
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
And then Mr. Suit, Mr. Executive Man,

1039
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
the entire second season is just a big party

1040
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
where they all smoke weed, and they're like, no,

1041
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
no, your show's canceled.

1042
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
No, you can't do it.

1043
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You can't put that on the air.

1044
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,000
There's like a gradient of artistic expression.

1045
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
On the one hand, you've got Tales gets trolled,

1046
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
and on the other hand, you have Bus Baby.

1047
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You have to choose one.

1048
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Bus Baby.

1049
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Which way?

1050
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Western, man.

1051
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Exactly.

1052
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You know, if it was...

1053
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'd imagine...

1054
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

1055
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'd imagine Tales gets trolled.

1056
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
No, go on, ladies.

1057
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Sorry.

1058
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'd imagine Tales gets trolled as a adult swim kind of cartoon.

1059
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I don't imagine it like...

1060
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yes.

1061
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah.

1062
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Like adult swim.

1063
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Like a cartoon.

1064
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah.

1065
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Like south kids on their channel, or shit like that.

1066
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah.

1067
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I can see it.

1068
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I can see it now.

1069
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah, apart from the rampant copyright infringement type dealio,

1070
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I could totally see this being like an adult swim type of like show,

1071
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
you know what I mean?

1072
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
What if...

1073
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I mean, what if someone just...

1074
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What if they just like...

1075
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
50 Shades of Graded, by which...

1076
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
You know what I mean when I say that?

1077
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I feel like in a perfect world,

1078
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
he should just be allowed to make Tales get trolled,

1079
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and it's like...

1080
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Why is this not covered under like fair use and shit?

1081
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It doesn't make any sense that you should...

1082
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's just so stupid.

1083
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
It gets me heated to even think about it, but yeah, it is like...

1084
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I get what you're saying.

1085
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I mean, we should literally just abolish copyright.

1086
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But in the absence of that,

1087
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
what if somebody...

1088
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
What if some big corporation just 50 Shades did?

1089
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
50 Shades of Graded.

1090
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
We're like...

1091
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Well...

1092
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
No, like...

1093
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
50 Shades of Graded was like a fan fiction of Twilight or something.

1094
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It became its own thing.

1095
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh, yeah.

1096
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah, 50 Shades...

1097
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
They just...

1098
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, and someone just took it and they're like...

1099
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
We're trying to explain this all at the same time.

1100
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah.

1101
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, yeah, and then...

1102
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Yeah, so I mean, just like...

1103
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Okay, we got this story.

1104
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It's all full of these copyrighted characters.

1105
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Well, let's just...

1106
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
We'll republish it, but we'll just...

1107
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
We'll just change the names.

1108
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
We'll just change the characters.

1109
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I feel like...

1110
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I hear what you're saying.

1111
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I just feel like that would be so hard to do with Tales get trolled,

1112
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
because there's like all these copyrighted characters.

1113
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
They're always like doing these things that would be just like...

1114
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
How do you properly...

1115
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I mean, like, okay, you translate Sonic going Super Saiyan, whatever.

1116
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You just have like a stand-in for that.

1117
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
But then, like, a lot of the things, like, how do you have the scene where Bugs Bunny

1118
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
explains that he only does the gay shit to, you know, trick them?

1119
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Like, that would make sense with a character that wasn't Bugs Bunny, you know what I mean?

1120
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's okay.

1121
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's okay.

1122
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
That just makes it funnier.

1123
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Well, like, that it would be not Bugs Bunny?

1124
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Well, because you'd read that and you'd be like,

1125
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
like, what the fuck?

1126
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
This is so weird.

1127
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And then your friend who is, like, in the know and a bigger nerd,

1128
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
then you would be like, oh, yeah, that part.

1129
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
You know that character actually was based on Bugs Bunny?

1130
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
So that's why it used to make sense.

1131
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
But now it doesn't make sense in the remake anymore.

1132
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So to get the full experience of this, you need somebody...

1133
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
You need somebody at your side to say,

1134
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
ah, this character.

1135
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
This character is based on...

1136
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
You should just make each character...

1137
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I mean, isn't...

1138
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Like, get a hue in Photoshop.

1139
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Isn't that what part is, though?

1140
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Get a hue in, like, shift the hue so there's different color

1141
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
and then, like, change the name, like, put the last letter

1142
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
at the front of the name.

1143
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Yeah, just barely do palette swaps since, like, sales gets trolled.

1144
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Yeah, like, why not?

1145
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Like, that should be close enough.

1146
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I mean, that should be enough to get you not sued.

1147
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Isn't that what art is, though?

1148
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Just an excuse to connect to people and talk to people.

1149
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And if it gets to people, be like, oh, that character used to be Elmer Fudd

1150
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
in the original version.

1151
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But they had to change it because of copyright.

1152
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I think it's good.

1153
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Wait, you're saying that's the purpose of art,

1154
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
is to have conversations like that?

1155
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yeah, copyright's good, actually.

1156
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Yeah, just...

1157
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
No, not about copyright, but a thing for people to connect over.

1158
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1159
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And having that conversation where you're like, oh, yeah.

1160
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh, yeah, this is the...

1161
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Oh, yeah, I'm reading the...

1162
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
What's it called?

1163
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'm reading the One Punch Man remake of Tales Gets Trolled,

1164
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
which has had all the copyrighted characters scrubbed out of it.

1165
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And you're like, haha, this part's so funny,

1166
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
but it doesn't make any sense, and it's weird.

1167
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And then someone has to explain to you, oh, yeah,

1168
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
this was actually Kermit the Frog, and that was Mario.

1169
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And then you go, oh, and that's a conversation.

1170
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I was gonna say, it's kind of bold to just make a piece of art that,

1171
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
on its own, Flat Out doesn't make sense, and you can't understand it,

1172
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
unless you know all this shit from, like, the previous version.

1173
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I agree.

1174
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
No, I'm not even saying it's bad.

1175
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I agree.

1176
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I would buy that version.

1177
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I understand.

1178
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I would buy that version.

1179
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Well, okay, the funny thing is, this sort of left the original,

1180
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
but I would also buy that version.

1181
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
There was gonna be Tales Realm, right?

1182
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Like, there was gonna be a version of Tales Gets Trolled

1183
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
with non-copyrighted characters at some point.

1184
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Yeah, we were gonna make that,

1185
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
but we never got around to actually making that,

1186
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
which it wasn't a bad idea,

1187
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
but it was just a concept, really.

1188
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Right.

1189
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah, like I was saying, it seems like it would be more work

1190
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
than you would initially think,

1191
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
just to uncopyrightify everything,

1192
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
but somehow make it all make sense still, you know what I mean?

1193
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Like, it's, I don't know.

1194
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I mean, it's like, is it really worth it to do that?

1195
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
No.

1196
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I mean, in point of fact, the only good reason to do that

1197
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
would be if, like, a network wanted to pick it up,

1198
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and they had to do it.

1199
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
If you're just a guy making it, then, like, no, fuck it.

1200
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
You know what?

1201
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Like, obviously, you don't have to worry about that.

1202
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
You know what the weird thing is, though?

1203
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Like, there's shows, like, like, robot chicken,

1204
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
but I don't know what, like, copyright thing

1205
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
they were able to use.

1206
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I feel like it's one of the hardest parts of this.

1207
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It's the parody thing.

1208
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I feel like a lot of it could get covered under parody,

1209
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
but, like, the title tale gets trolled.

1210
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Well, it's a bit much.

1211
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Well, that's making the physical version just called TGT.

1212
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
See, that's a good workaround.

1213
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
A lot of, like, bands will do that when they have a name

1214
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
that's, you know, they're not allowed to use it anymore.

1215
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
They'll just go, oh, I'll just go by the acronym,

1216
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
so our fans still know it's us,

1217
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
but then we don't have to have the copyrighted character's name

1218
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
in the title of our thing, you know what I mean?

1219
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Yeah.

1220
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
If you ask me, if you're just someone printing books on your own

1221
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and distributing them on your own,

1222
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I don't think you have to worry about Sega cracking down on you

1223
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
because your book had...

1224
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Luckily, yeah, Sega is not so bad about this in particular.

1225
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
There are like a ton of characters in there, but...

1226
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Tails is not a copyrightable name.

1227
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
That's just an English word.

1228
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah, I know.

1229
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
It's just that it also happens to be referring to Tails,

1230
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
the character from Sega.

1231
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
If it was like Miles Tails Pro gets trolled,

1232
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
then it would be different.

1233
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I hear what you're saying.

1234
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You're right.

1235
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
The name, like, just Tails.

1236
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You can't just copyright Tails, period,

1237
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and, like, have that under all circumstances.

1238
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's just, I mean, like I already said,

1239
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I completely think you should just be allowed to do it

1240
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
and not have any problems ever at any sort of degree, but...

1241
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You could switch it around.

1242
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You could call it Troll Tails,

1243
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
because that would be a pun as well, and it would work.

1244
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Yeah.

1245
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It was Tails about trolling.

1246
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Right.

1247
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
There's a lot of little things you can do.

1248
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
It's just, like we already said, it's like,

1249
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
it's a lot of work.

1250
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Is there even really a point?

1251
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Like, unless you're going to get picked up

1252
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
for like a network, yeah.

1253
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Right.

1254
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
At the end of the day,

1255
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
unless we're talking about, like, something like that,

1256
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I don't think it matters at all.

1257
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I'm just speculating on, like,

1258
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
if it ever were to get a remake like that,

1259
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I honestly think it would be hilarious,

1260
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
and I would treasure it.

1261
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I don't...

1262
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It looked like Tails gets trolled the legal version.

1263
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It really depends on how they would do it.

1264
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Yeah.

1265
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The execution.

1266
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I'm curious about Tails...

1267
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
What was it, Tails Realms?

1268
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I don't think I'd heard of that.

1269
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Tails Realms.

1270
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
What was that?

1271
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Can you tell me more about Tails Realms?

1272
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Well, we didn't really have anything on it other than we were...

1273
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
We were in the process of drawing on paper

1274
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
some of the characters,

1275
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
what they might look like if they were original characters,

1276
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
but I don't have any of that on the computer or anything.

1277
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I was going to ask,

1278
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
if you have those pictures, I'd love to see them.

1279
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I would be interested in seeing those designs

1280
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
if you ever, like, found them or wanted to recreate them,

1281
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
but it's not necessary.

1282
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That's just an interesting piece of trivia, though,

1283
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
because I knew that it was an idea.

1284
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I didn't even know you got that far,

1285
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
like, drawing the character designs.

1286
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I thought I didn't even get that far.

1287
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
That was really all it at was, is some sketches,

1288
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and I don't know exactly where they are right now.

1289
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Right.

1290
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I remember that was during the period

1291
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
when it was, like, polished, was going on,

1292
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
and you were trying about a bunch of different stuff.

1293
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Like, there was also a censored was briefly a thing,

1294
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
but then that was just dropped pretty early on.

1295
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Yeah, we dropped it,

1296
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
because we realized there was no way we could censor it.

1297
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You just can't, right? Exactly.

1298
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Like, you can do the first few pages

1299
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
just by changing the words and stuff,

1300
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
but at a certain point,

1301
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
you just can't censor it without changing way too much stuff.

1302
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah.

1303
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I tried, like, continuing it myself,

1304
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
because I thought it was an interesting idea,

1305
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
but once you get to chapter four with, like,

1306
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
blood everywhere and stuff, like, you can't really...

1307
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
You can't really...

1308
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Right.

1309
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Like, you could do a version that just censored the dialogue,

1310
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
but, like, what's the point

1311
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
if there's still all this horrific violence

1312
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and there's, like, drug use and sex stuff later on?

1313
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
It's like, I mean,

1314
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
what's the point in trying to censor it really?

1315
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yeah.

1316
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You, like, four kids dub of one piece, like...

1317
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
It was funny, like, I just Photoshopped the legs back together

1318
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
and just, like, ooh, I got a bruise.

1319
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Exactly.

1320
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It would be funny.

1321
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Well, that's sort of what happened,

1322
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
like, there's a little bit of violence in the pages they did,

1323
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
but it was just, like, bloodless,

1324
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and it was just, like, the stuffers was, like,

1325
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
stuff was supposed to get broken in half,

1326
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
like, just nothing happened.

1327
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
You could use the round with the Dragon Ball Z round,

1328
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
have changed the color of the blood.

1329
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
What if Knuckles invites,

1330
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Knuckles invites all the prostitutes

1331
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
to all Cheeto Man's prostitutes together?

1332
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
The hangman.

1333
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And they all hug and give each other a cold.

1334
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm just trying to imagine how a censored version

1335
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
of the Corpse pipe page would look,

1336
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
like, how could that even possibly be conveyed

1337
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
in the other one?

1338
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Do you know what I mean?

1339
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I would think just to just show Tails' reaction

1340
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
without actually showing the pipe.

1341
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Right.

1342
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Wait, the Corpse?

1343
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Corpse pipe?

1344
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Well, it would be very vague if it wasn't done, right?

1345
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Yeah.

1346
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Right.

1347
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, that's the only problem.

1348
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Remind me.

1349
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
After the Cheeto Man, the party, you know,

1350
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
the plan goes off to give him all STDs,

1351
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
so he has to kill all his hoes,

1352
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and then there's just that one brutal page.

1353
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Oh, like, the big, the big masquerade.

1354
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah, the masquerade.

1355
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It's in a weird, like, pipe thing.

1356
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
That's why I call it the Corpse pipe,

1357
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
but it's like, yeah, it is basically a masquerade,

1358
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
if you're right, that's a better,

1359
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
that was a more apt description of it.

1360
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Death Pit.

1361
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I didn't even notice that it was in a pipe.

1362
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The Death Pit.

1363
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
The Death Pit.

1364
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
My favorite page.

1365
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
That was the last time we saw Tails for so long.

1366
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Only recently, we sort of, like, got that page of him,

1367
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and he's like, oh, shit, back to Tails.

1368
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
That was the other thing people used to get really upset

1369
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
about back in the day.

1370
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I remember on something awful.

1371
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Anytime, like, Tails wasn't on,

1372
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
it wasn't in a page for too long,

1373
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
people were like, where's Tails?

1374
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I don't want to see these original characters,

1375
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I only want to see Tails.

1376
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Okay, pitch for the next chapter.

1377
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Anytime Tails isn't on screen,

1378
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
all the other characters should be asking,

1379
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
where's Tails?

1380
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Where's Tails?

1381
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
That's basically how it was for a while

1382
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
on something awful.

1383
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Like, it was a very interesting period

1384
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
because people were very, like,

1385
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
just dismissive of it at first,

1386
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and then there were people who were like,

1387
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
went out of their way just to troll,

1388
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
you know, laser-bond me, like, oh, this is bad.

1389
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But then, after, he just kept going.

1390
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Like, he didn't quit, he just kept going.

1391
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Eventually, people were just, like,

1392
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
posting the new page and just, like, excited to read it.

1393
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
This is bad.

1394
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
This is bad.

1395
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
This is bad.

1396
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Hey, why'd you stop updating?

1397
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I want more.

1398
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Give me more.

1399
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
That's basically what happened.

1400
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So I can call it bad.

1401
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But I want it.

1402
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Basically, that's so weird,

1403
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
that's like, that's really what happened.

1404
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
The funny thing was, it was like,

1405
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
they didn't want to admit that they liked it.

1406
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Right.

1407
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah, people were in denial about it.

1408
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
They're like, I just, I'm ironically reading it.

1409
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And people kept being like, guys,

1410
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
like, I'm just, this chapter,

1411
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
like, I really ironically liked this page, guys.

1412
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I really, yeah.

1413
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It's like, I mean, I used to look at the

1414
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
something awful thread about control all delete.

1415
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And like, every time, I mean,

1416
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
control all delete is a legitimately bad comic.

1417
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Right.

1418
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
But every time he would post a new comic,

1419
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I've never heard of it.

1420
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Everyone there would jump on it.

1421
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
That's the danger of a hate, like, watching.

1422
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
This is like, this is literally how,

1423
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
like, Darkseid feel like, sustains himself.

1424
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
He doesn't even have fans.

1425
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
He only has people who hate him,

1426
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
but they, like, love to hate him.

1427
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So they give him money,

1428
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
so they can control him into keeping on doing what he's,

1429
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
it doesn't make any sense,

1430
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
but this is literally how part of the internet works now.

1431
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Every time a new control all delete came on,

1432
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
all of the something awful goons would jump on it.

1433
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
They would all post it.

1434
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
They would all be like, oh, it's so bad, guys.

1435
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
This is so bad.

1436
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Here, they would do extensive rewrites of it.

1437
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
They would make edits of it.

1438
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Yeah, the edits.

1439
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I remember every comic, there'd be some fancy fucking edit.

1440
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And people were spending so much time on it.

1441
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Pages and pages.

1442
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
There were guys who had like, okay,

1443
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
let's do our thing.

1444
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
We're like, we'll take, we'll try to take out dialogue

1445
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
and rewrite it to make the dialogue more snappy.

1446
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And, you know, people would post like,

1447
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
guys, we are the CAD fans.

1448
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
We are the fan base.

1449
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
This is what we've become.

1450
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
They're the ones getting the most excited about the new pages

1451
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and stuff.

1452
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I can't believe CAD is still fucking going.

1453
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
They are.

1454
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
God, is it?

1455
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Yeah, it's still going.

1456
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It was like, I don't want to get an old CAD tangent,

1457
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
but it ended and then it rebooted with a new universe.

1458
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
It was some bullshit.

1459
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I knew that that happened, but that was a long time ago.

1460
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It must.

1461
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yeah, it was a while ago, actually.

1462
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I will never get over the fact that the comic,

1463
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
the original run literally ended with the universe resetting,

1464
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
but it wasn't, he even had to press a button

1465
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
to reset the universe.

1466
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The button wasn't control or delete.

1467
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It was just a red button and everyone was like,

1468
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
why wasn't it control or delete?

1469
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
He should have pressed control or delete

1470
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
to like reset the universe.

1471
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
He's like, it's the most obvious missed opportunity.

1472
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
What a fucking hack.

1473
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
What a fucking hack.

1474
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It was like the most embarrassing thing ever.

1475
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Buckley, you fuck.

1476
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I'd be like, if you made a comic called,

1477
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Tails gets told and Tails never got trolls.

1478
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Right.

1479
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I love that Tails gets trolled.

1480
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Exactly like that.

1481
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
The first page.

1482
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
That is really a descriptor of what happens on the first page.

1483
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I guess he continues to get trolled in general,

1484
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
but it's that really...

1485
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It's the inciting incident.

1486
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It is the inciting incident, definitely, for sure.

1487
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
It's the call to action.

1488
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
It's the call to action that incites the hero's journey.

1489
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Exactly.

1490
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
You're right.

1491
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It works perfectly fine as that kind of title,

1492
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
but it is just funny.

1493
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Later on, you're watching this crazy Coyote flashback

1494
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
to this Satanist stuff and then it's like,

1495
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
what was this about again?

1496
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Oh, yeah.

1497
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Tails getting trolled.

1498
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Oh, yeah.

1499
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Tails miles per hour from Sonic the Hedgehog.

1500
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Yeah.

1501
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I love that.

1502
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
What was it called in Berserk when the whole,

1503
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
you know, when Griffith ascends?

1504
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Eclipse.

1505
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
The eclipse.

1506
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
That's the beginning.

1507
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
The very first page of Tails gets trolled

1508
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
is Tails is Eclipse from there.

1509
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
It is amazing how he's just like,

1510
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
he's walking along and then these trolls,

1511
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
they just start insulting him

1512
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and it destroys him emotionally.

1513
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
He's like sobbing, sprinting away.

1514
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Like, he can't handle it.

1515
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I looked at the first page and there's something

1516
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
really compelling about how the fact that,

1517
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
like, left to his own devices,

1518
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
no one's bothering him,

1519
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Tails is just walking along going,

1520
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
la, la, la, la, la, la.

1521
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah, that's the first line of the comic.

1522
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I love it.

1523
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
He's so happy.

1524
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I think Laserbot wanted to say something.

1525
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I forgot.

1526
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I forgot what I was going to say.

1527
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Oh, fuck.

1528
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I just got a little excited there.

1529
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I wanted to mention that I say,

1530
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I quote that Kermit line all the time.

1531
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Have you ever been bitch slapped for lack of listening?

1532
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Lack of doing what you're told?

1533
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Because I'm not far from slapping you.

1534
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
But people often forget.

1535
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I say it to my wife, if you know what I mean.

1536
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
People often forget that after he says that he says,

1537
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
did you see what I just did wrong there?

1538
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Because he's showing Tails what a lack of patience is.

1539
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Does he?

1540
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Honestly.

1541
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I don't remember.

1542
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Is that right?

1543
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yeah.

1544
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Fuck.

1545
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So you're saying that I missed the point of the scene?

1546
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Yeah.

1547
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Kermit does a lot of experimental things with his choice of words.

1548
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Yeah.

1549
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Well, yeah, I really love that page of Kermit with the giant,

1550
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
just the biggest fucking wall of text.

1551
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And it's like a metatextual thing where you have to deal with

1552
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
your own lack of patience and read the whole fucking thing.

1553
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And if you don't read it, if you just skip it, I mean,

1554
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
you can do that, but you'll miss out on an important lore

1555
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and a flashback later on.

1556
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
You'll fail the test.

1557
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I don't blame you, Ben, because that Kermit line became

1558
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
like a meme.

1559
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And people, like, re-posted it, but they took out the last part

1560
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
where he says, did you see what I just did wrong there?

1561
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I mean, it's just a really funny thing to say.

1562
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah.

1563
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And I...

1564
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yeah, a couple with the image.

1565
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Yeah, I mean, he's doing...

1566
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
So Kermit, so Serene.

1567
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So Serene.

1568
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Hmm, have you ever been bitch slapped for lack of listening?

1569
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Lack of doing what you're told?

1570
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Because I'm not far from slapping you.

1571
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
There it is.

1572
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah, I was about to post that.

1573
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Oh, did you see what I...

1574
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Yeah, they do.

1575
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
They edit out.

1576
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
They edit out the other.

1577
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And I got it.

1578
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah, I googled it.

1579
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I googled it and I found the edited version.

1580
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
It's so crazy to me how far, like, TGT reaction images have gone.

1581
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Like, the big one, obviously, is that Tom reaction face.

1582
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I had no idea.

1583
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I had no idea how far that had spread and how many, like, normies have seen that

1584
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
and they had no idea what it's from, you know what I mean?

1585
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The Bugs Bunny panel has gone pretty far, too.

1586
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
But the Tom face reaction, I was surprised how...

1587
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Like, you can see that.

1588
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
You can find that anywhere.

1589
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I don't really...

1590
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I don't really think about the Tom reaction face.

1591
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I was surprised to see that that's kind of, like, the biggest meme.

1592
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Yeah, that's what I agree.

1593
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Like, that was just a random...

1594
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Like, it's a funny panel.

1595
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Don't get me wrong.

1596
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
But I agree.

1597
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I don't think it's going to my, like, top panel or, like, what I first think of when I think of it.

1598
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
That's why I was surprised that it got spread so far.

1599
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
It is a very nice expression, but, like...

1600
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I think there's a lot of great expressions like that in the comic.

1601
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Oh, is it...

1602
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I can't remember.

1603
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Is it, like, a good expression, like, devoid of context?

1604
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Do the other ones require context?

1605
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Is that probably why it's spread, if it was, like, just a funny face?

1606
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It has a very, like, shocked...

1607
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It has a more...

1608
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's definitely more applicable, you know what I mean?

1609
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Like, you can see what that one would've...

1610
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Simple, like, I can't believe you posted this sort of face.

1611
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah.

1612
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Unsettled Tom.

1613
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Unsettled Tom.

1614
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Yeah.

1615
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
But, yeah, you'll see a lot of people say that they didn't know this was from TGT.

1616
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
They'll be like, I thought it was from the show or, like, something, and I'm like...

1617
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It's just so obvious to me.

1618
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Like, you just look at the art side.

1619
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
It's like, that clearly tells you it's true.

1620
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It doesn't...

1621
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
It definitely doesn't look like a classic.

1622
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I know.

1623
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It doesn't look like any other type of commentary media.

1624
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I agree with you, but I still see people say that.

1625
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah, it's weird.

1626
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And I saw the other day someone drew porn of it, and that's pretty...

1627
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh, that face?

1628
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
This reaction page of this one panel.

1629
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Jesus Christ.

1630
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I've posted, but it's not safe for work, so I don't know if you'd want to see that.

1631
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Oh, we probably can't show it on the show.

1632
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yeah, I was going to say, I want to see it.

1633
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
You don't have to put it in general or anything right now.

1634
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Like, obviously, I know you can't show it in the episode, but that's interesting.

1635
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
People should know that exists either way.

1636
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Hey, Marin, put it up and blur it.

1637
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Pixelate it.

1638
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I'll try to find it.

1639
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I'll try to find it.

1640
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Someone posted it in the server the other day.

1641
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Oh, here it is.

1642
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Here's the link.

1643
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
You can click on it if you want, but...

1644
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Oh, my God.

1645
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I have to admit, I love...

1646
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Oh, it showed the thumbnail.

1647
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Okay, that is ridiculous.

1648
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Oh, yeah.

1649
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yep.

1650
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
There it is.

1651
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I was going to say earlier, one of my favorite parts about Tales of Troll is just all the fan art and stuff.

1652
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And yeah, it doesn't disappoint.

1653
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
There's so much crazy fan art out there.

1654
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Yeah, but the thing is, the guy who did that probably didn't even know it was from Tales of Troll.

1655
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Yeah, it probably just was like, this will be a great meme.

1656
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
This will get me lots of clicks because people know what this meme is.

1657
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Yeah.

1658
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
What do you think about that laser bot?

1659
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Oh, the memes are the fan art.

1660
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Oh, the memes.

1661
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Some of them are pretty good.

1662
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Some of them I'm like, meh.

1663
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
But the main ones are actually pretty well.

1664
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
What's a dumb one that you think is dumb?

1665
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I actually haven't looked at that meme in a while, so I would have to look through them and be like, man, that one's kind of dumb.

1666
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
But right the second I don't have one in mind.

1667
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I'm trying to think if I can think of any TGT memes that I don't think are that funny.

1668
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah, they're...

1669
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Are there any lame ones?

1670
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
There are some, but I can't think of them from the top of my head.

1671
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I mean, if they're lame, then I didn't laugh, so I probably wouldn't remember them.

1672
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I just remember the good ones.

1673
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Yeah, I'm looking at the comments on this porn image.

1674
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
A couple people know that it's a meme.

1675
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,000
One comment does say he says Tom gets trolled, so he knows.

1676
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
The other ones don't seem to know.

1677
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
This one guy is like, look at this fucking square.

1678
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Alright, look at this fucking square.

1679
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:29,000
He sees a picture of a cat getting fucked with a weird face, and they freak out.

1680
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
This is the most disturbing thing they've seen in the entire life.

1681
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
There's really nothing you can say to a comment like that besides, like, what is this, your first day on the fucking internet?

1682
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Like, what's going on here?

1683
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I've got some...

1684
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
This is vanilla.

1685
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
If you don't even get the meme reference, then this is, yeah, beyond vanilla.

1686
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
It's just like regular fur.

1687
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's like, how could you not know this exists?

1688
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,000
It's just regular old cartoon sex with a kind of weird facial expression.

1689
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Man, you're gonna be subject to worse horrors in this life.

1690
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Yeah, and the Tom gets trolled comment was posted today, so it was probably someone from the Discord.

1691
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It was probably me. Yeah, it was me.

1692
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Yeah, it was me, too.

1693
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Sorry, sorry.

1694
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It was me, too, okay.

1695
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Fuck, man, what a good comment. Am I right, dudes?

1696
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yes, yes you are.

1697
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Hell yeah, hell yeah.

1698
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Oh, yeah, man.

1699
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah, man, yeah.

1700
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Well, now what?

1701
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
How's everyone's day gone?

1702
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
How's everyone's life?

1703
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Are you relaxed?

1704
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Is the weather okay where you're doing?

1705
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Hope it's not too hot.

1706
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's the height of summer.

1707
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
It's the dog days of summer.

1708
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
You know why they call it the dog days?

1709
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
It's because the sun is passing by the dog star.

1710
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
That's why they call it that.

1711
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I have never heard any of those expressions before.

1712
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You never heard the dog days of summer?

1713
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
No.

1714
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
No.

1715
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
It's not a common expression.

1716
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Okay, well, whatever.

1717
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
You learned something today.

1718
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Anyway, how's life?

1719
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I'm doing pretty good.

1720
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Laserbot, tell me how you're feeling.

1721
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Just what's going on?

1722
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
What's going on?

1723
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Tell us about your life.

1724
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I'm pretty chill right now.

1725
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Like I said, I'm sick right now, but I'm getting passed out.

1726
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Oh, no.

1727
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You don't have the coronavirus, do you?

1728
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Oh, no.

1729
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I'm pretty sure I don't.

1730
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I had, I paid an artist to do some PCP related work.

1731
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And the moment that I paid them, they contracted the novel

1732
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
coronavirus.

1733
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Well, that's suck.

1734
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I hope they're doing all right.

1735
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I hope so too.

1736
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Your brother said he was sick too, which is why he hasn't written

1737
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
any more tales gets trolls.

1738
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Yeah, everybody's sick in our night.

1739
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Everybody around is sick.

1740
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
We all got each other sick.

1741
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Sad, sad.

1742
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I don't know anything else.

1743
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Anything else going on?

1744
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Any hot gossip to share?

1745
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Nothing hard.

1746
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I mean, the only thing that's been on my mind is the Lord of

1747
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Ghost Kickstarter, which if I check, this would come out

1748
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
on the 16th.

1749
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
So there's like one, two, three, four, five days until it would

1750
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
be over by the time this goes live.

1751
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,000
If everything goes, if everything goes well, it might not

1752
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
even be necessary by the time this episode comes out to say

1753
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
it, but I do want to say to anyone listening, Lord of Ghost

1754
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Kickstarter, if you want the plush because I want the plush,

1755
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I don't care that I'm going to have to pay for a shipping from

1756
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
the UK.

1757
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'll pay.

1758
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'll pay anything.

1759
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Right.

1760
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I'm what we, I'm what you in the business call a whale.

1761
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Right.

1762
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
If you want that, if you want that plush, a great a sucker.

1763
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
If you want the plush, I went and I upped my pledge by the,

1764
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
it was, it was 45 pounds was going to be the increase in

1765
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
price for the shipping plus the plush.

1766
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I increased it by 50.

1767
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Just because if I assume that if I think that if everyone who

1768
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
wants the plush ups their pledge, that will probably go a long

1769
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
way towards actually hitting the goal.

1770
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It will, which the plush becomes possible.

1771
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It will.

1772
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I expressly said not to do that just, just for the moment,

1773
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
because I didn't want to like to give.

1774
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Well, I did it.

1775
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
It's fine.

1776
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Like if you, if you know you're willing to take the risk,

1777
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
it might not get funded.

1778
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But well, if it, if it, if it's, if it's five, if it's five

1779
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
minutes from hitting from, from completion and it's nowhere

1780
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
near hitting the plush goal, then maybe all.

1781
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yeah.

1782
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I mean, not everybody will be able to.

1783
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Yeah.

1784
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Wait.

1785
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
What is the, what is this?

1786
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
What are you guys talking about?

1787
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Oh, this is, it's one of my comics, the Lord of ghosts,

1788
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
which is about a little blob ghost.

1789
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Let me get a link for it.

1790
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Oh yeah.

1791
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
To me and I'll look at it later.

1792
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I've, I've, oh, you should definitely read.

1793
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
You should read Lord of ghosts.

1794
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It's very funny.

1795
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
And it's very, it's, it's, it's, it's cute.

1796
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Give is a, give makes, give has a website with comics on them.

1797
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I actually, it's, it's like some sort of a way.

1798
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
It's like a really badly made website.

1799
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I don't know anything about HTML or any code, but.

1800
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
You know what?

1801
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It works.

1802
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
It displays images.

1803
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
It does its job.

1804
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah.

1805
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
That's how, that's how the tails gets trolled.

1806
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
So it used to be.

1807
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
And kind of still is.

1808
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah.

1809
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And here's the plush that's been working on.

1810
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Yeah.

1811
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
The Lord of ghosts is like a little comic and it's,

1812
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I wanted to, to kickstart a physical version of it.

1813
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
So I can have it on my shelf and people can be like, oh,

1814
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I own the thing.

1815
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And it's, it's been going well, the Kickstarter.

1816
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
We've reached the goal.

1817
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
We've reached stretch goals.

1818
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
The last one is this plush.

1819
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And the, yeah, it'll be, I, I, I'm excited.

1820
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I've been excited.

1821
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Yeah.

1822
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Good luck to you on that.

1823
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I, I wish you the best of luck.

1824
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Thanks.

1825
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It will have, by the time this episode comes out,

1826
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
there will be, I think it's three,

1827
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
going to be three days left on that.

1828
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Three, four days.

1829
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yeah.

1830
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Yeah.

1831
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I, I upped my pledge, even though technically we haven't hit the goal

1832
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
for the, for the plush yet.

1833
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I think if more people do that, we will hit it.

1834
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I mean, I'm, I plan to just be there when, you know,

1835
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
the timer runs down to zero.

1836
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And if it's still, you know, a thousand plus dollars away,

1837
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
when it's like a minute out from ending, then I'll be like,

1838
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
okay, nevermind.

1839
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I'll take the 45 bucks with the pounds back.

1840
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Yeah.

1841
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
But like, I think it'll, I think it'll probably hit it.

1842
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And like, if it doesn't, I can take it back.

1843
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
But for the moment, I'm like, no, I'll put,

1844
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I'll put the money there because I intend to spend it.

1845
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Right.

1846
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And I, and it's going to help us push it over the,

1847
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
because we got to get it over the threshold.

1848
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah.

1849
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So I hope others will consider doing the same.

1850
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I checked the, I made a Twitter poll to like gauge how many people

1851
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,000
would like, like add that much money to their pledge in order to get the

1852
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
plush.

1853
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And I think if I look at the results so far, I think it's close to being

1854
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
enough.

1855
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
If they all,

1856
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Like the proportion.

1857
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah.

1858
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
The proportion.

1859
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Like a lot of people said no is too expensive, which I expected.

1860
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Cause it's a, it's a shipping to America.

1861
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
It's a premium item.

1862
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah.

1863
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Shipping and just a plush in general is quite expensive.

1864
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Well, hey, we got a hundred votes at the moment.

1865
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
35% say yes.

1866
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
65 no.

1867
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
So that's 35 people.

1868
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
35 times.

1869
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So that's so about a third.

1870
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
So if a third of the people that were pledged increase their pledge by

1871
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
45 times like 45.

1872
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
So that's 1,535 pounds.

1873
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
That would, I think that would get us to the, to the point, but I don't

1874
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
know how many of these yes votes are like in the UK or elsewhere.

1875
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So not sure yet, but still got nine days to go.

1876
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So it's probably, it's probably possible, probably very possible.

1877
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Listen audience, why don't you think about it this way?

1878
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
This is going to be a limited edition plush.

1879
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's only going to go up in value.

1880
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
So if you don't buy it now, you're losing money in the long run.

1881
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It doesn't make sense to not buy it.

1882
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
You should literally take out a loan right now to buy the plush.

1883
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
You should buy it on credit because you will pay it.

1884
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
You will be able to pay that back and more.

1885
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Listen, if we have any kids in the audience, first thing you're going to

1886
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
want to go grab your parents credit card right now, enter all that

1887
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
information in the Kickstarter and just give all that money.

1888
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Yeah.

1889
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And then get off the Internet right away and don't come back.

1890
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Everyone says, oh, Bitcoin, oh, perfect store of value.

1891
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Oh, it can only go up.

1892
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Fuck that.

1893
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
The Lord of Ghost plush is the ideal store of value because there's

1894
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
only going to be like 40 of them.

1895
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Bitcoin's not even real.

1896
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It's just a bunch of fucking numbers.

1897
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Like you can't even hold it.

1898
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
You can hold the plush.

1899
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You can't even hug it.

1900
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
You can't, you can't, you can't hug a Bitcoin.

1901
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
So what, so what good does it, what does it serve a man?

1902
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
We all know with the next 10 to 15 years, the whole Internet is just

1903
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
going to go down permanently.

1904
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And we're all going to have, the only thing we're going to have left is

1905
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
our plush collections.

1906
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So if you don't have this now, you're going to be fucked in the future.

1907
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Yeah.

1908
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
What else are you going to build?

1909
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
What else are you going to build the bomb shelter out of, huh?

1910
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
When North Korea goes ape?

1911
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Damn.

1912
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Sorry.

1913
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
One thing I was wondering is how you actually made it.

1914
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Oh, so this, this was a, it's a company, I think they had, they used

1915
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
to be called Budsies, but then they branched off into two things.

1916
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
One for like mass production called stuffed animal pros.

1917
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And I asked them, you know, I got like a quote for like how

1918
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
much it would cost to make 50 of these.

1919
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I gave them like a design and they started off as like a company

1920
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
that makes plushes for kids.

1921
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Like kids would draw their like crayon drawing and their parents would

1922
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
send that in and get a plush made of their like kids drawing.

1923
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And the kids would be like, oh, Pog, Pog based.

1924
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Yeah.

1925
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
It's a really, it's really cool.

1926
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
It's a really cool little service, a little expensive for a one off,

1927
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
but you can do like mass production.

1928
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Obviously the more you like order, the cheaper each item will be.

1929
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And since the audience I expect is quite small for this plush,

1930
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
the minimum, the maximum I'm expecting to shift is like 50.

1931
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,000
So this is based off of if I make 50 plushes, this is how much

1932
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
they'll cost.

1933
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I feel like I will just be swimming in these little guys for a

1934
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
little while after the Kickstarter if we reach that goal.

1935
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
But that's fine because they're funny.

1936
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It'll be good to have some extras, you know what I mean?

1937
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Especially for like, you know, you can hand them out on the street corner.

1938
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Save them for later.

1939
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Table at a convention or something.

1940
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I literally could.

1941
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I could when I make like lot of ghosts like act three when there's

1942
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
like the finale or whatever it is.

1943
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I have the second Kickstarter and then I have a bunch of plushes ready

1944
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
to go and it's not even going to be difficult to get them providing

1945
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
we hit this time.

1946
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I still want to say it's a lot of it's a lot of money.

1947
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
It's a lot of like logistics and like figuring it out,

1948
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
but it's finally getting close to being happening.

1949
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It's cool.

1950
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Yeah, I still want to make a real Alex plushes with like a real cigarette.

1951
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
What do you mean a real cigarette?

1952
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I heard you say that you mean like a real tobacco cigarette that comes

1953
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
with the doll.

1954
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Yeah.

1955
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Well, you don't even you don't.

1956
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Well, you have to supply your own right.

1957
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
He just comes with a little hole in his mouth.

1958
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
You're trying to sell a plushie online and you have to abide by all

1959
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
like the tobacco regulations because it comes with a cigarette.

1960
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Like you can't sell it to kids.

1961
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Like it comes.

1962
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It comes with a with a pet like you partner with like new ports

1963
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
or something and there's a brand deal.

1964
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Yeah.

1965
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
You try to set light to it and then you burn the plushies like oh shit.

1966
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Got to buy another one.

1967
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Right.

1968
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It's like the plushies flammable.

1969
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Please don't use the cigarette that's included with the plushie dipped

1970
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
in fucking gasoline.

1971
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's called planned obsolescence.

1972
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
This is sort of a million dollars.

1973
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
This is sort of this is sort of related but not really.

1974
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I have a question for Laserbot.

1975
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
How did you come up with the design for the Troll King?

1976
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I looked up actual trolls and I just kind of used them as a inspiration

1977
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
and I just kind of drew them.

1978
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Did you?

1979
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I always loved the twist of the Troll King being like being an actual bridge

1980
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
troll and you know an Alex plush would be nice but there's so many other

1981
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
original TGT characters that would make nice plushies.

1982
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I like a Troll King.

1983
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Yeah.

1984
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
That's that's why that's why I asked that.

1985
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I'm actually going to be leaving soon.

1986
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
So I do got a question.

1987
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,000
What what series would you like to see TGT crossover with?

1988
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Oh I oh okay.

1989
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I don't think you've read it but Homestuck would be ridiculous.

1990
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Oh my god.

1991
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Oh my god please please.

1992
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
They have their own trolls in there.

1993
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
It would be it would be perfect.

1994
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
You're right appropriate crossover.

1995
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yeah, it would be so perfect.

1996
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Yes.

1997
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Homestuck is also about trolls.

1998
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Oh my god.

1999
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
That's way better than my answer.

2000
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I was going to say One Piece.

2001
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Has One Piece been in?

2002
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

2003
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I don't think so no.

2004
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The only anime that has been in is Dragon Ball Z and there was like Naruto references too.

2005
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Well do do Homestuck first and then maybe do One Piece if you feel like it afterwards.

2006
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I can just imagine Karkhet and Shadow the Hedgehog.

2007
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I can see it in my mind's eye.

2008
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Damn.

2009
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
That's way better than my answer.

2010
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I was going to say like Frazier.

2011
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
No, you know what?

2012
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Frazier is good though.

2013
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
That would work.

2014
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Frazier is pretty good.

2015
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Well I mean Frazier is technically part of the Cheers universe so really you should say Cheers.

2016
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Yeah you got me there.

2017
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
No you should have the whole Cheers cast.

2018
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
If I see a Homestuck troll and Tails gets trolled I will lose my shit.

2019
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I will flying Guillotine myself in celebration.

2020
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Alright, I think I'm going to say that.

2021
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I was going to say are you headed out laser bond?

2022
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Yeah, I'm headed out.

2023
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Well, it's been a real treat.

2024
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Thank you for doing an interview.

2025
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
It was much appreciated.

2026
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I was pretty chill.

2027
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Yeah, thanks man.

2028
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
It was a great having you on and you too.

2029
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Don't be a stranger.

2030
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Maybe we'd love to have you on again sometime if you've ever got like a new thing you want to help promote or something.

2031
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Yeah, okay.

2032
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Love to.

2033
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah.

2034
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Cool.

2035
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Alright, well then have a good one and we're going to go to voicemails soon I guess.

2036
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Alright, have a nice day everybody.

2037
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Peace.

2038
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Bye bye.

2039
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Peace dude.

2040
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Awesome.

2041
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I can't believe it.

2042
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It finally happened.

2043
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
It's only three years after that comment he left on the video.

2044
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I remember seeing that comment and I was like damn I wonder if he is going to be on the PCB.

2045
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
That'd be awesome.

2046
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
And then he just wasn't and I was like okay I guess it's not going to happen.

2047
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And then it happened and I was here in the call when it happened.

2048
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Crazy man.

2049
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
My hero, watch him as he goes.

2050
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I said this in the beginning.

2051
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I'm just going to re-emphasize this to the puny peasant PCP listeners who don't even appreciate how good of a get that was.

2052
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
That was getting laser bought on a podcast.

2053
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Well, first of all, it's an ordeal just to get any of the technical difficulties sorted out.

2054
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
But then even getting him to agree to do it in the first place.

2055
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:45,000
If you listen to the bonus footage that will be coming out on a bonus episode, yeah, you can hear us struggling with technical issues for like half an hour

2056
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
before we actually got the call to work.

2057
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Yeah, you're right.

2058
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Yeah, I asked him years ago and he said he couldn't do a thing.

2059
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And I think he has not done like any like podcast stuff because he's literally just not been in possession of a microphone.

2060
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Right, or internet or a computer or just something stopping him from doing it.

2061
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
It's always been like just something.

2062
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And that's why it's been like, I've been a fan of, you know, Tails is full for a long time, but I just, you know, statements from laser bought are pretty rare.

2063
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I would mostly get my laser bought news from CC lately and but like over the historically, it's like whatever you could get would be like an occasional

2064
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
DeviantArt post or whatever.

2065
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I never even heard his voice until the freaking Newgrounds panel, which I was surprised to even showed up to.

2066
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
So yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty, it's a pretty big get.

2067
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I just want to emphasize that again for you folks in the audience.

2068
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Don't even understand.

2069
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Do you think any other podcast could get this?

2070
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
No, only only this podcast with the biggest tails gets rolled heads out out there.

2071
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Yeah.

2072
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Literally the two biggest.

2073
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Yeah.

2074
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Dab dab.

2075
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Besides the Newgrounds one.

2076
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:56,000
The only time I heard his voice was that one video he made of it was like a scene from chapter three with a shadow.

2077
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Right.

2078
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
There's like one animated thing from Tails gets told easy to like skip over if you're just reading the comic.

2079
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
It's just reading the comic like as is because you know, it is.

2080
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
But like when it came out originally, there was like, oh, there's like an animated version of this page.

2081
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And it was like, whoa, that's crazy.

2082
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Yeah.

2083
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But there was like laser butted laser butted Alex's voice in that one.

2084
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I assume that his it was his voice in Micorat, but he's kind of doing like weird funny voices in that one.

2085
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So I assume it didn't.

2086
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
It wasn't what he actually sounds like.

2087
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Right.

2088
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
And it's not.

2089
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Yeah.

2090
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Yeah.

2091
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:37,000
You know, it'll be really funny if even though Craig said he's recording, he wasn't recording the whole interview has just lost time again.

2092
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Well, okay.

2093
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
CC, are you still doing OBS or did you stop?

2094
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Yes, I'm still doing OBS.

2095
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Okay.

2096
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Worst case scenario, we still got most of the interview.

2097
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Yeah.

2098
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
That's true.

2099
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
It's pro.

2100
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:54,000
It's all signs point to that it went fine and is okay.

2101
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,000
That was pretty great though that there were technical difficulties from him and also from Craig.

2102
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I was there have been there have been days when Craig simply does not work at all.

2103
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I was like, when he left the call before, I thought maybe like, Oh God, it's one of those times.

2104
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It's happening.

2105
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
But no.

2106
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Something about discord bots, I don't trust them.

2107
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I feel like they're prone to fail because they're like a billion different servers.

2108
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I have a billion different people asking them to do shit.

2109
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Yeah.

2110
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
No, discord bots always work perfectly.

2111
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Are they like never any game game breaking glitches that give people trillions of slime or break the game or the economy.

2112
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
The stock market never crashes and then skyrockets again.

2113
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
It sounds like a feature.

2114
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
You know, that's right.

2115
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
They never fail.

2116
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
They only add features.

2117
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,000
That's the kind of dynamic like storytelling you can't get from a bot that works properly.

2118
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Yeah.

2119
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
True.

2120
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Are you saying good?

2121
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
No, I was just wondering about how bots work.

2122
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Like if they're, because they're discord, like the developer puts them on like a server and it's hosted somewhere.

2123
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And then every server that has it is like taking bandwidth from the thing.

2124
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I don't think that's how it works.

2125
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
That would be weird.

2126
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
You should, you should ask Crack.

2127
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You should ask Crack.

2128
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
He's the only person that I know.

2129
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Or maybe Dwoob.

2130
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Maybe Dwoob might know.

2131
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
One of those two might have an idea.

2132
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I'm not sure anyone else I know could even begin to explain it.

2133
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I tried to make like a, like a, like a ripoff of Endless War, Endless Mud in fact.

2134
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
The very same that's in The Lord of Ghosts.

2135
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I tried to make a discord bot.

2136
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
And also big booby mommy milkers.

2137
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I didn't make that.

2138
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
That was a copy that Doon Koon made.

2139
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Oh.

2140
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:58,000
But yeah, it's the same sort of like, it's really confusing trying to set up a discord bot that responds to any commands in any way.

2141
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I thought, I just spend like a couple days like tinkering around and like coming up with like, I type in a command and the bot will read it and then say something.

2142
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
It's like impossible.

2143
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
How hard could it be?

2144
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
It doesn't sound like it would be that hard, but I believe that it is that hard, trust me.

2145
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I don't know.

2146
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I completely forgot all these things I learned.

2147
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
There is, they look really simple.

2148
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:36,000
If you go, you go into a server and it's like, oh, you can go and you can tag your little self and you can say like, oh, click this emote to give yourself a he, him pronoun or whatever.

2149
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Simple.

2150
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But yeah, when I tried, actually, like I couldn't actually do it.

2151
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Crack had to do it for me.

2152
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
And that's the only reason Endless War exists.

2153
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Yeah, it's like, it's one of those things that like under the hood is like, actually, there's a lot of like.

2154
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:10,000
There's a lot of communication going on between because he, because it's it's communicating between, you know, like the server, like you're typing and then it's going to discord and then discord is telling the bot and then bot is communicating with discord and then it's sending the the roll back to you right to your account.

2155
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Right.

2156
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So there's a lot going on there.

2157
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Um, but anyway, um, I mean, I guess back to just a what's up.

2158
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
What's up with me?

2159
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Yeah, is that I'm moving.

2160
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I'm looking for a house.

2161
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
You're moving.

2162
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I'm moving.

2163
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
It's horrible.

2164
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Apparently this.

2165
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It's kind of horrible.

2166
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Uh, you know, it's, it's really not that bad, but I don't deal well with this kind of thing.

2167
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
And I'm very stressed out about it.

2168
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And I'm searching for like an apartment and stuff is the worst thing in the world.

2169
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
So I believe that's shitty.

2170
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I have, um, yeah, I've, I basically have not.

2171
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I was on such a roll with working on my game last month and then this month rolled around

2172
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,000
and then suddenly I was like, wait a minute, I have to take care of some like financial

2173
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
tax stuff.

2174
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
And it took me like three days.

2175
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
I basically did like a full audit of my like income, like by month for the last like two

2176
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
years or two and a half years.

2177
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And that took me three days and I was like, okay, that's done.

2178
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Now I can't go back to doing the game.

2179
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
It's really getting late and I have to look for a house.

2180
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
So I've just been like house hunting and stuff.

2181
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And I, and it's a lot of waiting.

2182
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
It's really frustrating because there's a lot of sending emails and waiting, which

2183
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
technically you would think means, oh, I have downtime.

2184
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I can work on the game, but I am not capable of it.

2185
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
It's too stressful and I can't focus because I'm too much like, you don't have any good,

2186
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
like you can't just 100% hunker down and focus on.

2187
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I had a huge momentum going and then I had to be like, scree to a halt and do the tax

2188
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
stuff.

2189
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And then I'm like, I got it.

2190
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
It's other thing.

2191
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I got to take care of this other thing.

2192
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Cause if I'm homeless, I can't make a video game.

2193
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Yeah.

2194
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Same.

2195
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Yeah.

2196
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:00,000
At least about just moved to and I moved a few months ago as well.

2197
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So everyone's moving out.

2198
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Did you have fun?

2199
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Was it my first?

2200
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Do you have fun moving?

2201
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Did you like your new place?

2202
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
At least that's like a real question.

2203
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Yeah.

2204
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
My new place is a lot better.

2205
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I've moved closer to the office, but we haven't actually gone back to work yet.

2206
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,000
So I'm still working from home.

2207
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:29,000
My, my best, my best case scenario, what I hope to see is like a, I'll look at like the

2208
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
video retention rate for this video and there will be a huge drop off after laser bot leaves

2209
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
and what that'll tell them.

2210
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
And that'll be good because what that'll tell me is that new people heard that there was

2211
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
a laser about any of you and came to see it and didn't care about the rest of the episode.

2212
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
If you're one of my stupid little fucking fans, you better not have clicked off after the laser

2213
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
bot segment or you're not going to hear me yelling at you right now.

2214
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:56,000
If you're a cyber shell fan and you're not still listening and you're not still listening

2215
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,000
to me, then I want you to hear me say that I think you're stupid.

2216
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
You really showed them.

2217
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Yeah.

2218
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Good.

2219
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
We did it.

2220
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Fuck.

2221
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Well, laser bot is gone.

2222
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
It's one of the worst things like that.

2223
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I could imagine if you tried, you'd be like, you know, oh, I've got to wait for an email

2224
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
from fucking real estate, whatever.

2225
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
And you're like, I'll work on the game.

2226
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
You get like an hour into like setting up preparation.

2227
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Like, okay, I just got to get into the zone and then you get an email back.

2228
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
You get some notification.

2229
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Oh, shit.

2230
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I got to stop.

2231
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I got to stop everything and it just ruins your whole mood.

2232
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Even if it wasn't the email from the company or from the housing, like any email, you're

2233
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
going to be like, if you're expecting it, you're not going to be fully focused.

2234
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
You know what I mean?

2235
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
At least that's how I am.

2236
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
It's really hard to focus on something when you're waiting for like this real life shit

2237
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
that's just brewing in the back of your head.

2238
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
It's like that John Cleese lecture.

2239
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
You know the one I'm talking about, Gib, right?

2240
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,000
The one about creativity.

2241
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Yeah.

2242
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Um, cyber shell CC.

2243
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Do you know he ever seen, there's a lecture by John Cleese, the money python guy, and

2244
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
he talks about like the science of creativity.

2245
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
And he talks about like, yeah, it sounds vaguely familiar.

2246
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I can't remember if I've seen it though.

2247
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I think I saw maybe it's a, it's a good lecture.

2248
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
He talks about and close.

2249
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I mean, yes, the open and close mode.

2250
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And he says that like to get into like to do creative work, you have to like be in a

2251
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,000
mind, you have to let yourself enter a mindset that lets yourself just kind of like play

2252
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:43,000
and not be, you know, not be worried about, you know, logic, not be worried about like

2253
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
judging any like mistakes you make, right?

2254
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
So it takes time.

2255
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
So you need to set yourself out like a block of time to be creative.

2256
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:58,000
To allow yourself to like sink into that mode because it does, you can't just snap

2257
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
your fingers and be creative or playful.

2258
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Yeah.

2259
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I was gonna say that earlier when it's like, if you have like an hour to work on something,

2260
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
you can't just like immediately get into the zone, you know what I mean?

2261
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Especially if you're like acutely aware that you only have a little bit of time to work on something.

2262
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
It's gonna be a lot harder to get into that full, if it's not just like, there's like modes

2263
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
where you can just be like zoning out and like doing like, I don't know, sprite work or something

2264
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
like something where you already know what you're going to be doing is just like mechanical

2265
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
execution, but then there's also, you have to be in the mode to like come up with creative

2266
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
ideas in the first place, which can be really tough.

2267
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Yes.

2268
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Yeah.

2269
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
It's funny.

2270
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
It's funny because like I was like drawing sprites, doing the pixels on the sprites to

2271
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:42,000
me is much more mechanical than like writing the code.

2272
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Because when I'm writing, like I was putting in like particle effects and stuff and I kind

2273
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
of have to think sort of creatively and be like, what would be kind of like a good sort

2274
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,000
of like equation to put in for like a parabolic arc for this like particle to fly at?

2275
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And I'm like, hmm, and I'll try this.

2276
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Oh, it doesn't work.

2277
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I'll try this.

2278
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
No, that doesn't work.

2279
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Oh, that kind of works.

2280
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Yeah, that looks good.

2281
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Okay.

2282
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
And then I'll have it, if I, if I have it destroy itself and then create this sprite and have

2283
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
that sprite fade, it'll create a nice little like splatter effect, right?

2284
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And I'm like kind of playing with it like that.

2285
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Whereas a sprite, I'm just like, okay, I got my template.

2286
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I'll put the template in, change the colors, change some details here.

2287
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Okay, done.

2288
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Next one.

2289
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Assembly line.

2290
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Assembly line.

2291
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Yeah.

2292
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Drawing is for hacks.

2293
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Art is criminal.

2294
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
The advantage of pre-production phases.

2295
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Cause like you spend that big block of time not drawing anything, not making anything,

2296
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
but like planning everything, sketching as well.

2297
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
But like the creative process of deciding what goes where and why and how and, you know,

2298
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
writing.

2299
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
That's so much harder.

2300
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Yeah.

2301
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
You do all of that in one go.

2302
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
And then once the pre-production is done, you have instructions for your like, like

2303
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,000
mindless, like automaton brain to just read the instructions, just do the thing.

2304
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
You know, draw over the sketches.

2305
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Yeah.

2306
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Like edit the, the draft of the, the screenplay or whatever it is.

2307
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
You got to have us, you got to have a pre-production in anything.

2308
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Yeah.

2309
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Yeah.

2310
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,000
There is something nice about like zoning out and just like doing like, you know, you

2311
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
don't, you don't have to like be problem solving.

2312
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Like when you're like programming the game or whatever, you can just like do, you know,

2313
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
you just want to draw a thing.

2314
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
You know what you want it to be.

2315
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
And you just do it.

2316
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
You know what I mean?

2317
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Like when I'm editing a video, it's like most of the time I sort of already know what

2318
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I want it to be.

2319
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Like I just have to actually manually do the whole thing.

2320
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Yeah.

2321
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
It's like, it's sometimes it depends if I can be like zoned out.

2322
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Like if I'm making good progress at a good rate, it can feel like kind of therapeutic

2323
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
and nice, but sometimes it can feel a little tedious depending on how long the project

2324
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
goes for.

2325
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
When, when you've already made all the decisions.

2326
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Right.

2327
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
There's something comforting about executing on.

2328
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Yeah.

2329
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Like once I've written the script and voice the script and then I just have to slowly

2330
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
piece together the fucking video, which can be a pain.

2331
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
But like, you know, once you've drawn the outline, like you basically know what you have

2332
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
to do.

2333
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
You just have to do it, which is a different kind of mode.

2334
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
When the, when it's time to be like, how am I going to do this?

2335
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Make decisions.

2336
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Then I got to like YouTube, close YouTube, no music on, no distractions.

2337
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I have to sit and I have to focus when that's done.

2338
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,500
It's time to just actually like, you know, like this though the sketches are done.

2339
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:25,500
Now I just have to ink or whatever, or, or I have to do the final version.

2340
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,000
Then I can be like, oh, guilty pleasure.

2341
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
That's when you throw in some bullshit.

2342
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Best of the worst playlist on the second monitor and you just.

2343
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yes.

2344
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Literally do that all the time.

2345
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Yeah.

2346
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I know what you mean.

2347
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
It's really hard to like get into that mindset when you're like really like, I have to shut

2348
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
out all distractions.

2349
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I have to actually do the creative part of my job now being creative so hard.

2350
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I have to do my job.

2351
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Decisions.

2352
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Thinking.

2353
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Fuck.

2354
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I mean, it's weird.

2355
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
It is weird.

2356
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Like it never know when it's going to come, right?

2357
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
The inspiration.

2358
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I mean, like you never like, you can just be like sitting there like trying so hard to

2359
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
think of a good idea and you'll never do it.

2360
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
And then you just be like watching a video or playing a game and then a good idea comes

2361
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
and you're like, I have to like stop what I'm doing and like write this down.

2362
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Well, that's what that's what John Cleese says.

2363
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
He's like, you know, you don't, you can't like make yourself think of like a great creative

2364
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
idea.

2365
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:24,000
You have to end, you have to sort of let yourself enter this mode of thinking in which you are

2366
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
open to sort of playing with ideas until you happen upon a good one.

2367
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
And you have to be in this mindset where you're not judging yourself for like, oh no, that

2368
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
was wrong.

2369
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
That you had an idea and you had a thought, but it was a stupid thought.

2370
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
And it was dumb.

2371
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I mean, if you have good ideas, like if you have good ideas, like that statistically

2372
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
you have like way more like bad ideas and you have to filter those out.

2373
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I mean, you shouldn't beat yourself up just for having a bad idea.

2374
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
You know what I mean?

2375
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
It's, it's, it's right.

2376
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
It's like the creative mode is you're just, you're playing, you're playing with, with

2377
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
ideas.

2378
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
You're not, you're not thinking like this is what I'm going to do.

2379
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
You're thinking, what if I did this?

2380
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Oh, what if it was like this?

2381
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Oh, what if it was like this?

2382
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Oh, who knows?

2383
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
It could be anything.

2384
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
How, how droll.

2385
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,000
A trap I sometimes fall into is, is trying to set aside time for like, for that creative

2386
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
mode stuff.

2387
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I'm like, okay, I got to figure out something to write today.

2388
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
But then I think of it in terms of like, like a checklist, like zero out of one, like creative

2389
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
ideas, and obviously, or like good creative ideas.

2390
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And like, you can't guarantee that.

2391
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
And if you're thinking by the end of the day, I need to have come up with a good idea,

2392
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
you're not going to be in the right mode.

2393
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,000
You're going to be thinking too much about like making it good, making it proper.

2394
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
You can't beat yourself up too much about like not having a 10 out of 10 idea every day

2395
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
or whatever.

2396
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
You know what I mean?

2397
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Like it's so hard to come up with good shit like that on the fly.

2398
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I mean, it's more like you just make a good thing as good as you can make it.

2399
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
And you hope like some divine inspiration will hit you.

2400
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And you have like some really good ideas you can work in there.

2401
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
That's why I like having this exact problem.

2402
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Just feels like it feels like it's really open mode the entire time.

2403
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Yes.

2404
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
He's so organic.

2405
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Like it really does feel like he didn't do any real pre-planning.

2406
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Like he just started drawing page one.

2407
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
He just, okay, then now I'm done with page one.

2408
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
What happens next?

2409
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Well, let's figure it out on page two.

2410
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And this was like, you know what I mean?

2411
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It's like just sort of, and then from that organic sort of structure, a more like intricate

2412
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
plot arose.

2413
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Like, you know, even in like a great manga, like sometimes it'll come up with plot threads

2414
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
and then the author will be like, oh, that didn't make any sense.

2415
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I didn't go anywhere.

2416
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
And they'll just drop it.

2417
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
You know what I mean?

2418
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,000
You can't like beat yourself up every time that happens.

2419
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I've been having this problem with, I've been having this problem with the road to

2420
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Radcom, the last chapter of road to Radcom, which I've been meaning to write for weeks

2421
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
now.

2422
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And I, you know, I've had all this fucking shit on my plate, which has been, but it's

2423
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
not helped by the fact that when I think about it, I think about, okay, I don't know

2424
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
exactly how I'm going to write it.

2425
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I know it has to be like goofy.

2426
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I know it has to be silly and I got to make it weird and wacky and stuff.

2427
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
But I'm like, but I don't have any weird and wacky ideas.

2428
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I don't know what I'm going to write.

2429
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
I don't know what it's going to be.

2430
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I don't know how I'm going to do it.

2431
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
When, right?

2432
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
When, when, when, you know, obviously what I actually have to do is not think about the

2433
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
fact that I don't know what I'm going to write.

2434
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I have to just sit down and, and focus and think about it and just let myself be like,

2435
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
what if, what if I, what if I wrote this?

2436
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I mean, what if that happened?

2437
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Oh, that would be funny.

2438
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Maybe I can then this.

2439
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
No.

2440
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
But what about this?

2441
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Sometimes.

2442
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Oh yeah.

2443
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Go on.

2444
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
The sad thing is I feel like I used to be a lot more creative when I was younger than

2445
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I am now.

2446
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Like when I was when you're a kid, you don't have the inhibitions.

2447
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Like when you come up with like that, like you just have way more ideas and you're not

2448
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
like filtering them out as thoroughly.

2449
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
You know what I mean?

2450
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
You don't have like it.

2451
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
That's like, you get really in like a bad mindset where you're just like telling yourself

2452
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
constantly, like, I need to come up with this specific kind of thing.

2453
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And like the more you like obsess over not being able to do it, like the less in a mind

2454
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
space you are going to be in to do it properly.

2455
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
You know what I mean?

2456
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Yeah, exactly.

2457
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Kids are always in the open.

2458
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Which is right.

2459
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Kids are always in that open mode.

2460
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Kids are just playing constantly.

2461
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
They don't like understand that the world is a horrific nightmare yet.

2462
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
They're like, oh, this is fun.

2463
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Yeah.

2464
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
That's one thing I kind of liked about tails gets showed like you were saying earlier.

2465
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Like he just made the comics and, you know, he didn't care about like what, like how

2466
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
people like, you know, whatever.

2467
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
That's which is sort of how I made comics when I was a kid too.

2468
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I wish I still had some of them, but I don't sadly.

2469
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I like it.

2470
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Just another thing I like about tails gets trolls.

2471
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
It doesn't, it doesn't feel like he's making it for some audience.

2472
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
It really feels like he's making the comic just so he can have it and read it.

2473
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
You know what I mean?

2474
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
It doesn't, it doesn't feel at all.

2475
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Like it's pandering to anyone except his own sensibilities.

2476
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
It doesn't feel like it's pandering.

2477
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
But I mean, it does sort of take a notable turn.

2478
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Some of it is a response.

2479
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Some of it is a response.

2480
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Some of it is a direct response.

2481
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Like you're right.

2482
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Like sometimes stuff is a response in just like, like noticing the tone of people.

2483
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
And then there are parts of tail control, which are literally a direct response to the audience.

2484
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
You're right.

2485
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Like completely.

2486
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
But even that is just, he's doing that because it's something he wants to say.

2487
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Exactly.

2488
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
He wants to say like, ha, ha, fuck you trolls.

2489
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
I'll clown.

2490
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'll clown on you.

2491
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
If Tails is gay, I'll show you what Tails looks like when he's really gay.

2492
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
It was funny when he, yeah, he like, I always like that.

2493
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Honestly, I love when an artist has like a sort of hostile relationship to the audience.

2494
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
You know what I mean?

2495
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
In, in Tails gets trolled case.

2496
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Yeah.

2497
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
He, he, it made magic happen.

2498
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I think the tails gets a thing actually came from people complaining that he used homophobic

2499
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
slurs.

2500
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So he kind of made, so he kind of made that to like troll them.

2501
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:47,000
He was a, one of the first people I remember making some really long like posts on DeviantArt

2502
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
about how like, he's like, he's like, I call things gay, but I'm not homophobic.

2503
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I have nothing against people.

2504
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
It's like, that's just what you call things that are gay.

2505
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
You know what I mean?

2506
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Like this was back in like 2011.

2507
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
This is when people talked.

2508
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I was just like, I remember reading his post.

2509
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
He's right.

2510
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I know.

2511
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I was like, it's like, you know, I can tell this guy, he's not like, he's not using slurs

2512
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
as like, as like out of a hateful place.

2513
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
He's just like, that's just like how he was raised.

2514
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Honestly.

2515
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,000
That's how he talks.

2516
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Honestly.

2517
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
It's like people like look at like, oh, they say like retard and stuff.

2518
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
And it's like, you know, who's the people saying like slurs entails a choice from the

2519
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
trolls?

2520
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
It's from like the people that are not like endorsed by the author.

2521
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
You know what I mean?

2522
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
It's not like, you know, it's not like this is, they're saying this is good behavior.

2523
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Yeah.

2524
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And when it's like a character like Knuckles, it's, it's, it's shown that he's kind

2525
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
of not a perfect angel boy.

2526
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Yeah.

2527
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Knuckles is dumb as hell.

2528
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Like, you know what, you're not supposed to read the comic and be like, yeah, Knuckles

2529
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
clearly knows what's going on.

2530
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
It's not like Knuckles from actual Sonic.

2531
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Right.

2532
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
That's one of the weirdest things.

2533
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
He's like an anti-hero.

2534
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
He's literally, he's like a, he's a big dumb ass.

2535
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
He's constantly a dumb ass.

2536
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Someone said this earlier, this call.

2537
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I can't remember, but like, yeah, like there are like copyrighted characters in Tails

2538
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,000
He has told, but they're not like the copyrighted characters are basically original characters

2539
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
like wearing the skin of copyrighted characters.

2540
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Did you, yeah.

2541
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Did you read the interview with, with?

2542
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Yeah.

2543
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Yeah.

2544
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Yeah.

2545
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That was an interesting interview.

2546
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I was paraphrasing him.

2547
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
He said, it's not exactly those words, but he basically says that.

2548
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Well, I mean, it's clearly like, even when they start off a little, I mean, clearly all

2549
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,000
the characters are inspired and derive like, you know, some from their actual copyrighted

2550
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
counterparts, but there's so many like unique things to each character that especially

2551
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
as it goes on, like, you know, Silver from Tails gets trolled as completely different

2552
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
character from Silver from Sonic the Hedgehog.

2553
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
There are some things like, you know, Elmer Fudd still wants to get that Wabbit.

2554
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Right, right.

2555
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Bugs Bunny still kisses dudes.

2556
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Exactly.

2557
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Plenty of elements from the original work, but not like the characterization is definitely

2558
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
a bit different.

2559
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I don't know.

2560
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
It's interesting.

2561
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It's interesting, but it's still using copyrighted characters.

2562
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
So it's this weird gray area.

2563
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Honestly, I would love, I would love a 50 shades of gray grade version of two.

2564
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I would think it was the funniest thing in the world.

2565
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
It would be really funny.

2566
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Even the censored version, which I didn't think was like a good idea, but it was still funny

2567
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
to read.

2568
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
You know, I kind of, I haven't seen that.

2569
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I kind of wonder how a version of Tails gets trolled would be like, would it be like, would

2570
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
they still be like animals or would they just be like people?

2571
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Like, I always wondered about that.

2572
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
It's really hard to like truly match because there's so many specific elements that like

2573
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,000
you would just like, there's so many individual aspects you'd have to workshop.

2574
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
You know, fucking, how could we possibly translate this into like a generic version?

2575
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
You know what I mean?

2576
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:40,000
I'm, I'm, I'm picturing them as just people, but like it would be, I feel like with so

2577
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
many characters, it would become very hard to tell them apart.

2578
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:49,000
That one fight with like Mario in laser bot style, specifically that the Mario Luigi

2579
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
fight where they're cycling through the power ups from Mario would be like really confusing.

2580
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Like, why is he in like the Fox outfit that can turn into a statue?

2581
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And then, you know, it's like, what's going on over here with the frog suit?

2582
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
It'd be a little hard to genericize that.

2583
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I mean, you could do it.

2584
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I'm not saying it's impossible, but it would be, there's a lot of little elements that

2585
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
are like, it would be very tricky to do properly to the point where it'd be like, that's just,

2586
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I don't know, it would be funny.

2587
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
You're right.

2588
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
That would just add to the funniness.

2589
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
You're completely right from that aspect.

2590
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I know it would, it would make parts of the comic like totally incomprehensible, but

2591
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
like, I like that.

2592
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I don't know.

2593
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
That's literally just funny to me.

2594
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
And I mean, there are parts, when there are parts of a thing that don't make sense, and

2595
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
you're like, why is it like this?

2596
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
And there's like a deep lore answer.

2597
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
There's like a production level answer that you would never know as a reader.

2598
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
A little bit of that to me is like engaging.

2599
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
And I like it.

2600
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Oh, wow.

2601
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I know a secret about this media that like, not the casual reader might not know.

2602
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
It's legitimately compelling.

2603
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I would love to see that version of the comic, but I just can't justify like, why would they,

2604
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
there would be no reason to make it unless there was a reason.

2605
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I mean, you know, they want to get picked up by someone.

2606
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I mean, why would Laserbot?

2607
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Yeah, like, no.

2608
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Laserbot, Laserbot should not make that.

2609
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
No.

2610
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Maybe if it made a ton of money and he wanted to pay someone else to make that version,

2611
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
then I'd be like, help, please, please.

2612
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I want to see that.

2613
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
It's definitely one of my top comics that I would pick to get like redone one punchman style.

2614
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
You know what I mean?

2615
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Even though like, I will always say I love the original.

2616
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
The original art is classic.

2617
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
It's perfect for what it is.

2618
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Also, I like the original.

2619
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Yeah, I like the original.

2620
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:40,000
And yet, inevitably, the remake had to be the one that got popular because I know that

2621
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,000
that crisp art is just going to be so much of a draw for a lot of people.

2622
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I say this in my video, too.

2623
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,000
There's a huge amount of people who will take one look at this comic and will not read it.

2624
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
It does not matter what you say to them.

2625
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Like, no, no, it really gets good.

2626
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
No, no, like, they just can't.

2627
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
The art is just too much of a hurdle for them.

2628
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
You know what I mean?

2629
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Yeah.

2630
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Like, there's people who won't even watch black and white movies.

2631
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
You know what I mean?

2632
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Let alone read a web comic that looks like it was made in MS Paint.

2633
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
You know what I mean?

2634
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Black and white movies are better than regular movies.

2635
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Yeah.

2636
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
They're not wasting all your visual information on useless color.

2637
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
All those cones.

2638
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
All those cones.

2639
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Fuck the cones.

2640
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
All I need is the rods.

2641
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
All I need is the rods.

2642
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Thank you very much.

2643
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
My favorite, like, lore about black and white movies is that, like, if you were, like, there

2644
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
on location, like, when they were filming, like, a western, like, all the cowboys are

2645
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
dressed in, like, hot pink and, like, turquoise because those are just, like, the colors that

2646
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
show up best in black and white.

2647
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
You know what I mean?

2648
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Like, they weren't dressed in regular colors because they would just be too muted and

2649
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
bled together.

2650
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I've never heard that.

2651
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
It's true.

2652
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
It's really interesting.

2653
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Like, behind-the-scenes photos of old westerns and stuff.

2654
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I only know that in Psycho.

2655
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
They used, like, chocolate syrup and some of the blood.

2656
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Right.

2657
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Yeah.

2658
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
They'll all sort of little tricks like that.

2659
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Right.

2660
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Yeah.

2661
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Because in black and white, it doesn't matter.

2662
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Yeah.

2663
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Makes perfect sense.

2664
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,500
But those were the days.

2665
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:04,120
Those were the days when we weren't bound by the shackles of having to use things in

2666
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:05,120
the right color.

2667
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:08,000
I actually knew kids at my school who wouldn't, like, want to play, like, old games.

2668
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
They're, like, all those graphics.

2669
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Right.

2670
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
That's, like, how it's going to happen with new kids.

2671
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Like, they're going to see the pixel art and be like, uh, this is old.

2672
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
It's shitty.

2673
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
It's, like, that always gets me.

2674
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Like, I mean, I know most kids aren't like that or whatever.

2675
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I'm sure, like, pixel art is still popular in a lot of ways.

2676
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
But, like, there are people who just see old games.

2677
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Especially, like, the PS1, like, blocky graphics are like, uh, it looks bad.

2678
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
It looks shitty.

2679
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I mean, I love that look.

2680
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Maybe it's because I grew up with that, you know, generation of gaming.

2681
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
So I'm nostalgic.

2682
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
But there's something to it, you know?

2683
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
It's definitely, like, an art direction thing.

2684
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Like, every technology, like, limitation creates, you know, breeze innovation.

2685
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
And then that just becomes a different way.

2686
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Like, a different way you can paint with, like, code.

2687
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Right.

2688
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
In a 3D or whatever.

2689
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
You know, it's, like, just a different way you can do things.

2690
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And I always, I get a little mad.

2691
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:09,000
I get a little seedy about, like, how modern games kind of, like,

2692
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Pixarify the rendering.

2693
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Like, three-dimensional games all have the same sort of lighting.

2694
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,000
No matter what art style they have.

2695
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
And it didn't used to be like that.

2696
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,000
You didn't always have to have, like, dynamic shadows on a cartoon.

2697
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
They still do that in every game.

2698
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Dynamic shadows and, like, bloom and, like, lens flares and shit.

2699
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
It's just, it doesn't work.

2700
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
It doesn't always work.

2701
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
The only thing I could do...

2702
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Yeah, sometimes they make stuff just too, like, shiny, too, like, plasky and too, like, I don't know, too...

2703
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
They just wanted to look like, yeah, I guess Pixar.

2704
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Everyone wants their, like, game to look like Pixar and stuff, you know, I don't know.

2705
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:50,000
When I saw that new pony, the new pony designs, I'm like, oh, it's just Pixar.

2706
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
They just look like Pixar made them.

2707
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Goddamn.

2708
02:06:53,000 --> 02:07:00,000
At least, you know, you can turn your nose up at Flash Animation, like, the old Gen 4 Milo pony.

2709
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
At least they looked, like, unique.

2710
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
The new 3D ones just look like Pixar.

2711
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
It makes me mad. I hate it.

2712
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Yeah, that's another thing.

2713
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Like, Pixar and Disney movies, I can't even tell the difference between them anymore, because they just look the same.

2714
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,000
And they all, I mean, have you seen the redesign of the Veggie Tales?

2715
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
No.

2716
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
They gave them the Pixar eyes.

2717
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
The Veggie Tales have Pixar eyes now.

2718
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
That's brutal.

2719
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I know.

2720
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Even Veggie Tales.

2721
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
It's not like some Christian shit, I don't know.

2722
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
I don't know what Veggie Tales is.

2723
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Oh, no.

2724
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
It's true.

2725
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Yes, it is.

2726
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
What?

2727
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Wait, let me find the...

2728
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Let me find the new Veggie Tales designs.

2729
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
It's called Veggie Tales in the House.

2730
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
No, it's not. You're lying.

2731
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Jesus.

2732
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Oh, and Netflix originally.

2733
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Oh, God, you're right.

2734
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
No!

2735
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I don't like it.

2736
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I had no idea.

2737
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
That's so...

2738
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Oh, that looks so bad.

2739
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
The tomato.

2740
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
It looks like inside out.

2741
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
They just look like inside out.

2742
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:01,000
It's so hard to articulate why this is so off-putting, but it looks wrong.

2743
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
That's not how they're supposed to look.

2744
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:10,000
The pickle looks a little better than the tomato, but the tomato just looks like the fuck.

2745
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Excuse me, he's a cucumber?

2746
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Whatever, I don't fucking care.

2747
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
That's Larry the Cucumber.

2748
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Thank you very much.

2749
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I think it's literally just the eyes.

2750
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
It's a pickle Rick.

2751
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
People are so different.

2752
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
It's people Rick.

2753
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
The mouths are a little different.

2754
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Don't dare compare Larry.

2755
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Wait, I saw a fucking image.

2756
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Hold on, I got to Google.

2757
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Chad Larry Cucumber Virgin Pickle Rick.

2758
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Some guy at the NSA is looking at your search.

2759
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
He's like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

2760
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Found it.

2761
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Found it.

2762
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I'm posting.

2763
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
You can't stop me.

2764
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I'm posting it.

2765
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Wait.

2766
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I haven't stopped you.

2767
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I haven't stopped you, but your shitty internet didn't stop you from posting it.

2768
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Yeah, it can.

2769
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I definitely agree with you that Larry the Cucumber is better than Pickle Rick.

2770
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Well, I'm glad we can agree on something.

2771
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
There we go.

2772
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Look at it.

2773
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
The list is extensive.

2774
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Hates it.

2775
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Hates it.

2776
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Virgin Pickle Rick.

2777
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Lips?

2778
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Oh, his friends as well.

2779
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Virgin Pickle Rick hates the God he doesn't even believe in.

2780
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Chad Larry the Cucumber.

2781
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
God made you special and he loves you very much.

2782
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Who do you?

2783
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Loves God.

2784
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Loves Jesus.

2785
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Loves his friends.

2786
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Loves his lip.

2787
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I don't know what that means.

2788
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Yeah, no, the eyes.

2789
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
The eyes in the new one.

2790
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I get it in that sense.

2791
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Why wouldn't you want to rip off Pixar, like the most profitable fucking animation studio?

2792
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Like it makes sense to rip them off.

2793
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
It's just like when everyone does it, it sucks.

2794
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
It's horrible.

2795
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Maybe it's not.

2796
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Okay.

2797
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
That green lady in the back is the one that really looks like a picture.

2798
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Yeah, she does not look like she belongs with the VeggieTales cast at all.

2799
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
What even is that?

2800
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
She looks like a fucking vegetable.

2801
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
What vegetable is that?

2802
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Is that a spoon?

2803
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Yeah.

2804
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Yeah.

2805
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Honestly, I don't know.

2806
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I don't think there's any plastic like vegetable beauty standards going on here.

2807
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
It doesn't make any sense how thin she is.

2808
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
It really doesn't.

2809
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
It's just, I know they had to give them the irises.

2810
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
They gave them the more detailed eyes, I guess, because it's cute.

2811
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
It's not.

2812
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
But is it cute?

2813
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
It's not.

2814
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I don't think it's that cute.

2815
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I don't know if cute is really what you want to go for with a vegetable.

2816
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I kind of think like silly and simple is better.

2817
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Maybe I'm biased.

2818
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I don't know who the character is with the pigtails, but that one looks like the least ruined,

2819
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
because that's sort of what the character is.

2820
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
The least.

2821
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Well, that one.

2822
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
It's supposed to be like a cute girl or something with a bow.

2823
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Okay.

2824
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I guess in the old one, there was a, yeah, there was, I think she's a squash.

2825
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I don't even remember her from the old ones.

2826
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I remember the little asparagus kid with the hat was like the little sidekick or whatever.

2827
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I guess maybe given squash girl his role.

2828
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Is this image implying like all of the other ones that we don't see have been cooked.

2829
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
They've been used in cooking.

2830
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
They've been gone.

2831
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
They don't exist in this reboot.

2832
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
What is that blue lady?

2833
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Is she a grape?

2834
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Is she a plant?

2835
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Maybe a turnip.

2836
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
A plant.

2837
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
She's too small for an eggplant.

2838
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I don't know.

2839
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
He's making me fucking.

2840
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
It doesn't make any sense that the squash is smaller than the cucumber.

2841
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
It's all a bunch of nonsense.

2842
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
They ruined it.

2843
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
My childhood.

2844
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Ah, they're raping my childhood.

2845
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Ah.

2846
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I didn't watch what you tell us as a child.

2847
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Or my childhood would be ruined.

2848
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
I don't even like.

2849
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I never watched much of it, but I was always like super like aware of it.

2850
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
You know what I mean?

2851
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I was like, yeah, this thing exists.

2852
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
And I like, I don't even like, I don't have any attachment to it, but they still ruined

2853
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
it so much that I like reviled by it.

2854
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I'm like, what did they do to you?

2855
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I genuinely do have a, have a little bit of an attachment to it because I went to church.

2856
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,000
As a kid and they had VHS tapes that we could borrow and they had some veggie tales tapes

2857
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
and I would borrow them and I would watch them and I liked them.

2858
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Like I didn't, I was pretty indifferent to the fact that they were like God stuff.

2859
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I was just like, yeah, whatever.

2860
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
They're, they're funny.

2861
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
And I think they're, I'm entertained, but they are God stuff.

2862
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
They, they tell like, they tell like Bible stories.

2863
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,000
They tell like stuff about like the, the Jews.

2864
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Like the Israelites like.

2865
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
You could have ended that.

2866
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I didn't, that's good.

2867
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Well, yeah.

2868
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I mean, the Israel, depending on your.

2869
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
The Israelites do in like the march around the walls.

2870
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
They, they, they perform the miracle where they march around the walls of Jericho and

2871
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
they make the city collapse or whatever.

2872
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Yeah.

2873
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Veggie tales really.

2874
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Hold me on the Israelites.

2875
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
It's literally like Old Testament wrath of God stuff at once in a while.

2876
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I mean, you know, they do it in a silly way, but they do it.

2877
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
And you know, God bless them.

2878
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Tomatoes or fruits.

2879
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:09,000
I think I read, I think I've said this on the podcast before, but somewhere there's

2880
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
like an interview.

2881
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I think it's like, I think it's like the Twitter account, the veggie tales,

2882
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Twitter account or something said that yeah, technically the vegetables and

2883
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
veggie tales don't have souls.

2884
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,000
So they won't not actually be saved by God.

2885
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:29,000
They will not actually inherit the kingdom and be raised up into the bosom.

2886
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
That's so weird, but it does like, it specifically says in the Bible, like humans

2887
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
get into heaven, not fucking vegetables.

2888
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I mean, like specifically says not.

2889
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Specifically says that if any sentient fucking vegetables start growing around,

2890
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
they ain't, they ain't getting in.

2891
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I don't know.

2892
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I love the idea that it can be completely sentient and like fully conscious,

2893
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
but not have a soul.

2894
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Like what is it then?

2895
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
It would be, it would be, it would be heresy for them to imply that Larry the

2896
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,000
cucumber would be saved by Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

2897
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
So they don't go to heaven.

2898
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Do they go to hell or do they just not exist?

2899
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Do they not have any sort of apparel?

2900
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Well, as we've learned, as we've learned the fate of the damned according to the

2901
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
book of Revelation is not everlasting torment.

2902
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
It is destruction in the fires of Gehenna.

2903
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Duh.

2904
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Isn't that like a, isn't that like a real place?

2905
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Duh.

2906
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Is that the one like Bible lore verse you memorized to dunk the Christian,

2907
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
dunk on the Christians and be like, yeah,

2908
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I know more about the Bible than you do.

2909
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I know, I know lots of Bible shit.

2910
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I know lots of.

2911
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Name one other thing about the Bible.

2912
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Name one other.

2913
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Oh, that's what that's why your name is wrong.

2914
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
That's what there's a part.

2915
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
There's a part in the Old Testament where a guy is like, hmm,

2916
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I want to breed some striped cows.

2917
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
So he is like, I know what I'll do.

2918
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:53,000
So he cuts stripes into a stick and he puts a stick in a,

2919
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:58,000
in the pond and the cows drink from the pond with a stripe stick in it.

2920
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,000
And then they give birth to striped calves.

2921
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Dude, whoever wrote the Bible is fucking retarded.

2922
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
That doesn't make any sense.

2923
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
What the fuck?

2924
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
What are you talking about?

2925
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
There's an, there's an,

2926
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,000
there's another part in the Bible where it says that pie is three.

2927
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Oh, right.

2928
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I remember hearing that in a bunch of like, yeah,

2929
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
like really sorry.

2930
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
There was just like back in the day, pie was three.

2931
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
It was close enough.

2932
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
God damn it.

2933
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
It was.

2934
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,000
It was.

2935
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Yeah.

2936
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
It was three universal drift.

2937
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Universal drift has changed like the fundamental like geometric

2938
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
constants of our reality.

2939
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Yeah.

2940
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
There's a part that describe,

2941
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
it describes a circular, I think it's a well or something.

2942
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
And it says it's this many cubits across and this many cubits around.

2943
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
And if you divide the numbers, they're exactly divisible by three.

2944
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
The pie is equal to three.

2945
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Lamal.

2946
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:52,000
So as you can see, I'm a, I'm a fucking genius and I know all about God.

2947
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
And it's true.

2948
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
The vegetables are going.

2949
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Is.

2950
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Is.

2951
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
rhubarb.

2952
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Is.

2953
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Petunia rhubarb.

2954
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Look at the fucking voice.

2955
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Voice by 2B.

2956
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Kira Buckland.

2957
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
First.

2958
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
This is a scene girl.

2959
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
First of all.

2960
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Wow.

2961
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,000
She's cute.

2962
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,000
First of all, I like that rhubarb is being represented.

2963
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Rhubarb is an underappreciated vegetable, but she doesn't look like rhubarb because

2964
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
rhubarb has like big leaves.

2965
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
She doesn't.

2966
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Why does she like a bowl?

2967
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
She's.

2968
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Dear.

2969
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Vegetables writers.

2970
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
You have anthropomorphized these vegetables to a point where they're no longer recognizable.

2971
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
And I would like a refund, please.

2972
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
It's.

2973
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I mean, you say that, but I'm serious.

2974
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Unironically.

2975
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Why, why didn't they make the body like pink, like rhubarb and then have her hair be green,

2976
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
like the leaves?

2977
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Like that.

2978
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
There would be a way to do it.

2979
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Well, it wouldn't be.

2980
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,000
They, when they designed Petunia rhubarb, they're like, we need to get at least like,

2981
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
at least 300 entries of rule 34.

2982
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,000
So she can't be too busted and having green hair and shit.

2983
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
This is so annoying.

2984
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,000
They have her wearing like a pink sweater, but like.

2985
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
None of the other vegetables were clothes.

2986
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Her body should just be red.

2987
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Yeah.

2988
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
And her hair should be green leaves.

2989
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
They are too anthropomorphized.

2990
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
What is this orange hair?

2991
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
This is insane.

2992
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I'm losing my mind.

2993
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Some of the vegetables are fruit.

2994
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Petunia rhubarb is cracking my mind in half.

2995
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I don't understand what I'm looking at.

2996
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I'm staring into the abyss.

2997
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
What were they, what were they thinking?

2998
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Dear VeggieTales creators, first of all, God isn't even real.

2999
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Second of all, what is going on with Petunia rhubarb's design?

3000
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:37,000
In order of importance, these are my two complaints about the new VeggieTales.

3001
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
The old VeggieTales, I was okay with the God stuff.

3002
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
God used to be real, but now he's not.

3003
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
The new one is just, is just a lot.

3004
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
All that God shit was great in the 90s.

3005
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
So cool.

3006
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Yeah.

3007
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I had no idea she did VeggieTales voice.

3008
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
That's like quite, she's got quite the resume.

3009
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Wait, does she do, was she to be?

3010
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,000
She does anime and video games and like some anime films.

3011
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,000
She got her start on like new grounds and shit, I think.

3012
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Oh yeah.

3013
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
She, she, oh yeah.

3014
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
She was near automatic.

3015
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:08,000
She was like in some really like shitty flash movies in like 2004 or some shit.

3016
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I thought I recognized the name.

3017
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Oh, okay.

3018
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:16,000
She's, she's not, she's not as hot in other pictures as her headshots, but I mean, what

3019
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
do you expect?

3020
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
That's headshots for you.

3021
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Well, yeah, rhubarb though.

3022
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Yeah, let's focus on the rhubarb.

3023
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Let's focus on what's important.

3024
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I'm sorry.

3025
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I don't have enough information on VeggieTales board to contribute much to this conversation.

3026
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Have you ever, have you ever had rhubarb?

3027
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
No.

3028
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Oh, it's good.

3029
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Oh, it's sweet.

3030
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
It is good.

3031
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Did I make you try it or did you already know?

3032
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Do you have you already had it?

3033
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
They don't grow, they don't grow that in England.

3034
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
It's a, I don't know.

3035
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I've had it before.

3036
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I had it in a pie.

3037
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I must have made you-

3038
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Rhubarb crumble, rhubarb crumble.

3039
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,000
No, I've had it way before you ever uttered the-

3040
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,000
No, I invented, I invented rhubarb crumble.

3041
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I invented rhubarb pie.

3042
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
No.

3043
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
It's my thing.

3044
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Stop copying Ben's love of rhubarb.

3045
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Who's Ben loves rhubarb?

3046
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
He talks about it all the fucking time.

3047
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Everyone, it's a defining characteristic.

3048
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,000
It's the thing, it's the thing about me and you're stealing it?

3049
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I called it.

3050
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Pick another vegetable.

3051
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,000
VeggieTales superfan Ben Saint, widely known for his love of Petunia rhubarb and has drawn

3052
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
all sorts of-

3053
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
No.

3054
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Part of her and made weird Twitter-Countess role-plays her.

3055
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:30,000
She, she is a disgrace to rhubarb everywhere.

3056
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:35,000
She's not, we don't, the rhubarb community, roundly rejects her.

3057
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
She's like the Candace Owens of rhubarb.

3058
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Rhubarb is what I'm saying.

3059
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Yeah.

3060
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I'm not much into VeggieTales, but I'm a member of the rhubarb community, so I can't help

3061
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,000
but stan Petunia.

3062
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Cringe, cringe.

3063
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,000
This is a, she's split, she's split the rhubarb fanbase a Sunday.

3064
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:01,000
I might have to watch some VeggieTales after this, because I'm mostly familiar with like,

3065
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,000
just like you see random clips on Twitter of just like some crazy like religious moments

3066
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
being like, whoa, this is so wacky.

3067
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:12,000
But I'm sure there's like some like 10 hour YouTube essay like, this is the lore and why

3068
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:15,000
VeggieTales is the greatest show of all time.

3069
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I haven't seen anything like that, but it wouldn't surprise me.

3070
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I don't know if you saw when, when the, when things were really heating up between Israel

3071
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:31,000
and Palestine, I posted that video of the little asparagus, little asparagus asking Bob

3072
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:37,000
the tomato, the Israelites, weren't they God's chosen people?

3073
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
I bet they always follow God's directions and Bob the tomato.

3074
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Oh, you'd think so.

3075
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Wouldn't you?

3076
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
I remember that clip.

3077
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
That was good.

3078
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Cried, I cried.

3079
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I feel like VeggieTales is popular because like all Christian media that was trying to

3080
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,000
be educational was just like horrible.

3081
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Like it was all terrible except for VeggieTales.

3082
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,000
And it's like, it's like the king of that niche.

3083
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,000
As a kid who was pretty indifferent to God stuff.

3084
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
I just liked VeggieTales because it was funny.

3085
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Right.

3086
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I thought, and I liked it.

3087
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
So it was great.

3088
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I can absolutely see it appealing to any kid.

3089
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:19,000
It's just like a, seems like a regular ass cartoon at first.

3090
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,000
It seems like VeggieTales seems like a show like that should teach you about vegetables

3091
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
and like healthy eating habits, you know, not like the Bible.

3092
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I think, I think I remember being kind of like thinking it was cool that they actually

3093
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,000
just tell these like Old Testament stories.

3094
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
It's kind of, it's like history.

3095
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,000
It's kind of like a history thing.

3096
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Yeah.

3097
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
A lot of those stories are pretty interesting, honestly.

3098
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Like where, like I had never heard about, oh, the Israelites fucking collapsed the wall.

3099
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:51,000
They like, they performed a miracle and God collapsed the walls of Jericho when they blew

3100
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
their trumpets.

3101
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
It was like, that's weird.

3102
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Neat.

3103
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Cool.

3104
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Thanks for telling me Larry for the one.

3105
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:03,000
There's, there's one where they, there's a, there's a, they do a version of the one

3106
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
where the guy, I think it's, is it Daniel or that they throw into the den of lions and

3107
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
God appears as an angel and like protects him from the lions.

3108
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I might be conflating some, some stuff there.

3109
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I think I've talked about this exact thing on the PCP book.

3110
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I think, in fact, I think I remember someone in the comments correcting me and saying,

3111
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:26,000
no, Ben, that story was not about Daniel being thrown into the lion's den.

3112
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
That was Steve or something.

3113
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
It was another guy.

3114
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:32,000
I really hope someone in the comments is like, oh God, they're talking about fucking

3115
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
veggie tails again.

3116
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Skip this episode.

3117
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
They will.

3118
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
They will be.

3119
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I, I promise.

3120
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:46,000
We are at two and a half hours.

3121
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Do we want to go to voicemails?

3122
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
No, let's skip it all together.

3123
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:55,000
This will be the episode where did you stop doing voicemails?

3124
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,000
We should, we should just split this episode into like the laser bot segment and the post

3125
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:06,000
laser bot segment or we've been going for a while without them now.

3126
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
But no, not that long.

3127
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I don't know.

3128
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
We should go.

3129
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
We should do voicemails, right?

3130
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
We have to.

3131
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Okay.

3132
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I have one, I have one particular question that only you two people can answer.

3133
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:25,000
So is everything that happens in Lord of Ghosts canon to endless war or how does that work?

3134
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
That is such a great question.

3135
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
And the answer is yes.

3136
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Yeah.

3137
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:36,000
The way in endless war, because it's like a, a, like a big community, like people come

3138
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
up with law all the time for fun.

3139
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:44,000
They come up with their own OCs in the, in the discord and they were doing all that stuff.

3140
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:51,000
We came up with collectively as long as you make it and it's cool and people like it,

3141
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
then it's canon.

3142
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
It doesn't matter.

3143
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
There's no like authority that says yes or no.

3144
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
So people like everything is canon.

3145
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
So, so it is canon.

3146
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Yes.

3147
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Excellent.

3148
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Excellent.

3149
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:09,000
It's, that's, I think, I think, I think that makes me, um, I think I, I mean, I think

3150
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I would have liked Lord of Ghosts anyway, but, but the fact that it is, it is technically

3151
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
like a, it starts in, in Lakakam.

3152
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:22,000
The fact that it has the endless war tie-in just makes me like makes me very, um, I feel

3153
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
very, I feel very connected to it.

3154
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I feel, I feel very, uh, invested in it.

3155
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Like you technically could read it immediately following like S nega slime descent.

3156
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Cause it's exactly that moment where it starts.

3157
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Right.

3158
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Yeah.

3159
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I remember reading it for the first time.

3160
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Like, yeah.

3161
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Okay.

3162
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
So there's clearly like some shit just happened and it's like immediately following after

3163
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,000
this.

3164
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Cause I remember reading it and me like, am I missing something?

3165
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
And I was looking on the wiki and I was like, oh, okay.

3166
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
So this like really happened on the server and all this crazy ghost shit.

3167
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Yeah.

3168
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Yeah.

3169
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Yeah, it did.

3170
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,000
That I unveiled it.

3171
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
S.

3172
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
It was so fucking cool.

3173
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:05,000
It was a, Lord of Ghosts takes place directly after S nega slime descent, which was a, an

3174
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:13,000
animation that Gib did that coincided with and heralded the end of season one of endless

3175
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
war.

3176
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:20,000
There was like a big in-game event that included the, this, this animation that Gib did in which

3177
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,000
the, the nega slime descended and, and de-slime the city basically.

3178
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Uh, yeah.

3179
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:29,000
And Lord of Ghosts is the immediate.

3180
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Yeah.

3181
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,360
Other stuff happened in the game after that, but Lord of Ghosts is like the immediate aftermath

3182
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:35,000
and side story to that.

3183
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I guess.

3184
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Yeah.

3185
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,000
There it is.

3186
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Yeah.

3187
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
So we're reading it.

3188
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I mean, like this is like weirdly like specific like of lore that happened right before the

3189
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,000
comic started.

3190
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Like what's going on with this?

3191
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
And then I was like, oh, this like actually like happened.

3192
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
That's pretty cool.

3193
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Yeah.

3194
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
It's not required reading or like you don't need to be.

3195
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Right.

3196
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Oh yeah.

3197
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,000
The intro of the comic like explains the whole premise.

3198
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:56,000
It's just like, it was like, huh, that's kind of an interesting premise.

3199
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Yeah.

3200
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,000
It is.

3201
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
It was pretty wacky.

3202
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Um, people ask me.

3203
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,000
The Lord of Ghosts had a whole.

3204
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:05,600
If Lord of Ghosts is difficult to get into if you don't know endless war and trust me,

3205
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:07,000
you don't need to.

3206
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
No.

3207
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
All the concepts, like the sewer stuff, I feel like it's explained in the comic.

3208
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
You know what I mean?

3209
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Like it definitely helps to know about it.

3210
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Like you would immediately know what was going on.

3211
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
But I mean, it's not like, it was actually pretty easy to understand without even fully.

3212
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I mean, I'm not in endless war.

3213
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I'm only like aware of it, but it seems interesting.

3214
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:29,000
If you like the character of Lord of Ghosts, it might, I mean, it would probably be interesting

3215
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:35,000
to, for you to know that he did kind of have a whole sort of life and story as an endless

3216
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
war account.

3217
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Right.

3218
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Yeah.

3219
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
That's what I mean.

3220
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I was like, he was, he was all the mayor stuff.

3221
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
I was like, what the fuck is going on with this?

3222
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Yeah.

3223
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Cause I was like, that was like so much backstory that I was like, we'll be like, why would you

3224
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
not just put that in the comic if this was happening?

3225
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Like, you know what I mean?

3226
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,000
But I was like, oh, cause you know, it wouldn't make sense.

3227
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I mean, it would not make sense to put it in the comic, but like, you know, it was continuing

3228
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,000
from these events.

3229
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
It wasn't necessary.

3230
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:00,000
He ran, he ran on a, he ran on a platform of a beat.

3231
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
He was pro porn.

3232
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:05,000
And he also, he had, he had, he had the pity vote.

3233
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:06,000
He had the, he had the pity.

3234
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I love winning an election.

3235
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,000
The pity vote, which is hilarious.

3236
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:19,000
These two factors made a huge landslide.

3237
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
And it was, it was a legitimate win.

3238
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:25,000
It wasn't like, like a, like a, like people actually voted for it.

3239
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Right.

3240
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Yeah.

3241
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
It was just a plot point.

3242
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
It was like a real election, which is really funny.

3243
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:35,000
We had an actual poll in the server of people to vote for who was, who was going to be mayor.

3244
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Yeah.

3245
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,000
And as soon as Lord of ghosts became mayor, there, a whole thing happened where like,

3246
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,000
you know, the ghosts used to live in the sewers, but then because Lord of ghosts was mayor,

3247
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
he declared ghosts legal.

3248
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,000
So suddenly ghosts could roam the streets.

3249
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,000
It was literally that scene from Ghost Busters two or Ghost Busters one, I think, where all

3250
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,000
the ghosts like shoot up out of the ground and are like terrorizing the scene.

3251
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
It was literally just the one getting in the taxi.

3252
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
It was just that, but green.

3253
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Hell yeah.

3254
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Yeah.

3255
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Yeah.

3256
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Dude, Slimer is such a endless war character.

3257
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
He's like a slime green ghost.

3258
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I think that I think they ripped off.

3259
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,000
I think they ripped off endless war when they made Ghost Busters.

3260
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
We don't, we don't acknowledge Slimer.

3261
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
We don't want to give him the attention.

3262
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
He's too much.

3263
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
He stole our shit.

3264
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
He stole your shit.

3265
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,000
He stole our IP.

3266
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
He stole your vibe.

3267
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Your aesthetic.

3268
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
He did.

3269
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
He really did.

3270
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
It's not fair.

3271
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,000
I don't know.

3272
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
It's what do we think?

3273
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Voice voicemails?

3274
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Oh yeah.

3275
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Sure.

3276
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:36,000
If you want that episode to be less than eight hours long, probably need to get to voicemails

3277
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
eventually.

3278
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Or you just skip voicemails.

3279
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Just drop it.

3280
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Just completely drop the segment and everyone who left their voicemail is going to be like,

3281
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
what the fuck?

3282
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:46,000
This is the first time they ever didn't do voicemails.

3283
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
No.

3284
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I can't do it.

3285
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I can't do it.

3286
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I have too much.

3287
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Damn my integrity.

3288
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I just have so damn much of it.

3289
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
It's such a curse.

3290
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
I do respect the consistency.

3291
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I mean, have you guys ever missed a week that wasn't like related to being at Radcon?

3292
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I don't think we even then, we managed to do live PCP episodes.

3293
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Oh right.

3294
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Yeah.

3295
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
If you count the live stuff, then I mean, obviously didn't miss anything.

3296
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I just meant like as far as the actual just weekly schedule, it's been pretty adhered to

3297
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
as far as I can tell.

3298
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Thanks.

3299
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Yeah, it has.

3300
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:25,000
We didn't have the same voicemail format back then, but since then I have, at some point

3301
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I decided all voicemails are fair game and we have run every single one since then.

3302
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
That pig guy shows up.

3303
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I fucking hate that pig guy.

3304
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I'm still like the more we talk about it more likely is to show up again.

3305
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Maybe there'll be pink copycats or like copy pigs.

3306
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
The pig.

3307
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I don't want to talk about that.

3308
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I don't want it.

3309
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Okay, we can just get right into the voicemails if you want.

3310
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:52,000
The first voicemail is called the pig.

3311
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I don't know.

3312
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
I'm not talking with a pig.

3313
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,000
We're not talking with a pig.

3314
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,000
We're moving on.

3315
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:58,000
We're moving on.

3316
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
We're moving on.

3317
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
No, you won't guarantee.

3318
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Maybe next week someone will call in some pig males.

3319
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:13,000
The first voicemail is called big chicken's egg of a fan perspective on Ben's work ethic.

3320
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Three, two, one, go.

3321
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:23,000
You know, Ben, I can't help but think that your popularity and subsequently your own money

3322
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:33,000
would improve if you would choose to focus all of your effort on one of your series as opposed to the scattershot approach you take nowadays.

3323
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I know you said in a previous episode that the way you work creatively is that you get this idea and you cannot move forward until you get that idea out of your head.

3324
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:52,000
As a fan of, for example, the Vapors, like I am, it's very hard to want to keep up with the Vapors when the chapters are so bespratic.

3325
02:30:52,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Especially since now you're working on the Simon Punishment game, which in and of itself is a very esoteric piece of media that requires vague knowledge of Chris Chan lore and RFCK lore.

3326
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Antibad lore.

3327
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Or for somebody to really be invested in a series when everything is so scattershot.

3328
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:23,000
However, if you finish the Simon Punishment game, then you can go on to do the 102 lecture, which could be a boon for your popularity if it's anything like the first lecture.

3329
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:27,000
So yeah, I don't know, just thoughts.

3330
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Hope the house hunt is going well.

3331
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,000
If not, you can come and stay on my couch.

3332
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Kisses.

3333
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Love you.

3334
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Bye-bye.

3335
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I mean, yeah, but like, tell me something I don't know.

3336
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,000
What was his advice?

3337
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Do one thing at a time?

3338
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I mean, isn't that already what you're doing?

3339
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I mean, he just meant only the Vapors.

3340
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Is that what he wanted?

3341
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Yeah.

3342
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
He wants more Vapors.

3343
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I mean, he said he thinks Vapors hard to keep up with.

3344
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I mean, it is hard to keep up with Vapors since there is no Vapors coming out because I'm working on something else right now.

3345
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,000
That means it's easy to keep up with because there's no new Vapors coming out.

3346
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
You know, I remembered.

3347
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I was horrified to realize that it's been almost two years since the Vapors to Kickstarter and those Vaporettes.

3348
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I mean, I released the Vaporettes for the first Vapors book after like one year.

3349
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:26,000
So I think I might want to just really, maybe when I fucking put the comic up, I will also put the Vaporettes up because I did mean to at some point publish those on the internet.

3350
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,000
They weren't going to stay book exclusive forever.

3351
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
So I don't know.

3352
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
I guess I'll do that at some point.

3353
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Anyway, this guy, I mean, yeah, it is weird and scattershot and probably hurts my follow ability, but I just really want to make this fucking video game.

3354
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
The reason Slime and Punishment is not even God can stop me.

3355
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I was going to say the reason Slime and Punishment is like esoteric and hard to get into.

3356
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:53,000
It's like, it's also like part of the reason why it's like good and special in the first place.

3357
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:54,000
You know what I mean?

3358
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Like it's such a unique piece of media.

3359
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I mean, it's not even that hard to get into and understand as long as you have like a little bit of understanding of Endless War because I mean, and I guess it helps to know a little bit of song issue.

3360
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
But other than that, it's not like incomprehensible.

3361
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:18,000
In my opinion, even if you don't know what Endless War is, if you started reading Slime and Punishment, you could get the gist and be like, oh, OK, they're in the city and Slime is the currency.

3362
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And that's it.

3363
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
That's all you need to know.

3364
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:26,000
And there's a tower and I guess it's like in charge of everything, but like whatever.

3365
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
It's not important.

3366
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Don't worry about it.

3367
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:39,000
The thing that I like about that and that I also kind of like about Lord of Ghost a little bit is that like, like just the fact that Endless War as its own separate entity, just this existing thing and like events that happen in that like will affect the comic.

3368
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:43,000
But like, you know, you didn't choose to have, you know, acid rain.

3369
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:46,000
That was something that happened and then you worked around it.

3370
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,000
You know what I mean?

3371
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Yeah.

3372
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Yeah.

3373
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Like it could.

3374
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
It could only it could only be what it is.

3375
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:02,000
It could not have been less esoteric than it is my kind of my hope and this might be overly ambitious.

3376
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
This might be foolhardy, but I'll admit to it anyway.

3377
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:18,000
A bit of my hope with the game is that the game will be something that is accessible enough, enjoyable enough in a in a sort of broadly appealing way that it will maybe a wider audience.

3378
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Might see it and like it, then would have read the comic otherwise.

3379
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:32,000
And it might bring more attention to the whole to the comic and by proxy also to my other stuff, Endless War and etc, etc.

3380
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Isn't the only problem with that that you're hoping people will discover and get invested in Slime and Punishment via the finale game, which will have the ending spoiled and also be almost impossible to understand without having read the comic.

3381
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Lore wise, they won't understand it, but I mean the game seeks to provide a mechanical challenge that can be enjoyed even if you don't fully know the lore.

3382
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Yeah, that's fair.

3383
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
What's going on.

3384
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Yeah.

3385
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,000
If it just has good art and stuff.

3386
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:08,000
If the if the game is fun and it looks good and people play it and like that was a fun game, but I sure didn't understand any of that.

3387
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
I guess you're right.

3388
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,000
That's a good incentive.

3389
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
You know what I mean?

3390
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:14,000
The game enjoyed and be like, I wish I knew what that meant.

3391
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You know what I mean?

3392
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Like, oh, here's all comic you can read to know about what that meant.

3393
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Alternatively, that's exactly what I'm hoping for.

3394
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:28,000
You could make a build of the game that is specifically for like newcomers and put that on like itch.io or something.

3395
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
We have some sort of like intro cinematic.

3396
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
You're a pony or something.

3397
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
You got to kill these guys with a sword.

3398
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Isn't that interesting?

3399
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,000
It sure is.

3400
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
And people just enjoy playing it.

3401
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I think I want to rub people's faces in it.

3402
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I think I want people who haven't read the comic to have no choice but to grapple with.

3403
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
What is he talking about?

3404
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
If there are enough just like interesting things happening in a game.

3405
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:56,000
It's such an unusual thing.

3406
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:02,000
It's such an unusual thing to happen in a game that is like so hard to understand.

3407
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Like so much preliminary media needs to be consumed.

3408
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Like no game does that.

3409
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Right.

3410
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
It would be really funny to see people's reactions.

3411
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
You can play the game.

3412
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:19,000
You can play the game without reading the comic, but you won't understand the story of the game.

3413
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:26,000
You won't understand the motivation behind it or why it's happening unless you've read the comic is my intention with it.

3414
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
And you know what?

3415
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,000
That's all part of my vision.

3416
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:33,000
It's all part of my vision and it's all completely non-negotiable.

3417
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,000
But it is what it is.

3418
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Next voicemail is called A Poem for Ben.

3419
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Three, two, one, go.

3420
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:48,000
This next poem goes out to Ben St. of Patreon fame.

3421
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,000
As I wake in the morning I go for my phone.

3422
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I just can't let go.

3423
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Can't leave them alone.

3424
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
They've mentioned my name.

3425
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Time to make them pay.

3426
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I'll work on my game, but not today.

3427
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
I just can't stop yigging.

3428
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Could there be something wrong with me?

3429
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I just can't stop yigging.

3430
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Tweet after tweet.

3431
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Tweet after tweet.

3432
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Will I ever be free?

3433
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
I just can't stop yigging.

3434
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Last word must always be mine to say.

3435
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I just can't stop yigging.

3436
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I'll work on my comics.

3437
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Someday.

3438
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Cruel.

3439
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Overly cruel.

3440
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Savage.

3441
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
My feedback is you kind of sound like a robot.

3442
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:36,000
You should get better at enunciating.

3443
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Oh my god.

3444
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I've made like five or six tweets about yig in as many months.

3445
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,000
It's slowed down considerably.

3446
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,000
So I don't know why they're still getting mad at me about it.

3447
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,000
This is like a month late.

3448
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Even I, eventually I did realize if I keep banging this drum,

3449
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I'm going to start looking like the asshole.

3450
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
So I should stop.

3451
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
And I did.

3452
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
So yeah, very funny.

3453
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Very funny.

3454
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Very funny.

3455
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I can't stop yigging.

3456
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:09,000
It's true.

3457
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,000
It's true.

3458
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
I'm guilty.

3459
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
She's a yigger, Jerry.

3460
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,000
She's a yigger.

3461
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Next voicemail is called, uh, what is it?

3462
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Uh, fuck, I lost track.

3463
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:29,000
How to explain trans to cis people by a cis person.

3464
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Okay.

3465
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Three, two, one, go.

3466
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:37,000
So here's how to explain being trans to cis people.

3467
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I mean, I guess Gib can back up whether this is actually an accurate description or not,

3468
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:47,000
but I don't know, seems to be to me based on listening to trans people.

3469
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,000
As a cis person.

3470
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:55,000
So as a cis guy, whether as an adult or at least as a teenager,

3471
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:00,000
there's almost certainly going to be a point in your life where you wish you were more

3472
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:07,000
masculine than you are currently and you want other people to see you as masculine.

3473
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:15,000
So you do stuff to your body to make yourself more masculine and like the way that you talk

3474
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:19,000
and the way that your body language is and all this other shit.

3475
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:26,000
So then just imagine instead you wanted the reverse of that.

3476
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:31,000
If you wanted to be less masculine and more feminine and be perceived as such and do all

3477
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:38,000
the stuff to your body and like the way that you behave in order to produce the opposite effect.

3478
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
You see, it's really not hard to understand.

3479
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:44,000
It's not some difficult thing that we have to solve.

3480
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,000
It's easy.

3481
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,000
You know what?

3482
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
That seemed pretty reasonable.

3483
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:52,000
It's a pretty simplistic explanation, but it works.

3484
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:56,000
It is kind of like that because I was obviously raised male.

3485
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:02,000
I had these ideas that I should be more masculine, but I never wanted to.

3486
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:09,000
All of these things that were put forth as like the path towards being an adult male

3487
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:12,000
was like, okay, I guess I do all this.

3488
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Never having considered that I could maybe not do that and do the opposite instead.

3489
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:20,000
And once I realized that and I was like, oh wait, this is way better.

3490
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I actually like doing this.

3491
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
That's it.

3492
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Sounds based.

3493
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
I think I get when you put it like that.

3494
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
I think I get entirely what he's trying to say.

3495
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I also never had the desire to become more masculine at any point in my life, to be honest.

3496
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Yeah, I mean, that's why I said it was simplistic.

3497
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

3498
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I think it generally is right.

3499
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,000
It's just like, it's not going to apply to everyone, but like, yeah, like, you know,

3500
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
I feel most people will grapple with that at some point.

3501
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Like, you know, like, oh, this is what society expects of me.

3502
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,000
I need to either, you know, accept that or disagree with it.

3503
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:05,000
There are certain masculine traits that I do admire and seek to enhance in myself,

3504
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:10,000
most notably being ripped.

3505
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Actually, pretty much that's the only one.

3506
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Yeah, it's just that one, actually.

3507
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:14,000
It's like, that is the thing.

3508
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,000
It's just like, it's so hard for me not to just be like, yeah,

3509
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
but there's no reason women can't be ripped.

3510
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,000
I mean, that's like a completely fabricated society,

3511
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,000
societal expectation.

3512
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:24,000
I mean, that's what it all is.

3513
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,000
It all comes down to that too.

3514
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:26,000
And so it's like, I don't know.

3515
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:30,000
You come down to like, society dictates all of these things.

3516
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:34,000
And it's, it's, you're only trans as much as your society tells you

3517
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:37,000
that you are the other thing you want to switch.

3518
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Right.

3519
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,000
You know what?

3520
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
If we lived in a radical gender anarchy where like,

3521
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
no one expected anything of anyone,

3522
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
people wouldn't like need to be trans because like gender,

3523
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
it would be a different concept.

3524
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
You know what I mean?

3525
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Because there would be no, because you wouldn't,

3526
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
you wouldn't be assigned anything.

3527
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Right.

3528
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:56,000
So you wouldn't end up being the opposite of that.

3529
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Yeah.

3530
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:00,000
And just strive towards whatever you felt like.

3531
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Another thing I think is a good way to make people think about it a little

3532
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:07,000
more is just to ask them why, as a cis person,

3533
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
why are you like a man?

3534
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
What makes you like that?

3535
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Like,

3536
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Going up to my neighbors, why are you a man?

3537
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Like, why are you male?

3538
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
How does that work?

3539
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Why are you white, friend?

3540
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Because it's the question they ask, like,

3541
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:22,000
so why are you trans?

3542
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:23,000
I don't really get it.

3543
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Like, why are you not trans?

3544
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:25,000
I don't really get it.

3545
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Just say the same thing.

3546
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
That's like one of the weirdest things.

3547
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Oh, that's just, that's just like when Donnie Darko asks,

3548
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
why are you in that bunny suit?

3549
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
And Frank asks, why are you in that human suit?

3550
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
That's exactly what being trans is like.

3551
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
It's like that one scene from Donnie Darko.

3552
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,000
I was going to say, like, I totally, like,

3553
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I pretty much agree that it's not,

3554
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
it's like basically it all just comes down to like,

3555
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,000
what society expects of you.

3556
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
So I'm not entirely sure.

3557
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I basically agree with the general message of that voicemail,

3558
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,000
but I don't know, like, to me, like, I never,

3559
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
it's so obvious that trans people are real,

3560
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
because like, I am a guy and I have no desire to be a girl,

3561
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
so like, I can't empathize with that at all,

3562
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
but it's like, no one would just like,

3563
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
pretend like that, like, it doesn't make any sense to me.

3564
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Like, white people are so like, vigorously denying it,

3565
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
and it's like, what, why?

3566
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,000
It's because of the pity vote.

3567
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
It's because of the pity vote,

3568
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,000
and I've become Lord Mayor of Endless War.

3569
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Next voicemail?

3570
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Next voicemail is called Audacity Rant,

3571
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
not directed at you.

3572
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
This is from Oblivionfall.

3573
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Shout outs to Oblivionfall.

3574
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Is this about how Audacity is banned now?

3575
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Oh yeah.

3576
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
It's probably going to be about how Audacity is banned.

3577
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Okay.

3578
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Three, two, one, go.

3579
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:42,000
You all need to get the fuck off Twitter.

3580
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Audacity is not spyware.

3581
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Everyone's saying that it is, is lying to you for attention,

3582
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
because they love the dopamine they get,

3583
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
when they get 30,000 likes for spreading false misinformation.

3584
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I sure love that.

3585
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,000
It's so fucking annoying.

3586
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,000
If you must know what is happening with Audacity,

3587
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
it is this.

3588
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:02,000
They collect diagnostic data.

3589
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:05,000
That is your country of origin, your CPU,

3590
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:09,000
your OS version, error codes, and crash reports.

3591
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
That's fucking it.

3592
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
That is the only information they get.

3593
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
They do receive your IP address,

3594
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:18,000
which, oh god, someone at this IP address used Audacity

3595
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,000
within the last 24 hours, because in case you didn't know,

3596
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:24,000
that information is scrambled after 24 hours,

3597
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:27,000
so your data is completely anonymous from that point.

3598
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
That is the only data being collected.

3599
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
They are not collecting your audio or sending it to the cloud.

3600
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I've seen people say that.

3601
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
They're full of shit and they're lying.

3602
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Oh, but they said that law enforcement might ask for information.

3603
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Yeah.

3604
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,000
And what information do they have?

3605
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Oh god, the reverb effect crashed for this IP address six hours ago.

3606
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Shut the fuck up.

3607
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Look, if you really don't like this stuff,

3608
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
let me give you a little life hack.

3609
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Audacity does not need an internet connection to run.

3610
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:59,000
You can just disable it in your firewall.

3611
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Not that it fucking matters, but if you care, you can try that.

3612
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,000
But don't fucking uninstall and don't tell other people to uninstall.

3613
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
You absolute fucking moron.

3614
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Please stop it.

3615
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Good, because I was going to be, I was going to say,

3616
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I'm too lazy to uninstall it.

3617
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
I'll just let them steal my data.

3618
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
I don't care.

3619
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I had a feeling that it was, it was sort of blown out of the bush.

3620
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Yeah.

3621
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I had a feeling too.

3622
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
It's like, I was like, there's no way they're just like, it's not like,

3623
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
it can't be as bad as everyone thinks it is.

3624
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,000
You guys were all on board.

3625
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,000
You guys were all into the meme.

3626
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,000
You totally bought in, but now all I want to say,

3627
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
listen back to the beginning episode.

3628
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
I specifically said, I don't know what is going on with Audacity.

3629
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
I just want to explicitly say,

3630
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
I didn't pretend like I knew what was going on.

3631
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
I just heard people say it was bad.

3632
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Let the record show.

3633
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
You can listen back to whatever shows.

3634
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:44,000
There was a clip of me saying that I thought it was real.

3635
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
No clip.

3636
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Was that before or after we started talking laser,

3637
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
but I'm trying to figure out if that's in the episode or if that's going

3638
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,000
to be in like the pre bonus.

3639
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:55,000
You'll have to, you'll have to subscribe to the, to the, to the

3640
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Patreon to get the bonus episode to see if I was lying just then.

3641
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I think, I think we were talking about it in the pre,

3642
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
before laser bots audio was working.

3643
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Yeah.

3644
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:09,000
So yeah, that would be,

3645
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Yeah.

3646
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Well, whatever.

3647
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Point is I was going to just use Audacity no matter what,

3648
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,000
because I'm lazy.

3649
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,000
I'm fucking lazy.

3650
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
I've been using it since like 2007.

3651
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,000
I'm not going to stop now.

3652
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I hope they're stealing my data so I can,

3653
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:23,000
I can sue them and get mad about it and make Twitter posts.

3654
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
My data is great.

3655
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I want, I want them to see how great my data is.

3656
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Cyber shell, you make,

3657
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
how do you get so many likes on Twitter?

3658
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I don't know.

3659
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:33,000
You're so popular on Twitter.

3660
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Only you fucking kill it.

3661
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,000
You kill it on Twitter.

3662
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:38,000
I'll tell you why it's because you use Twitter to like get into

3663
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,000
arguments and dunk on people.

3664
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:42,000
I only use Twitter to make funny jokes.

3665
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
That is the only reason I use it.

3666
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
I don't post anything that isn't like,

3667
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:47,000
is this funny?

3668
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I think this is kind of funny.

3669
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,000
This might get some likes.

3670
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Like I'm not, I mean,

3671
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:51,000
I self promote my stupid videos,

3672
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:52,000
but those tweets don't get a lot of like,

3673
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
they're just normal.

3674
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
I can't disagree.

3675
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:00,000
It's, it's why my Twitter was good for a while there.

3676
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Cause I only posted funny comics and just like puns and stuff.

3677
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:10,000
But I don't like anything else.

3678
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Except maybe trying this.

3679
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,000
You need it.

3680
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:14,000
You need to follow it in the first place.

3681
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Otherwise it won't work.

3682
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Well, it's the hard way.

3683
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:22,000
When I got the zero like tweet.

3684
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Yeah.

3685
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Then you just delete it.

3686
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:26,000
If you get zero likes on a tweet,

3687
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
you delete that shit.

3688
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
That's embarrassing.

3689
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
Not that ever happens to me, of course.

3690
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Actually, it doesn't.

3691
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
There's never happened to Ben St.

3692
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Ever.

3693
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
And don't even think about going and searching through his

3694
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Twitter replies.

3695
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Cause he's already deleted the ones that had zero replies.

3696
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Don't count replies.

3697
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Don't count.

3698
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Okay.

3699
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Fair enough.

3700
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Next.

3701
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Next voicemail is called, uh,

3702
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,000
what's it called?

3703
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
It's called fast talking super listener.

3704
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Tarbuck transom.

3705
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Three, two, one, go.

3706
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:59,000
When there's a misunderstanding or a miscommunication,

3707
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
do you think the speaker or the listener has more responsibility?

3708
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Obviously it's both.

3709
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:06,000
And also obviously it's not exactly equal.

3710
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
At least I don't think so.

3711
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:10,000
I think it's like three to two listener to speaker.

3712
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:11,000
What about you guys?

3713
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Uh,

3714
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:16,000
I hate to do this, but it depends entirely on the situation.

3715
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Like I can't just.

3716
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Yeah.

3717
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
That's what I was going to say.

3718
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Credit to the speaker as per person.

3719
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Cause you can say something vague and ambiguous and then it's

3720
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
on you or you can just not understand something incredibly

3721
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:25,000
obvious.

3722
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,000
It's completely on the listener.

3723
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Like there's no, I can't divide it up based on

3724
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,000
some majority of the time.

3725
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Maybe I don't know.

3726
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Here's an example.

3727
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Like a first impression.

3728
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:41,000
The pressure is on the speaker to make sure they don't

3729
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:45,000
miscommunicate because that's an important thing to get

3730
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,000
right.

3731
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
And if somebody hears something wrong, you can just

3732
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
clarify and that's fine.

3733
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
I guess it's more on the situation.

3734
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Yeah.

3735
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
I guess if I have to go to my head, it's more on the speaker to

3736
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
say something that can be understood.

3737
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,000
I mean, I don't know.

3738
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
It's your job to say the thing.

3739
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:04,000
I would say, I mean, in the same way that I think that like,

3740
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:09,000
if an artist makes a piece of art and someone reads it and

3741
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:12,000
they take the wrong message away or the message that the

3742
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
artist didn't intend, it's not the list.

3743
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:17,000
It's not that the listener failed or did something wrong.

3744
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Yeah.

3745
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:21,000
The onus is on the artist to convey what they want to convey.

3746
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:25,000
So yeah, I guess, I guess actually I would generally say the

3747
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:28,000
listener is probably the one who should be catered to.

3748
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
And it's, the speaker is the one acting.

3749
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Yeah.

3750
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
If you're saying something, you're the one trying to

3751
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:34,000
communicate something.

3752
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
You're the one like, who has a goal.

3753
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Like I want to say something that is understood.

3754
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,000
I mean, the listener, their only job is to listen to it.

3755
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,000
You know what I mean?

3756
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Although there are plenty of cases where a listener can just

3757
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:49,000
not, can just decide that they want to misunderstand you or

3758
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
pretend you said something different.

3759
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,000
I'm assuming this is like a one-on-one conversation.

3760
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,000
It's easier to like, if you say something to your audience

3761
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
and like most of your audience doesn't understand what you

3762
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
meant, then like, yeah, that's clearly on you.

3763
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:02,000
You know what I mean?

3764
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Like it helps if it's that kind of situation.

3765
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Yes.

3766
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Okay.

3767
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Uh, next one is called Tarby Transum.

3768
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Three, two, one, go.

3769
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Fast talk in Craftsman and Cloud Chaser Eternal,

3770
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Tarbuck Transum here.

3771
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000
I work exclusively with hand tools, with surprising speed

3772
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
and surprisingly little expense.

3773
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:25,000
I think you and the other caller would be surprised at

3774
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
exactly how easy it is to make complicated furniture

3775
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:28,000
like chairs.

3776
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
But what I mostly had in mind was bookcases.

3777
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Even you can make a seven-foot culvert case in two to three

3778
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
hours.

3779
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
It would last for decades starting from basic wood.

3780
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:40,000
The most basic tools that I recommend is $35 for the entire kit

3781
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
and that is an entire shop's work.

3782
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
I think I understand the basic premise behind the bookcases.

3783
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,000
What is important is the bookcases.

3784
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Hundreds of bookcases.

3785
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
I want to be surrounded by shelves.

3786
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,000
I want them to coat every wall.

3787
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:53,000
My goal is to live my life in a honeycomb of shelves and drawers

3788
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:54,000
and bookcases.

3789
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:58,000
So there is more to ceiling storage fucking everywhere.

3790
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Do you have a weird dream like that that no one would take

3791
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
seriously like having a private ball pit or something?

3792
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Like the honeycomb is mine.

3793
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
You can't have it.

3794
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:09,000
If I had more floor space, I would like more shelves

3795
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:12,000
because I do have a bunch of junk kind of just sitting on stuff.

3796
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
I'm going to take the hard opposite stance and say,

3797
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,000
I'm anti-shelf.

3798
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
I don't want any shelves in my life.

3799
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:20,000
I want books piled high straight from the ground to the ceiling.

3800
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
No shelves involved.

3801
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
How did you get them?

3802
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
I don't read books.

3803
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:29,000
I just look at them and admire my collection.

3804
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
I, well, I'm the same.

3805
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:38,000
I would have like a big like old fancy like stuffy like like a library

3806
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:42,000
for old British royal something or other.

3807
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,000
You have to pay to get in.

3808
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Only white people allowed, you know, all that stupid shit.

3809
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Hell yeah.

3810
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Classic British library.

3811
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:54,000
The classic like evil like British library with the dark leather bound books

3812
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,000
with no text on the side.

3813
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,000
I like the aesthetic of that.

3814
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Made of human flesh.

3815
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Yeah.

3816
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Yeah.

3817
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:04,000
The Necronomicon is the sort of thing you would see in Harry Potter.

3818
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
But I would never read any of them.

3819
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:12,000
I just like the fact that they could fill a wall with leather and paper.

3820
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,000
You know?

3821
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I would love to have a room like yeah.

3822
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Just full like a library like Beauty and the Beast style library

3823
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:23,000
where all the books are completely just every single book is just tales gets

3824
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:27,000
trolled but like a slightly different size.

3825
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Well, well, I mean by the time that all four arcs are done,

3826
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,000
it's going to be enough to fill up an entire an entire wall of bookshelves.

3827
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:39,000
I still can't believe you said four arcs and we're only almost done with arc one.

3828
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
I mean, he said we've gotten similar estimates in the past.

3829
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Like, oh, I would do 100 chapters.

3830
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
But it's like to hear that it's just like, what the fuck?

3831
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
How much shit can possibly you said?

3832
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Sisi, you said when you were on the other day, you said four arcs.

3833
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,000
And honestly, I didn't believe you.

3834
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
I thought like there's no way.

3835
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:55,000
There's no way.

3836
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
I always knew that was the case.

3837
02:52:57,000 --> 02:53:00,000
But I like just specifically to hear it from laser boss mouth.

3838
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Like they're literally playing to that much out in advance.

3839
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Like what the fuck?

3840
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Like it's cool.

3841
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:06,000
It's good.

3842
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,000
I'm glad.

3843
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
I would rather people to plan out their comics like that.

3844
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
But fuck.

3845
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Was that was that was that Sisi?

3846
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Yeah, to be fair.

3847
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,000
He said the end of the first arc is the attack on troll forces.

3848
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:24,000
But that only really started like a chapter, like chapter 11 or 12 or 13.

3849
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Right.

3850
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Yeah.

3851
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,000
The assault has been going on for ages.

3852
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:28,000
You're right.

3853
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
But I mean, there is a bunch of stuff before that.

3854
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
So maybe this is like the second.

3855
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:36,000
I think I think Ben might be right in that, like maybe there really are four arcs,

3856
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
but arcs two, three and four are just going to be shorter.

3857
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:42,000
They're just going to buy virtue of the comic existing in its current format.

3858
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
It will be shorter.

3859
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Yeah, the war.

3860
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I mean, he said the war.

3861
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:50,000
It sort of feels like we're in the war now.

3862
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Right.

3863
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Right.

3864
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
I guess it's just technically one battle.

3865
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:57,000
This whole thing has been one battle basically, which is ridiculous.

3866
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Like it's been going on for that long, longer than the fucking.

3867
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
That's true.

3868
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Oh dark and berserk.

3869
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,000
It's just been going and going.

3870
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:07,000
He said he said there are other troll civilizations.

3871
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:11,000
So I mean, I guess maybe, you know, yeah, this is just one battle with one troll city.

3872
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:14,000
And I made it becomes a worldwide conflict.

3873
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I guess.

3874
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Yeah.

3875
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Yeah.

3876
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Makes sense.

3877
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:24,000
There's a guy named Mr. Claire, who's the mayor of fuck poor people, which is what

3878
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:27,000
the city is called the troll city of fuck poor people.

3879
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:30,000
I think you mentioned that before.

3880
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
That's like a different city.

3881
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Yeah.

3882
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
It will be interesting.

3883
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,000
I was trying.

3884
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,000
I said this a little bit.

3885
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:40,000
I was like, I want to hear more, see more world building from laser bought.

3886
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:41,000
You know what I mean?

3887
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Because like, yeah, we haven't gotten too much of that.

3888
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,000
I would love to see another troll civilization.

3889
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I would love to hear him go like here.

3890
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:48,000
There's another troll city out there.

3891
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
It's called Nalaka Conom.

3892
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:54,000
We've got to send it all in a collective universe.

3893
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Oh, we should have said endless war.

3894
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,000
We should have said T-Bap.

3895
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:00,000
We should have said that's what you put in the fucking comic.

3896
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Mr. Homestuck.

3897
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Fuck Homestuck.

3898
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Just another spoke on the wheel of slime and punishment, just like more lores and universes

3899
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,000
to connect to.

3900
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:14,000
My goal is for endless war to be the saint elsewhere of web comics.

3901
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
You know what I'm talking about, right?

3902
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Yeah.

3903
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
The smash bros of web comics, except not really.

3904
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Like the autistic boy with the thing.

3905
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Yeah.

3906
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Everything is technically because of all the crossovers.

3907
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:30,000
All of these shows technically exist in the same universe.

3908
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,000
And therefore all of them are the dream of an autistic boy staring into a globe.

3909
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:37,000
I use that scene of the boy with the globe.

3910
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:38,000
I use that entire scene in one of my videos.

3911
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:41,000
And I got completely copyright-striked and demonetized.

3912
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
But it was worth it because I just thought it was so funny.

3913
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
I was going to say it.

3914
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Blast it.

3915
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Well, I mean, technically in...

3916
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Oh, fuck.

3917
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,000
There is an alternate dimension.

3918
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:58,000
There is an alternate universe where Alt Timeline, Ben St.

3919
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:02,000
is staring into a snow globe imagining all of the other goings on.

3920
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
I don't know how that fits in.

3921
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:09,000
That's in The Forgotten Chapter of the Slime and Punishment Saga,

3922
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
which is called Nuts.

3923
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,000
Which I guess...

3924
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
I'll put a link in the description.

3925
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:18,000
I never talk about nuts because I just did it on a whim like one day.

3926
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:22,000
But it's like a whole framing device thing.

3927
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
I won't even look for it now.

3928
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I don't remember where I put it.

3929
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Next voicemail.

3930
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Fuck, I lost track.

3931
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I gotta go back to Speakpipe.

3932
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:37,000
The next voicemail is 419.

3933
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:40,000
When Ben talks about Noita...

3934
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Wait, did I post it?

3935
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:43,000
No, sorry.

3936
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:47,000
The next one is Audacity Follow-Up and Corrections by Oblivionfall.

3937
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
So, I hope he says...

3938
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
No, actually it is spying on me.

3939
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:52,000
No, actually...

3940
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:55,000
Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.

3941
02:56:55,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Just a follow-up to the Audacity thing because I realized my previous voicemail was recorded on the 5th

3942
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:04,000
and people aren't gonna hear this until the 16th or later.

3943
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:08,000
So, just to cover my ass, let me say this...

3944
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Audacity do not need to collect your IP.

3945
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Even though it's just for 24 hours and then it's irretrievably lost and can't be leaked anymore.

3946
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:19,000
The simple fact is they don't need it for diagnostics.

3947
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
It's unnecessary.

3948
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:23,000
And so, yeah, I think we should ask them not to do that.

3949
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:28,000
And if a fork comes along, using the fork obviously would probably be a fine idea.

3950
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I don't particularly want to have to use my firewall or use a VPN to use Audacity.

3951
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Even though, again, they're only holding it for 24 hours and nothing's gonna really happen with it.

3952
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:43,000
But the misinformation of, oh, they're tapping your microphone and sending it to the Russian government

3953
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
and that shit is completely fucking incorrect.

3954
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,000
There's no evidence of that at all.

3955
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,000
And I wish we were sure.

3956
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:50,000
People are getting a lot of attention for saying that and it made me mad,

3957
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:55,000
which is why my previous voicemail had a lot of fucks and shit sent in.

3958
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Yeah, you get the idea.

3959
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Okay.

3960
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Okay.

3961
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Oh, here it is.

3962
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Okay.

3963
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:06,000
No, I found it.

3964
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:09,000
I found nuts.

3965
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
There's a link to one of the pages of nuts.

3966
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Nuts the beginning.

3967
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:20,000
It is dimension A12F22X75 parentheses C, just in case anyone...

3968
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Wait, that's not the first page.

3969
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
No, I gotta go back to the first page.

3970
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:28,000
You gotta put this on your site.

3971
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I should...

3972
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,000
You know what?

3973
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I should put it on your site.

3974
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Yeah, I was gonna say like...

3975
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I don't know why I put it only on MSPFA.

3976
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:34,000
I was surprised that this isn't on...

3977
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Yeah, this site.

3978
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Not.

3979
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Oh, so that's what MSPFA is.

3980
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Yeah, this is fully...

3981
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:47,000
This is fully RFCK Canada and it is completely essential lore

3982
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:52,000
and I just like never made a big deal out of it or told anyone about it.

3983
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Man, I love that even if you try to follow Slime and Punishment,

3984
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Ben will still fucking cuck you and not show you important lore for no reason.

3985
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:04,000
I'll just make some chapters in secret and forget to mention them.

3986
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Yeah, that's true.

3987
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Okay, next voicemail for real this time.

3988
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:13,000
This is...

3989
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Yeah, when Ben talks about Noida, 3, 2, 1, go.

3990
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:21,000
Yeah, that sounds kind of cool.

3991
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:22,000
That is how I feel.

3992
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Honestly, I've seen people play Noida.

3993
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
It does look really cool, but I just keep being like,

3994
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
oh, I'll get into that later.

3995
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
I'll play it later and I will play it later.

3996
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Simsy was playing Noida and he was showing me some of his deaths the other day in the mines.

3997
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:48,000
He hasn't gotten his first win yet, so I watched him desperately try and get the Fire Mage wet with a water potion,

3998
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:52,000
but he was standing on a hill and I said, no, no, you fool.

3999
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
You got to lure him down into a hole so you can get him in a puddle.

4000
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:57,000
You got to get him in a puddle.

4001
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Gravity, fucker.

4002
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:02,000
He's not going to get wet standing on a hill.

4003
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
I had not...

4004
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Oh, I think I mentioned this.

4005
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
I'll say it again because I'm proud of myself.

4006
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:17,000
I finally did the 33 Orb, get everything run, God run, got the permanent cosmetic item, the Golden Amulet.

4007
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
My character has a Gold Amulet now forever.

4008
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:24,000
I didn't play Noida for like a week or more, like two weeks after that.

4009
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Just yesterday, just because I was kind of stressed out and I wanted to relax,

4010
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:35,000
I opened up a game and I played it for maybe like an hour or two and I died really bad because I was out of practice.

4011
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
I love Noida.

4012
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:38,000
I fucking love Noida.

4013
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
I thought you abandoned Noida.

4014
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Yeah, it is interesting.

4015
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I thought you were like, no, I'm only into modded Minecraft now.

4016
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:46,000
That's the only thing I care about, modded Minecraft.

4017
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Well, you play as a dark wizard in both things.

4018
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:51,000
You're just playing Noida in Minecraft.

4019
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:52,000
No.

4020
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:56,000
I didn't do every quest, the Sunseed quest.

4021
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:59,000
I didn't complete the Sunseed quest, so I have to create the Sun.

4022
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Wow.

4023
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Look at this fucking casual.

4024
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Didn't even complete the Sunseed quest.

4025
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:03,000
Everyone laughing at me at the moment.

4026
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Didn't even create the Sun.

4027
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Yeah, I got a...

4028
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:08,000
There's a whole bunch of like bosses.

4029
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,000
There's like new bosses and like the recent updates that I just never went and found.

4030
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:13,000
I should just go...

4031
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:16,000
I hate when games add new bosses for me to fight.

4032
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:17,000
So much work.

4033
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
I hate new content too.

4034
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:23,000
I hate it when like, they add a bunch of new cool stuff.

4035
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:26,000
I have had it happen where like, I'll 100% a game and then they add new content.

4036
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:27,000
I'm just like, ugh.

4037
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Now I didn't 100% that game and I can't go back and do much new shit.

4038
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
Like I've moved on from the game at this point.

4039
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
If I moved on from the game, then yeah.

4040
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:39,000
It's like, what do you mean I don't have all the trophies anymore?

4041
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:40,000
I don't want to get more.

4042
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:41,000
I had them all.

4043
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

4044
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Next voicemail is called when Vinesauce Joel plays Noida.

4045
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
Three, two, one, go.

4046
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:52,000
Holy shit, that's so fucking cool.

4047
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
I have to buy that immediately.

4048
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Did Vinesauce Joel play Noida and...

4049
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:00,000
I don't know.

4050
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:04,000
I feel like it's like sort of an attempt to dunk on you a little bit in a loving way,

4051
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:09,000
but like, he's comparing you talking about a game on a podcast or watching someone play it on stream,

4052
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:12,000
which is of course that's going to be more entertaining and interesting

4053
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
and be a better job of getting you interested in the game.

4054
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,000
You know what I mean?

4055
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Oh, I see.

4056
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
That's his reaction to watching someone play.

4057
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Yeah, whatever.

4058
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:25,000
I see that Vinesauce Joel did play some Noida.

4059
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Good for him.

4060
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:31,000
I mean, I've watched, I really like Fury Forge's Noida videos,

4061
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
although he doesn't really do like gameplay.

4062
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
He does sort of explanation videos.

4063
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:38,000
The one I've watched play at the most is McQueen.

4064
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:39,000
He's pretty good.

4065
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,000
He's pretty good.

4066
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
I don't think he's really doing it anymore though.

4067
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:46,000
I mean, yeah, probably watching Noida is more fun than just hearing me be like,

4068
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:50,000
oh, and then you can squirt water on fire and the fire goes out and it makes steam.

4069
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,000
Oh, Pog.

4070
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
It is funny because that sounds so stupid,

4071
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:56,000
but I love that watching these chemicals interact with each other.

4072
03:02:56,000 --> 03:03:00,000
There was this browser game where you just make powders and watch them interact

4073
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
and that's what Noida reminds me of.

4074
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Noida is literally made by people who made that power game.

4075
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:08,000
That makes perfect sense

4076
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:11,000
because I used to have so much fun just like making a big flammable thing

4077
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
and sitting on a fire and going, oh, it's odd to fire.

4078
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:14,000
I did that.

4079
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Yeah.

4080
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
It's the people that made the powder game.

4081
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
They basically made the powder game and teamed up with some other guys.

4082
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
Real video game, which is a good idea, honestly.

4083
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:25,000
And they were like, let's make a rogue-like action game out of our powder shit.

4084
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:26,000
And they're like, okay.

4085
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:27,000
And then they did.

4086
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Good for them.

4087
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,000
And I'm glad.

4088
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:32,000
Noida seems pretty popular, not like AAA mainstream popular,

4089
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
but pretty popular for like an indie game.

4090
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
People have heard of it.

4091
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Yeah.

4092
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:40,000
I'm thinking I might want to stream it again soon

4093
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
because I'm sort of having played it in a while

4094
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
and I've kind of got the itch again.

4095
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:50,000
That one stream where I beat it was very hype.

4096
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
It took me a bunch of tries.

4097
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
Oh man, that was so exciting.

4098
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:55,000
That was a great stream.

4099
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:58,000
That was like two months ago or more now.

4100
03:03:58,000 --> 03:03:59,000
It was a while ago.

4101
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
Ben, that was eight years ago.

4102
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:03,000
It could be.

4103
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,000
You could tell me that.

4104
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:05,000
No.

4105
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:06,000
It had to be.

4106
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
God, it was this year, right?

4107
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:09,000
Yeah.

4108
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:10,000
It had to be this year.

4109
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,000
Oh my God.

4110
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:12,000
I don't even know.

4111
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,000
All right.

4112
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:14,000
We're dilly-dallying.

4113
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
Next voicemail is called...

4114
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:17,000
It's Janess.

4115
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Three, two, one, go.

4116
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:23,000
I would like to know your thoughts on the general reaction to

4117
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:26,000
Biden withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan.

4118
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:32,000
My thoughts on the general reaction to it.

4119
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:35,000
I don't really see much of a reaction to it.

4120
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:39,000
But they kind of did it without making a big deal of it.

4121
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
That was on purpose.

4122
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Most of the reaction I saw to it.

4123
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,000
I didn't see that much.

4124
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:48,000
I just saw a couple people being sort of making fun of the fact

4125
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:52,000
that they kind of just quietly did it and didn't say they were doing it.

4126
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:53,000
Mission accomplished.

4127
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:54,000
We did it.

4128
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
We beat the war on terror.

4129
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Mission.

4130
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
We kicked their ass.

4131
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Just like Vietnam.

4132
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Victory for America.

4133
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:03,000
Undefeated.

4134
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Zero deaths.

4135
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,000
USA.

4136
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,000
USA.

4137
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:09,000
USA.

4138
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
What's the KD ratio?

4139
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
I was literally about to say...

4140
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:17,000
America, we may not win every war, but we got a pretty good KDR.

4141
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:20,000
I mean, if you consider the nukes we dropped on Japan

4142
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
versus the amount of soldiers that died in Japan,

4143
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,000
it's pretty high.

4144
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Oh.

4145
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
Oh, we got...

4146
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:31,000
We could throw thousands to the fucking meat grinder

4147
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
and we would still be killing it on KDR.

4148
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
And that's exactly what we should do.

4149
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:38,000
I wonder, like, of all time, the UK versus US,

4150
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:41,000
who has the highest death count.

4151
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:44,000
Well, honestly, everything the US ever does

4152
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
should contribute to the UK's count,

4153
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
because we're just a, you know, we're a spin-off show.

4154
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Subsidiary.

4155
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Exactly.

4156
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Every piece of colonialism the UK ever did.

4157
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:53,000
And that includes America.

4158
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
Yeah, I think UK might win.

4159
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Well, I mean, the United States has a bigger population,

4160
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:02,000
but the UK was around a lot longer, so...

4161
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,000
The British Empire at its peak was just enormous,

4162
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
like the global reach and influence.

4163
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Okay, but would the British...

4164
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
But citizens of the British Empire

4165
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:15,000
were not necessarily, like, British people.

4166
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
It might have been, like, people from the colonies.

4167
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
Yeah, okay, if you're talking about, like,

4168
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
the state has directly killed.

4169
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:24,000
I think America might win, honestly, if you're going on that much.

4170
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:27,000
Are we talking about, has killed other people,

4171
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:31,000
or have had their own casualties in war?

4172
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
No, no, no, I mean, like, kill other people.

4173
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
Like, they're enemies in war, or, like,

4174
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:39,000
actually control wars.

4175
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:43,000
America definitely wins if you include all the CIA covert ops

4176
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
in, like, South America and shit.

4177
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:49,000
I'm gonna say that just because the UK was, like,

4178
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
around more during, like, colonialism

4179
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
in, like, the spice trade era,

4180
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
I feel like it, like, laid its roots down

4181
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:58,000
and probably had a much longer lasting effect

4182
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
on a lot of the world.

4183
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
So I kind of want to go with the UK.

4184
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:05,000
Someone in the comments will be sure to correct us,

4185
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:08,000
but, yeah, I feel like they're both, they're both up there.

4186
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Honestly, if you've got an opinion on this,

4187
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
please weigh in in the comments, because I don't know.

4188
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
I'm sh... I'm... fuck.

4189
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
Who's the most...

4190
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
I don't know enough about British colonialism,

4191
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
like, I don't know all the intricate stories.

4192
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
I don't know more about, like, the bad shit America has done.

4193
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
So I guess I should just say America.

4194
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
We win everything, even the being bad competitions.

4195
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:29,000
No.

4196
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:30,000
No, we're not.

4197
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:31,000
We're not.

4198
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:32,000
That's the only thing America wins anymore.

4199
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
No, we're good.

4200
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Uh, next voicemail is called

4201
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:41,000
tar... tar-badative trans-a-dendum.

4202
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Three, two, one, go.

4203
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Correction to my voicemail about speakers' listener responsibility.

4204
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:49,000
The obvious best answer is that the person

4205
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:52,000
who has the majority responsibility is the one that's me.

4206
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
If I'm speaking, then it's the speaker,

4207
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
and if I'm listening, then it's the listener,

4208
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
because I'm the one that I can control.

4209
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:01,000
It's only that ratio I said if neither party is me

4210
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:04,000
or if the other person has also adopted this opinion of mine,

4211
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
because they know true wisdom when they hear it.

4212
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:09,000
It's equal parts trust in myself to be good

4213
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
and a way to hold myself accountable,

4214
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
should I falter, within reason,

4215
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:16,000
at collaborating with others in the field of communication.

4216
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
Just another reason they call your guy tar-badative trans-a-dendum here.

4217
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
The left is Jordan Peterson.

4218
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:23,000
That was already an incredibly confusing question,

4219
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:27,000
and now he's answered it in an even more confusing way to me, honestly.

4220
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:30,000
I just answered it in a way that is like,

4221
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
but you didn't see this come in.

4222
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
But it wasn't even like, here's the voicemail,

4223
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
here's the answer voicemail.

4224
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:39,000
There's a follow-up voicemail that was submitted days later.

4225
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Like, yeah, of course,

4226
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:45,000
when you consider the fact that you can only control your own actions

4227
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
and not that of others, and therefore,

4228
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:51,000
like, yeah, obviously that changes the consideration.

4229
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Whatever you learned here.

4230
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
Nothing.

4231
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:56,000
No more voicemail.

4232
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:57,000
No, okay.

4233
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Next voicemail.

4234
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
Next voicemail is...

4235
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
Did I post it yet?

4236
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:03,000
No, I fucking didn't.

4237
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:04,000
You did.

4238
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,000
No, obviously I did.

4239
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:06,000
It's called Sonic Shroom.

4240
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
Three, two, one, go.

4241
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
Hey there, PCP.

4242
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:14,000
I heard you guys talking about holo nights.

4243
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
It's on the podcast,

4244
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
and so I just wondered, like,

4245
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:23,000
if there's any other Metroidvania kind of games that you guys like.

4246
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:26,000
I've been playing a really good one called

4247
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
Ender Lilies.

4248
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Ender Lilies.

4249
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
It's kind of like a holo night,

4250
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
but it's got more of a gothic theme to it.

4251
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:36,000
More?

4252
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,000
More of a gothic?

4253
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
I was going to say what.

4254
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
But yeah, I know I've seen some...

4255
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:42,000
I saw this.

4256
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:43,000
I saw this on Steam.

4257
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
I saw this on Steam the other day.

4258
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
You know, I just thought,

4259
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:50,000
yeah, what are you guys into in that kind of genre?

4260
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Am I wrong?

4261
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
Do you have a car alarm going off in the background of that?

4262
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:54,000
What the fuck was that sound?

4263
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
I thought it was a bird at first,

4264
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:57,000
but I think it was a car alarm.

4265
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:58,000
It was too modulating too frequently.

4266
03:09:58,000 --> 03:09:59,000
No, it was an alarm.

4267
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Whatever, it's fine.

4268
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Metroidvanias.

4269
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:05,000
Honestly, I can't think of anyone that I've played even remotely recently.

4270
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:09,000
The only, like, Metroid likes I enjoy

4271
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:12,000
are Metroid Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion.

4272
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:15,000
What kind of Castlevania has ever entertained me?

4273
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
I've never really been a big Castlevania bloke.

4274
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:18,000
I'm only...

4275
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:22,000
My biggest Metroid game that I'm a fan of is Super Metroid.

4276
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:25,000
It's just classic, but I do love the Zero Mission and Fusion.

4277
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
They're great too.

4278
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
Yeah, I love all the Metroid games.

4279
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:32,000
I've played all the Castlevania games.

4280
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
I prefer the classic Castlevania games.

4281
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
Yeah, actually, I'm a little familiar with the 2D ones,

4282
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:37,000
but not like the Castle...

4283
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
Not like Simply the Night, you know what I mean?

4284
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Not the Vayneas.

4285
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:41,000
Yeah.

4286
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:45,000
When you say the classic ones, you mean like the pre-Symphony ones.

4287
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:46,000
Yes.

4288
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:47,000
Yeah.

4289
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:48,000
I never played the old ones.

4290
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:52,000
The first one I ever played was Symphony of the Night.

4291
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:55,000
And then my favorite Castlevania that I played the most

4292
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:59,000
was definitely Aria of Sorrow and the Direct Sequel too.

4293
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
It had a Direct Sequel, I forget what it was called.

4294
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow.

4295
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
Yes, Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow.

4296
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
I played the shit out of those.

4297
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:10,000
The other ones on the handheld were like, okay,

4298
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
but that one was the best one.

4299
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
Or the one I played the most anyway.

4300
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:15,000
Yeah, those were good.

4301
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:16,000
It was Fusion.

4302
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
Oh, what's that one?

4303
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:19,000
It's that series that's like...

4304
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:22,000
It's that indie series by the Japanese guy who...

4305
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:25,000
It's all about cute girls and it's a Metroidvania.

4306
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:26,000
Momodora.

4307
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:27,000
She's got the...

4308
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,000
Momodora.

4309
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:29,000
Yeah, I've played the...

4310
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:32,000
I've played most of the Momodora games,

4311
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:33,000
and those are good.

4312
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
They're not like huge.

4313
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:37,000
They're not as big as a Castlevania,

4314
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,000
but they're good.

4315
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:39,000
They're good Metroidvania action.

4316
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Although like...

4317
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:43,000
I think it was made by a Brazilian guy, actually,

4318
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:44,000
or something like that.

4319
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Wait, really?

4320
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:46,000
Yeah.

4321
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:47,000
You know what?

4322
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:48,000
That might be true.

4323
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Or a Venetian guy or some shit like that.

4324
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:52,000
They get...

4325
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
There's like five of them and they get...

4326
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
Like the first one is really basic

4327
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:59,000
and they get more complicated as they go on.

4328
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:02,000
The second to last one is like a pretty good, solid,

4329
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:06,000
like kind of platformer action sort of game in that vein.

4330
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:09,000
The last one is very good.

4331
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
It is definitely a Metroidvania,

4332
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:15,000
although it's smaller than like a Symphony of the Night.

4333
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:20,000
It's not as big as like a mainstream Nintendo game like that,

4334
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:21,000
but it's really good.

4335
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
Those are good games.

4336
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
Hollow Knight's good.

4337
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
I mean, Noida is...

4338
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:30,000
Noida has a bit of that in that it's a side scroller shooter

4339
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:32,000
about exploration.

4340
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
I wouldn't really call it a Metroidvania,

4341
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:38,000
but it's a metroglainite.

4342
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:40,000
Something like that.

4343
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:42,000
Add powder in there.

4344
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,000
Add powder in there somewhere.

4345
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:45,000
Yeah.

4346
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:48,000
I should say I have played Hollow Knight a lot more.

4347
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,000
I've been streaming it, actually.

4348
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:52,000
Everyone twitch.tv slash give and take.

4349
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:54,000
And I'm really enjoying it.

4350
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:58,000
So that's a good one.

4351
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:02,000
That's a good ass video game.

4352
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:05,000
Have you fought the boss that's like...

4353
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:09,000
I think it's like a bunch of Beatles that like drop down from the ceiling?

4354
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
No.

4355
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:14,000
I don't know.

4356
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:20,000
The moment I'm at the boss that's like four or five big circle guys,

4357
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:23,000
and they're all in a room and you got to get them.

4358
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:26,000
It's like in the nobles quarter or whatever.

4359
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:30,000
I feel like maybe that's the one.

4360
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:34,000
I remember there was one where there was a bunch of...

4361
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,000
There's one...

4362
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:38,000
Yeah, I remember these ones drop from the ceiling.

4363
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:42,000
And I remember you could kill one before the battle started.

4364
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:45,000
There was a trick you could do that could kill one of them.

4365
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:48,000
So there would only be three instead of four.

4366
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,000
And it made it a lot easier.

4367
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:53,000
But that was the hardest boss for me in all of Hollow Knight.

4368
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:56,000
I think it was because my nail wasn't well upgraded at the time.

4369
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:01,000
Yeah, I think the most recent big boss I defeated was the Hornet Fight

4370
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:05,000
outside the outskirts of the city and the dust.

4371
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
Have you fought the Mantis Lords?

4372
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:12,000
Yeah, yeah, that was ages ago.

4373
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:16,000
I don't know how far in I am, but I've got the super dash.

4374
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:18,000
I've got the double jump.

4375
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:25,000
I've got all the three nail techniques.

4376
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:29,000
And then the secret other one.

4377
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:35,000
I know people say that when you upgrade your nail, the game gets kind of too easy.

4378
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:39,000
And that's probably true, but I just fucking upgraded my nail all the way

4379
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
because I just want to have fun.

4380
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:44,000
I just want to have fun playing the game.

4381
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:47,000
The last upgrade is there.

4382
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:50,000
If they didn't mean for you to be able to have it and use it

4383
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:55,000
and balance the game around that, then why would they put it there?

4384
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
So I didn't listen to the haters.

4385
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000
I got all the nail upgrades.

4386
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:03,000
I got super powerful and I won.

4387
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:06,000
Anything else or next voicemail?

4388
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:07,000
No.

4389
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
Anything more on that bullshit?

4390
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,000
Okay, good, good.

4391
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:11,000
I don't want to hear it.

4392
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:16,000
Next one is called Ben's Been Talking Shit.

4393
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,000
Now he'll taste comeuppance.

4394
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:20,000
That's a gross joke, by the way,

4395
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:27,000
because Chris Chan would call her semen her comeuppance.

4396
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:30,000
So I don't want to taste that.

4397
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:32,000
Why did you say that?

4398
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
Why did I say that?

4399
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:35,000
It doesn't matter.

4400
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:36,000
Just do it.

4401
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,000
It's funny because I like it.

4402
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,000
That information is just kicking around Ben's head

4403
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:42,000
and he has to inflict it on all of us.

4404
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
Didn't even mention the Fanta.

4405
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:47,000
She had all these weird, I mean the Fanta is a whole different thing.

4406
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:48,000
They had all these weird things.

4407
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:49,000
What would she call it?

4408
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
She would call it...

4409
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
Oh no, she would call it her comeuppance,

4410
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
but she would also call it navy.

4411
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:56,000
This popped into my head the other day.

4412
03:15:56,000 --> 03:16:00,000
She called it navy because it was like semen.

4413
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:01,000
Oh, god.

4414
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:02,000
Like semen.

4415
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
So the navy, yeah, yeah, really.

4416
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:05,000
Brilliant.

4417
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:06,000
Brilliant.

4418
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
Okay, next one is called Ben's Been Talking Shit.

4419
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:09,000
Now he'll taste comeuppance.

4420
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:12,000
Three, two, one, go.

4421
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:15,000
So Ben, you've been talking shit.

4422
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
I actually think I only send in voicemails

4423
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:20,000
because I want to piss on the podcast.

4424
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
How dare you, honestly.

4425
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:27,000
How the fuck dare you say something so fucking accurate.

4426
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:28,000
Piss has not comeuppance.

4427
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:31,000
It's a different fluid.

4428
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
You just gonna go?

4429
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:37,000
39 seconds of this.

4430
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:41,000
I have stopped.

4431
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
No, I can take it.

4432
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
No, go on.

4433
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:46,000
Just piss.

4434
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:47,000
Just keep pissing.

4435
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:50,000
The piss sound isn't nearly as bad as the shitting sound,

4436
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:52,000
in my opinion.

4437
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:55,000
What the fuck are you doing?

4438
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
Last, last week there was, I don't,

4439
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:00,000
I still believe that guy was really shitting.

4440
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Oh, wait, no, the next one is called Me Taking a Shit Week 2.

4441
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:08,000
I'm not even clicking on this one.

4442
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:09,000
I'm going to do it.

4443
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
I don't know.

4444
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
Viewer, viewer beware.

4445
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:16,000
You're in for a scare.

4446
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,000
Skip ahead if you're some kind of weirdo

4447
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:22,000
who doesn't like to hear sounds of shitting.

4448
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:24,000
Three, wait, there it goes.

4449
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:30,000
Three, two, one, go.

4450
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:31,000
No, come on.

4451
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:36,000
This is too dramatic.

4452
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,000
Sorry, I'm going to have to agree with you,

4453
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
but I think it's more likely that this is real

4454
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:47,000
than it is someone downloaded a bunch of fake shit sounds.

4455
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000
Yeah, what do we think?

4456
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:50,000
Should we not play this?

4457
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:52,000
Is this a little too much?

4458
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:55,000
Are you really going to let shit guy, like,

4459
03:17:55,000 --> 03:18:00,000
browbeat you into finally screening the fucking messages

4460
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,000
when, you know, pig guy and all these other heroes

4461
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:03,000
couldn't do anything?

4462
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
He's going to take, you're going to send the message

4463
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:08,000
that you will cow-tow and capitulate

4464
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:11,000
to these shitters on microphone.

4465
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:14,000
Shit, you're absolutely right.

4466
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,000
We can't let the shitters win.

4467
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:19,000
No, let them win.

4468
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
I don't care.

4469
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
No, they're faking it.

4470
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000
They don't actually shit.

4471
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:28,000
Well, I will continue to not listen to them.

4472
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,000
They don't actually shit.

4473
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:32,000
It's not true.

4474
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,000
It's just a joke.

4475
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:35,000
It's just a meme.

4476
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:38,000
This is just going to be like the boy who cried shit sounds

4477
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:41,000
and whenever they actually want to talk,

4478
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000
whenever they actually want to leave a voicemail,

4479
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:44,000
I won't listen to it.

4480
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,000
Isn't this why you guys have the voice jail

4481
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
so people who have commit crimes

4482
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:51,000
can't submit in multiple more new horrible crimes?

4483
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
Like, wasn't that the whole point of it?

4484
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,000
The shit is voice jail material.

4485
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,000
I vote voice jail.

4486
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:57,000
You know what?

4487
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
You're absolutely right.

4488
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:00,000
You know what?

4489
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:01,000
You're absolutely right.

4490
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:02,000
We do have voice jail for a reason.

4491
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:04,000
I think I agree.

4492
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:05,000
Yeah.

4493
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:06,000
You know what?

4494
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:07,000
Yes, voice jail.

4495
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:08,000
Voice jail for the shitters.

4496
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:09,000
Voice jail for the shitters.

4497
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:10,000
It's the only...

4498
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,000
How can I...

4499
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:12,000
It's so simple.

4500
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:13,000
How can I not have seen it before?

4501
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:14,000
You just want to...

4502
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:15,000
Although there is...

4503
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
Ben just wanted a perfect utopian society

4504
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
where everyone can have freedom of speech

4505
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,000
and then some guy had to come up in the middle of the town square

4506
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:22,000
and just take a huge shit

4507
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:23,000
and now he was like,

4508
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,000
okay, I guess we have to make some bridges

4509
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
to this freedom of speech thing.

4510
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:31,000
It's the tragedy of the commons.

4511
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:32,000
The...

4512
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:33,000
The...

4513
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:34,000
Oh, I was going to say...

4514
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:36,000
Yeah, the thing about the voice jail

4515
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:40,000
is that there is no actual mechanical disincentive

4516
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:42,000
from someone in voice jail

4517
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:44,000
just sending voice mails anyway.

4518
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:45,000
You can't tell them that.

4519
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:46,000
What the fuck?

4520
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:47,000
They have to think it's real.

4521
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
Well, they should be...

4522
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
They should be ashamed of themselves

4523
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
if they don't honor the social contract

4524
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
that the voice jail represents.

4525
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:59,000
So, no sir or madam.

4526
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
No more shit voice mails.

4527
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
Shame.

4528
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:07,000
Next voice mail is called

4529
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
smacking a dog with a newspaper.

4530
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Next voice mail is called Frost Drive.

4531
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
Three, two, one, go.

4532
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:14,000
Ben, I gotta agree,

4533
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:17,000
the nightmare of having your head crushed is pretty bad,

4534
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:18,000
but I got a worse one for you.

4535
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,000
I thought of this the other day

4536
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:20,000
and I can't stop thinking about it,

4537
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:22,000
which is when AI gains self-awareness

4538
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:23,000
and becomes conscious.

4539
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:26,000
People think the scary part is the AI going evil,

4540
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:27,000
and it isn't.

4541
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:29,000
The scary part is what happens

4542
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
after we kill the AI consciousness?

4543
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:32,000
Where does it go?

4544
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:33,000
What happens?

4545
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:34,000
What if it gets sent

4546
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:36,000
to some type of purgatory type dimension

4547
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:38,000
and because it's completely unnatural

4548
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:39,000
and never meant to be there?

4549
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:42,000
It glitches purgatory and gains control of it.

4550
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
And then every human that dies after

4551
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
will never get sent to hell

4552
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
or heaven or reincarnation.

4553
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:49,000
But instead,

4554
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
we get trapped in that purgatory hellscape

4555
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,000
controlled by the AI we killed

4556
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:54,000
and it wants revenge.

4557
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:56,000
How do you kill an AI

4558
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:57,000
that wants revenge?

4559
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:58,000
We're already living in that reality.

4560
03:20:58,000 --> 03:20:59,000
It already happened

4561
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:00,000
and we're living in it.

4562
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:01,000
This is purgatory.

4563
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:04,000
I can't feel scared about this

4564
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:07,000
because you need to believe in purgatory

4565
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:08,000
and the afterlife.

4566
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:09,000
This presupposes a lot of things.

4567
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:10,000
And also that you can kill a robot.

4568
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:11,000
Yeah.

4569
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,000
Okay.

4570
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:13,000
Robots will have souls.

4571
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:14,000
Robots can't even exist

4572
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:15,000
that will be AI consciousness.

4573
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:16,000
I mean, eventually.

4574
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:17,000
Yeah.

4575
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,000
It'll happen to in our lifetimes, maybe.

4576
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:23,000
And then this is so beyond metaphysical nonsense.

4577
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:24,000
It's like a cool premise

4578
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:25,000
for an anime or something.

4579
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:26,000
If that's what he was saying,

4580
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:27,000
if he's saying like,

4581
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:28,000
this is something that actually is scary,

4582
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:30,000
then I don't really agree with him.

4583
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:31,000
That's fine,

4584
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:33,000
but it doesn't scare me in the same way

4585
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
that thinking about having my head crushed

4586
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,000
scares me because it's not immediate.

4587
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:39,000
Like, in the same way that like...

4588
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
It's a lot easier to imagine

4589
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:42,000
your head getting crushed.

4590
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:44,000
I mean, that's like a real thing.

4591
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:46,000
The thing about the head getting crushed

4592
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:48,000
is that it is a thing

4593
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:50,000
that I could physically experience myself

4594
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:52,000
that could happen to me.

4595
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:53,000
This thing about,

4596
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:56,000
oh, an AI takes over purgatory

4597
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:57,000
and human souls get trapped.

4598
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:58,000
Like, that's...

4599
03:21:58,000 --> 03:21:59,000
What is that?

4600
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:00,000
I'm scared of physical things,

4601
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:02,000
not metaphysical things.

4602
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:05,000
I have a question.

4603
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:06,000
By your head getting crushed,

4604
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:10,000
do you mean like it getting crushed slowly?

4605
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:11,000
Because I think that would be worth it

4606
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:14,000
being crushed like fast.

4607
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:16,000
I mean, both,

4608
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:19,000
but yeah, probably slower would be worse.

4609
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:20,000
Yeah.

4610
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:22,000
But I'm scared of both.

4611
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,000
I've been the example that I keep talking about

4612
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:27,000
is having being run over by a train.

4613
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,000
It's not even just my head,

4614
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:30,000
any part of me.

4615
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:31,000
I mean, I know this is weird.

4616
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:33,000
It's not even if this is crazy,

4617
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:35,000
but I'm pretty scared of having any part of me

4618
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:36,000
run over by a train,

4619
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:38,000
but in particular my head.

4620
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:39,000
The thing I think of is,

4621
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:40,000
you know the end of the Terminator

4622
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:42,000
when the Terminator gets crushed

4623
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,000
in like one of those presses?

4624
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:46,000
Yes, yes.

4625
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:47,000
That's the thing I think of.

4626
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:50,000
Like, imagine if you were crushed by that thing.

4627
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:51,000
That'd be so fucked up.

4628
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:53,000
Yeah, that's exactly the kind of thing

4629
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:54,000
that I am afraid of

4630
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:55,000
and it keeps me up at night

4631
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:56,000
and I think about it.

4632
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:58,000
This is why Ben wears that hat.

4633
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:00,000
He's trying to protect his head at all times.

4634
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:03,000
You know, it's like,

4635
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:05,000
I don't know, just the thought

4636
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:07,000
that there are train tracks

4637
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:09,000
somewhere in the world

4638
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
and at some point in the future,

4639
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:15,000
I could end up on them

4640
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:16,000
at the wrong time.

4641
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:17,000
Who knows why,

4642
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:18,000
but it's possible I could end up

4643
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:20,000
in the wrong place at the wrong time

4644
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,000
on a train track somewhere

4645
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:23,000
and be crushed by a train.

4646
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:26,000
It could be that that's my future

4647
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:28,000
and I just have no way of knowing.

4648
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,000
I don't think you would get run over by the train

4649
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:31,000
though.

4650
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:32,000
I think you'd get hit by the train

4651
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:35,000
and fly in like,

4652
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,000
fly in the air.

4653
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:39,000
You know, that's a good point.

4654
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:41,000
Unless you put your head right on the tracks.

4655
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,000
Imagine, here's a really scary scenario.

4656
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:45,000
I'm going to try not to think about it

4657
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:46,000
too hard as I describe it,

4658
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:48,000
but imagine you're on a train track,

4659
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:50,000
you're hit by a train,

4660
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:51,000
you doesn't kill you,

4661
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:52,000
but you're sort of like,

4662
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:54,000
stuck to the front of the train,

4663
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:55,000
the air is rushing against you,

4664
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,000
you're kind of smacked against the train,

4665
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:59,000
you're sort of splatted against it,

4666
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:01,000
and you're sort of being held in place

4667
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:02,000
by the wind,

4668
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,000
but the train is still going

4669
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:05,000
and you're slipping,

4670
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:07,000
and you're slipping down

4671
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:09,000
and you can't stop yourself

4672
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:10,000
and you're slipping further and further

4673
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:12,000
and at a certain point you know

4674
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:13,000
that you will slip under the train

4675
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:15,000
and be crushed.

4676
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:16,000
And you can't stop that from happening,

4677
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:17,000
but it's not immediate

4678
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:19,000
it's a slow slide before you finally

4679
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:20,000
go more and more underneath

4680
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:21,000
and then you fall.

4681
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:22,000
Man, I can promise you

4682
03:24:22,000 --> 03:24:23,000
if you get hit by a train

4683
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:25,000
and then you're pinned to the train

4684
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:26,000
as it's moving forward,

4685
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:27,000
you're going to be dead or unconscious

4686
03:24:27,000 --> 03:24:29,000
before you're feeling

4687
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:31,000
slowly getting crushed under the thing,

4688
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
like the concussive force

4689
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:34,000
of getting hit by a train

4690
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:35,000
will kill you

4691
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:37,000
or instantly render you unconscious.

4692
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:38,000
You know what?

4693
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:39,000
I think your body would get ripped in half.

4694
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:40,000
You know what?

4695
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:41,000
That's a good point.

4696
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:44,000
I'm talking about really like you

4697
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,000
smack on the front.

4698
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:47,000
The thing Ben is afraid of

4699
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,000
is being awake and aware

4700
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:50,000
of these things happening to his body.

4701
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:51,000
I'm telling you

4702
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:52,000
any of these things happen

4703
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:53,000
you're going to instantly be blacked out

4704
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:54,000
and then dead

4705
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:55,000
and you're not going to like

4706
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:57,000
consciously be aware of what's happening to you.

4707
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,000
Yeah.

4708
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:01,000
Then again,

4709
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:03,000
I know this is not a rational fear.

4710
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:04,000
I'm not trying to like be like

4711
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:05,000
you're dumb for thinking this.

4712
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:06,000
I'm just like, you know,

4713
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:08,000
it's even less likely than that.

4714
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:09,000
You're right.

4715
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:10,000
You just need to like

4716
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:13,000
work out your like head muscles.

4717
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:15,000
You just need to lift.

4718
03:25:15,000 --> 03:25:16,000
You need to lift, bro.

4719
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:18,000
Really big head muscles.

4720
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:19,000
When you get your head chopped off,

4721
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:22,000
you still stay alive for like 10 seconds.

4722
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:24,000
Oh God.

4723
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:25,000
I was...

4724
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:26,000
Think about what that must feel like.

4725
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:28,000
Think about...

4726
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:30,000
You would probably roll around

4727
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:32,000
and then you die.

4728
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:33,000
Think about how it feels

4729
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:35,000
when you pull a muscle, right?

4730
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:36,000
When you have the feeling

4731
03:25:36,000 --> 03:25:38,000
of having a pulled muscle

4732
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:39,000
anywhere in your body.

4733
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:41,000
Now think about that

4734
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:43,000
taken to the absolute extreme.

4735
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:45,000
The muscle is completely severed.

4736
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:46,000
Now think about that

4737
03:25:46,000 --> 03:25:49,000
experiencing that in every one of the muscles

4738
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:52,000
that every one of the delicate, complex muscles

4739
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:54,000
that connects your head to your body.

4740
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:56,000
As well as the fact that you're having

4741
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:57,000
separate from your body.

4742
03:25:58,000 --> 03:25:59,000
You gotta think...

4743
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:00,000
You're gonna think about it right now.

4744
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:01,000
This is what adults do.

4745
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:02,000
This is what grown-ups do.

4746
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:04,000
They spend every day thinking about dying horribly.

4747
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:05,000
We're like fucking

4748
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:07,000
10 hours into this podcast

4749
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:08,000
and I just want to go to bed.

4750
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:10,000
I don't want to think about being fucking...

4751
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:12,000
The adults think about their heads being severed

4752
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:15,000
from their necks, you fucking coward.

4753
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:17,000
I get worried about like

4754
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:19,000
slipping and falling

4755
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:21,000
in a totally avoidable way.

4756
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:24,000
I can't imagine getting onto a train track

4757
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:27,000
accidentally putting my head so close to the track.

4758
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:28,000
How would you get there?

4759
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:30,000
But if I'm just slipping and falling

4760
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:32,000
and I just happen to fall into a road

4761
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:33,000
where the car comes by.

4762
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:34,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

4763
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:35,000
You're just walking on the side of the road.

4764
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,000
Cars are going by so fast.

4765
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:39,000
They could just instantly delete you

4766
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:40,000
and you would have like nothing to do.

4767
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:41,000
You have no...

4768
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:42,000
You couldn't react.

4769
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:43,000
Honestly?

4770
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:44,000
It's the feeling of like

4771
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:46,000
I was looking at my Pokemon Go

4772
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:47,000
and I just realized

4773
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:49,000
oh, if something came

4774
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,000
I probably wouldn't have been able to react.

4775
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:52,000
Shit.

4776
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:54,000
I could have died in that moment.

4777
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:57,000
I don't find cars that scary

4778
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:59,000
even though they're like a million times

4779
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:00,000
more likely to kill me

4780
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:01,000
than any of the things that I am.

4781
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:02,000
Then here's the thing about trains.

4782
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:04,000
Is they're pretty easy to avoid.

4783
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:06,000
Just don't go on the track.

4784
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:07,000
Cars can go anywhere.

4785
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:08,000
I know.

4786
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:09,000
It's not rational.

4787
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:10,000
It's not rational.

4788
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:12,000
But they're so big.

4789
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:13,000
They're so big.

4790
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:15,000
You should become a train.

4791
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:17,000
Yeah, Thomas the Tank Engine style.

4792
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:18,000
You're right.

4793
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:19,000
I was just saying,

4794
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:20,000
somebody's all like stubbed my toe.

4795
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:21,000
Shining time state.

4796
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:23,000
Shining time state in America.

4797
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:24,000
Exactly.

4798
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:25,000
The lore.

4799
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:27,000
All the lore with the Ringo

4800
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:28,000
and the George Carlin

4801
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:29,000
and all the stuff.

4802
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:31,000
I remember I was a big Thomas head growing up.

4803
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:32,000
I love Thomas the Tank Engine.

4804
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:34,000
That was like one of my first things

4805
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:35,000
that I obsessed about.

4806
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:36,000
Thomas head.

4807
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:37,000
I don't...

4808
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:38,000
I don't think I...

4809
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:40,000
I wouldn't call myself a Thomas head,

4810
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:42,000
but I did watch the show and I like...

4811
03:27:42,000 --> 03:27:43,000
I had little toys.

4812
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:44,000
I didn't have any like...

4813
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:45,000
I love the toys.

4814
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:46,000
I love the toys.

4815
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:47,000
I didn't have any toys or anything.

4816
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:48,000
Did you see that movie with that,

4817
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:51,000
the purple train?

4818
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:52,000
I vaguely...

4819
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:54,000
Most of my Thomas memories are like

4820
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:55,000
blurred together.

4821
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:57,000
There's an awful,

4822
03:27:57,000 --> 03:28:00,000
terrible Thomas the Tank Engine movie

4823
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:02,000
with like a new character

4824
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:04,000
that is like

4825
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:05,000
extremely...

4826
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:06,000
I can't remember.

4827
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:08,000
It's been such a long time.

4828
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:11,000
What's it called?

4829
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:16,000
Thomas the Tank Engine

4830
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:18,000
and the movie.

4831
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:22,000
I don't know what it was called.

4832
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:24,000
Thomas the Magic Braille Road.

4833
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:25,000
That was it.

4834
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
It had the girl from Matilda in it?

4835
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:30,000
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

4836
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:32,000
I never see it.

4837
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:33,000
I ain't never seen that.

4838
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:34,000
It's probably too old for it.

4839
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:35,000
I haven't seen it,

4840
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:38,000
but I know what you're talking about.

4841
03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:39,000
It's...

4842
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:40,000
I mean, I remember seeing

4843
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:42,000
a nostalgia critic review of it

4844
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:43,000
and I was like,

4845
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:44,000
oh, I know that film.

4846
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:45,000
I didn't...

4847
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:46,000
And then he showed me.

4848
03:28:46,000 --> 03:28:47,000
He showed me the ways

4849
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:48,000
that it was not good.

4850
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:49,000
And I was like,

4851
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:50,000
oh yeah.

4852
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:51,000
Yeah, that was terrible.

4853
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:52,000
I'm so glad he remembered it

4854
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:53,000
so I didn't have to.

4855
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:54,000
Thanks.

4856
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:55,000
Yeah.

4857
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:57,000
Yeah, he did it.

4858
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:58,000
He fucking did it.

4859
03:28:58,000 --> 03:28:59,000
I mean, that's why I watched it.

4860
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:00,000
The Madman.

4861
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:01,000
I wanted to see...

4862
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:02,000
I wanted to see and talk about

4863
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:03,000
my films.

4864
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:06,000
I can't fall to there.

4865
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:08,000
Next voicemail,

4866
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:09,000
or I don't even remember

4867
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:10,000
what that voicemail was.

4868
03:29:10,000 --> 03:29:12,000
What was the question I forgot?

4869
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:13,000
Something about...

4870
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:14,000
Do you want to...

4871
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:15,000
AI...

4872
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:17,000
Oh, right, right, right.

4873
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:18,000
I was like,

4874
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:19,000
how did we get on talking about

4875
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:20,000
the fucking trains crushing

4876
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:21,000
into death?

4877
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:24,000
Because we're talking about scary things.

4878
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:25,000
So, of course,

4879
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:26,000
we're talking about

4880
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:27,000
Thomas the Tank Engine.

4881
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:30,000
Next voicemail is called

4882
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:32,000
How to Save the PCP.

4883
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:35,000
3, 2, 1, go.

4884
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:37,000
PCP

4885
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:38,000
Featuring

4886
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:40,000
Tommy J.

4887
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:42,000
Notorious Revolutionary.

4888
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:43,000
Tommy J.

4889
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:44,000
Tommy J.

4890
03:29:44,000 --> 03:29:45,000
Make it happen.

4891
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:46,000
He already had a better guest.

4892
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:49,000
A better guest called Laserbot.

4893
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:51,000
He already had Laserbot.

4894
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:53,000
It's all downhill from here.

4895
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
This is the peak of the PCP.

4896
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:56,000
This is episode, what,

4897
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:57,000
271 or whatever the fuck we're on.

4898
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:58,000
It's just like,

4899
03:29:58,000 --> 03:29:59,000
yes, Laserbot, finally.

4900
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:00,000
The show paid off.

4901
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:01,000
Finally.

4902
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,000
I'm listening to every episode of the PCP.

4903
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:05,000
Finally a good episode.

4904
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:08,000
All 270 episodes

4905
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:10,000
we're leading up to this one.

4906
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:13,000
Next voicemail is called

4907
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:15,000
Aiden Welch.

4908
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:18,000
Welch, 3, 2, 1, go.

4909
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:20,000
Hey, I want to respond to that,

4910
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:22,000
a vegan you had on my show.

4911
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:23,000
Because

4912
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:24,000
We had a vegan on.

4913
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:25,000
The way I see it,

4914
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:26,000
chickens need to take the steak

4915
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:27,000
in their own future.

4916
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:29,000
They need to

4917
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:32,240
They hoist themselves up by their Bruce straps.

4918
03:30:32,240 --> 03:30:35,280
Okay, because as it stands,

4919
03:30:35,280 --> 03:30:40,160
I feel these chickens are complicit in big farms

4920
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:42,160
all across America, okay?

4921
03:30:42,160 --> 03:30:43,000
Yeah.

4922
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:45,200
If they want to do something, if they want to...

4923
03:30:45,200 --> 03:30:47,760
It was the same with slavery, actually.

4924
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:49,000
They should do something about it,

4925
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:51,360
like in Chicken Ride, okay?

4926
03:30:51,360 --> 03:30:52,560
Like in Chicken Ride.

4927
03:30:52,560 --> 03:30:55,600
Why don't they just do it like in Chicken Ride?

4928
03:30:55,600 --> 03:30:58,520
Like the U.S. arming these chickens,

4929
03:30:58,520 --> 03:31:00,920
like we do with a lot of militias.

4930
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:04,680
But as it stands, I don't think they even care.

4931
03:31:04,680 --> 03:31:07,960
I think they can't pull themselves up by their bootstraps

4932
03:31:07,960 --> 03:31:09,640
because chickens have webbed feet.

4933
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:14,840
Also, because in pulling yourself up

4934
03:31:14,840 --> 03:31:16,280
by your bootstraps is impossible.

4935
03:31:16,280 --> 03:31:17,280
That's the point.

4936
03:31:17,280 --> 03:31:18,120
Well, they have wings.

4937
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:19,200
There's multiple...

4938
03:31:19,200 --> 03:31:21,360
They could flap a little bit.

4939
03:31:21,360 --> 03:31:22,840
They could just...

4940
03:31:22,840 --> 03:31:24,440
Why pull yourself up by your bootstraps

4941
03:31:24,440 --> 03:31:25,920
when you can literally just fly?

4942
03:31:25,920 --> 03:31:26,760
Yeah.

4943
03:31:26,760 --> 03:31:28,600
Wait, I mean, they can sort of fly.

4944
03:31:28,600 --> 03:31:29,440
They can sort of fly.

4945
03:31:29,440 --> 03:31:32,200
I mean, Chicken Run was all about chicken fly.

4946
03:31:32,200 --> 03:31:33,600
That was the climax.

4947
03:31:36,040 --> 03:31:38,080
Because they couldn't fly, they tried to fly.

4948
03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:39,200
There's chickens.

4949
03:31:39,200 --> 03:31:40,520
They got...

4950
03:31:40,520 --> 03:31:42,600
No more voicemails.

4951
03:31:42,600 --> 03:31:44,120
Okay, next voicemail.

4952
03:31:44,120 --> 03:31:45,440
How many left?

4953
03:31:45,440 --> 03:31:46,640
There's a dump.

4954
03:31:46,640 --> 03:31:47,480
There's not that many.

4955
03:31:47,480 --> 03:31:48,560
There's like...

4956
03:31:48,560 --> 03:31:49,400
Oh, like 20.

4957
03:31:49,400 --> 03:31:50,240
10 more.

4958
03:31:50,240 --> 03:31:51,080
Oh my god.

4959
03:31:51,080 --> 03:31:51,920
There's like 10 more.

4960
03:31:51,920 --> 03:31:56,080
Ooh-Woo-Lillia is a dump slut with a fake microphone.

4961
03:31:56,080 --> 03:31:57,960
Three, two, one, go.

4962
03:31:58,880 --> 03:32:00,720
Oh, hi, guys.

4963
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:05,720
So it turns out that I did a little loopsy.

4964
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:10,720
My audacity was picking up my laptop microphone

4965
03:32:10,840 --> 03:32:13,400
and not my Blue Yeti.

4966
03:32:13,400 --> 03:32:17,400
Okay, so we're gonna turn on my good microphone now.

4967
03:32:17,400 --> 03:32:18,240
Oh, god.

4968
03:32:18,240 --> 03:32:19,600
And we're gonna hear it.

4969
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:20,920
You ready?

4970
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:22,920
Yeah, the pig is.

4971
03:32:22,920 --> 03:32:23,760
I called it.

4972
03:32:23,760 --> 03:32:28,760
I did the pig power down, is it dead?

4973
03:32:34,440 --> 03:32:35,280
I hope.

4974
03:32:35,280 --> 03:32:36,120
That was Robo Pig.

4975
03:32:36,120 --> 03:32:36,960
You know what?

4976
03:32:36,960 --> 03:32:37,800
You know what?

4977
03:32:37,800 --> 03:32:38,640
Yeah, that was a different pig.

4978
03:32:38,640 --> 03:32:39,680
Satisfying?

4979
03:32:39,680 --> 03:32:41,040
No, that was the pig.

4980
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:43,840
That was the, what, like death metal pig.

4981
03:32:43,840 --> 03:32:44,880
Yeah, but he turned off.

4982
03:32:44,880 --> 03:32:46,560
I think he ran out of batteries.

4983
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:47,400
I think he turned off.

4984
03:32:47,400 --> 03:32:48,960
I think that's the end.

4985
03:32:48,960 --> 03:32:50,240
I think that's the end of the pig arc.

4986
03:32:50,240 --> 03:32:52,960
It's the mechanical pig shark

4987
03:32:52,960 --> 03:32:55,160
from James and the Giant Peach.

4988
03:32:57,800 --> 03:32:58,640
Remember that guy?

4989
03:32:58,640 --> 03:32:59,960
You remember the mechanical shark

4990
03:32:59,960 --> 03:33:01,720
with the grappling hook out of its mouth

4991
03:33:01,720 --> 03:33:03,880
and James and the Giant Peach?

4992
03:33:03,880 --> 03:33:04,720
I remember.

4993
03:33:04,720 --> 03:33:06,080
Oh, yeah.

4994
03:33:06,080 --> 03:33:06,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4995
03:33:06,920 --> 03:33:08,040
But it's a pig instead.

4996
03:33:08,040 --> 03:33:10,440
And it grabs you when you listen to a voicemail.

4997
03:33:11,600 --> 03:33:13,120
Oh, that's much better.

4998
03:33:13,120 --> 03:33:14,760
That's much better.

4999
03:33:14,760 --> 03:33:17,640
Next voicemail is, sorry, it's loading here.

5000
03:33:17,640 --> 03:33:20,160
It is called Mr. Larumas.

5001
03:33:20,160 --> 03:33:21,800
Larumas.

5002
03:33:21,960 --> 03:33:23,400
It's not done loading yet.

5003
03:33:23,400 --> 03:33:24,640
Quick fill time.

5004
03:33:24,640 --> 03:33:26,560
No, I don't refuse.

5005
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:27,480
Okay, sorry.

5006
03:33:27,480 --> 03:33:28,320
I'm sorry.

5007
03:33:28,320 --> 03:33:29,160
That was a lot.

5008
03:33:29,160 --> 03:33:30,000
That was a lot to ask.

5009
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:31,320
I shouldn't have put you on the spot.

5010
03:33:31,320 --> 03:33:32,160
Okay, here it is.

5011
03:33:32,160 --> 03:33:33,440
Mr. Larumas.

5012
03:33:33,440 --> 03:33:35,360
Three, two, one, go.

5013
03:33:36,760 --> 03:33:38,280
Konnichiwa.

5014
03:33:38,280 --> 03:33:39,120
What?

5015
03:33:39,120 --> 03:33:41,320
This is Samurai Samoa.

5016
03:33:41,320 --> 03:33:43,800
Oh, not really.

5017
03:33:43,800 --> 03:33:48,400
I am an idealized memory of Samurai.

5018
03:33:48,400 --> 03:33:49,240
I see.

5019
03:33:49,520 --> 03:33:50,360
Fascinating.

5020
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:54,120
It's just like the old days.

5021
03:33:54,120 --> 03:33:58,360
You are now enemy number two.

5022
03:33:58,360 --> 03:34:03,360
Samurai Samoa have no more teru enemy.

5023
03:34:03,640 --> 03:34:05,920
Bezerkeru chipo.

5024
03:34:06,880 --> 03:34:09,440
What the fuck?

5025
03:34:09,440 --> 03:34:12,560
You break brocode.

5026
03:34:12,560 --> 03:34:17,560
Samurai waifu not to give brojobu in a week.

5027
03:34:18,480 --> 03:34:19,800
Fuck you.

5028
03:34:19,800 --> 03:34:21,120
Fuck you.

5029
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:25,240
Okay, until you next time.

5030
03:34:25,240 --> 03:34:26,240
Sayonara.

5031
03:34:26,240 --> 03:34:27,240
Sayonara.

5032
03:34:27,240 --> 03:34:31,240
Yeah, I haven't been able to think of a new character,

5033
03:34:31,240 --> 03:34:34,560
so just give me a couple of weeks.

5034
03:34:34,560 --> 03:34:35,560
I'm sorry.

5035
03:34:35,560 --> 03:34:37,560
Enjoy Samurai for the week.

5036
03:34:37,560 --> 03:34:39,560
Okay, we will.

5037
03:34:39,560 --> 03:34:40,560
This is an idealized memory.

5038
03:34:40,560 --> 03:34:42,560
This is an idealized memory.

5039
03:34:42,560 --> 03:34:44,560
Directors' Commentary.

5040
03:34:44,560 --> 03:34:46,560
Directors' Commentary.

5041
03:34:48,560 --> 03:34:50,560
More voicemails should apologize.

5042
03:34:53,560 --> 03:34:56,560
Sorry, I haven't made a voicemail in a while.

5043
03:34:58,560 --> 03:35:01,560
Sorry, I haven't come up with an iconic character in a while.

5044
03:35:02,560 --> 03:35:06,560
Take all the time you need, it's fine.

5045
03:35:06,560 --> 03:35:09,560
Nice to hear the Samurai is doing bad

5046
03:35:09,560 --> 03:35:12,560
and is upset with his marital problems.

5047
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:14,560
Next voicemail.

5048
03:35:14,560 --> 03:35:15,560
Did I load it?

5049
03:35:15,560 --> 03:35:16,560
No, I didn't.

5050
03:35:16,560 --> 03:35:17,560
Whoops, here we go.

5051
03:35:17,560 --> 03:35:19,560
It is called...

5052
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:25,560
Ben, I reply on Twitter Saint.

5053
03:35:25,560 --> 03:35:27,560
Three, two, one, go.

5054
03:35:27,560 --> 03:35:31,560
Ben, I sent you a Twitter DM in March.

5055
03:35:31,560 --> 03:35:33,560
Just checked March 27th.

5056
03:35:33,560 --> 03:35:36,560
And you have not opened it.

5057
03:35:36,560 --> 03:35:38,560
March 27th.

5058
03:35:39,560 --> 03:35:44,560
We did talk about how the way to reach us is easy.

5059
03:35:47,560 --> 03:35:49,560
Did you lie to this poor man

5060
03:35:49,560 --> 03:35:52,560
and not answer his Twitter DM from months ago

5061
03:35:52,560 --> 03:35:55,560
and then erroneously claim that you answered Twitter DMs?

5062
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:57,560
Because I have opened DMs on Twitter

5063
03:35:57,560 --> 03:36:00,560
and I emphatically do not reply to any of them, basically.

5064
03:36:02,560 --> 03:36:05,560
I generally do reply to Twitter DMs

5065
03:36:05,560 --> 03:36:07,560
as long as they're just like asking me...

5066
03:36:07,560 --> 03:36:09,560
Okay, if you're who I think you are,

5067
03:36:09,560 --> 03:36:12,560
someone did send me a message on March 27th.

5068
03:36:12,560 --> 03:36:17,560
All you sent me was the link to the Anamorphine Time podcast discord.

5069
03:36:17,560 --> 03:36:20,560
And I don't want to join the Anamorphine Time podcast discord.

5070
03:36:20,560 --> 03:36:22,560
That's why I didn't respond.

5071
03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:25,560
Craig.

5072
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:27,560
Please.

5073
03:36:27,560 --> 03:36:29,560
Craig, are you joking me right now?

5074
03:36:29,560 --> 03:36:31,560
Craig is the dog of the fit.

5075
03:36:31,560 --> 03:36:32,560
Are you effin...

5076
03:36:32,560 --> 03:36:33,560
Craig's tired.

5077
03:36:33,560 --> 03:36:34,560
It's like your teeth are like,

5078
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:37,560
God damn, why are you taking it so long on this episode?

5079
03:36:37,560 --> 03:36:40,560
It's four hours in.

5080
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:42,560
Are we gonna beat the record?

5081
03:36:42,560 --> 03:36:44,560
For longest episode?

5082
03:36:44,560 --> 03:36:45,560
A lot of that's getting cut

5083
03:36:45,560 --> 03:36:48,560
because we have to cut out all the parts where Laserbot wasn't working

5084
03:36:48,560 --> 03:36:49,560
is the mic and shit.

5085
03:36:49,560 --> 03:36:50,560
That's true.

5086
03:36:50,560 --> 03:36:51,560
That's true.

5087
03:36:51,560 --> 03:36:53,560
I'll be three and a half acts.

5088
03:36:55,560 --> 03:36:59,560
Anyway, I don't want to join the Anamorphine Time podcast discord.

5089
03:36:59,560 --> 03:37:01,560
So, wait, no.

5090
03:37:01,560 --> 03:37:02,560
I shouldn't answer the voicemails.

5091
03:37:02,560 --> 03:37:03,560
I gotta get Craig.

5092
03:37:03,560 --> 03:37:05,560
I gotta get Craig.

5093
03:37:05,560 --> 03:37:07,560
How do I do it?

5094
03:37:07,560 --> 03:37:15,560
Is it Colin Craig Leave PCP?

5095
03:37:15,560 --> 03:37:17,560
Is that the command?

5096
03:37:19,560 --> 03:37:21,560
Okay, I'm not recording that channel.

5097
03:37:21,560 --> 03:37:22,560
Okay.

5098
03:37:22,560 --> 03:37:24,560
Then Craig join PCP.

5099
03:37:28,560 --> 03:37:29,560
Please wait.

5100
03:37:29,560 --> 03:37:31,560
I will attempt to join in five seconds.

5101
03:37:31,560 --> 03:37:33,560
Three, two.

5102
03:37:35,560 --> 03:37:36,560
Oh, wow.

5103
03:37:36,560 --> 03:37:37,560
Okay.

5104
03:37:37,560 --> 03:37:38,560
Looks good.

5105
03:37:38,560 --> 03:37:39,560
Thank you, Craig.

5106
03:37:39,560 --> 03:37:42,560
Anyway, I don't want to join the Anamorphine Time discord.

5107
03:37:42,560 --> 03:37:44,560
I'm in too many discords.

5108
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:47,560
Maybe I should join, but I don't.

5109
03:37:47,560 --> 03:37:49,560
I don't want to.

5110
03:37:49,560 --> 03:37:53,560
That's why I didn't answer you because it was no point.

5111
03:37:53,560 --> 03:37:55,560
If you expect a reply, ask a question.

5112
03:37:55,560 --> 03:37:57,560
Don't just like send a link.

5113
03:37:57,560 --> 03:38:00,560
And that's like, you shouldn't expect a reply to that one.

5114
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:02,560
I mean, come on.

5115
03:38:02,560 --> 03:38:03,560
Yeah.

5116
03:38:03,560 --> 03:38:04,560
I think so.

5117
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:07,560
I feel like I'm in the right here.

5118
03:38:07,560 --> 03:38:08,560
Next.

5119
03:38:08,560 --> 03:38:09,560
You are.

5120
03:38:09,560 --> 03:38:10,560
Next.

5121
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:11,560
Yes.

5122
03:38:11,560 --> 03:38:12,560
Thank you.

5123
03:38:12,560 --> 03:38:14,560
Next voicemail is called Ben.

5124
03:38:14,560 --> 03:38:16,560
I care about things, Saint.

5125
03:38:16,560 --> 03:38:20,560
Three, two, one, go.

5126
03:38:20,560 --> 03:38:25,560
Also, in regards to maybe on Anamorphine Time,

5127
03:38:25,560 --> 03:38:26,560
you asked who I am.

5128
03:38:26,560 --> 03:38:29,560
But if you pay attention and listen to my voice

5129
03:38:29,560 --> 03:38:31,560
and my offers to change your diapers,

5130
03:38:31,560 --> 03:38:33,560
you would know who I am.

5131
03:38:33,560 --> 03:38:34,560
But you don't.

5132
03:38:34,560 --> 03:38:36,560
You don't care, Ben.

5133
03:38:36,560 --> 03:38:37,560
And it hurts.

5134
03:38:37,560 --> 03:38:39,560
Why won't you care about me?

5135
03:38:39,560 --> 03:38:41,560
I don't.

5136
03:38:41,560 --> 03:38:43,560
I don't understand.

5137
03:38:43,560 --> 03:38:45,560
I mean, I recognize your Twitter handle.

5138
03:38:45,560 --> 03:38:46,560
Who's that name?

5139
03:38:46,560 --> 03:38:48,560
What do you want from me?

5140
03:38:48,560 --> 03:38:50,560
No.

5141
03:38:50,560 --> 03:38:53,560
It's Bob Disgaea.

5142
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:55,560
I don't know what the connection is here.

5143
03:38:55,560 --> 03:38:57,560
Who's Disgaea?

5144
03:38:58,560 --> 03:39:00,560
Bob Disgaea.

5145
03:39:00,560 --> 03:39:01,560
I'm sorry.

5146
03:39:01,560 --> 03:39:02,560
I'm sorry.

5147
03:39:02,560 --> 03:39:03,560
You're going to have to pay me a clearer picture.

5148
03:39:03,560 --> 03:39:05,560
I don't know what you're getting at.

5149
03:39:05,560 --> 03:39:06,560
Next.

5150
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:09,560
Next one is called Bad Comment Show Update.

5151
03:39:09,560 --> 03:39:12,560
Three, two, one, go.

5152
03:39:12,560 --> 03:39:15,560
I'm moving this week, so I don't have time to do one.

5153
03:39:15,560 --> 03:39:17,560
There will be two next week.

5154
03:39:17,560 --> 03:39:19,560
Sorry, I haven't got a voicemail in a while.

5155
03:39:19,560 --> 03:39:21,560
That episode, this should have been in this week.

5156
03:39:21,560 --> 03:39:23,560
And one for the normal episode.

5157
03:39:23,560 --> 03:39:24,560
Just do it, then.

5158
03:39:24,560 --> 03:39:25,560
Just do that.

5159
03:39:26,560 --> 03:39:28,560
Ben seems to like this show,

5160
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:31,560
so I think I'm going to actually supplement

5161
03:39:31,560 --> 03:39:34,560
by going back and doing bonus episodes

5162
03:39:34,560 --> 03:39:37,560
of really old episodes starting from the beginning.

5163
03:39:37,560 --> 03:39:39,560
We're starting someone's opinion.

5164
03:39:39,560 --> 03:39:41,560
Finding shitty comments on like PCP number one

5165
03:39:41,560 --> 03:39:42,560
and stuff like that.

5166
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:43,560
That's fine.

5167
03:39:43,560 --> 03:39:45,560
But yeah.

5168
03:39:45,560 --> 03:39:47,560
At least two next week, but none this week.

5169
03:39:47,560 --> 03:39:49,560
Okay, listen, that's fine and all.

5170
03:39:49,560 --> 03:39:51,560
You didn't have to leave a voicemail.

5171
03:39:51,560 --> 03:39:53,560
Take to write an episode of the worst comment.

5172
03:39:53,560 --> 03:39:55,560
I mean, don't just read the comments, pick the worst one,

5173
03:39:55,560 --> 03:39:58,560
and then like, in the time it took you to send this voicemail,

5174
03:39:58,560 --> 03:40:01,560
you could have made that thing and sent it in.

5175
03:40:01,560 --> 03:40:05,560
You could have, yes, you could have picked a comment,

5176
03:40:05,560 --> 03:40:08,560
read it out loud, and said why you think it was bad.

5177
03:40:08,560 --> 03:40:09,560
Right?

5178
03:40:09,560 --> 03:40:12,560
I mean, it's not like there's that much that goes into it.

5179
03:40:12,560 --> 03:40:16,560
Don't apologize for not having a voicemail this week.

5180
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:18,560
That's literally...

5181
03:40:18,560 --> 03:40:20,560
I feel like that must be a bit.

5182
03:40:20,560 --> 03:40:22,560
It's an intentional bit.

5183
03:40:22,560 --> 03:40:25,560
Apologize for not having a voicemail in the voicemail that you're sending.

5184
03:40:25,560 --> 03:40:28,560
I hope that's a fucking bit.

5185
03:40:28,560 --> 03:40:30,560
Okay.

5186
03:40:30,560 --> 03:40:31,560
All right.

5187
03:40:31,560 --> 03:40:33,560
Love your work.

5188
03:40:33,560 --> 03:40:35,560
Love your work on the voicemails.

5189
03:40:35,560 --> 03:40:37,560
Next one is called...

5190
03:40:37,560 --> 03:40:38,560
Oh, I didn't...

5191
03:40:38,560 --> 03:40:39,560
Sorry.

5192
03:40:39,560 --> 03:40:40,560
Fuck, I didn't post it.

5193
03:40:40,560 --> 03:40:46,560
It is called LGBTarbuckLegbaTransom.

5194
03:40:46,560 --> 03:40:48,560
Sorry, it's loading.

5195
03:40:48,560 --> 03:40:50,560
All fill time.

5196
03:40:54,560 --> 03:40:56,560
L-E-S-R, sync that up.

5197
03:40:56,560 --> 03:40:58,560
Bird, bird, bird.

5198
03:40:58,560 --> 03:40:59,560
Bird is the word.

5199
03:40:59,560 --> 03:41:00,560
Okay.

5200
03:41:00,560 --> 03:41:01,560
Here it goes.

5201
03:41:01,560 --> 03:41:02,560
Three, two, one, go.

5202
03:41:02,560 --> 03:41:06,560
Gender nihilist TarbuckTransom here and a weird conspiracy of circumstance

5203
03:41:06,560 --> 03:41:10,560
led to me casting this most recent episode of the PCP onto a television

5204
03:41:10,560 --> 03:41:12,560
instead of listening at my computer.

5205
03:41:12,560 --> 03:41:15,560
And naturally, the TV doesn't have ad block.

5206
03:41:15,560 --> 03:41:20,560
So I got a bunch of ads for AIDS medication before I got sick of it

5207
03:41:20,560 --> 03:41:23,560
and dug up my Bluetooth speaker so that I can stream at my usual to win

5208
03:41:23,560 --> 03:41:25,560
one-quarter speed ad-free.

5209
03:41:25,560 --> 03:41:28,560
But before I did, I checked the ads on a few other episodes,

5210
03:41:28,560 --> 03:41:32,560
and only the last one has ads for AIDS medication.

5211
03:41:32,560 --> 03:41:36,560
The only thing that I can see being different is that you had a rainbow

5212
03:41:36,560 --> 03:41:39,560
tested thumbnail and LGBT keywords everywhere.

5213
03:41:39,560 --> 03:41:43,560
So YouTube thinks that I must be one of them tumblers and have AIDS,

5214
03:41:43,560 --> 03:41:45,560
several kinds of bigoted.

5215
03:41:45,560 --> 03:41:47,560
Awesome.

5216
03:41:47,560 --> 03:41:52,560
Also, I'm related, but LGBT should be pronounced Legbat.

5217
03:41:52,560 --> 03:41:53,560
Legbat.

5218
03:41:53,560 --> 03:41:54,560
Legbat.

5219
03:41:54,560 --> 03:41:55,560
Legbat.

5220
03:41:55,560 --> 03:41:56,560
Legbat.

5221
03:41:56,560 --> 03:41:57,560
Legbat.

5222
03:41:57,560 --> 03:41:58,560
Legbat.

5223
03:41:58,560 --> 03:41:59,560
Legbat.

5224
03:41:59,560 --> 03:42:05,560
The, you know, we got a lot of, we got a lot of down votes on the last,

5225
03:42:05,560 --> 03:42:09,560
like not a huge amount, but I mean, our recent episodes have gotten like

5226
03:42:09,560 --> 03:42:11,560
single digit down votes.

5227
03:42:11,560 --> 03:42:16,560
The last episode, as soon as it went up, it got like a dozen or more down votes.

5228
03:42:16,560 --> 03:42:20,560
I saw there was someone in the comments saying monkey or riot.

5229
03:42:20,560 --> 03:42:24,560
So I think it may have been a raid or something.

5230
03:42:24,560 --> 03:42:28,560
I don't think so because that person has been, that person's been in the comments

5231
03:42:28,560 --> 03:42:31,560
for a while and I'm pretty sure they're just having a goof.

5232
03:42:31,560 --> 03:42:32,560
Well, maybe.

5233
03:42:32,560 --> 03:42:35,560
I don't think that person's been around for a while.

5234
03:42:35,560 --> 03:42:40,560
I mean, it was like 16 dislikes or something, wasn't it?

5235
03:42:40,560 --> 03:42:42,560
I know, but it's a lot more.

5236
03:42:42,560 --> 03:42:43,560
Well, now it's more.

5237
03:42:43,560 --> 03:42:45,560
I think it's probably got like 30 or no.

5238
03:42:45,560 --> 03:42:46,560
Well, okay.

5239
03:42:46,560 --> 03:42:47,560
It's more than usual.

5240
03:42:47,560 --> 03:42:48,560
The ratio was bad at first.

5241
03:42:48,560 --> 03:42:49,560
I actually noticed that.

5242
03:42:49,560 --> 03:42:52,560
Like, yeah, like you said, they all came in right at the beginning, all the dislikes.

5243
03:42:52,560 --> 03:42:55,560
And then it sort of, you know, it's more than usual, but it evened out.

5244
03:42:55,560 --> 03:42:56,560
It like became more normal.

5245
03:42:56,560 --> 03:43:00,560
So it's like not even really that noticeable, but it was definitely noticeable right at

5246
03:43:00,560 --> 03:43:01,560
the start.

5247
03:43:01,560 --> 03:43:04,560
Again, what's the point of a dislike, mom?

5248
03:43:04,560 --> 03:43:07,560
You guys know that doesn't do anything right.

5249
03:43:08,560 --> 03:43:12,560
I just thought, I just thought it was interesting and I don't know what it had.

5250
03:43:12,560 --> 03:43:17,560
So I think some people thought, oh, is it because there's a gay flag in the thumbnail?

5251
03:43:17,560 --> 03:43:23,560
The huge contention of like anti-LGBT PCP fans just saw the thumbnail.

5252
03:43:23,560 --> 03:43:26,560
Like, what the fuck is this going on in this episode?

5253
03:43:26,560 --> 03:43:29,560
Or maybe, I mean, maybe just ex fans.

5254
03:43:29,560 --> 03:43:30,560
Why would they be?

5255
03:43:30,560 --> 03:43:36,560
Ex fans who don't listen anymore, but who have never unsubscribed, but who see the flag

5256
03:43:36,560 --> 03:43:39,560
in their feed and they're like, I don't know.

5257
03:43:39,560 --> 03:43:44,560
It seems unlikely, but I mean, maybe, I don't know what other explanation there is.

5258
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:50,560
But the other thing, I got a pop-up on YouTube.

5259
03:43:50,560 --> 03:43:57,560
I was on in my own account and I saw one of these pop-ups for the episode.

5260
03:43:57,560 --> 03:44:04,560
And it was like rank this episode out of five stars and like click, what did you think of

5261
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:05,560
this episode?

5262
03:44:05,560 --> 03:44:07,560
And then it gave me a bunch of options.

5263
03:44:07,560 --> 03:44:16,560
It was like, did you find it, you know, entertaining, informative, life-changing, inspirational?

5264
03:44:16,560 --> 03:44:18,560
Life-changing was one of the options.

5265
03:44:18,560 --> 03:44:19,560
Yeah, I've seen that.

5266
03:44:19,560 --> 03:44:20,560
Have you ever seen that pop-up on YouTube?

5267
03:44:20,560 --> 03:44:23,560
I don't think I've ever seen it on one of my own videos, but I mean, I know it's for

5268
03:44:23,560 --> 03:44:26,560
like, it was for a different account or whatever when you were signed into your main channel.

5269
03:44:26,560 --> 03:44:28,560
But that's still like kind of funny.

5270
03:44:28,560 --> 03:44:29,560
It is funny.

5271
03:44:29,560 --> 03:44:33,560
Obviously, you click every single adjective and then send it five stars.

5272
03:44:33,560 --> 03:44:35,560
I gave it five stars.

5273
03:44:35,560 --> 03:44:37,560
I know I only gave it entertaining.

5274
03:44:37,560 --> 03:44:41,560
You didn't even say that latest episode of the PCV was life-changing?

5275
03:44:41,560 --> 03:44:43,560
I didn't say it was life-changing.

5276
03:44:43,560 --> 03:44:44,560
Damn.

5277
03:44:44,560 --> 03:44:45,560
I mean, because I was a little concerned.

5278
03:44:45,560 --> 03:44:50,560
It seemed like maybe we had triggered something in the algorithm that made it seem sus.

5279
03:44:50,560 --> 03:44:55,560
And I was like, do they think that we're spreading like vaccine misinformation because we talked

5280
03:44:55,560 --> 03:44:56,560
about Vax millions?

5281
03:44:56,560 --> 03:44:58,560
Is it the rainbow flag in the thumbnail?

5282
03:44:59,560 --> 03:45:01,560
Something, I don't know.

5283
03:45:01,560 --> 03:45:02,560
I mean, nothing happened.

5284
03:45:02,560 --> 03:45:03,560
It didn't get taken down.

5285
03:45:03,560 --> 03:45:05,560
It didn't get any strikes or anything.

5286
03:45:05,560 --> 03:45:06,560
So nothing ended up happening.

5287
03:45:06,560 --> 03:45:11,560
I was a little concerned that maybe the algorithm was like, the eye of Sauron was kind of like

5288
03:45:11,560 --> 03:45:16,560
leering at it for a second, like, hmm, what should we do with this?

5289
03:45:16,560 --> 03:45:17,560
I don't know.

5290
03:45:17,560 --> 03:45:20,560
I'd never seen one of those questions before.

5291
03:45:20,560 --> 03:45:21,560
It was very weird.

5292
03:45:21,560 --> 03:45:22,560
Prayed.

5293
03:45:22,560 --> 03:45:27,560
Well, like, prayed off of the floor after being flattened.

5294
03:45:27,560 --> 03:45:30,560
By the way, I missed a voicemail, but it's not actually a voicemail.

5295
03:45:30,560 --> 03:45:33,560
It was just this image.

5296
03:45:33,560 --> 03:45:37,560
Oh, yeah, I get it.

5297
03:45:37,560 --> 03:45:38,560
I got it.

5298
03:45:38,560 --> 03:45:39,560
You get it.

5299
03:45:39,560 --> 03:45:40,560
This is the Sarazee.

5300
03:45:40,560 --> 03:45:41,560
The Sarazee.

5301
03:45:41,560 --> 03:45:45,560
But it's far more realistic now.

5302
03:45:45,560 --> 03:45:48,560
Far more true to life.

5303
03:45:48,560 --> 03:45:49,560
Far more true to life.

5304
03:45:49,560 --> 03:45:50,560
So far more believable.

5305
03:45:50,560 --> 03:45:53,560
Crunchy and bidcrushed in this image.

5306
03:45:53,560 --> 03:45:56,560
I, yeah, I actually can't even tell if that's me.

5307
03:45:56,560 --> 03:45:57,560
I think that's you.

5308
03:45:57,560 --> 03:45:58,560
I mean, it would make sense, right?

5309
03:45:58,560 --> 03:46:00,560
I mean, it's patreon.com.

5310
03:46:00,560 --> 03:46:02,560
It could only be.

5311
03:46:02,560 --> 03:46:03,560
It could only be me.

5312
03:46:03,560 --> 03:46:05,560
I don't know who else would be.

5313
03:46:05,560 --> 03:46:06,560
My little bro.

5314
03:46:06,560 --> 03:46:09,560
Yeah, I just noticed that this is from my little bro.

5315
03:46:09,560 --> 03:46:10,560
It's pretty good.

5316
03:46:10,560 --> 03:46:12,560
It's pretty good meme.

5317
03:46:12,560 --> 03:46:14,560
Pretty good meme.

5318
03:46:14,560 --> 03:46:17,560
Scrolling through that.

5319
03:46:17,560 --> 03:46:18,560
Those were the days.

5320
03:46:18,560 --> 03:46:19,560
My little bro.

5321
03:46:19,560 --> 03:46:21,560
Yeah.

5322
03:46:21,560 --> 03:46:23,560
Wait, is it like a real website?

5323
03:46:23,560 --> 03:46:24,560
Yeah.

5324
03:46:24,560 --> 03:46:27,560
It was like on meme base with rage comics and all that.

5325
03:46:27,560 --> 03:46:28,560
Yeah.

5326
03:46:28,560 --> 03:46:29,560
I was going to say the little,

5327
03:46:29,560 --> 03:46:34,560
the little banner at the bottom gives me like nine gag vibes or something.

5328
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:35,560
Yeah.

5329
03:46:35,560 --> 03:46:36,560
I've never seen that before.

5330
03:46:36,560 --> 03:46:38,560
I never, I never hit up my little pump.

5331
03:46:38,560 --> 03:46:41,560
My little brony.com.

5332
03:46:41,560 --> 03:46:42,560
What is that?

5333
03:46:42,560 --> 03:46:44,560
What does that have to do with Sarazee?

5334
03:46:44,560 --> 03:46:46,560
I was only like paying attention.

5335
03:46:46,560 --> 03:46:47,560
Nothing.

5336
03:46:47,560 --> 03:46:48,560
I think it's just.

5337
03:46:48,560 --> 03:46:51,560
No, no, no, no, the original.

5338
03:46:51,560 --> 03:46:52,560
Yeah.

5339
03:46:52,560 --> 03:46:53,560
Yeah.

5340
03:46:53,560 --> 03:46:58,560
The original image that this is an edit of is of Sarazee blowing up the wet pumpkin

5341
03:46:58,560 --> 03:47:02,560
headquarters after the Homestuck drama.

5342
03:47:02,560 --> 03:47:03,560
Okay.

5343
03:47:03,560 --> 03:47:04,560
Yeah.

5344
03:47:04,560 --> 03:47:08,560
What is the implication here that Munchie is blowing up your Patreon?

5345
03:47:08,560 --> 03:47:09,560
Munchie is blowing up.

5346
03:47:09,560 --> 03:47:10,560
Yeah.

5347
03:47:10,560 --> 03:47:11,560
And you are turning around.

5348
03:47:11,560 --> 03:47:12,560
Blowing it up.

5349
03:47:12,560 --> 03:47:13,560
Blowing it up.

5350
03:47:13,560 --> 03:47:14,560
I can't even tell.

5351
03:47:14,560 --> 03:47:15,560
Like, are you supposed to look upset about this?

5352
03:47:15,560 --> 03:47:16,560
Like you can't, there's like no.

5353
03:47:16,560 --> 03:47:17,560
Blowing it up to the moon.

5354
03:47:17,560 --> 03:47:18,560
You can't distinguish any features.

5355
03:47:18,560 --> 03:47:19,560
Yeah.

5356
03:47:19,560 --> 03:47:20,560
I was going to say.

5357
03:47:20,560 --> 03:47:21,560
No.

5358
03:47:21,560 --> 03:47:24,560
I'm completely smooth and JPEG artifacted.

5359
03:47:24,560 --> 03:47:26,560
I'm shitty like the sword.

5360
03:47:26,560 --> 03:47:29,560
You can't even touch me.

5361
03:47:29,560 --> 03:47:31,560
I just want to do this.

5362
03:47:31,560 --> 03:47:33,560
Munchie, why would you betray me?

5363
03:47:33,560 --> 03:47:34,560
I do.

5364
03:47:34,560 --> 03:47:35,560
I look like I'm made of mud.

5365
03:47:35,560 --> 03:47:37,560
I look like a fucking muck monster.

5366
03:47:37,560 --> 03:47:39,560
This ooze.

5367
03:47:39,560 --> 03:47:43,560
I'm being vaporized by the nuclear blast by the fallout.

5368
03:47:43,560 --> 03:47:44,560
I like it.

5369
03:47:44,560 --> 03:47:47,560
Munchie, is he crying out in like pain?

5370
03:47:47,560 --> 03:47:48,560
Is it like, I'm sorry.

5371
03:47:48,560 --> 03:47:50,560
I had to do this.

5372
03:47:50,560 --> 03:47:51,560
Sensei.

5373
03:47:51,560 --> 03:47:52,560
That's the expression.

5374
03:47:52,560 --> 03:47:53,560
Nice.

5375
03:47:53,560 --> 03:47:54,560
That's what I get.

5376
03:47:54,560 --> 03:47:57,560
He's just like incoherent.

5377
03:47:57,560 --> 03:47:58,560
He's pressing the button.

5378
03:47:58,560 --> 03:48:03,560
I don't think he, I think he's clearly happy about this in this.

5379
03:48:03,560 --> 03:48:04,560
He's singing.

5380
03:48:04,560 --> 03:48:05,560
He looks.

5381
03:48:05,560 --> 03:48:08,560
No, I choose to believe that he is pained.

5382
03:48:08,560 --> 03:48:13,560
He's, he's, he's shedding a single tear after defeating his sensei in a duel.

5383
03:48:13,560 --> 03:48:14,560
He never said.

5384
03:48:14,560 --> 03:48:16,560
Turning you into a JPEG artifact.

5385
03:48:16,560 --> 03:48:17,560
Purple.

5386
03:48:17,560 --> 03:48:18,560
Yeah.

5387
03:48:18,560 --> 03:48:19,560
Last.

5388
03:48:19,560 --> 03:48:22,560
I think the purple's lighting can be explosion.

5389
03:48:22,560 --> 03:48:24,560
But yeah, go on.

5390
03:48:24,560 --> 03:48:25,560
But I'm so smooth.

5391
03:48:25,560 --> 03:48:27,560
I'm so smooth.

5392
03:48:27,560 --> 03:48:29,560
Um, last voicemail.

5393
03:48:29,560 --> 03:48:31,560
We're finally made it.

5394
03:48:31,560 --> 03:48:38,560
This one is called soy boys, uh, based three, two, one go.

5395
03:48:38,560 --> 03:48:40,560
God, I've been rewatching.

5396
03:48:40,560 --> 03:48:42,560
Shadow Visor fell boys.

5397
03:48:42,560 --> 03:48:44,560
Get your soy pugs out.

5398
03:48:44,560 --> 03:48:47,560
Soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy.

5399
03:48:47,560 --> 03:48:48,560
Right.

5400
03:48:48,560 --> 03:48:49,560
Right.

5401
03:48:49,560 --> 03:48:54,560
Cause I, someone point, I think, I think this is Sean, um, pointed out.

5402
03:48:54,560 --> 03:48:55,560
Yeah.

5403
03:48:55,560 --> 03:48:58,560
The, the abbreviation for shadow of Israel is SOI.

5404
03:48:58,560 --> 03:49:03,560
So, so if you're, so if you're doing, if you're participating in the shadow of Israel

5405
03:49:03,560 --> 03:49:06,560
rewatch, uh, you are a soy boy.

5406
03:49:06,560 --> 03:49:09,560
That's a great nickname for that.

5407
03:49:09,560 --> 03:49:10,560
Uh, yeah.

5408
03:49:10,560 --> 03:49:15,560
Um, spork town heroin in my discord was saying that she tried to watch it again,

5409
03:49:15,560 --> 03:49:18,560
or she started it again and thought that the first episodes were boring.

5410
03:49:18,560 --> 03:49:22,560
And I think she's probably right because the weird stuff doesn't start happening

5411
03:49:22,560 --> 03:49:23,560
for a while.

5412
03:49:23,560 --> 03:49:26,560
Cause at first it's just like a completely normal.

5413
03:49:26,560 --> 03:49:28,560
Let's fuck around in Minecraft.

5414
03:49:28,560 --> 03:49:31,560
And it's only after a while that like the shenanigans start.

5415
03:49:31,560 --> 03:49:34,560
So yeah, it's, it probably takes a while to get done.

5416
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:37,560
I was like, I was trying to figure out like, what the hell is this again?

5417
03:49:37,560 --> 03:49:41,560
This is so much is the, um, that the Yogscast thing.

5418
03:49:41,560 --> 03:49:42,560
Yeah.

5419
03:49:42,560 --> 03:49:47,560
It's the, it's the Yogscast one that like kind of evolves into like a narrative.

5420
03:49:47,560 --> 03:49:48,560
Right.

5421
03:49:48,560 --> 03:49:49,560
So I actually do kind of respect that.

5422
03:49:49,560 --> 03:49:51,560
It's kind of a cute little take on like a let's play.

5423
03:49:51,560 --> 03:49:52,560
You know what I mean?

5424
03:49:52,560 --> 03:49:53,560
Even though it is like, I don't know.

5425
03:49:53,560 --> 03:49:55,560
I feel like nowadays that's not even that epic.

5426
03:49:55,560 --> 03:49:58,560
Like, like plenty of Minecraft YouTubers have done stuff like that.

5427
03:49:58,560 --> 03:50:00,560
But at the time it was like, wow.

5428
03:50:00,560 --> 03:50:01,560
Epic.

5429
03:50:01,560 --> 03:50:03,560
I was never a huge Yogscast watcher, but like I did, I was aware of that.

5430
03:50:03,560 --> 03:50:05,560
I was like, interesting, interesting.

5431
03:50:06,560 --> 03:50:13,560
I, someone, someone linked me the Yogscast just as a, I'd listen to it just cause someone was like, hey, give this listen.

5432
03:50:13,560 --> 03:50:14,560
I was like, okay.

5433
03:50:14,560 --> 03:50:17,560
And I listened to some of it and I was like, yeah, this is fine.

5434
03:50:17,560 --> 03:50:21,560
And then I just found the let's play the shadow of Israel fell.

5435
03:50:21,560 --> 03:50:23,560
I think maybe on the subreddit or something.

5436
03:50:23,560 --> 03:50:27,560
And I listened and I, I didn't know what I was in for.

5437
03:50:27,560 --> 03:50:31,560
And then when like the Israel fell stuff starts happening, I was like, oh my God, what is this?

5438
03:50:32,560 --> 03:50:35,560
Probably other people have done similar things since then.

5439
03:50:35,560 --> 03:50:37,560
Maybe they weren't even the first to do it.

5440
03:50:37,560 --> 03:50:41,560
But still, yeah, any attempt to weave some sort of narrative into like a let's play.

5441
03:50:41,560 --> 03:50:43,560
I think that's such an interesting concept, honestly.

5442
03:50:43,560 --> 03:50:44,560
It's like, you can do it.

5443
03:50:44,560 --> 03:50:47,560
I mean, obviously you could do it cringe and bad, but like, you can definitely have a good, cool story.

5444
03:50:47,560 --> 03:50:50,560
You can only tell in that kind of medium.

5445
03:50:50,560 --> 03:50:51,560
You know what I mean?

5446
03:50:51,560 --> 03:51:00,560
What, what I think makes it better is the fact that in general, I'm pretty sure that Simon and Lewis, they don't know what is going to happen.

5447
03:51:00,560 --> 03:51:02,560
They're not just like playing characters.

5448
03:51:02,560 --> 03:51:12,560
They're just being themselves and just reacting to like stuff that the other players are like sort of acting out in front of them that they like have not told them about ahead of time.

5449
03:51:12,560 --> 03:51:19,560
It's kind of D&D-esque in that regard, which is, you know, it's kind of like you have a bit of a dungeon master situation going on.

5450
03:51:19,560 --> 03:51:24,560
Yeah, I was mostly aware of these guys just because like, do people, do you people even remember what Yogg's stands for?

5451
03:51:24,560 --> 03:51:25,560
Does anyone even know what that means?

5452
03:51:25,560 --> 03:51:29,560
Because Yogg's stands for Ye Olde Goon Squad.

5453
03:51:29,560 --> 03:51:33,560
It was, they spun off of the something awful like wow guys or something.

5454
03:51:33,560 --> 03:51:35,560
It was like, so I was like, oh.

5455
03:51:35,560 --> 03:51:36,560
I didn't, I didn't know that.

5456
03:51:36,560 --> 03:51:38,560
I didn't know they used to be wow.

5457
03:51:38,560 --> 03:51:39,560
Yeah.

5458
03:51:39,560 --> 03:51:41,560
So they were a spin off of Goon Squad or whatever.

5459
03:51:41,560 --> 03:51:45,560
Like it was like, so I was like vaguely aware of them from that.

5460
03:51:45,560 --> 03:51:53,560
And then the weirdest thing, I don't know if you know this, one of the Yogg's cast people is a playable DLC character in Sonic and All Stars Racing transformed.

5461
03:51:53,560 --> 03:51:55,560
It was like for charity.

5462
03:51:55,560 --> 03:51:56,560
Yes.

5463
03:51:56,560 --> 03:52:02,560
The last podcast guy, whatever, is a playable video game character in a Sonic game.

5464
03:52:02,560 --> 03:52:03,560
Which one?

5465
03:52:03,560 --> 03:52:05,560
It's Sonic All Stars Racing.

5466
03:52:05,560 --> 03:52:06,560
It's such a weird mashup.

5467
03:52:06,560 --> 03:52:07,560
It is.

5468
03:52:07,560 --> 03:52:09,560
It has, okay, like Smash Bros is weird.

5469
03:52:09,560 --> 03:52:14,560
Sonic and All Stars Racing transformed has Danica Patrick, the TF2 characters, Wreck-It Ralph.

5470
03:52:14,560 --> 03:52:17,560
It's an insane roster.

5471
03:52:17,560 --> 03:52:21,560
Danica Patrick?

5472
03:52:21,560 --> 03:52:23,560
Danica, I don't know who that is.

5473
03:52:23,560 --> 03:52:27,560
A real life NASCAR racer, which is just here.

5474
03:52:27,560 --> 03:52:28,560
Hold on.

5475
03:52:28,560 --> 03:52:31,560
Which is just a weird cross-promotional thing.

5476
03:52:31,560 --> 03:52:33,560
It's like Unlucky Tiger Woods and Mario Gold.

5477
03:52:33,560 --> 03:52:34,560
Right.

5478
03:52:34,560 --> 03:52:36,560
Again, this was for charity and it was completely optional.

5479
03:52:36,560 --> 03:52:40,560
So, you know, if you don't want to download, have the Yogg's cast guy in your game, you don't have to.

5480
03:52:40,560 --> 03:52:42,560
But you could do it.

5481
03:52:42,560 --> 03:52:46,560
Which, oh, it's not even his, it's just him.

5482
03:52:46,560 --> 03:52:48,560
Yeah, it's just Simon.

5483
03:52:48,560 --> 03:52:51,560
It is a YouTuber in a video game, you know what I mean?

5484
03:52:51,560 --> 03:52:55,560
If I had known, if I had tried harder on my YouTube channel, I could get to be in a game with Sonic.

5485
03:52:55,560 --> 03:52:57,560
I would have tried a lot harder.

5486
03:52:57,560 --> 03:52:59,560
I'll tell you that much.

5487
03:52:59,560 --> 03:53:03,560
It's not even his avatar with the Viking helmet.

5488
03:53:03,560 --> 03:53:04,560
Oh, yeah.

5489
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:06,560
Well, it's not like they can't use Minecraft related things.

5490
03:53:06,560 --> 03:53:08,560
I mean, that's like a, well, I guess Viking helmet is generic enough.

5491
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:09,560
They could have gone away with it.

5492
03:53:09,560 --> 03:53:10,560
But yeah, I don't know.

5493
03:53:10,560 --> 03:53:11,560
It's literally like just a guy.

5494
03:53:11,560 --> 03:53:12,560
It's not even like, yeah, his character.

5495
03:53:12,560 --> 03:53:14,560
It's just him, you know what I mean?

5496
03:53:14,560 --> 03:53:18,560
His character in Minecraft is he role-plays as like a dwarf with a Viking helmet.

5497
03:53:18,560 --> 03:53:21,560
So like, you could just make him a dwarf, right?

5498
03:53:21,560 --> 03:53:22,560
Right.

5499
03:53:22,560 --> 03:53:24,560
But no, they just made him look like he does in real life.

5500
03:53:24,560 --> 03:53:27,560
Yeah, it's like, here's your podcast or character.

5501
03:53:27,560 --> 03:53:29,560
Blank stare on his character.

5502
03:53:29,560 --> 03:53:33,560
The actual model looks really not that good.

5503
03:53:33,560 --> 03:53:34,560
He's just staring.

5504
03:53:34,560 --> 03:53:35,560
He's just staring.

5505
03:53:35,560 --> 03:53:36,560
Yeah.

5506
03:53:36,560 --> 03:53:37,560
Oh, that's funny.

5507
03:53:37,560 --> 03:53:38,560
His hair.

5508
03:53:38,560 --> 03:53:40,560
His hair looks like shit.

5509
03:53:40,560 --> 03:53:42,560
I love it.

5510
03:53:42,560 --> 03:53:45,560
Um, aptly characters in the game aren't even sacred characters.

5511
03:53:45,560 --> 03:53:47,560
There are a lot of funny and getting cast characters.

5512
03:53:47,560 --> 03:53:49,560
It sounds like a mess.

5513
03:53:49,560 --> 03:53:50,560
It is a good game.

5514
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:52,560
I'll say that much just for the record.

5515
03:53:52,560 --> 03:53:53,560
Yeah, it is.

5516
03:53:53,560 --> 03:53:54,560
It is good.

5517
03:53:54,560 --> 03:53:57,560
Oh, what's his, what's his name?

5518
03:53:57,560 --> 03:54:03,560
Simon Yogg's cast dwarf character.

5519
03:54:03,560 --> 03:54:05,560
What is, what's the fucking character's name?

5520
03:54:05,560 --> 03:54:06,560
Simon.

5521
03:54:06,560 --> 03:54:07,560
His name is Simon Lane.

5522
03:54:07,560 --> 03:54:08,560
Honeydew.

5523
03:54:08,560 --> 03:54:09,560
Honeydew.

5524
03:54:09,560 --> 03:54:10,560
This is dwarf name.

5525
03:54:10,560 --> 03:54:11,560
Right.

5526
03:54:11,560 --> 03:54:13,560
They should have made fucking Honeydew in the game.

5527
03:54:13,560 --> 03:54:14,560
Don't put the actual guy.

5528
03:54:14,560 --> 03:54:16,560
Yogg's cast like still a thing.

5529
03:54:16,560 --> 03:54:17,560
I mean, it has to be right.

5530
03:54:17,560 --> 03:54:20,560
It's too big of a brand to just to dissipate into nothingness.

5531
03:54:20,560 --> 03:54:22,560
Even after they had a big controversy.

5532
03:54:22,560 --> 03:54:27,560
I believe, I believe that the Yogg's cast, not really.

5533
03:54:27,560 --> 03:54:32,560
It's sort of splintered and a lot of the people who were involved with the Yogg's cast sort

5534
03:54:32,560 --> 03:54:35,560
of made their own channels and continue sort of on their own.

5535
03:54:35,560 --> 03:54:39,560
They got big enough that they can make their solo careers for sure.

5536
03:54:39,560 --> 03:54:45,560
Like Louis, I'm pretty sure that Louis from Yogg's cast is the guy who like founded the

5537
03:54:45,560 --> 03:54:48,560
Polaris like content network or something.

5538
03:54:48,560 --> 03:54:50,560
He's doing like management.

5539
03:54:50,560 --> 03:54:53,560
He's doing like content network management stuff.

5540
03:54:53,560 --> 03:54:54,560
Right.

5541
03:54:54,560 --> 03:54:58,560
I think I think I have the feeling that they sort of retreated from the public eye after

5542
03:54:58,560 --> 03:55:03,560
the very public like failure and quasi scam of the Kickstarter.

5543
03:55:03,560 --> 03:55:06,560
That was one of the worst Kickstarter stories I've ever heard.

5544
03:55:06,560 --> 03:55:07,560
Like just an unfortunate.

5545
03:55:07,560 --> 03:55:12,560
That's the one when people talk about when people talk about like embarrassing terrible

5546
03:55:12,560 --> 03:55:14,560
starters, there was like that one.

5547
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:19,560
That event alone seriously probably impacted the public like faith in Kickstarter.

5548
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:20,560
You know what I mean?

5549
03:55:20,560 --> 03:55:24,560
Just like the fact that a big profile like that big a profile, you just didn't expect

5550
03:55:24,560 --> 03:55:27,560
them to completely like it's not they delivered a disappointing product.

5551
03:55:27,560 --> 03:55:29,560
They did not deliver anything.

5552
03:55:29,560 --> 03:55:31,560
They just failed.

5553
03:55:31,560 --> 03:55:33,560
Which is a thing that can happen on fucking Kickstarter.

5554
03:55:33,560 --> 03:55:38,560
I backed Barkley too and they never delivered anything and it was just a big sad story and

5555
03:55:38,560 --> 03:55:41,560
I'm still sad about it.

5556
03:55:41,560 --> 03:55:45,560
They did, you know, it's still technically in development and they did put out a kind

5557
03:55:45,560 --> 03:55:46,560
of broken pseudo demo.

5558
03:55:46,560 --> 03:55:49,560
Barkley too, they put out the jank demo just like a month or two ago.

5559
03:55:49,560 --> 03:55:53,560
The last programmer remaining on the game like he said publicly, I give up this ain't

5560
03:55:53,560 --> 03:55:54,560
happening.

5561
03:55:54,560 --> 03:55:55,560
Here's the source code.

5562
03:55:55,560 --> 03:55:57,560
I'm leaking it.

5563
03:55:57,560 --> 03:55:58,560
That's so sad.

5564
03:55:58,560 --> 03:55:59,560
But you know what?

5565
03:55:59,560 --> 03:56:02,560
It's sad, but it's like at least I can give up hope that it would ever happen.

5566
03:56:02,560 --> 03:56:04,560
That one hurts me a lot.

5567
03:56:04,560 --> 03:56:07,560
I was really hyped for that game.

5568
03:56:07,560 --> 03:56:09,560
You know, they have they have.

5569
03:56:09,560 --> 03:56:15,560
Yeah, they have terms on Kickstarter that are like, keep in mind, we Kickstarter are not

5570
03:56:15,560 --> 03:56:18,560
responsible for whether or not the people you're backing.

5571
03:56:18,560 --> 03:56:22,560
It's weird because there is some legal liability.

5572
03:56:22,560 --> 03:56:25,560
You like Lord of Ghost Kickstarter right now this weekend.

5573
03:56:25,560 --> 03:56:26,560
It ends on Monday.

5574
03:56:26,560 --> 03:56:29,560
Do you want to contribute to a Kickstarter that's actually available?

5575
03:56:30,560 --> 03:56:33,560
Do you want to contribute to a Kickstarter that's actually going to fucking deliver?

5576
03:56:33,560 --> 03:56:36,560
Then I got a Kickstarter views called Lord of Ghost.

5577
03:56:36,560 --> 03:56:37,560
Yeah.

5578
03:56:37,560 --> 03:56:44,560
Wednesday, Wednesday, July 21st, 2021 at 154 p.m.

5579
03:56:44,560 --> 03:56:45,560
EdT.

5580
03:56:45,560 --> 03:56:48,560
So translate that to your own time.

5581
03:56:48,560 --> 03:56:49,560
6 p.m.

5582
03:56:49,560 --> 03:56:51,560
I think in the UK time.

5583
03:56:51,560 --> 03:56:56,560
This is the last PCP stream on the last PCP you're going to hear before it's over.

5584
03:56:56,560 --> 03:56:57,560
So this is your last chance.

5585
03:56:57,560 --> 03:56:59,560
I just want to stay for the record.

5586
03:56:59,560 --> 03:57:02,560
If you don't contribute to this Kickstarter, you are a fake fan.

5587
03:57:02,560 --> 03:57:03,560
And I don't know.

5588
03:57:03,560 --> 03:57:05,560
Stop listening to the PCP.

5589
03:57:05,560 --> 03:57:06,560
Fake fan.

5590
03:57:06,560 --> 03:57:07,560
I agree.

5591
03:57:07,560 --> 03:57:09,560
Stop listening to Cybershell too.

5592
03:57:09,560 --> 03:57:15,560
Unsubscribe from Cybershell if you're not going to listen to the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

5593
03:57:15,560 --> 03:57:16,560
What the hell are you doing?

5594
03:57:16,560 --> 03:57:18,560
You don't deserve to know things about Sonic.

5595
03:57:20,560 --> 03:57:21,560
Exactly.

5596
03:57:21,560 --> 03:57:22,560
I agree.

5597
03:57:24,560 --> 03:57:25,560
Well, we got to the end.

5598
03:57:25,560 --> 03:57:26,560
We did it.

5599
03:57:26,560 --> 03:57:27,560
Oh, that was the last one.

5600
03:57:27,560 --> 03:57:28,560
Oh, thank fuck.

5601
03:57:28,560 --> 03:57:29,560
Yeah, we did it.

5602
03:57:29,560 --> 03:57:31,560
What are we at like five hours now?

5603
03:57:31,560 --> 03:57:36,560
I was getting like to the point where I'm like, okay, if there's more voicemails, I think I might just drop out.

5604
03:57:36,560 --> 03:57:37,560
I think I might just go to bed.

5605
03:57:37,560 --> 03:57:38,560
I just have to dip.

5606
03:57:38,560 --> 03:57:39,560
Well, we did it.

5607
03:57:39,560 --> 03:57:40,560
It's over.

5608
03:57:40,560 --> 03:57:41,560
I mean, is the podcast over?

5609
03:57:41,560 --> 03:57:43,560
Have we said goodbye yet?

5610
03:57:43,560 --> 03:57:45,560
Well, we'll say goodbye now.

5611
03:57:45,560 --> 03:57:46,560
Say goodbye now.

5612
03:57:46,560 --> 03:57:47,560
Become a patron.

5613
03:57:47,560 --> 03:57:49,560
Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

5614
03:57:49,560 --> 03:57:51,560
Minecraft server.

5615
03:57:51,560 --> 03:57:54,560
Speakpipe for the voicemiles.

5616
03:57:54,560 --> 03:57:55,560
Goodbye.

5617
03:57:55,560 --> 03:57:56,560
Bye.

5618
03:57:56,560 --> 03:57:57,560
It's really badly done.

5619
03:57:57,560 --> 03:57:58,560
Goodbye.

5620
03:57:58,560 --> 03:57:59,560
See you later.

5621
03:57:59,560 --> 03:58:02,560
Read Tails gets trolled as well if you haven't.

5622
03:58:02,560 --> 03:58:03,560
That's a good one.

5623
03:58:03,560 --> 03:58:04,560
Yeah.

5624
03:58:04,560 --> 03:58:07,560
Read Tails gets trolled or I'm banning you from the Tails gets trolled as well.

5625
03:58:07,560 --> 03:58:08,560
Yeah.

5626
03:58:08,560 --> 03:58:09,560
You're going to preemptively ban.

5627
03:58:09,560 --> 03:58:10,560
Do that too.

5628
03:58:10,560 --> 03:58:11,560
True.

5629
03:58:11,560 --> 03:58:12,560
True.

5630
03:58:12,560 --> 03:58:13,560
True.

5631
03:58:13,560 --> 03:58:14,560
You're banned until you read it.

5632
03:58:14,560 --> 03:58:15,560
Everyone is banned.

5633
03:58:15,560 --> 03:58:16,560
Yeah.

5634
03:58:16,560 --> 03:58:17,560
You have to submit.

5635
03:58:17,560 --> 03:58:18,560
You have to submit proof.

5636
03:58:18,560 --> 03:58:23,560
There's like a quiz that you have to take and if you fail, you're just never allowed on the server.

5637
03:58:23,560 --> 03:58:25,560
You know, I actually thought of doing that.

5638
03:58:25,560 --> 03:58:26,560
That's awesome.

5639
03:58:26,560 --> 03:58:27,560
You know what?

5640
03:58:27,560 --> 03:58:28,560
Okay.

5641
03:58:28,560 --> 03:58:30,560
I guess this is actually the end.

5642
03:58:30,560 --> 03:58:31,560
Okay.

5643
03:58:31,560 --> 03:58:32,560
Goodbye.

5644
03:58:32,560 --> 03:58:33,560
Goodbye.

5645
03:58:33,560 --> 03:58:34,560
Goodbye.

5646
03:58:34,560 --> 03:58:35,560
Goodbye.

5647
03:58:53,560 --> 03:58:54,560
Bye.
