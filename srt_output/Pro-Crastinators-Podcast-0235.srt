Hello, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm Ben Saint. We got Gibbontake with us as well.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,200
Hello everybody. Hello, and our guests this week. We have another guest. Audience, commenters,

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,360
I don't care how much you hate our guests. We're going to keep doing it. Guest this week is...

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,360
I care. Listen, if you hate me, email this podcast about it, not me.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,640
If you hate... That goes for forever. Please put that on all of your future work. Just like,

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,160
if you don't like this, just send an email to theprocrastinatorsmail.com. Anyway, this is a

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,360
Jim Storm dancer. Hi. Hello. Who I was shocked to find is your real name.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,800
Yes. I thought it was just a Twitter handle. And then I thought, oh, maybe there's an Elizabeth

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,080
Warren thing going on, like a one-thousandth Cherokee. It was like a Native American name or

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,280
something. No, no. So when my wife and I got married, we decided we neither of us wanted to

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,880
be named after the other one's dad. Yeah. So we picked a new name, and it's really more than

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,240
anything, it's a riff on Luke Skywalker. Right. Which is itself probably appropriating Native

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:43,440
American style names. Probably. Yeah, one imagines. But yes, anyway, Jim Storm dancer is the creator

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,960
of Frog Fractions, among other games, including but not limited to Frog Fractions 2,

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:02:01,600
and Frog Fractions Game of the Decade edition. And I think we have on our channel a very long

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,120
Let's Play videos, Rowdyfuckers, cop killers episode, I don't know, six or whatever. For me

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,160
and Munchie, we played Frog Fractions 2. I think it was like a five-hour video or something.

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,760
Wow, you marathoned it. We did marathon it. And you know, I'm sorry to say I never actually

19
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,320
finished it. I was gonna because me and him never got around to doing the rest of it.

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,680
But yeah, I played I played Frog Fractions 1 back when it came out in 2012, I think,

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,880
something like that. Yeah, it was October 2012. October 2012. Right. Yeah, I played that when it

22
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,400
came out. You know, I saw the, you know, I don't even remember where I saw some people vague posting

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
about it, maybe it was on 4chan or something awful or something. Just like, have you seen this game?

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm not going to say what it is. You should play this game. I was like, OK, I guess I will. And

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,880
I won't, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't know. If anyone hasn't played it, I recommend it.

26
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:10,240
Check it out. It's free on twinbeer.com. Right. But if you don't, if it's like three months from

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,640
now, you won't be able to play it because Flash is going away. Yeah, I went this morning, I like

28
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
booted it up to take another look and I got the notice that's like Flash won't be supported

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,480
past December 2020. I was like, oh my, oh my God. Oh no, this fucking game. But it's OK. I made it all

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,360
better because I did a remake in On Steam and it's actually it's high res, so you don't have to

31
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,760
stare at a 640 by 480 postage stamp to play the game.

32
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,480
When I, when I saw, like I heard about Game of the Decade Edition and I, I just,

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,520
I don't know how much, I don't know. Do you want to, should I skip past talking about it? Should I

34
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,120
not say anything about it? Is it secrets? Oh, you're asking me if I put secrets in my own game?

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,760
Is that what's happening here? No, no, no. I played the Steam version. It's just the

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,600
same. It's just for fractions again, but on, you know, preserved. Yes, yes, that's correct. It's,

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,360
it was preserved as, as closely as possible to the original. However, there is DLC.

38
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,600
I was going to say, oh, oh, OK, because I read your article on your blog. Yeah. And I was reading

39
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,720
that and I was like, wait a minute. I don't know who these characters are. Yeah. This is not the

40
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,400
same game. Listen, if you, you wear a hat with the DLC, OK. You pay, you pay 10 bucks and you get

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,000
this hat and your frog looks dapper as heck. Nice. While you're eating bugs. And that's,

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,240
that's definitely all it is. I see. Yeah. I mean, 10 dollars well spent. Since, since the original

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,560
was free and all. Right. OK. Yeah, I was, I was, you know, I think when you, when you posted this

44
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,160
article, I went and I, and I looked at it and I was like, oh, there's, there's, there's more. Oh,

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,640
no. Oh, no. And I, I'm going to get around to playing it. I haven't gotten around to it yet,

46
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,000
but it's on my, it's on my to-do list. I think, I think you'll find it a lot more approachable

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,640
than Frog Fractions 2 was. OK. Like you were talking about how you spent five hours on that

48
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,080
thing and didn't finish it. Like I had intended it to be finishable in like two or three hours.

49
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,520
It turns out, turns out it was a lot harder than that for most people.

50
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,560
There were, I mean, Frog Fractions 1 is not that long and yet, well, I, I had a lot of trouble

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,480
with it actually. Sure. There was, I remember at the beginning, it took me forever. Spoilers

52
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,800
for Frog Fractions 1. Don't, don't listen to this. You haven't played it, but it took me forever to

53
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,560
realize that I could go under the water. Sure. And then, and then, so I spent like, oh, because

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,040
people assured me like, no, no, no, give this game a chance. Give this, I'm like, OK, I guess I'm

55
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,720
giving it a chance. I, I feel like I spent an hour just like turning the cyber brain on and off, or

56
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,440
is that what it's called? The one that changes you. The lock on. The lock on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Just like, and like, you know, just doing that over and it's like, what, where is this going? What's

58
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,640
and then I also got stuck on the text adventure portion. I had to, I don't remember what it was.

59
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,760
I don't remember what part it was, but I had to look up a hint at some point.

60
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,960
Yeah, no shame. Nobody knows how to, like when I made that game, I basically originally made it for

61
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,240
my audience of, you know, I had a couple dozen friends who I thought would enjoy it and that was

62
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,080
it. Yeah. And I had no idea that I would be inflicting text adventures on the world at large.

63
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,520
Um, yeah, I mean, so it goes, I guess. That's you never know. You never know what's going to be

64
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,920
the thing that blows up. But then I did that on purpose with like ZZT style dungeon crawls in

65
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:08,720
the second game. So yeah, I had never. Is ZZT a worthwhile game? I didn't know about it. The only

66
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,960
way that I know about it is that the main frog fractions game is like a reference to it. And

67
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,920
I thought that part of frog fraction was really cool in and of itself. Yeah. If you did like it,

68
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,480
then you might. So ZZT is actually really interesting. It's a game by Tim Sweeney,

69
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:37,520
who went on to make the Unreal Engine. And like Unreal, like the game Unreal, it is a game that

70
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,200
like was shipped and sold as a video game. But by far the most interesting part of it was the

71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:54,000
level editor. So it was a lot of people's first foray into game design. And so it was extremely

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,160
through the level editor. Yes, it was extremely influential in that regard. It was like early

73
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:07,920
90, like 1991 or something. Yeah. PC users found this game and made their own worlds with it.

74
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,960
And it's real hard to go back to now. Like just the it's not super playable. Like believe it or

75
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,880
not, like despite all the the bullshit I pulled in in text world, it's a lot more the feel of it

76
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,160
is a lot better than the original ZZT was. Yeah, like you kind of you do do some like graphics

77
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,520
stuff. It's not all like, I mean, I play I play some ASCII games, like I play a dungeon

78
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,920
Crawlstone soup, you familiar? Yeah. Yeah. Although I play with a tile set. Oh, sure. Yeah. Because

79
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm weak, though. So I mean, you know, the the a bit of a esoteric interface doesn't really

80
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,800
doesn't really bother me too much. Well, the thing is, so what I'm talking about specifically is

81
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,720
ZZT is an action game, but it uses like the default OS key repeat for movement. So

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,080
you key repeat, meaning so, you know, when you hold down a letter on the keyboard,

83
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,880
one letter appears in the text box, and then like a second later, a bunch of letters start

84
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,080
appearing in the text box of the same one. Yeah, sure. Okay, that's what I mean by key repeat. So

85
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,400
in ZZT, if you want to move left, you hope you can push left once to move one step left,

86
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,480
or you can there's a second, or you can hold it down, and it'll go left once, and then it'll

87
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,480
wait a second, and it'll start going left in a bunch of times. Yeah, and it's really does not,

88
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,320
it doesn't feel good to to operate like and I actually did a frog fractions too is the same

89
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:58,240
though, right? It is, but it's tuned way differently. I see. You did it deliberately.

90
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,800
Yeah, yeah. Instead of just inheriting it, I suppose. Right, yeah, right.

91
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Gib, you haven't played frog fractions too. I know I did what you play for those five hours.

92
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,920
That's right. I think a fun part of I think was it the first frog fractions you did like

93
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,480
another video where I think we did where where you played the game but like in the course of the

94
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,680
video, you sort of got derailed and started Google image searching things and looking at

95
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,840
Wikipedia's and it the video itself sort of became a reflection of what frog fractions is as a game,

96
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,640
which is that's beautiful, right? Because the video it's the video itself, right, right. I

97
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,360
remember. Yeah, there was sort of like a meta joke to that when we're like the video pretends to be

98
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,720
a video where we play frog fractions, but instead it is about, you know, entirely separate things.

99
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,880
That's right. I had like forgotten, but that was a thing at the time. Yeah, you know, I wanted to

100
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:10,720
I wanted to be, you know, wanted to be like Jim. Yeah, oh man. So I'm looking forward to

101
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,280
looking forward to checking the DLC out. That's great. My little brother is is also game developer.

102
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,520
He's he's just finished uni and he's he's working with people doing game jams and stuff. Nice. And

103
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,400
he made I was very surprised at this. He had a game called road toads, which was like a little

104
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:42,960
3D game where it had toads on cars driving around in another rfck video we did a road road toads

105
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,880
yeah through I and the the idea is you're just driving around as a toad and it's you know,

106
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,400
it's a fun little game, but he had visions of it being like, you know, you there's a revelation

107
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,240
and you find out that there's more to it and all this stuff. And I said, oh, that's reminds me

108
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,280
of frog fractions. And he was like, what the hell's that? And he was so disappointed to find that

109
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,720
someone is also done. Someone has already made a frog game with a drug game with a twist. And he

110
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,040
was like, oh, this is a genre. Next, you told him about frog detective haunted island.

111
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
I don't know about that. Oh, you should definitely check out the frog detective series.

112
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,160
Oh, it's a whole series. There's only two of them. But technically, that's a series.

113
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,320
Is it like, um, oh, I'm looking at it. Is it like a point and click? It's like a point and click

114
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,320
if a point and click were first person like a first person shooter style movement.

115
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,920
But it plays like a point and click adventure.

116
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,360
Makes sense. Makes sense. This looks cool. And I think they did that just so they wouldn't have

117
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,680
to animate the main character running around. Yeah. Yeah. I had a similar story from

118
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,960
back when I was making frog fractions. There was another Bay Area game developer

119
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:13,280
making a game called Total Toads. A lot of frog and we heard about yeah. And we heard about each

120
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:20,480
other. And I I just assumed, okay, he's making like an educational game. But he thought that I

121
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
was making an educational game as well. And was like, oh, there's a rival frog educational game

122
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,600
developer. And it turns out like you can't get his game anymore. It shipped on iPhone and it

123
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,960
doesn't work on modern iPhones. But it was a game about adding and subtracting with frog with toads

124
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:45,920
rather. Total Toads. Total Toads. So it's got the alliteration to it. Yeah. It's

125
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,160
pretty good. It's like, no, stop honing in on my market. Yeah. Have you have you seen them?

126
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,280
Do you know the catamites? Oh, yeah. Have you seen his his frog blog? I have not seen that.

127
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,840
He I don't know if he still does it. But he had a little blog page where he would he would rate

128
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:15,120
games solely based on like the appearances of frogs within them and stuff. So he would like,

129
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,760
I don't remember. But like, you know, he was like, yeah, cave stories got some some pretty

130
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,000
good frog enemies. You know, they don't do very they're not in very much the game. But you know,

131
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,040
they're good for what they are, you know, seven out of 10. Right. Oh, you know, in, you know,

132
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,600
whatever. Yeah, yeah, he'll just rate really rated the frogs, basically. Now I'm curious. Now I want

133
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,040
to find out what the catamites had to say about the frogs and frog fractions. I don't know. I,

134
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,800
you know, I feel like I should know whether or not frog fractions made the cut for that list. But

135
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,200
I but I don't well off the top. If the blog is is continuing into the future, and maybe it will,

136
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,560
it will in the unknowable future. I think it's probably still on Harmony Zone

137
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:12,160
somewhere on that fucking Technicolor nightmare. Angel fire. Yeah, yeah. The web ring or whatever.

138
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:22,640
Right. So how is you, both of you? How is your Halloween? How is how's how's life? Who's going

139
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:31,360
first? Well, I guess I can go first. Yeah, go for it. My Halloween was uneventful. And that's

140
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,120
that's exactly how I enjoy it. Usually, you know, obviously put up decorations, people come around

141
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,440
the door, trick or treat with COVID. Nobody did that. And we didn't put up decorations to encourage

142
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,560
it. Instead, I carved some pumpkins with goofy faces. And usually they're out in the front.

143
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,760
And then they get like, by the next morning, they're all like brought in. So we just throw them

144
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,680
away. But this time they were inside. And so I decided to burn them. I said to light a fire

145
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,280
inside the pumpkin. And that was what I did with my evening. So I just because it's a it's a vegetable,

146
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,920
it's got a lot of moisture in it. You just threw like wood in there. I put I put logs and kindling

147
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,720
newspaper and I lit them in the fireplace. And it was it was it was very scary at some points.

148
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,160
Because you don't need them after after tomorrow or after the day. And yeah, but the the effect was

149
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,600
really quite striking because it's like, it's a guy's face and it's fires coming out of it and

150
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,480
is getting singed to the sides. It's cool. I was gonna say I've been listening to a YouTube series

151
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,720
called Goose Drunks, where this girl Bailey Myers just reads Goosebumps books. But she

152
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,240
she takes a drink. She has some rules, like whenever stupid things happen or spooky things happen.

153
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,440
That just reminded me of that series that I've been getting into lately, in which I recommend,

154
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,800
because there's one Goosebumps book where some kids have jack-o-lantern pumpkin heads.

155
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,440
That's that's it. That's the only connection. Okay. What were you saying? I say interrupted

156
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,400
for that. Oh, I was I was going to say that if you had filmed it, then it would make it great.

157
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,640
One of those videos where you know how you can find on Netflix, there's like a video that's just

158
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:32,000
a video of like an hour of a fireplace. Yes, an hour of like a pumpkin face slowly melting

159
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,200
would be fantastic. It'd probably be like 45 seconds of a pumpkin face disintegrating. Well,

160
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,080
on fire. Because yeah, like I was saying that it's a it's a vegetable and it was quite fresh. I

161
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,800
only cut it like the day or two before. There's a lot of moisture in there. So it actually the fire

162
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:58,000
was struggling to stay alive. So I was feeding that I was literally feeding it through the

163
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,320
mouth of the pumpkin fuel. That's pretty cute. I did film like few little 45 second chunks of it,

164
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,080
but I didn't set up anything because it was like in the living room. And parents were there watching

165
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,880
TV. It was sort of like we had to set up a camera. Right. So you couldn't make the theatrical

166
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,040
theatrical screaming noises either. No, do you do you? Did you save the seeds? Seeds? Oh,

167
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,840
yes. Well, yeah, I did. My brother was going to make a kind of a pumpkin pie. Yeah, something like

168
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,280
that. Yeah. You know, they're nice. You can you just you just put them up. You just bake them.

169
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,720
You just season them however you want. You bake them. You can make sweet cinnamon.

170
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:52,320
You can do like garlic and herb or just the seeds on their own. I mean, yeah, you should probably

171
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,560
salt them at least. What we did was we we actually boiled them in salt water to in order to salt them.

172
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,280
It's the best way apparently to get even salting. You know,

173
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,480
and then we baked them just to be clear. OK, OK, OK, OK, I was going to because like I was introduced

174
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,040
when I lived in the south, I was introduced to boiled peanuts. And I got to say they're gross

175
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,880
and I hate them. Yeah, I don't think I had I don't know if I had a peanut. They're so much worse

176
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,960
than just just cooking them like a normal human being. I don't I don't understand what you're

177
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,360
saying. Is that is that roasting? Is that is? Yeah, roast them. Yeah, roast them in the oven.

178
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,360
OK. Or or in whatever. Yeah, you roast them. That's roasted peanuts. Typically, I get them out of

179
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,400
the jar with the peanut guy with the top hat on it. Well, well, they because they roasted them,

180
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,360
right? Because they roast them because they know because they when you boil them, they turn into

181
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,560
like these soft. They taste like beans like it brings out. They're sort of like like like earthy

182
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,360
like beanie flavor. And it's I hate it. It's the texture like it's like a like a one of a chickpea.

183
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,800
It's very similar to interesting soft. Yeah, OK, all right. Time for a visual metaphor.

184
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:12,160
If Mr. Peanut was was boiled instead of roasted, what would he be wearing?

185
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,560
Well, he'd be big, swollen, soggy.

186
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,920
He would look like he has. He'd look like he was like covered in like eczema.

187
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,600
But like he already has some sort of skin skin condition.

188
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,840
He'd be all puffed up and darker in color and seeping just seeping.

189
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,520
I don't know. It's not for you. Anyway, I feel feel very strongly

190
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,960
about boiled peanuts and how you shouldn't do it. I know some people are big fans,

191
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,760
but I don't like those people and I don't trust them. Maybe you could make a homicide of it.

192
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,480
You said you said hummus, but I heard homicide. Maybe I could make a great homicide out of it.

193
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
That too. Makes you think. No.

194
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,880
It does, though, I promise. How was your Halloween, Jim?

195
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,080
You know, it was great. We we never get trick or treaters.

196
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,440
But this year we were like, well, we're we're going to now in covid times, it's time to go all out.

197
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:36,240
And we is it if we set up a table outside with a big tray painted to look like a Ouija board

198
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:44,960
and like Halloween colored Christmas lights and pumpkins all around it and a bunch of candy on

199
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,800
the tray and and hand sanitizer on the table. You put it out. You put it out for no one.

200
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,600
So pretty much pretty there was one group like that came by as we were going to bed

201
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,960
that were very excited and came by and yelled up. I don't know if they knew we were going to hear

202
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,440
them, but they yelled, thank you. Merry Christmas. And it was very sweet. And there was it sounded

203
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,600
like there were like four people in the group. So like four people took handfuls of candy. So

204
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,960
better than nothing. OK, yeah, it's not no one. And we also had we have our two year old Winston

205
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:33,440
who we wanted like we got to teach this kid how holidays work. So we did a very minimal

206
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:43,040
like just five houses or so. Trick or treat run he and he didn't want to we had gotten a costume

207
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,640
so he could dress up as Mario and he was like on the day of he was like, no, I don't want to wear

208
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,440
he doesn't speak that well. But he was like, no, I don't want to wear that.

209
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:57,520
Yeah. But he was willing to wear his pajamas that have bones printed on the front. So he could

210
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,120
look like a skeleton. Yeah, you know what? Yeah. But he just he just wears that all year round.

211
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,440
He does. OK, I mean, it's still fine. But but the neighbors don't know.

212
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,120
Yeah, yeah, it's not for him. Yeah, yeah. So we went we went to a couple of houses and like

213
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,120
surprisingly, we did our usual thing of like, well, is the porch light on or the house lights on

214
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,760
is their decorations of guessing like which houses are going to be participating. And like 50% of

215
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,040
people that we tried answered the door and gave us candy. So like people are still wanting to

216
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:37,440
participate in this thing. Sure. Of course. But yeah, this is not a high traffic trigger

217
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,960
treat neighborhood. So I think like my if like if next year he seems to be ready to step it up,

218
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,600
we have to figure out where are the kids actually going? Yeah, you might just like make a little

219
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,560
evening trip out to some like more tightly packed neighborhood, I guess. Yeah, dual circuit. Yeah.

220
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:05,280
Yeah, yeah. My house growing up. I yeah, I was on kind of like a country road, like not exactly in

221
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,360
like the complete boonies or whatever, but like, you know, in like a pretty, pretty loosely packed

222
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,080
like sort of suburban country town. And so we would on like a good year, we would get one

223
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:25,840
trick or treat. Yeah. Yeah. But now, I mean, now I live on a more on a more dense street.

224
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,480
And so we probably would have but I don't think I don't think anyone came to our door yesterday,

225
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,280
or maybe I just wasn't paying attention. Well, you know, I was going to have some,

226
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,720
I was going to have some friends over, Kazi and Munchie, give you know him, Jim, you don't know

227
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,600
him, we're going to be over. But then we're just going to hang out in my backyard, because like

228
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,640
that's what we've been doing. You know, social distancing guests don't come in the house,

229
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,160
we hang on my backyard. And it snowed, it snowed yesterday, and there was still snow on the ground.

230
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,280
And so I said, oh, and crack and shell, it wasn't just a bunch of people, whatever.

231
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,880
Anyway, it snowed at the wrong time. I didn't want to like squat in the snow in my backyard.

232
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:12,240
So I said, no, Halloween's canceled, everyone, go home. So I didn't do anything. I was grumpy all

233
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:20,320
day about it. But you know what, dumb holiday, dumb holiday anyway, who needs it? Right? Am I

234
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,320
right? Yeah, hell yeah. It's the sweetest holiday. Oh, Winston. Oh, sorry, gone. I was going to say

235
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,880
the other thing, the other thing that ruined my Halloween was because it snowed. I finally had

236
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,280
to take my air conditioner out of my window. And I had to take it out of my window and move it over

237
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,960
my bed to get it into my closet to store because I have like a low, well, the snow, I don't know

238
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,120
if you know where this is going, but the snow had gotten into the air conditioner and the whole

239
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,040
thing was wet. And as I was moving it over my bed, all the snow water, like poured out of it

240
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:06,320
and like soaked my bed. So what I had to do last night, I had to, I took like saran wrap,

241
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,040
I had to like spread saran wrap over this big wet area in my bed and put a blanket over it

242
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,200
and sleep on top of that. It felt dry. Yeah, some people feel extra for that kind of bed.

243
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,040
And you know what? I woke up in the morning and I checked and it was dry again. So

244
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,920
problem solved. I just hope it didn't have any like weird like black mold or fungus in it,

245
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,840
you know, that's like a living in my mattress now. Oh dear. Winston, when we were out walking this

246
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,240
morning, he wanted to get more candy. He walked up, he started walking up a neighbor's driveway

247
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:49,360
saying get candy. Yeah, yeah. I have to explain like, sorry, this is just yesterday, buddy. Oh,

248
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,800
okay. He thought this isn't, oh, so this is what all, this is what all those other houses are for.

249
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:03,680
Right. You can get candy from them if you ask. I see. Smart, smart, smart kid. He's a pattern

250
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:18,080
matcher. I see. I see my new angle. So this is, now I didn't tell you this. I'm springing this on

251
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,600
you, but it's nevertheless true that you're not merely our guest this episode. You are actually

252
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:32,320
interviewing right now to be the new replacement member since all of our other members have

253
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:45,120
abandoned us. So how do you feel you're doing? I think I'm doing great. You think you're killing

254
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:53,280
it? Well, we'll see about that. Listen, I'm here to interview you. Okay. Oh, I didn't prepare

255
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:02,080
anything. I do want to say, I didn't, this is technically a crossover with your podcast

256
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,800
Topic Lords, which I didn't know you had. Yeah, I guess technically it is. Yeah, I didn't know

257
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,880
about it until very recently as I was looking up stuff related to you in the week leading up to

258
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,840
having you on. And I was like, oh, he's got a podcast too. I wonder if he knows the pain.

259
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Surely he must also know the pain of having all of his other podcast members turn on him

260
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,680
and abandon them to their fate. That's just part of the experience.

261
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,680
Yeah, so Topic Lords is a weekly podcast, TopicLords.com. The only place on the internet,

262
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:53,600
you can hear us to discuss topics. It's me and two guests. Every week, it's two different guests.

263
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,360
And the guests bring topics to discuss. And it's very freeform. One of the listeners described it

264
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:12,000
to me as a place for people with ADHD to gush about their fixations. Oh, there's a market for

265
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,600
that seems pretty accurate. But so, yes, I, the last last episode I recorded was pushed back

266
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,200
twice because both of the guests forgot they were recording. Sure. Oh, like, oh my god.

267
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Like they started the episode and just there was no. Oh, no, I mean, like I was I was messaging them

268
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,480
on, however, I know them on Discord or whatever. And they were just like, oh, I forgot about it.

269
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,320
Can we do this later? Oh, sure. And then they both answered that way. And I was like, luck,

270
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,720
you're in luck. The other guests also forgot. Yeah, lucky you. You're not, you're not the odd man out.

271
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Right. Technically, you're the weird one because you remembered. Well, my wife had to remind me.

272
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:12,560
Oh, okay, few. Good, good. I am very diligent. And I never forget an episode. And I'm here,

273
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:20,160
and I'm here rain or shine, because I care, viewers, because I give a shit. And you're all welcome.

274
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,280
Oh, yes. Yes.

275
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,840
Well, that's all my notes. I don't know. Show's over.

276
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,320
I don't know how. Yeah, go on. Yeah. Mr. Frog, Mr. Fraction.

277
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,360
Storm dancer. Storm dancer. Yeah, please. Storm dancer. Fraction was my dad's name.

278
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:56,080
I'm only a fraction, fraction. Okay, all right. Game development is a cool thing.

279
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:05,520
I've wanted to, oh, really? Yeah, it's cool when it works. It's cool when it works out.

280
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Making the game is great. It's all the parts where you try to get other people to pay to play

281
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,000
the game. That part sucks. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's that's always been like with any art thing. It's

282
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,440
like, I love what I'm doing. And then you've got to eat and you've got to make the money so you

283
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:31,760
can eat. And it's like that goes in that flies in the face of art in itself sucks. Marketing is

284
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,320
you have to like spec some of your talent points into like being a soul sucking vampire in order

285
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:45,360
to actually make money. It's been a problem. Yeah, because I noticed business that like

286
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,720
for fractions one obviously was free and it was big. And then for fractions two is like

287
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:59,440
the whole idea of making a sequel to something with brand recognition is so that you don't have

288
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:09,040
to do as much work to get it seen and bought. Yeah. And you did the cool thing, which was to make it

289
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,960
like not put your name on it, not call it frog fractions, release it secretly with an ARG.

290
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,200
And it's all like really interesting and cool and unique, but not good for capitalizing on,

291
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,480
you know, on the things that you're supposed to do in this world.

292
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,800
And I was trying to do, I mean, so obviously the reason I did that was that I hate the marketing

293
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,400
side of things. And this was effectively like, I'm promising I'm never going to do any marketing

294
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,600
on this game, which is itself like it's audacious enough that people are going to talk about it.

295
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,280
So it becomes itself a form of marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that worked. But

296
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,480
I don't know. It was frog fractions two at this point, like a success in terms of being able

297
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,720
to get away with being so audacious, like non marketing marketing. Yeah. So it's technically

298
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:15,360
profitable. But we didn't pay the best kind of profitable. Yeah. We didn't pay people very well.

299
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:23,680
So like that's not a very high bar. I definitely would have made more money if I called it frog

300
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,960
fractions two. Right. Yeah. Because then people would knowing where to get it is like a pretty good

301
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,680
is like, that's like the first hurdle you got to clear. Yeah. But that's pretty high for frog

302
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:44,320
fractions to that right. But I also definitely would have made more money if the main minigame had

303
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,120
art. Like I did ZZT style stuff because I'm nostalgic for that art style. And because

304
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,640
it was a style that I could do without paying a bunch of money out of an art budget, which I didn't

305
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,600
have basically. I mean, I do like the way it looks. It's very I do too. But it's very spiky.

306
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,920
Like a lot of people don't like a lot of people are really turned off by that. And if I had made

307
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,760
that look like, you know, Zelda one, for example, I think a lot more people would have been into

308
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:26,000
that. Yeah, Zelda one or like Minecraft, something that that can. Yeah. Minecraft is amazing and how

309
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,640
it can get away with such, you know, low, low resolution textures and low poly things because

310
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,920
I don't know. It's just the game. It's so fun. Yep.

311
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:47,040
So it's always a challenge because I'm like, I make comics, but I'm not that good at drawing yet.

312
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,960
So I'm trying to figure out how I can make comics without really being good.

313
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:58,000
Give us hard on yourself. Give us hard on yourself about the drawing thing. But you've

314
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,840
improved. I mean, we've said this before. I don't want to, not to go on a side, but I really do

315
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,640
want to tell you again, how much you've improved and like your last couple of things like Clarissa

316
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,520
looks Clarissa looks like much better than Lord of Ghost, which looks much better than

317
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,120
Bail Jade, you know, for instance, just I can't let that go unsaid.

318
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,960
Have baited. I baited you into complimenting me again, you fool. Yeah, this is the one.

319
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah. It was just saying like

320
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,440
the with the comics, I'm not terrible, but like, I have improved. Thank you, Ben.

321
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,040
You're welcome.

322
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,240
But it's it's always been a thing where like, I'm trying to think of ways that I can

323
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,360
make it engaging and marketable and good and people would want to see it regardless of how

324
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,080
much it looks like the best thing ever, you know, you play to my strengths,

325
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,240
play to the things that work, because like people make snap judgments when they see something.

326
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,080
And if it doesn't look the greatest, you may as well make it look the most unique or, you know,

327
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,280
there's there's all these different things you can do to make it striking and I don't know.

328
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've put a lot of thought into this sort of thing because

329
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:25,920
I'm a largely a solo developer with without an art background. My skill sets are

330
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,320
programming and music and writing, basically. And so I've put a bunch of

331
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:40,080
like research and thought into like, how do people do programmer art that looks good,

332
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,680
that is appealing to people and like the most basic form of it is something like

333
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:52,000
geometry wars, which is just geometric shapes with a nice bloom filter applied, basically.

334
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:01,280
Yeah. And I think like something along those lines might be your solution like you like you could

335
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,360
like you could use Blender to pose 3D mannequins or something like that.

336
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Yeah. I thought of things like that, like like a multimedia sort of thing. I mean,

337
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,200
Bailhape, my first comic was like MS Paint crap, but I made up for that by having

338
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:29,360
a lot of Homestuck inspired aspects like like flashes. There's a 3D video game that me and

339
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,520
my brother worked on that is one of the pages of the comic. And there's a lot of gifs that sort of,

340
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:43,680
you know, pages that are gifs rather than just still images that make up for how shoddy the artwork

341
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,800
is. Right, right. You make it be a multimedia kind of a thing where like, suddenly this comic,

342
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,800
it's like something that couldn't exist in a book. And so it's taking advantage of being digital.

343
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:07,120
Yeah, I would, I think I've said before that I would think it was, I would find it really cool

344
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:14,320
to be because I do art myself. I'm a draw guy. I would love to be, I don't know, I would love to

345
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,320
find like some like little studio or something that needs like a dedicated artist and be like a

346
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,720
background artist or like a character artist or something. I'm not really an animator, so I don't

347
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,480
I guess I'm limited in that. But I would, that'd be really cool to just be the art guy for some

348
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,520
game that ends up being like an indie hit or something. That would be, that would be the

349
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,840
dream right there. But I've looked, I've looked on, I've looked around a little bit on websites that

350
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,600
are like, unlike job hunting websites, and I've found like studios in my area that are hiring,

351
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,600
and then, but they, none of them were looking for, the closest thing I could find was like

352
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:04,400
UI designers and like UI designers from mobile games. It's just not, it's just not that interesting.

353
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,160
I don't know, it doesn't sound like it is. So yeah, I mean, are you like looking at classified ads

354
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,360
and that sort of thing? I mean, this was a while ago, but I just went on, I don't know, I looked

355
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,080
on some website or something that like, like looked for studios, look for studios and like,

356
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,840
because I live in the Boston area, I look for like studios around Boston. And I think I just

357
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,400
like went to each of their websites to see, because sometimes they have like a weird hiring page.

358
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,640
Yeah, if you want to do indie games, and indie developers, I can't, I've never heard of one

359
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,800
putting out a job ad. Yeah, they almost ubiquitously hire people they've met already.

360
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:52,160
And yeah, they met, they meet people doing game jams, for the most like, if you, if you want to

361
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:59,200
start getting gigs, making video games, I think like that's actually your path forward is to

362
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,280
start doing jams and the people you work with, if they like your work, then they'll want to work with

363
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:13,520
you again. Oh my God, I would have to, I would have to assemble a team. I would have to assemble

364
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,680
like a jam team. And I could be the art guy. Oh, well, you have pro programming guy.

365
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,440
You could do it that way. I mean, or you could, I guess you can't do the thing that I always did,

366
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,960
which was assemble a team on site, because they don't have on site game jams anymore.

367
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah, but like, I presume like you go to Ludum Dare forums and they will be there will be people

368
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,280
like looking for group or whatever. I mean, hell, how big is the audience of this podcast? You could

369
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,200
send out a message there saying I want to I want to form a team for the next Ludum Dare or whatever

370
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,520
jam and send me an email. We've got you know what, I know there's a number of people in our audience

371
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:05,200
who are like artist types of various descriptions. You know, I hate our audience. Oh yes. But you

372
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,480
know, they can they can be harness their their work can be siphoned.

373
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,640
They can extract their surplus value. Hmm, that interesting idea. You know what, I would do it.

374
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,960
I would do a game jam. I guess I never thought of it because I'm not like a games guy specifically.

375
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,200
But I could do you know, these, you know, idiots are always looking for like, oh, I can do all

376
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
this other stuff, but I can't do the art. Oh, I don't know how to draw. Oh, the art is hard.

377
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,000
You know, for whatever reason.

378
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,440
You know, what's easy programming?

379
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Yeah, I looked at it. I looked at it. Programming is also easy. There's a lot of text. I can't read

380
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:59,120
it very good. I need a visual indicator. This is like a like a weird thing that I've noticed

381
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,080
over the years. That is just I when it when it comes to a video game, at least, I love being

382
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:13,520
able to move in a 3D space, because oh, yeah, feels good. You press you press your button,

383
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,520
and then you instantly feel movement through an area because all of the pixels on screen

384
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,360
change at once. And I don't know, something about a 3D environment where you're moving around

385
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:31,120
and everything is updating constantly, you get an instant feedback. In the text

386
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,400
adventure part of Frog Fractions, I always like my brain breaks, like because you look around

387
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,680
in the spaceship, and you think, okay, here's the things I can examine. I examine each one of

388
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,560
them. And then the text has gone off screen. And because it's gone, I can't remember what it was.

389
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,680
So I have to do it again. And I just can't keep it in my head. Need that visual stimulus.

390
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,800
Well, you know what you can do, you can lean on the return key, and then every every pixel on

391
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:09,040
the screen just keeps moving. I just keep just in one direction. Right. That's what I'm looking

392
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,560
for in a game is the pixels move. I just need like a white noise like static image and like,

393
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:24,000
that's what I like. I have to say that moving through a 3D space is one of my, if not the

394
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:33,280
biggest pleasure I get out of games. Like just the being in a world and interacting with the

395
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:41,280
world in an interesting physical way. Like, I have been super stressed this year from shipping

396
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:47,120
a game and raising a kid and COVID basically. And so I haven't really had the mental energy to

397
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:55,440
pick up any new games. But I replayed the entire Tony Hawk series and the entire 3D Mario series.

398
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,760
Because those are both like, and those are both games that I love in part because they are about

399
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,840
navigating a 3D space in an interesting way. Yeah, it's just sometimes I just want to be in a

400
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,280
place. I've been playing a lot of World of Warcraft lately. And I've said before on this podcast

401
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:22,000
that the Warcraft sucks. The world is where it's at. And it's just so nice being in certain

402
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,280
locations and just being like, yeah, I'm turning the camera around. I'm here. This character is me,

403
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,200
and I'm just sitting down at this table in this pub in this weird dwarven district of a city. It's

404
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:43,440
cool. That was also my favorite part of World of Warcraft. Yeah. I got into it for a little bit.

405
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,080
And then I got turned off when I realized that, oh, I hit the end game. Now it's time to raid.

406
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,560
Now it's time to join a guild and start putting together raid teams and like, oh, I got it.

407
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,920
You mean I'm not done? You mean I have to come back and do it again? And like,

408
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,560
I couldn't. I just didn't have the wherewithal.

409
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:09,920
Yeah, I had a similar reaction where I hit level 60 and I was like, where do I go from here?

410
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:19,920
And thank God because I think I lost my job because of that game. And so like the fact that it was

411
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,920
like I didn't even kick the addiction. It just the game ejected me basically.

412
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,200
I only played it for one summer because like my friends at college were like, oh,

413
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,120
we're all going to play. This was when the Lich King came out. They were like, oh,

414
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,760
you never played Warcraft? Oh, bro. Lich King's coming out this summer. We're all going to play it.

415
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,680
We're all going to be online. We're all going to be a guild. I was like, yeah, sure. Okay. I guess.

416
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,280
And I did. And then summer ended and I was like, yeah, it's fine. I did it. I don't need any more.

417
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:04,160
I did dabble a little bit in game making. I made a very simple sort of turn-based RPG kind of game

418
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:12,640
in a Game Maker Pro, I think, like in GML, which was also a tie-in as part of like my

419
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,840
a webcomic that I was working on. And then I made, I think I would be remiss.

420
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,800
We got to talk about Endless War. I want to tell Jim a little bit about Endless War.

421
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:30,320
Can we do that? Yeah, of course. It was two years ago. I started working on this thing.

422
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,200
And now there's like a whole team. There's like a whole volunteer team that has taken it off my

423
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,720
hands and they're the ones developing it now. But what it is, it's called Endless War. And it is

424
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,840
a Discord bot that runs in this Discord server, which turns the server into basically an MUD,

425
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:56,000
like a text-based RPG kind of thing, wherein you live in this city called Slime City,

426
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,840
New Los Angeles City, aka Neo Milwaukee. And you got a mine for Slime, and you join a gang,

427
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,800
and then you engage in an endless cycle of gang warfare. You choose a team. You're a killer or

428
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,240
a rowdy, and you kill each other. And whoever's got the most slime is the most power. Watch out

429
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:22,160
for Slime Corp. They're ruthless capitalist dogs that'll kill you for a nickel. I don't know.

430
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,440
That was ballooned over time. At first, it was just like you do a command and you kill.

431
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,680
That's the basic skeleton. But every month of the day, you just go in the mines,

432
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,040
you just mine for slime. Well, you can fish for it too. You can also farm it. You can grow up.

433
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,480
Yeah, all right. Mines are the OG. Mines are the coolest.

434
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,160
I don't even know what the game is doing anymore. Me and my friend Crack,

435
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,320
honestly, mostly him, because he was more of a developer than me. We made it two years ago,

436
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:00,080
and now people that I barely know make it. And every month, I'll see an update that's like,

437
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:10,800
oh, yeah, we added new... Now you can sell your soul to another player and put it in a jar,

438
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,960
and they can keep the jar in their fridge. You can own a real estate. Oh, yeah, we added new

439
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,600
crops. There's new crops that you can mill for new dyes and stuff. Oh, we added a new mini-boss

440
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:27,360
or... I don't even know what this means. This is all in this text-based thing.

441
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,000
So this is what you do. Here's how you do the handle this. You wait till you're on your death bed

442
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:41,360
to maximize your anticipation and to maximize the number of weird features that these developers

443
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:47,600
have added. Then you play the game right before you're about to die, and you have the most amazing,

444
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:54,880
like, I made this awesome indie game, and now look at... 50 years ago, I made this bot,

445
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:02,640
and now it's moved platform six times. Now it's in VR, and I'm growing crops, and I'm hunting

446
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,600
beasts and stuff. Yeah, this is what I expected it would become one day. A 4x platformer.

447
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,040
Yeah, it's so advanced that it actually turns you immortal, and then you don't be on your death bed

448
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,240
anymore. Oh, no. That was it. That was the plan all along, to transcend the physical form.

449
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,760
And then you become one with the slime in the cloud. The slime cloud.

450
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,320
Which is definitely not the same as dying.

451
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,280
No, no, no, no. You convert your consciousness directly into slime-based cryptocurrency,

452
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,800
and then trade it on the stock market. That's what I wanted, my tombstone.

453
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,520
You feel like, oh, shit. KFC stock is rising. My consciousness is expanding. My third eyes

454
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,960
of... In the game, there's a stock market, by the way. You competing stock like Taco Bell,

455
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:05,360
KFC, and Pizza Hut are all... But you didn't put KFC in the game. The simulants invented it.

456
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:14,000
KFC was in the game, but I did not add the stock market portion. You used to just buy food from

457
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,360
KFC, believe it or not, but now it's a living dock. Now there's multiple restaurants and multiple

458
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,840
districts. The slime is... No, they want the slime. You pay them in slime, and they're like,

459
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:34,320
okay. You go to the mines, you mine for slime until you're too tired, and then you go to KFC,

460
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,920
you give them your slime, they give you some plutonium chicken. You eat it. You restore your

461
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,680
stamina, and then you go back to the mine, and then you just do it all over again. That's capitalism,

462
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:54,400
baby. It's a metaphor. It's, you know, in real life, that's horrifying, in a video game that

463
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:03,120
sounds delightful. It is. Exactly, exactly. Fortunately, you can't do... There's no more

464
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,760
Kavens now. We took Kavens out, so... Oh, you did? I think so. Maybe not. Maybe they're back in. Who

465
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:17,280
fucking knows? Remember what we said? What about Kaven mimics? You think it's a Kaven,

466
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:26,000
but it turns out to be a treasure chest. You trigger Kavens on purpose, but sometimes...

467
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,160
Before you notice that it's actually a treasure, you miss out on the treasure if you run away.

468
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,800
Right. I guess that's a reverse mimic. Devs, I hope you're listening. Devs, you better listen to this

469
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,880
and implement all of this right now. Put it on the to list. Yeah, you're still the project leader,

470
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:53,520
right? I mean, I can't make them do anything. Yeah, because it was like... I would hope that

471
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,280
my suggestions would carry at least a little weight. Right. It was a free thing. There was no

472
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,920
pay structure. I guess it's always been whoever's the coolest with the coolest ideas gets to decide

473
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:21,120
what happens. It's open source, and that's why... Oh, yeah. You just stole it, right? Oh, yeah.

474
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:30,640
Yeah, I copied it for my own copy of the thing for an adult version. Yeah, you could say.

475
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:45,040
You could say. Disgusting. Absolutely. Absolutely despicable. I'm glad to say. When I'm on my deathbed,

476
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:54,720
reading the patch notes for version 7.33.49.01 of Endless War, seeing all the new vegetables that

477
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:03,040
they've added, I'm glad that I'll be able to look back and say, hey, me, Endless War guy,

478
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,680
and Jim Stormdancer, Frog Fractions guy. Yeah, we rapped a little bit. We rapped a bit about video

479
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:17,120
games. That was the thing that happened. Definitely happened. Yeah, and here's the proof.

480
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:27,200
Are you working on anything right now? I know that's probably a pretty cliche question,

481
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:34,640
but I'm genuinely curious. What's the next video game? Can I have another video game,

482
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:43,280
Sarah, please? So I just patched achievements and a bunch of new secrets into the Hat DLC.

483
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:55,120
That was a few weeks ago. Right, right. And at this point, I can't... So it's complicated.

484
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,320
The game is not selling well enough that I can justify just launching into a new product.

485
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,120
You mean the Game of the Decade? Yeah, the Hat DLC. The Hat DLC is what I mean. It's not a game,

486
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:15,600
it's just a hat. Yeah, just a hat. There's nothing other than the hat. Yeah, yeah. Right. It's a very

487
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,640
nice hat. It's not selling well enough that I can justify just like, yeah, now is when I make my next

488
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,920
game. So I have to figure out what is next for me. In the meantime, I am doing contract stuff.

489
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,760
I was going to say, you do like real jobs, at least some of the time.

490
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,880
Yeah. Well, I mean, it's been ever since Frog Fractions, I've only done like...

491
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:47,760
And this is really neat. It's only been interesting work. It's mostly been game dev stuff,

492
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:56,080
but yes, I do contract work in addition to making my own video games.

493
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,960
But I've been very privileged to like, largely be working on my own games for the past eight years.

494
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:10,480
I don't know. I mean, stop me if you can't answer anything specific or anything. But like,

495
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,200
is it, do you do studios? Do you work for studios or is it mostly like other indie devs that like

496
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:23,440
contract you to work on projects? So I, it's always been indies. The biggest

497
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,080
studio that I worked for was Human Nature Studios, which was at the time making Toja

498
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:38,560
Mineral. And I was working on, they wanted to crowdfund a sequel to Star Flight. And so I was...

499
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,680
Star Flight, okay. Which is, if you've heard of Star Control 2...

500
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,480
I've heard of it, yeah. Yeah. Star Control 2 was the game that was like a spiritual sequel to Star

501
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:56,080
Flight. But so it's a game about flying around and getting in dogfights and talking to aliens

502
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:03,280
and exploring alien planets. It's a very like, try to do everything, space exploration game.

503
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:11,360
Like Star Citizen, except made in 1984 or whatever it was, in 86 maybe.

504
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:19,600
And I was working on, I wasn't working on the sequel, I was working on the prototype of the

505
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:28,560
sequel that they could film, they could screen capture to use in the trailer. So I was still...

506
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:34,480
Okay. I was still doing like game design work. I was still doing like interface design work.

507
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:42,960
But it was kind of amazing in that like, oh, if there's a bug that I...

508
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,760
If there's like a nasty bug that happens like, even as often as like half the time the players

509
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,640
run the game, yeah. It doesn't matter. Just use the footage where the bug didn't happen.

510
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:04,800
It's like, that's like so funny. It's must like, imagine like, you don't even have to worry about

511
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,800
bugs like as long as the game runs. Like you can make the ultimate game. Like you're freed from

512
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,680
this whole like vector of concern about like what's going to limit the kind of game you can make.

513
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:21,760
But alas, only for this in this context that like we'll never see a wide release because like

514
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:29,600
the game's broken. Right. Very, very strange. Is that like, is that like,

515
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,720
is that what, is that what Will Wright did with Spore? Do you know about, you know,

516
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,080
you know the trailer, the initial trailer for Spore that he did, the demo, you remember that?

517
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:47,360
I, yeah, I don't know what that was. It might have been, it might well have been a prototype in

518
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,880
the same, along the same vein. Like that was an incredibly ambitious project that they really,

519
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,400
they really cut scope on that by a huge amount in order to ship it.

520
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:06,400
It looked so different, the final game. And yeah, it was, I don't know, man, like some of the, some

521
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,240
of the stuff, some of this, like when he, I've complained about this before because no game

522
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,640
ever broke my heart, like Spore did. But like when he gets to the planet stage and he's like

523
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,640
finely tuning the planet's atmosphere, like, oh, the various gases in the atmosphere and the

524
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,320
temperature. And then suddenly organically, like life starts blooming on the planet. He's like,

525
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,960
oh, yes, I've tariff, the delicate control. And then you get it, you get to the real game.

526
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,360
And it's like, you just drop a fucking bomb on the planet. And like, that's how you turn it into

527
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,520
a habitable planet. And you can like put stamps on it. And that's how you just like, oh my God,

528
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:46,160
Will, Will, you fucker. Yeah, they were doing some some sneaky shit with that.

529
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,680
Yeah, yeah. I mean, obviously, like they were trying to make the game that Will

530
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,000
Wright wanted to make. And they were just like, well, we're like four years into development.

531
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And it's nowhere to close to anything playable. Like, is my guess is what happened. So like, okay,

532
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,840
let's let's bring in the guy who made civilization to do the the turn based strategy part of it,

533
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:19,600
you know. Yeah. And like, they turned it into, I guess, in the same sort of way as frog fractions,

534
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:29,600
they turned it into a series of mini games. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, the the the different stages

535
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:37,280
were always going to play differently. But yeah, like the the final like the final stage like the

536
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:44,080
conquest of space was just so like, just so like, oh, you know, just do the same thing just like

537
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:50,000
move from planet to planet. Oh, and sometimes these like Borg things show up and you just got

538
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,760
to kill them and they're just like, okay, it does. Yeah. Sad. Yeah. Sad times. I'm still still

539
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:06,560
still hurting, still hurting over spore. I bet I bet you could get some of that same sense out of

540
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:12,720
like a dwarf fortress or something like a war fortress. I have played dwarf fortress not in

541
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:23,680
a while. I used to play it pretty often, actually. Not in not in recent years. I was a big fan. I was

542
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,480
a really big fan of just going like doing world gen and then just going into like,

543
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,040
world history and like reading. Yeah, even that's like, I think that's why I stopped playing it

544
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,160
was because I discovered that like, I kind of just like reading about the stuff more than like,

545
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,080
you know, all the rigmarole of like, okay, well, I have to mine up have to mine iron and then I

546
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:49,520
got to I got to refine it and just steal and I need I need pig iron and okay, I need the okay to

547
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,000
form it into like, okay, I got to make greaves, got to make helmets, got to outfit my military.

548
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,120
Okay, what kind of what color cloak did I need? I need purple helmets to dye their cloaks with

549
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:06,800
like, okay, I get that. You know, let me just read about read about the let me just read about

550
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:14,800
like the goblin who became emperor of the dwarven kingdom after like, she was created when the

551
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:21,200
universe began and then spent the first like 400 years of her life, like winning a hammer throwing

552
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,720
contest and wrestling matches, only to become dwarven. Like, let me just read her story.

553
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:36,080
Yeah, my relationship to the dwarf fortress is similar, except that what I read is people's

554
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:45,840
stories of playing dwarf fortress. Like, like, like, like, like, it would be in I mean this in

555
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,160
the old sense, like, like, let's play threads where people like, yes, exactly, type out type.

556
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:56,640
Yeah, type out what happened and screenshot and stuff. I've read some of those. What's the one?

557
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:01,760
What's the one with the skeleton elephants? You know that one? I don't know that one.

558
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:09,680
I feel like it's the one like most famous like dwarf fortress story. And it was like the

559
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:19,680
it was in an evil biome. And these the outside was plagued with skeleton elephants. And at one

560
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:26,560
point, a dwarf went outside on like an excursion and it's an elephant killed the dwarf. And this

561
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,360
dwarf was carrying like some very like, you have like a nice like artifact piece of armor or something

562
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:38,080
or like pants. And like, because of like the waiting algorithm, all the other dwarves immediately

563
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:45,360
knew that these like valuable artifact pants were, you know, ownerless. So they all rushed out like

564
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:51,120
into the wild like rushed for these like artifact pants. And they were all just massacred by these

565
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:56,800
skeleton elephants, they just kept like pouring out and just getting crushed. Yes, exactly what I

566
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:02,640
want to hear. And then like from then on, like whenever the dwarves carved like artifact chairs

567
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,560
and tables, they would carve like images of dwarves being crushed by elephants. It's just like

568
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,080
the worst thing that ever happened to them. It's like, where were you on the day of like elephant

569
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:23,600
gate or whatever? Right. Very good. That was that one's a riot. Yeah. It's skill. There's a skill

570
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:29,280
that you have to have. And if you play a good game of dwarf fortress, some funny shit happens.

571
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,640
But then, you know, to tell it in a compelling way to make it a funny story to read, you know,

572
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:41,760
there's a, oh, there's, um, there's a YouTuber called Krugsmash. Have you seen him? Not familiar

573
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,440
now. Krugsmash basically does that he he runs these fortresses and he makes videos sort of

574
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,640
sort of summarizing and explaining like how the fortress is going and like what happened.

575
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,480
Oh, there's a great and he does his own art too. Like he draws scenes from it and he'll show them

576
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:04,800
on screen like while he's describing them. He has a great series called monster killer. Monster

577
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,520
killer. I won't say, I'm not going to say what happens because it would be a spoiler, but the

578
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:16,720
fortress monster killer has a real arc to it. It has dramatic, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, what's the word?

579
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,600
Irony something I was going to say, like build up and pay off.

580
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,920
Okay. There is dramatic irony. Yes. It's got like elements are built up and then they pay off in

581
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:34,400
the end. Mwah. Mwah. That's a, that's a good one. Excellent. I played, um, not to go, not to go on

582
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,640
and on about dwarf fortress, but I will say I had one game that I played where, uh, a guy got killed,

583
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,400
like I think like a were lizard attack and the guy got killed and I had built these tombs

584
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:48,160
and a guy got killed out there and I saw this other dwarf kept running

585
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:53,280
from where his body was to the tombs, from where his body was to the tombs. And I was like,

586
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,760
what is this guy doing? And I looked at his relationship and it turns out that this dwarf

587
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:03,840
that was running was a friend of the guy who was killed outside. And what he was doing was he was

588
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,160
going, the guy had been like crushed by like a hammer to the head or something. And it had

589
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,680
shattered his head and sent his teeth flying. And this guy kept going out, finding one of his

590
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,680
teeth, bringing it into the, into the tomb and putting it in the coffin, going out, finding

591
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:23,200
another tooth, bringing it back and putting it in the coffin. Yeah. Yeah, I know, right? I hope

592
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:31,920
someone does that for me. And inevitable teeth related accident when I'm eventually bludgeoned

593
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,880
to death by a were lizard. Yeah, yeah. Well, I hope, I hope that my friends go out with a bucket

594
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,680
and like scoop up a bucket of my slime, bring it to my coffin, pour it in, go out, scoop up another

595
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:53,280
bucket, bring it out, pour it in. Oh boy. Well, I don't know, we've been going for an hour. Either

596
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:59,200
of you, I don't want to want to raise any objections, any grievances, or anything else you want to talk

597
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:06,560
about on this episode of the Procrastinators podcast. This has been real fun. It's been great

598
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:14,720
having you on. I was, I was, I was actually pretty taken aback when Jim Storm dancer himself

599
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,520
got back to me like, yeah, Cheryl, been your podcast. It's like, whoa, shit. Oh, shit. I didn't

600
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,080
think you'd say yes. What do we do? Everybody, everybody clean up, look presentable, look professional.

601
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:34,800
That's me. I'm always getting on podcasts. Do you do it often? Do you make appearances?

602
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:40,560
You know, I was expecting to get a bunch of podcast invitations after I shipped the CapDLC.

603
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:49,280
Nothing. You're the first. No shit. Holy shit. Wow. Well, fuck that. I know, right? Listen.

604
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,480
I mean, I guess I could have, I could have like sent out a press release or something like

605
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:01,040
Jim Storm dancers looking to be on a podcast. Yeah, maybe. But I mean, live and learn. Yeah.

606
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:07,120
Live and learn. Well, I mean, fuck that. I, I have been putting it off, but I am going to go

607
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:12,400
and get the DLC because I, I'm going to play it. I would encourage our audience to do it too.

608
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,960
Fucking, I just really want my, I really want my frogs to look nice and dapper and it just

609
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,440
sounds like cute and it would really enhance the experience of garden variety vanilla frog

610
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:34,480
fractions one for me. Yeah. In my opinion. Yes. All right, cool. Well, then let's just do,

611
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,800
do you want to, do you want to get it? You want to, you want to escape? You want to open up the

612
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:43,600
latch and let you, let you out? Yeah, I guess I should probably go see how my wife is doing.

613
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:57,360
Sure. Sure. You're a, you're a busy guy. You're a dad. Yep. Very man. Scary. Scary thoughts.

614
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,440
All right. Well, thanks again. A few moments later.

615
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,440
Ellie is all right. Cut all that out. That's fucking horseshit. Yeah. Cut all this. Cut all this.

616
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:17,120
If even one, if even one whisper, no, no, no, no. If even one whisper of this makes it into

617
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:24,640
the podcast, I will destroy you. And then, and then Ellie is our and cut the cut out what we said,

618
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,840
but then leave that part in where I say that if any of this makes into the podcast, I'll kill you

619
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:37,680
and then leave so that they know that they have to get the, the Patreon bonus episodes,

620
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,600
right? Give them a little, just let them know exactly what's at stake.

621
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,080
All right. Voicemails. Okay. Voicemails. You got them up? Oh, shit. I never,

622
01:08:52,080 --> 01:09:00,720
I never remembered to do that. Speakpipe.com. It's already in the thing. All right. I'm here.

623
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:07,680
Wimp. Wimp. All right. Are we ready to go? Which one are we starting on?

624
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:16,720
We are an idea for a PCP fighter. Okay. Right on. Okay. Three, two, one, go.

625
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:23,440
Mugen is a free engine for 2D fighters. It has a big fan community and it's built around being

626
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:28,800
able to easily put your own characters and moves in. It might be a good place to start

627
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:35,920
for like a proof of concept for a PCP fighter. Yes. I mean, I've, I've done Mugen before.

628
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:44,720
I was, I was, I spent like, I don't know how long because I was an idiot kid who didn't really

629
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:52,320
understand what he was doing, trying to figure out how to get like an anime character. I think

630
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:56,800
it was like Zoro from One Piece. I wanted to get Zoro in the Mugen because I couldn't find him.

631
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,960
I tried to make him. I tried to make Sanji, I think actually. I got, I ripped some GBA Sanji

632
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:09,520
sprites from something and I was like working on the hitboxes and it was like, I managed to make

633
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:15,680
him kick and it connected and I was like, oh my God. But it was so powerful. Yeah. But I don't think

634
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:19,680
I ever really finished it because it was like, I don't want to do that for every single animation,

635
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:24,240
every single move. Yeah, fuck it. I'll just download Fat Albert.

636
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:36,560
You know, it's, I mean, it kind of sounds like fun. I was, I was fucking around with,

637
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,080
did I mention I was actually fucking around with some of the VTuber software? I mean,

638
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:48,800
I can see the appeal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can see the appeal of like, you know, oh, yeah,

639
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,160
take these sprites and then, yeah, I could see that it just being like a fun little thing to do.

640
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,480
When they talked about the PCP fighter idea, like, yeah, the first thing that jumped in my head

641
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,720
was like, oh, Mugen, that's kind of like, Mugen is a program that you can make like fighting games

642
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,760
and I have never used it. So I don't actually know how like, how involved it is or anything.

643
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,520
But I've seen like a, you ever watched Salty Bet? No, what's that?

644
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:21,040
Salty Bet is, it is a Twitch stream. I think it is, I think that's mainly what it is. It's a Twitch

645
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:29,440
stream that runs basically just a series of like algorithmically generated matchups of

646
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,880
Mugen characters from like a database. And I mean, you know that like some characters are just like,

647
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:46,720
Oh God, I saw a video recently, or maybe I read an article, I don't remember, but it was about

648
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:55,200
Mugen characters and how like, some of them can be designed to be invincible. But it's not like,

649
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,000
there are like tiers of invincibility. And like, the, the basic like, sure, yeah,

650
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,280
you can make a character that like has no hitbox, or like, you know,

651
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,440
has like an infinite hitbox that hits the whole screen for infinite damages in the blockable,

652
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:14,720
right? Like, yeah, sure, you can do that. And that's an invincible character. But there are like

653
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,360
coding tricks you can introduce into your game, into your character that make it like even more

654
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,160
invincible, like that like, will just like automatically win the match, or will like crash

655
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:31,280
the program or something like that. I yeah, I remember light Yagami has an animation redraws

656
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,880
in his death note. And if he finishes that animation, the other player just dies.

657
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,760
Yeah, but I'm, but I'm talking about, I'm talking, I'm talking about like characters

658
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:45,440
that are essentially viruses that like destroy your computer. Like that's how we crash the game.

659
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,120
Uh, I guess I don't actually understand, I really don't understand like the more technical ones.

660
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,400
But, but anyway, like, yeah, salty bed is basically matchups of sometimes it's

661
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,400
characters like these that are just like, a human could never possibly beat them.

662
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,040
But like, they get matched against each other and they're like, you don't even see what

663
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,960
know what's happening. And like, you can bet on it. I think there's like some kind of like

664
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,640
game currency that you can use to like place bets on like which of these two characters is

665
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:18,160
going to win. And I think it's just runs like constantly like 24 hours a day or a lot of the

666
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,440
time anyway. Yeah, salty bed if if you're ever like, it's good to like put on like a party or

667
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,280
something like if nobody knows what to watch, or like you need some background noise, you can

668
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:33,440
just put on salty bed and you can just be like, Oh, okay. You know, JoJo is fighting Garfield

669
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,480
and like Garfield is like, you know, good summoning like screen clearing like johns and odys that

670
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:43,600
are like pummeling, whatever, like, you know, you'll see some some cool shit like that. And that's

671
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:52,800
salty bed. All right. Yeah, make us a video game. Oh, I didn't tell Jim about the PCP dating

672
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,360
sim. I'm sure he would have been I'm sure he would have been blown away. Oh, well, next time.

673
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:06,400
Maybe next time. One of these days, we might have like, we could we could maybe try to orchestrate

674
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,560
like a super guest episode where we get tons of guests that we've had before. Like people who

675
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:19,040
would never interact normally. Like, like who? Well, like the people are old guests. Yeah, all of

676
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,480
them. Just fucking all of them at the same time. Oh, you can have like a mixer. It's like, Oh,

677
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:34,160
Jim Storm dancer meet aria de mezzo. Oh, cyber shell meet fit MC. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, sure.

678
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:44,480
Why not? So wait, I'm gonna Jim posted his audio. I'm going to give him not one but two thumbs up.

679
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:54,080
There you go. Excellent. Next voicemail is called. Yeah. Three, two, one, go.

680
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:04,480
No, no, November. No, no, November. No, no, November. No, no, November. No, no, November.

681
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:13,200
No, no, November. No, no, November. Yeah. Oh, it's it's not in its N and N for no, no, November.

682
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,520
We're starting. We're starting it boys. It begins.

683
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:26,160
That's what it appears. Everything would be destroyed. I'd be so mad if Nate came on the

684
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:33,840
podcast for any reason. Next one is called. Blaseball greater than greater than greater

685
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:40,080
than greater than greater than endless war. We'll see about that. Three, two, one, go.

686
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,040
Hey guys, I don't know if my last voicemail center not, but I'm just going to send another one

687
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,320
just in case. So like I haven't really watched the PCP in a few months, but that is irrelevant.

688
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,480
I'll catch up like eventually maybe probably, but there's this thing I found that's like really

689
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:59,840
fucking cool and also better than endless war. You might be like, what better than endless war?

690
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,800
That's impossible. Yeah, it's like similar, but better. It's called Blaseball. Imagine like

691
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:10,720
fantasy football, but it's baseball and also like hunger games and just fucking crazy shit happening

692
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,480
all the time. Dude, it's pretty awesome. Right now the game is on like a month long break,

693
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,880
but when it goes on, dude, it fucking goes on. It's so awesome and based and epic

694
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:28,320
Blaseball. This is, this is why like I have heard about Blaseball and I have,

695
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:33,760
I have keep meaning to look into it and I haven't. Same. It's, it's one of those things that's like,

696
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,760
oh, I feel like I've heard of this before, but I haven't. And it's a new thing that people are

697
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:45,600
going like, oh, cool. Yeah. But like, I don't, I don't, I don't really understand it out of

698
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,160
descriptions, like have not have failed to really clue me into like what it is. Oh, it's just good.

699
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,120
Man, it's just good. It's like crazy, crazy shit happens. Like,

700
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,840
is it a, I mean, people have, people have compared it to endless war. So I'm like,

701
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:06,720
is it a, is it an MUD? Is it an RPG? Is it text based? It's, let's Google it right now. But people

702
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,280
say that it's like fantasy football. And to be honest, I don't really even understand what fantasy

703
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:17,040
football is. Like the only, isn't the only thing you do in fantasy football, just like pick your

704
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:24,880
team and that's it. Right. Blaseball play now. I got to sign up. Fuck this. Yeah. That's what I got

705
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:30,800
to the homepage. I was like, I don't want to make an account. Fuck this. Wait. Blaseball is an online

706
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,400
browser baseball simulation horror game developed by the game band. Horror game.

707
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:48,000
Excuse me? Sploric magazine. Well, you collect, hang on. Here's polygon.com. I'm just going to

708
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,400
quickly, what is Blaseball? Blaseball is a fantasy baseball game. You can play online. You collect

709
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,760
coins by betting on games and use the coins at the end of each week to vote for decrees and

710
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:04,720
blessings that will change the game the next week. Okay. So like everybody, but it's like a

711
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,520
community thing, right? Like changing the way the game will play. And then they all watch,

712
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:17,520
I guess. I heard it compared Subway to like D&D in that like the game, the game masters are

713
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:24,000
basically like running like a campaign almost, but like it's sort of like behind like they're like,

714
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:30,560
they're doing something like they're reacting to the community in some way. And I don't really

715
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,800
know how because I don't understand how the game works. Yeah. I'm curious if this guy just said

716
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,200
it was better than Endless War because Endless War is a thing that the PCP has created.

717
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:45,680
And it's just a game and it's better than this game. Or if it's a similar type of game, that's

718
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:50,640
what I'm wondering. It sounds to me like it's similar in that it is largely like community

719
01:18:50,640 --> 01:19:04,400
engagement driven. You know, it sounds like it sounds like, yeah, like in the same way that like,

720
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:13,200
I don't know, maybe there'll be a contest and someone will make an entry that's popular and

721
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:18,640
maybe a dev will decide to like, okay, introduce a, you know, a mechanic that is, you know, based on

722
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:24,960
that thing, which is a thing that's happened in Endless War, you know, maybe, I don't know. I

723
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,160
can't even speculate on what would happen in baseball without having any knowledge of the game.

724
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:38,320
But like, I don't know, maybe, oh, a team wins that no one expected to win. And the devs say,

725
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:45,520
oh, a ghost appears now. A ghost appears. Now there's a ghost, guys. There's a fucking ghost in

726
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,840
the baseball. Dude, that's just like Endless War. And the ghost becomes the coach.

727
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:04,560
It's exactly like it. Only better. People like saying, oh, I'm going to vote for the air strike

728
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:10,880
to destroy the training fields for this team so they can't practice. And it accidentally kills

729
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,560
all of the team. And now they're all ghosts. Oh, I didn't mean to do that. Oh, shit. Oh,

730
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:23,680
but this is good, actually. Oh, I'm glad that it happened, you say, to the machine in text format.

731
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:30,000
I should probably look more into baseball. I keep hearing people talking about baseball.

732
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,920
Probably shouldn't be a fucking idiot who doesn't understand anything.

733
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,760
No, that's fine. Being an idiot is good.

734
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:42,880
Yeah, you're right. Okay, next, next voicemail is called Timmy return and update,

735
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:50,640
parentheses, guy who all other voicemailers hate. Oh, it's a minute and a half. Fuck you, Timmy.

736
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:58,880
Three, two, one, go. Yo, it's me, Timmy back. God, I fucking hate this guy.

737
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:07,120
For a few months, I haven't watched the procrastinators podcast. I sent that last

738
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:15,760
voicemail about baseball. Any voicemail since like, I don't know, mid August, all of September.

739
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,480
I have not sent any voicemails in September. I know that for a fact. And all of October until

740
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:28,000
like this point. So anyone vaguely sounding like me is not me because all of the people

741
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,680
God, I hate it when voicemailers get all protective about their identity.

742
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:39,520
So I get why it's hard to tell when it's tiny, Timmy, or when it's not Timmy, you are, you're

743
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:48,320
a nothing submission. Okay, man, I am, I'm not afraid of any of you. Okay, Timmy for voice jail.

744
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,960
Timmy for voice jail. He's in it. No, I'll send him to the fucking gulag. All right.

745
01:21:55,680 --> 01:22:00,480
Bang, bang, bang, bang the gavel. No more. It's over. It's over. Goodbye, Timmy. Take him away,

746
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:09,440
boys. Get him in there. Yeah, fucking, we got an empty cell. You know, exactly what to do with you.

747
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:18,160
Feels good. Feels good. Yeah, Timmy return an update. Like, was that just an update?

748
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,360
It's just to let you know that Timmy is back.

749
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:29,920
Like no content, just an update. It's just, it's like an update video. It's so annoying.

750
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,680
Hey guys, no, it's literally, hey guys, sorry I haven't made a voicemail in a while.

751
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,280
That's literally what it is.

752
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,000
I'm gonna die.

753
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,880
Oh, good times.

754
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:59,840
Next voicemail is called, oh fuck you, Timmy. Next voicemail is called Why Ben Why.

755
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:08,160
I hope this is Timmy saying why did you send me to voice jail. Okay, three, two, one, go.

756
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:15,040
Ben, your arguments in favor of circumcision are junk signs that have been debunked for at

757
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:22,640
least a decade and a half, probably much longer than that. The quote unquote health benefits

758
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:33,760
to circumcision are not. Basically, the hygienic thing about it is easily prevented by just

759
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:43,520
washing your fucking dick like any sensible person would do. And the prevention of the spread of

760
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:55,920
SCDs is a minuscule amount that is far surpassed by the much more common and widely society already

761
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:05,200
adopted practice of wearing a fucking condom. So in closing, don't push for circumcision because

762
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:15,280
all of the quote unquote benefits of it are not. They're up. And it is a moral wrong to do it because

763
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:26,720
you're not gaining anything. Okay, listen. The awkward thing here is that there's a period

764
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:34,480
of, there's a period of like five days between like the episode, like we record and the episode

765
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,640
comes out, we're in like, we've already answered questions, but the audience hasn't heard us answer

766
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,040
the questions. So sometimes we'll get a voicemail about the same thing two weeks in a row because

767
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:48,080
it fell in that period. It's unfortunate. I already answered this last weekend, but I'll say it again.

768
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:53,520
My argument is not, we should ban, we should circumcise because these things, I was merely

769
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,160
saying that if the data suggests that these benefits occur, they're worth considering and

770
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:02,320
weighing against the negatives of circumcision, which really seemed to be pretty minuscule as

771
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:07,200
well. You say the benefits are minuscule, well seems like the downsides are minuscule and that's

772
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:13,840
fine. The other thing, if it's junk science, then so be it. I just need to be convinced that it's

773
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,800
junk science and maybe it, I don't know, maybe it is. And then the other thing, okay, I hate this,

774
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:24,160
I hate this argument that like, well, yeah, it doesn't matter that it's more hygienic because

775
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:28,800
all you have to do is wash your dick. Well, like, sure. Okay, sure. It's fine for you to,

776
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:37,200
I don't know. I don't know, man. I almost feel like, sorry if this is like too, sorry if this is

777
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:43,680
like too, if this is sort of like God winning the argument a little bit, but I almost feel like

778
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:48,960
that's the same argument as saying like, well, it shouldn't matter if the police are racist,

779
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,720
because like, if the, if black people just didn't commit crimes, all they have to do is not commit

780
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,280
crime and then we'll get arrested. It's like, it's sort of missing the point. Like, it kind of

781
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,440
doesn't matter. Like, oh, you could prevent, you could prevent hygienic issues if you just

782
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:06,400
wash your dick. Well, no shit, right? But like, it kind of doesn't matter. Cause like,

783
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,400
I would be more interested in just, in looking at a, at like data, like, all right,

784
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:16,560
if everybody perfectly washed their dick all the time, then there would be no hygienic issues.

785
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,480
Yeah. Theoretically, the issues of like infection of one's dick should be zero,

786
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:25,520
but guess what? It's not, it's going to happen. So in a population that is circumcised are the

787
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,520
levels of those things higher or lower. That's all I would need to, that's all I would want to know.

788
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,520
Like, I'm concerned about the data, not the like, oh, well it doesn't, the data doesn't

789
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,440
matter because everyone just needs to do X. They're not going to do X. They never do.

790
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:49,040
Fuck you, voicemail. Yeah, whatever. I've set my piece on this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

791
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,560
Cool. Next one up. Billy the Bard, 11th, 3, 2, 1, go.

792
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:26,160
Fuck you. Fuck you. Because he's, because he's dead.

793
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,200
This son of tears of pain will never dry.

794
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:42,960
Very nice. Very nice. Very nice. Uh, you know, uh, that samurai, dang.

795
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,480
Can't believe, can't believe someone would betray him and make him commit sepaku like that.

796
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,160
Like, that's so fucked up. But what are you going to do? You know, human nature, I guess,

797
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:00,960
or something. It's just, damn. If only there could have been another way.

798
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:08,960
But we don't live in a perfect world. It's good to remember. Never forget. Never forget samurai

799
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,560
son. There's a, in the sky behind me, there's like a cloud and it looks like him and he's

800
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,480
giving the thumbs up. It's like, he's, you know, he's giving the finger. He's giving me the finger.

801
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:25,040
Like, fuck you, Beno santo son. Goodbye, Ogozaimasu. Goodbye, Ogozaimasu.

802
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:38,320
Oh, yes. Good. Good. Next one. Logo is sentimental. Otherwise, upgrade it, y'all. Artists, come on. Oh,

803
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:43,680
I bet I know what this is about. It's probably about the fact that our logo is TPC. I was looking,

804
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:47,280
I was thinking the exact same thing this week. I was looking at the logo. It's like, why don't

805
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:55,600
we just change it to be PCP? It's stupid. Nobody calls it TPC. That's all right. Yeah. Is this only

806
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:01,520
zero seconds long? Yeah, it's just the sound of a click. Okay. Well, like, it doesn't matter.

807
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:08,640
Because yeah, I agree. We should change the logo. It should say PCP. We're called the PCB,

808
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:13,600
where the progress news podcast. We should have done it years ago, Lamal. We're stupid. That's why.

809
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:23,440
Yeah. No, no, it's really just because I don't, I don't know how it would, like,

810
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:31,200
we have to Photoshop it. And I don't have the file. I don't think I was like, do we want it to,

811
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:37,120
like, this would be an opportunity to revamp the logo entirely, not change the letter. But

812
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,920
I don't know what it, I don't, that's a lot of work. It's true. Yeah, because we don't have,

813
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:48,080
like, Davoo's original file to edit or whatever. I mean, we could, I could edit it well enough

814
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,800
that it would essentially just be the same logo, but with the, like, I could do it. On the other

815
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,400
hand, I mean, I've been thinking of, like, changing the banner and changing it, because, like, we've

816
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:02,080
undeniably entered a new era. You know, the cast has rotated. I was thinking, I was thinking of

817
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:09,360
doing some branding changes anyway. Just because why not? It's not exactly the same show as it used

818
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:15,840
to be. No. It's the new, it's, you know, the bold new PCP for the, for a bold new future,

819
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:25,040
bold new era. I don't know, just something I was thinking about. Next up, harassed porn artist.

820
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:31,200
Three, two, one, go. So despite what you might think and the attitude around it,

821
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,800
like, people actually believe in, like, the real, no, not November thing,

822
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,720
are actually trying to, like, stop all porn. Thoughts?

823
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:46,640
Um, what does he mean by the, despite what you might think with the attitude around it?

824
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,920
I don't know, I don't know exactly what that means.

825
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:56,160
I think it's, it's just like, despite what you may believe, people actually think no,

826
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:01,760
November is important and not just a funny joke that you can try if you feel like,

827
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:11,040
like, like not, not nothing is, is, is not a, like, nothing in November. It's not a crime.

828
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:17,360
And like, I don't, I guess people feel like, I've not, I've not heard any of this,

829
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:22,160
like people trying to stop porn. I mean, I know that there are people that believe in,

830
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:29,280
like, the nofap lifestyle. Right. And I guess I think, like, that's, if you want to do that,

831
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,880
and like, maybe you think you're happier not doing it, makes you more productive or whatever,

832
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,920
then like, yeah, sure. You know, as, as with everything, I draw the line, like, well, you

833
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,760
know, who are you, who are you to say other people can't do it? Who are you to say people

834
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:49,360
shouldn't make porn? I mean, from the name of this voicemail, I assume this is a guy who makes porn

835
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,120
or girl or makes porn of someone who has been harassed because they are a porn artist. I can,

836
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:00,160
I can definitely see that happening on Twitter or something. Nofap people are fucking,

837
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,680
you know, despite, I don't know, I just said they're fine. I'm sure a lot of them are a lot,

838
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:12,640
by and large, they seem like some real degenerates. They seem like freaks, honestly.

839
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,880
I mean, I would assume, like, religious, like it comes from a religious place.

840
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:25,120
Yeah, like, like, Ruth V, I think, is a, is a nofaper, and he's fucking terrible.

841
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:34,400
It's, yeah, it's these, yeah, it's a very like, um, yeah, very like conservative. Nofap before marriage.

842
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:41,920
Yeah, it's people that are like, it's people that are like, people that are like, like,

843
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,640
I don't know, like post-Christian, like, like weird traditionalists. I don't know.

844
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:53,760
It doesn't seem like a, again, like whatever, I'm sure people do it for all kinds of reasons,

845
01:32:53,760 --> 01:33:02,400
but like, the community, the community seems bad. I've heard, um, examples of people who are like,

846
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:08,720
um, I do the nofap because when I finally do fap afterwards, it feels like so much better, dude.

847
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:14,960
So much calm. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, my balls just span to unbelievable sizes and I can't

848
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:21,760
move. And then I just let it all out all over my room. And it's like, okay, you know, if you want to

849
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:28,640
do that, that's all right. That's pretty good. The people who are like, the people who are like,

850
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:34,800
porn is bad. I don't really come across them. Um, not really come across porn artists getting

851
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:41,360
harassed, but I guess it would be through DMs. So I don't know. Yeah. But all this makes me want to

852
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,880
do is to draw more porn. I need to get back to doing that.

853
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:53,840
Yeah, fuck yeah. Not in November. Not November. Not November. Yeah, if you want.

854
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,720
Oh, wait, this is the start of find purpose November. Remember?

855
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,720
The first loser find purpose November. Who is going to be who is going to be the first loser

856
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,680
of find purpose November and then buy the shirt?

857
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,920
Wait, do we have a shirt? Yeah, we have. Yeah, I made the shirt as soon as we did that episode.

858
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:20,240
Oh, I had never seen it. No, you didn't. It's got a nice like font and stuff.

859
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:27,280
Eleazar show the shirt. Wait, I'm gonna. Yeah, get a link. I do really like the whole,

860
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,920
you know, the idea that of the of the silly things traditions we have created find purpose

861
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,600
November is a really funny one. That's actually nice. We

862
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:47,520
how do you how do you lose it? How do you lose the challenge to find purpose?

863
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:53,120
I put in the general, I probably should have put it in editor links, but

864
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:59,840
Oh, first of all, it's a shirt specifically about losing find purpose November. It's like,

865
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:08,160
hey, guys, I was the first loser of find purpose November available only available only on a fucking

866
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:14,080
teespring.com slash stores slash the procrastinators with dashes,

867
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:21,120
like the dash pro dash procrastinators. That's our storefront. Okay, mystery solved. That's where

868
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:31,360
you get that. But, you know, this this November, either here's what you do either at the end of

869
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:36,480
November, you call in and tell us how you found purpose, or you buy the shirt.

870
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,200
That's those are your those are your two options. Yes.

871
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:50,160
Um, next one. Oh my god, this one's going to be this is exciting. This next one is called

872
01:35:50,800 --> 01:36:01,440
Biden as a by e d o n versus drum. So that's that's going to be good. All right, three, two, one, go.

873
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:08,320
So since you guys record this on Sunday, and it usually comes out on Friday, by the time this

874
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:15,200
episode you're recording right now is going to come out, the election might be over and someone

875
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:21,600
would have won. So who do you think is going to win guys? Oh, God, when when does the election

876
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:30,160
happen? Also, should we do a heckles for shackles during it? Oh my god. We could. Do you want to?

877
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:36,080
I mean, I wouldn't mind. I was might be fun. I mean, I was thinking about something I've had before.

878
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:41,520
Yeah. You know what? I'm down. I'm down for it.

879
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:50,640
I was like, I rattled around the idea of like, doing a stream of my own, you know, because I

880
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,280
I used to stream like month. Oh, God, it's been so long since I streamed. I didn't mean to not do

881
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:00,240
it for this long. But um, yeah, I used to do I was thinking like, Oh, should I stream during the

882
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:04,560
election? Like other people, other streamers are going to be doing a stream during the election.

883
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,360
But I don't know. I thought I think I thought it would just be stressful and I wouldn't enjoy it

884
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:16,000
very much. So I wasn't going to. But as a shackles for heckles thing, I think it could be fun. So

885
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,280
I don't know. Maybe by the time you're listening to this, that will have all already happened.

886
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:27,200
Perhaps. Yeah. So did this guy ask who do we think is going to win? Yeah.

887
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:32,720
Yeah. What do you think, Ben? I mean, I might my my one is of

888
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:39,120
general pessimism, because people saying Biden's ahead in the polls, which is exactly what was

889
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:45,280
happening with Hillary. And there's this, there's the there's a precedent for like Trump voters to

890
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:50,240
not say openly that they are Trump supporters, because they get, you know, like yell that.

891
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:54,880
So like, I'll just wait. Yeah, I'll wait until I'm in the polling booth. And then it'll turn out

892
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:00,400
that Trump has won by the same margin. I would I would assume just just enough.

893
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:09,680
It well. Yeah, I mean, it's not impossible. I will say I have looked at the numbers. I have

894
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:19,440
heard analysis. Biden is I mean, according to polls, Biden is ahead by much by significantly

895
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:28,080
more than Clinton was. And like, yes, the polls did the polls did over indicate Clinton support.

896
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:34,080
If polls this time overestimated Biden support by the same amount, Biden would still comfortably

897
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:42,720
win. I am more concerned. I think that it is very likely. I mean, Biden is basically guaranteed

898
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:48,640
to win the popular vote by the the polls all indicate that even given a pretty significant

899
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:56,160
margin of error, Biden is going to win the Electoral College too. It is nevertheless

900
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:04,080
possible that given that like, you know, Trump does overperform relative to polls like he did

901
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:09,600
in 2016, maybe there's some maybe the the amount would be even greater because of like these so

902
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:17,760
called shy Trump voters, maybe and then like on top of it, like Trump doing some shenanigans with

903
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:23,840
the like, because you know, early voting and like mail in voting, you know, the Republicans

904
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:30,640
really, really want they are doing everything in their power to like disqualify polls or ballots

905
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:37,280
that were sent on time but arrived late. Like if you sent it before the third, but it doesn't arrive

906
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:43,200
until you know, after that, they they really want to like, get fucking judicial ruling saying like,

907
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:48,640
no, these aren't allowed. And I mean, which is like not right, but they want to do it anyway.

908
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:57,200
And it's possible that some chicanery like that could maybe tilt it enough that maybe Trump would

909
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:04,240
steal it. Or even if it doesn't technically that like there's enough uncertainty introduced that

910
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:10,320
Trump can just kind of declare victory. And because like the public is not entirely clear on the

911
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:15,680
situation, they would just accept it, which is basically what happened with with Gore and Bush.

912
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:22,560
I could imagine like, Oh, there's we're not sure. So it's like, and he Trump would be like,

913
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:28,000
they tampered with it, not really specifying who just saying, you know, it's it's a it's a fake

914
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:35,120
election. Yeah, he's been saying that he's been priming people for that idea, like, all year.

915
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:41,600
He keeps he keeps questioning like the validity of mail in ballots and stuff. And it's all it's all

916
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:51,760
it's all a production. The numbers just don't bear it out. But, you know, this is this is the

917
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,560
idea introduce and introduce enough uncertainty into the election and into the validity of

918
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:04,080
votes that you can just kind of like waffle enough you have enough leeway to be like,

919
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:09,520
you know, I think I kind of win actually. And then, you know, stack the Supreme Court with

920
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:14,480
justices that will rule in your favor, which is what just happened with Amy Coney Barrett.

921
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:20,960
And, you know, get yourself appointed fucking another one, even though you didn't win. So

922
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:26,800
will Trump win? I sincerely doubt it. Will Trump like legislate himself into a coup?

923
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,320
I think that's much more likely. I think that's much more likely. And I'm concerned.

924
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:40,560
Hopefully. I mean, hopefully this is all sounds like fear mongering in the near future. And it

925
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:46,400
doesn't actually happen. And I just sound silly. Many people are saying this, though. I'm not I'm

926
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:54,320
not the only one speculating about this sort of thing happening. His rhetoric supports that this

927
01:41:54,320 --> 01:42:01,280
is the plan. I guess you the viewer will already know if you put a gun to my head.

928
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:08,320
And you said what's going to happen? I would say, I think probably Biden will just win and Trump

929
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:14,320
will leave. But I'm not like super confident that that's what's going to happen. But I think that's

930
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:21,200
more likely than any other outcome. So fingers crossed, I guess, fingers crossed.

931
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:29,920
Ah, next voicemail is called Socialist Shinobi. Three, two, one, go.

932
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:36,960
I'm waiting for it.

933
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,400
There it is.

934
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:48,960
Oh, God.

935
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,840
Thank you. Many people are saying the proposition.

936
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,040
Oh, no, does he not know that he's dead?

937
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:26,480
Socialist samurai, of course, has any good socialists knows all must do their part to help

938
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:33,280
the community prosper. This is why I ask you to share resources with me in return. I would only

939
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:40,240
ask for the Kawasaki clan scroll. I think it is a most fair trade. I have an answer.

940
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:45,760
Please consider my offer honourable Ben St. Tsang. Socialist samurai. And until next time.

941
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,160
Oh, that's his fit.

942
01:43:54,400 --> 01:44:00,800
Let's hear it. Yo, I love it. Every time, every gets me every time. Socialist samurai,

943
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:06,000
this is proof that socialism just doesn't work, because clearly your publicly funded

944
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:14,320
postal service failed to deliver to you the parcel, the letter, the postage informing you

945
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:22,800
of Samurai Sama's recent seppuku. He got the scroll. I'm afraid you're going to have to dig

946
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,240
the scroll up from his cold grave, sir.

947
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:36,080
Nerd fucking nerd fucking commies, commie bitch.

948
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,880
Hey, thanks. Thanks. You know what? Thanks for the offer, though. Thanks. Thanks for the offer.

949
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:54,960
Next voicemail is from Liam. Three, two, one, go.

950
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:04,640
Hello. Am I going? Okay, this is nice. I was on earlier. A long time ago, you probably won't

951
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:10,320
remember. I was very tired and I was saying very dumb things. You made a joke about it being the

952
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:18,720
worst voice call you'd ever heard. Ben, I believe? Probably. Anywho, hello. My name is Liam. I'm

953
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:28,400
making a funny cool comic. Ben, I'm surprised you made it as far as you did. I find it difficult

954
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:36,240
to make a comic instead of just making normal art. I do thoroughly enjoy what's it called,

955
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:43,600
the vapors. I do enjoy that. Good aesthetic is good for you. And it's depressing and funny,

956
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:48,320
you know, in a quaint way. My brain is too small to really compliment it beyond that.

957
01:45:49,040 --> 01:46:00,000
I'm sorry. It's terrible. I guess that's all. Also, I have been liking the newer episodes.

958
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:06,880
I really liked the one with the sheriff lady. She's really cool, I guess. I think that was really

959
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:16,080
cool. Chow. Chow. That was a phone call. That was a message. That was a voice. That was a literal

960
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:23,440
as a phone message. I think it's interesting that you say that you, I think a lot of people

961
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:28,240
feel like this, that it's easier to just like draw a picture than it is to draw a comic.

962
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:34,400
It's easier to draw a comic because when I'm drawing a picture, I'm like, I don't know why

963
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:40,160
they would be here or what they're doing. I need context. I need context for them to have a pose.

964
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,760
I feel a little similarly. Yeah, yeah. When you're drawing a comic, like, you know, the moment to

965
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,600
moment, like what you're seeing is, yeah, it's motivated. Like, you know what just happened,

966
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:57,280
and then you're like, okay, what happens next? Oh, it's this. So yeah, in that sense, I agree. But

967
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:04,320
also, in terms of like, because I assume it's a matter of motivation, right? It's like, I feel

968
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:10,080
less motivated to just draw like a single image, because it's like, I don't know, I feel like,

969
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:17,120
I feel like what's the point? I don't know what I, I don't, it would be hard. It's hard for me to,

970
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:23,920
to imagine like, or not to imagine, but to like, I don't know, I think about this like, man,

971
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:30,240
artists on the internet, they'll just like, draw something that like, looks good. And then just

972
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,840
like, post it. Yeah, just because it just because it looks good. And I'm like,

973
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:43,200
then they sell, they sell stickers of it, and, and posters, and, and for me, I'm like,

974
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:47,360
if I'm doing that, I'm like, sure, I mean, I guess I could try to like, draw something that looks

975
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:53,520
good. But like, who cares if it looks good? Like, what's, what does it matter? You know?

976
01:47:54,400 --> 01:48:03,520
I, I feel, yeah, I know what you mean. It's, it's, it's like, what, to what end as this picture,

977
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:08,160
like, what, what is purpose does this picture serve? The picture has to have, whatever it is,

978
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:12,400
it has to have narrative stakes. There has, there has to be some kind of narrative to it. Like,

979
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:17,840
um, when I, I guess an exception would be like, after I did the Nuzlocke Conquest, I drew the

980
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:24,160
picture of like, you know, my remaining Pokemon, like on the throne of Alola or whatever. That

981
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:28,480
was like, okay, I mean, that's, that's just me drawing a picture, but like, I'm drawing it because

982
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:33,120
it is like a narrative continuation of the, the video. It's a narrative climax. It's a, it's an

983
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:40,000
ethalogue or something. Yeah, exactly. That's, it's part of a story. Comics, drawing a comic sort

984
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,760
of has that inherently. And I think that makes it easier, at least for me to be motivated to want

985
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:51,600
to make one. I mean, technically it's harder because like, there's more drawing involved in a comic

986
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:58,640
technically. Uh, but yeah. Oh, that's how I feel about that. Like single images that like,

987
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,800
the, the bar needs to be a lot, is a, is a lot higher for a single image if you're just drawing

988
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:12,400
illustrations of stuff. When it comes to like, porn, for example, um, it's, it, you can't really get

989
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:18,560
away with having shit art if it's just a single image. Yeah. In a comic, you can get away with all

990
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:23,680
kinds of horseshit. You can get away with it. Most of your, most of your art can just be bad.

991
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:27,760
Most of your art can suck as long as the, the progression of something is like interesting

992
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:32,880
in whatever way it is. It's the story that gets people. I think that the whole thing with images

993
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:38,080
is that they imply a story that people will be like, Oh yeah. You know, like a, you know,

994
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:43,120
beautiful landscape photograph makes you think of like places you've been that are like that.

995
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:47,280
And so there's sort of an implicit story, like inherit in the beauty of the image.

996
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:53,200
Yeah. And if you don't have all that beauty, you need to, to start at point A and end up point B.

997
01:49:53,680 --> 01:50:04,400
There's um, you know, there's a, there's a thing. Some, some people, some people are artists and

998
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:10,800
they just have OCs and all they do is they just draw, they just draw their OCs. Like sometimes

999
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:15,760
they'll be doing something or wearing something or maybe interacting with some of their other OCs or

1000
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:21,920
whatever, you know, but it's just images and there's like no actual story to it. Well, I think

1001
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:30,640
there is. They draw, I know people like that. They have like a long list of traits that the

1002
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:35,040
character has and the things they would say and do the likes and dislikes and backstory.

1003
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:42,080
Well, usually. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the, I mean, the backstory stuff is like,

1004
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:50,000
sure. I mean, I don't know if that really counts. I mean, I think that, I think that images do imply

1005
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,840
a story in a way like, I don't know, you can, you can get an idea of who this character is by like

1006
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:03,680
the images. But well, I guess I think it's, it's a mixed bag is what I was going to say was like,

1007
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:08,480
I think on the one hand, a lot of these people probably think about like, oh, I have these OCs.

1008
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:12,880
I would love to make a comic about them someday, but oh, that's so hard or whatever. Like, oh,

1009
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:18,640
there'd be so much work or I don't have time. And like, and I think a lot of them probably think,

1010
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:22,880
or I think a lot of people might think that like, okay, a comic or a cartoon would be like

1011
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:29,360
the ultimate expression of these characters, like that's what they should be for. But I also think

1012
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:36,800
that maybe some characters might, there might not need to be any more to them than just what

1013
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:42,080
they look like, or even just like the character traits suggested by these like snapshots, like

1014
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:49,520
maybe that's the appeal, maybe, maybe they can feel it on their own. Yeah, it depends on the

1015
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:53,200
character and depends on the artist, I think, but I don't think there's anything like wrong with that

1016
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:59,840
either. So like, I don't know, I mean, it's not everything I'm doing that's not everything,

1017
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:08,240
not everything needs to be a comic, I guess, you know, not every character needs to be elaborated upon.

1018
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:13,680
But they, but they can be. And that's also nice.

1019
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:20,720
Liam sent another voicemail that's nine seconds long. Let's let's see what that's about. Three,

1020
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:28,960
two, one, go. Oh, also, I did want to say thank you for the brick and RCQ. That was very funny.

1021
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:32,560
Oh, it's that Liam.

1022
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:42,800
Huh? I don't know. I was, oh, okay. I know this guy, this guy, he's an art, he's a fucking rowdy.

1023
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:52,080
He, I was, I was giving a princeps rewards from the contest or from the last two contests,

1024
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:56,480
I think, the other day. And I was giving out, you know, I was making them and I was typing

1025
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:01,440
them up and I was handing them out to the people that won them. And Liam was there and he was just

1026
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:08,240
like, conjure a brick, because I kept like conjuring these items out of text commands.

1027
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:13,440
And so I just created a new princep forum that was called a brick and its description was a brick.

1028
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:19,840
And I gave to him. And now he has this like, fairly powerful, like you'd like game like

1029
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:26,080
world unique item, which no one else has anything else. No one else has the same item. And it's,

1030
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:32,880
it's just a brick and he's got it. And Kip, another player was like, I want the brick. Oh, I could,

1031
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:38,000
I could max my stats with that brick. And I was like, sorry, buddy. There's only one.

1032
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:45,440
That's fun. It was very funny. Like the, the rarity thing. If there's only one of something,

1033
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:51,040
doesn't matter what it is, people want it. Jim Stormdancer would have been fully sold,

1034
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:54,160
even more sold on Endless War, if I'd told him that it had a brick in it.

1035
01:53:54,720 --> 01:54:01,200
That would have been. It had a the brick or a brick. It had a brick. Yeah. Yeah.

1036
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:10,240
Next one is called fuck Margar. And I think we can all agree with that. Three, two, one, go.

1037
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:15,680
Hey guys, fuck Dibuster here. As one of the few remaining members of voice jail,

1038
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,280
I just want to say that my cellmate Margar is really getting on my nerves with all these

1039
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:24,240
voicemails he's sending in while I'm trying to sleep. Once the voice jail is fully defunded,

1040
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:29,120
I was wondering if we could open up a privately owned voice maximum security prison just for him.

1041
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:35,600
Thanks for considering. Man, really feeling that gap between recording and releasing

1042
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:41,680
right now. This guy, this guy must not have known at the time. Margar is fucking dead.

1043
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:49,920
Wait, what was he asking for? Maximum security prison, PC maximum security prison.

1044
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:57,680
For Margar? Yeah. Well, I guess we should send Timmy there instead,

1045
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:03,040
in his place, because somebody's got to go. Yeah, we can't build a jail and not put anybody in it.

1046
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:08,880
Yeah. So we'll send Timmy to solitary confinement. We'll lock him up. We'll

1047
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:18,720
straightjack him, put him in a dank hole. Just for you, buddy. A fuck Dibuster. Dab.

1048
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:29,920
Next up is Agent E. Three, two, one, go. Hi. This message is with Ben. I asked that you destroy

1049
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:37,920
this message after listening, but we both know that you will not do that. I am Agent E. That is

1050
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:44,160
all that I can tell you now. Currently, I am in possession of two things that I think that you

1051
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:52,880
might desire, Ben. One of which is the Necronomicon, and the other is the lifeless corpse of SummerEye

1052
01:55:52,880 --> 01:56:02,480
Summer. Also, Mr. T is here. Yo, Ben, you damn fool. I ain't no one old gag from episode 225.

1053
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:06,000
I was in on this scheme the whole dang time.

1054
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:15,360
Do you see it, Ben? Your downfall is near. You might have survived phase one,

1055
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:22,720
but did you really think that the death of your supposed sensei would be the end? Ben,

1056
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:30,560
you never had a SummerEye master. They were memories that our organization implanted in your

1057
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:38,400
mind, and now, Ben, phase two begins. But until next time, sayonara.

1058
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,640
This is like your sonichu and this guy's Christian drawing your life.

1059
01:56:53,200 --> 01:57:00,640
But I'm like their sonichu and they're my Christian. They're creating my story.

1060
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:05,120
This is my story and nothing less.

1061
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:17,440
I don't know what the E stands for. What did I do? What did I do to deserve this? This hell.

1062
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:24,560
I can't believe the government, or whatever shadow organization,

1063
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:30,000
was using their freaking schizophrenia machine to send me voices in my head of the SummerEye.

1064
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,760
Why could I hear them as well? Am I a figment of your imagination?

1065
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:40,240
I mean, maybe they just widened the signal beam a little bit and just got us all a little bit.

1066
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:43,840
Just sent it through all the pipes. It's easy.

1067
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:54,080
They have resources. Well, listen, the necronomicon, I would like it.

1068
01:57:54,080 --> 01:58:02,080
Hey, actually, socialist shinobi. Can we work out a deal with this? Give me that.

1069
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:09,600
Do a slice, do an aeido slice, and cut Agent E's arm off with the necronomicon in it so it

1070
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:14,240
drops and I like catch it and I go, yeah, thumbs up. That'd be pretty nice. That'd be pretty cool.

1071
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:19,280
I don't care about Samurai's corpse. And then retrieve the arm as well.

1072
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:28,080
And then one might say, one might speculate about if one were to do such a thing, what might occur.

1073
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:37,520
All right, moving on. Next one is Laggars. 3, 2, 1, go.

1074
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:04,960
Yeah, bro. It's cool. It's social. And we're like, yep. And the conversation ends.

1075
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:11,840
It's a typical, hi, hi, how are you? Fine. And that's it. So my question is,

1076
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:17,040
how do I make enduring conversation with other people, where I talk and the other person replies

1077
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:22,000
and so on. And in general, when I'm with other people, what can I do that is fun and engaging

1078
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:27,600
because I always freeze. I try to open a chat or something and I never know how to

1079
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:33,200
start or what can I say to someone else? If somebody says, like, oh yeah,

1080
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:38,160
George, you've won the first half of the battle. You are both into the same thing.

1081
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:41,440
After that, you just have to ask them questions about what is their favorite character? What

1082
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:47,520
do you like in the thing? Just ask them questions about the thing. The conversation can easily go

1083
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:55,360
from there. That's like a basic strategy. I think I would agree. I would add that

1084
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:02,720
most people really just want to talk about themselves. So yeah, if there's something

1085
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:08,640
they're interested in, like genuinely they're interested in it, and you ask them anything

1086
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:18,080
about it, you just let them talk. Let them talk about a thing that they're interested in. Most

1087
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:23,680
people are just waiting for an opportunity to do that, right?

1088
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:31,360
Take a list, take a leaf out of tierlist.com. You know all those tier lists about what's

1089
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:36,800
your favorite cereal? Just ask people what is their favorite generic thing, usually food,

1090
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:42,400
and that'll get them like, oh, I like this thing. I like this brand of fruit juice.

1091
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:46,560
It's a good one. This is my favorite soda. Oh, really? Well, I like this.

1092
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:51,600
People like filling out those tier lists for a reason, and they like talking about them and

1093
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:59,360
arguing with people about them. So that's an aspect of just generic conversation starter stuff

1094
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:06,960
if you don't really know what to talk about. I mean, if the conversation stops and they're not...

1095
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:14,160
I mean, I guess I would say if you want to keep it going, then I guess you need to offer something

1096
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:21,440
that's like, okay, well, you know, my favorite episode was this or whatever, and hopefully that

1097
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:26,320
would prompt, like, okay, well, yeah, I like that one too, or like, no, no, my favorite episode is

1098
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:31,840
this one, and you can talk about why or whatever. And if it grinds to a halt, then I guess I would

1099
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:36,560
assume that like, I don't know, could be any number of reasons might be that maybe they're,

1100
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,120
I don't know, maybe they're not even that interested. Maybe they just said they were

1101
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:45,760
interested in it because... I think, yeah, there's times where they could be pretending to be

1102
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:51,040
interested because they want to be polite. They could be interested legitimately and just also

1103
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:56,240
terrible at speaking, in which case you have to carry the conversation, which is a bit exhausting

1104
02:01:56,240 --> 02:02:03,760
sometimes, but you know, you do what you gotta do. Do what you gotta do? Do what you... That's,

1105
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:07,760
that's like ours. That's how that's what it is. You just gotta do what you gotta do.

1106
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,360
You know, whatever it takes, do whatever it takes. Never, never, never, never relent.

1107
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:20,560
Don't let society tell you. Don't let society put you in a box. All right, you gotta, you gotta

1108
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:25,680
follow your dreams with a vengeance. All right, and if, and if, and if people try and stop you,

1109
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,760
you gotta make them pay, right? You gotta show them. You gotta show them all.

1110
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:37,760
What are that? I've got a mission. I got a mission for you. DM me. I'm gonna send you on a mission.

1111
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:49,120
Don't tell anyone. Okay. Next up, we really be circumventing the crux of circumcision.

1112
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:56,640
Three, two, one, go. Okay. So firstly, circumcisions can still be botched and that like

1113
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:02,880
sucks for the people who that happens to. Even if everything else is neutral, there's no reason to

1114
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,600
like take that risk. Also, people are quick to dismiss like the suffering of the child,

1115
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,960
because like, oh, you know, you won't remember it, but it's like...

1116
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,720
Yeah, it's still doesn't matter really. Like they're still paid. You're still chopping up their

1117
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:23,520
dick without an aesthetic. Why is that what we think is like the first experience of being alive

1118
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:29,360
in the world is, is that they get their dick chopped up? Like, you know, that's just, it just

1119
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:38,160
doesn't seem nice. That's just doesn't mean. It seems what if some, what if you, why do we give

1120
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:42,240
our babies vaccines that shouldn't be a baby's first memory is getting a needle stuck in it?

1121
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:45,920
Like, shut up. God, like... Needles don't feel like anything though.

1122
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:50,960
They hurt. Not really. Well, maybe when you're really small.

1123
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,800
I just, man, I like, I'm willing to be persuaded. I just, I hate bad arguments. Like,

1124
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:03,440
I don't even think, you know, I'm, I'm not genuine. I'm again, I'm not genuinely out here being like,

1125
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:07,840
no guys, we need to keep circumcising. Like I'm, I'm not committed to that position.

1126
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:12,240
But all the arguments in favour of it suck. I don't know, like, give me a good one, please.

1127
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:20,960
What was the first, what was the first thing that he said? I'm gonna replay the very first

1128
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:30,960
still be botched. Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay. And yeah, if, if, if there is, let's in a

1129
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:35,440
situ, in a situation where like the data suggests that there is no benefit at all to it,

1130
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:41,200
then yeah, probably the, the pain, which I think is pretty minor, like you're a baby, whatever,

1131
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:48,160
like the pain and the, and the possibility of it. The possibility of the botching. Yeah.

1132
02:04:48,160 --> 02:04:54,320
Against nothing, against no benefit at all. Then I would absolutely agree. Yeah. No, then

1133
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:58,400
probably we shouldn't do it. But like, there's not zero benefit. There's not.

1134
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:04,640
I guess I would like to know what happens when an uncircumcised, no, when a circumcised person

1135
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:10,880
never washes their dick, does it get stinky? You know, is it, is it, is it prone?

1136
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:15,680
Probably less so, but yes. Because like, probably yes, but not as much. Right. It's really just

1137
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:24,000
the not as much thing. I really feel like unless there's something major, it's pretty negligible

1138
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:29,680
one way or the other. I just like how I am. So I like, I am in favour of uncircumcised.

1139
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:35,840
Well, I mean, let me just, let me just pose you a hypothetical counterfactual here. Imagine,

1140
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:40,560
imagine I showed you some data, and this is hypothetical, I don't know what the data is,

1141
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:43,920
but imagine I showed you some credible data that suggests that like, okay,

1142
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:53,200
in a week, you know, one in a million circumcisions is botched, and the penis is destroyed. And it's

1143
02:05:53,280 --> 02:06:00,160
like, okay, that seems bad. But then I say, okay, well, among people who are not circumcised,

1144
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:05,920
one in a million will contract a penile infection that will require their penis to be amputated.

1145
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:11,760
Right. Not like, it's not common. And it's the rare individual who doesn't wash their dick enough

1146
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:19,040
to cause this to happen. So like, it's still rare. But like, those are two, those are two,

1147
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:25,280
like, pretty marginal cases that nevertheless balance one another out, right? Like, if that's

1148
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:29,840
it, you would look at that and be like, hmm, either way, someone's gonna lose their dick.

1149
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,880
So like, which one, which one is better? I don't know.

1150
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:40,800
Yeah, I understand your, your willingness to see the data before making a decision.

1151
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:44,240
Like that, that's what that's what it would take to convince me of anything.

1152
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:48,240
Yeah, I think at this point, the voicemails are still like trying to convince you

1153
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:54,800
um, you know, with like, with like this weird appeal to emotion, like, oh, that's so cruel

1154
02:06:54,800 --> 02:07:00,400
to a baby. It's like, I don't give a fuck. That's, that's not a good, that's, because it's mean,

1155
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:06,400
because you don't think, I don't know, this like, with like, oh, the babies are you implying that

1156
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:11,680
it causes some kind of emotional trauma? Because I don't think so. I don't think like, Sigmund

1157
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,560
Ford was like, Oh, yeah, the circumcision has really like fucked up a generation of babies

1158
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:21,120
or whatever. Like, nobody says that that they've got some like emotional trauma from circumcision.

1159
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:29,200
Nobody does. Maybe the data would say otherwise, but I don't know. I've, I mean, maybe I've never

1160
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:35,280
heard, I've never, I've never heard of it as someone's like, Oh yeah, this being circumcised

1161
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:40,400
gave this baby trust issues or something. Yeah, I guess it's because it happens so early in life,

1162
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:46,160
you don't really have anything to, to like, you know, you don't even know what's going on,

1163
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:49,600
because you didn't remember having it. You don't, you don't miss it. And like,

1164
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:54,960
you might experience like a moment of discomfort, but you won't be able to, you won't be like,

1165
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:00,160
you don't know why you can't like associate like, Oh, the reason I felt this was because

1166
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:05,840
this person did something. You just probably like, you feel some pain in your dick for a moment,

1167
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:11,040
and then for a while afterwards, and there's nothing you can do about it. I don't know.

1168
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:17,520
Anyway, whatever. I just don't think it's, I just don't think it's a great argument. I just don't.

1169
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:25,280
Next up, we got an email from Frost Drive. Three, two, one, go.

1170
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:31,120
So I was listening to an old episode of the PCP and in it, the comic website platform,

1171
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:36,080
Tapis was brought up and you guys kept saying something like Topis or Topaz. I just want to

1172
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:42,880
let you guys know the correct pronunciation is Tapas. And on the topic of comics, I have a series

1173
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:46,880
on there with a few thousand readers, but I've been thinking lately that's not enough. And I've

1174
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:53,440
also realized that putting all of your content online for free, pretty cringe, bro. So going forward,

1175
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:57,440
I'm thinking about reserving my comic series, like the main narrative for only backers on

1176
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:01,440
kick starters, and it'll continue to grow the fan base online through comic strips of the series

1177
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,960
and email marketing. That's what I'm going to do. It's pretty interesting topic to me. I don't know

1178
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:08,960
about you guys, but is it cringe or based? Let me know in the comments below and don't forget to

1179
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:13,920
smash like, smash subscribe for the PCP. Also, Ben, I got your comic in the mail finally from the

1180
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:18,320
Kickstarter. Oh, fuck you. Very cool. Love the black envelope in the white letters. I'm definitely

1181
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:28,880
copying you. Thanks, dog. Go for it. I don't know whether it is like based or cringe to keep

1182
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:34,400
some content for backers only. I think that's fine. It just depends on whether that is effective at

1183
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:39,200
growing an audience as much as you want. Yeah. Yeah. At the end of the day, I mean,

1184
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:44,800
that's what matters. It's like, you know, you got you got to balance. You got to balance

1185
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,560
you got to balance, like, you know, public outreach, I guess, versus like,

1186
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:57,760
generation of revenue, and like, whatever way works for you, like, is fine and is probably

1187
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:06,720
what you should do. And I'm not going to begrudge anyone for that. I think I think that it's cringe

1188
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:14,400
to I mean, it's cringe to overpaywall and like, you know, paywall all your stuff and then no one

1189
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:21,280
ever ever sees your shit. And then like, you don't grow and nobody yeah, but it's it's it's

1190
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:27,440
it's to some extent, probably also cringe to underpaywall and like, never charge for anything.

1191
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:33,280
And put and just do everything for free. I know that like, it carries the benefit that like, if

1192
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:38,480
you're if your stuff is good, and it gets popular, you know, you accrue social capital, which is

1193
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:45,040
valuable in in its own right. So it's, you know, it's not really for free exactly. But I mean,

1194
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:50,080
you do have to monetize it at some point, if you're ever going to take it beyond just being a hobby

1195
02:10:50,080 --> 02:11:01,360
that you do. So, you know, you know, I mean, just yeah, it's it's a I think a nice base thing to

1196
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:09,840
do is just whatever works. I think a nice middle of ground is is usually to have paywall for early

1197
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:18,160
access to content. That's usually fine. That was yeah, yeah, everybody ends up seeing it. But if

1198
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:22,960
you're really into it, you can get to see it early. Or you can get to see special behind the scene

1199
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:28,720
stuff. I guess I did. I guess I don't really think of it as paywalling. But I guess I did. I have

1200
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:34,000
technically paywalled the vaporettes, because they are only in the book.

1201
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:39,280
That's yeah, that's a cool one. Because like, they're they're side story content. They're not

1202
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:45,840
been saying original art. So it's like, I don't have to read them. But they are really cool. So

1203
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:51,520
I mean, I would consider them to be, I mean, they're not been saying art, but they're been,

1204
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:54,720
I mean, they're canon and everything. And I wrote yeah, yeah. So like, you know, they're just as

1205
02:11:54,720 --> 02:12:01,040
valid. But yeah, I guess that's, I guess, like, I paywalled a little bit. I will probably at some

1206
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:05,760
point in the future, I will make them public. But like, maybe not until after I maybe have like,

1207
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:10,800
another thing that's going to have like, you know, some of its own like, associated.

1208
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:21,440
I hate the word but paywalled content. Yeah, interesting. It's like, it's like a,

1209
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:27,760
it's one of those things that like, probably, you will never, there is no answer. It's just

1210
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:33,360
got to be one of those like, two conflicting forces that one must must forever balance,

1211
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:38,720
you know, in their life or whatever, or in their, in their brand.

1212
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:46,320
Next one is called perpetually two weeks behind three, two, one, go.

1213
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:53,520
Hey, I always let a new podcast episode come out before I watch the previous one,

1214
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:58,160
some always two weeks behind. But so far, all the guests have been really interesting,

1215
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:00,800
and they're intending to listen to, to keep up the good work.

1216
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:09,120
Wouldn't it be funny if this guy, he's two weeks behind. So wouldn't it be funny if like,

1217
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:12,880
this guy ends up being someone who gets mad about Mallory?

1218
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:22,720
You know, thinking about, thinking about it, it's easy to see like the, the dislike. Oh,

1219
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:27,760
we didn't even talk about, we didn't talk about last episode and the reaction it got.

1220
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,520
I mean, we didn't really need to.

1221
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:34,400
We talked about it. We talked about it. I mean, I kind of wanted to, I mean,

1222
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:39,200
I talked about it with Jim. We talked about it with Jim a little bit before the episode started,

1223
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,960
just to like, I don't know, because I, because I sort of intended to like reference it a little bit.

1224
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:58,000
But um, yeah, I, you know, it's, it's, it felt like, and my emotional reaction to

1225
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:04,880
all the, the, the, the, the downvote ratio and the proliferation of like,

1226
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:14,000
unfavorable, let's say, comments was to be like, dang, the people are mad. The people are riled up.

1227
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:21,920
I have like offended the community with this and, you know, that's, and, and, and it pisses me off.

1228
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:28,800
Wait, I gotta look at the numbers. But actually, you know, on reflection, it's easy to feel that way.

1229
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:36,960
But really, like, I mean, the video got, oh, it's almost, it's still under half likes, but like,

1230
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:40,960
you know, the video got three, it got 113 likes so far.

1231
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:48,080
Um, and 140 dislikes. So racialized, it's bad, but like, that only represents maybe like 100 people

1232
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:56,000
who were upset enough to, to click the downvote button where they wouldn't have, you know? So,

1233
02:14:56,800 --> 02:15:03,040
you know, it's definitely, it's definitely a small but vocal minority of people that were

1234
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:06,720
upset about it, upon reflection.

1235
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:12,240
It's, it's, it's the last remnants of, of the waiting for Nate crowd, I guess.

1236
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:15,360
You think so?

1237
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:19,520
They, they, they don't like the direction the show is going and this is like the final straw,

1238
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,040
like, I can't believe, I can't believe you got someone like that.

1239
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:30,960
Imagine, imagine being mad that someone's not on the podcast, on a podcast anymore. Imagine

1240
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:36,480
being mad about that at the people who are still on and not at the person who isn't on.

1241
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:44,560
Like imagine, imagine coping that hard that you like, displace, blame somewhere it doesn't belong

1242
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:51,280
to that extent. I don't know. It's wild. It's wild to me. Uh, I mean, I said, I said in that,

1243
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:56,880
I'll put out a little thing, like, I don't think people who like Nate equals people who are angry

1244
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:01,600
at the thing. No, there's, I didn't mean, I didn't mean to imply that. I didn't mean to

1245
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:05,600
imply that it's like, oh, everyone who liked Nate on the podcast is a piece of shit.

1246
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:13,760
No, no, no. Like, like legitimately not even true, but no. But yeah, it, it is a vocal minority

1247
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:19,600
that didn't like her because I don't know what I said in the episode is like that it's, she

1248
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:28,480
represents a thing that she doesn't actually represent like truly. They just think she does

1249
02:16:28,480 --> 02:16:32,240
and then they hate that and then therefore they hate her and they won't listen to her.

1250
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:37,760
It was, it was weird to see that like, I mean, I've seen like all the vitriol she's gotten on

1251
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:48,160
like Twitter. I kind of assumed that like people would just sort of, I mean, maybe I assumed that

1252
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:54,080
like they wouldn't have the same reaction to like hearing her talk and like seeing her on a podcast

1253
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:59,760
as they would just like, I can kind of, I don't agree with it, but I can understand how if you

1254
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:04,160
are someone who thinks that like stealing is really wrong, you read the shoplifting comment

1255
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:09,040
and you make get mad about it. I can kind of understand like at least the process there,

1256
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:16,960
but to then like get mad at her, just her on a podcast. I didn't, I didn't think it would carry

1257
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:21,520
over. It was weird to see like as soon as the first I mean, I thought it would carry over because

1258
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:27,520
I saw the ratio. I was like, wow, no, it's, it's, it's, it carry, it does. I was surprised.

1259
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:34,240
I, I mean, I felt like it would absolutely would because she's only known right now,

1260
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:40,080
largely in circles that don't like her through those specific things we put in the thumbnail

1261
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:45,120
and they're going to be like, what? I guess I just didn't and they just sort of associated

1262
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:48,400
whatever they felt with those things as like, you know,

1263
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:55,040
yeah, but like it's a new written in stone that this is a bad person and a bad person is on the

1264
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:59,760
show. Man, he's really going downhill and they just really reacted immediately.

1265
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:04,800
But even if you didn't, even if you didn't like, I don't know, just even if you didn't like the

1266
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:08,960
comics, I don't understand why you would have the same reaction to that person in like a totally

1267
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:16,000
different context. You know, it's, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I guess we did show the comics in

1268
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:24,560
the, yeah, I can see, I can see that it just doesn't like, I couldn't imagine. I'm not sure

1269
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:30,000
whether a lot of the people who reacted angrily really listened to the episode at all. Maybe

1270
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:35,920
they listened to like the first 20 minutes just to get an idea before commenting. But like, I don't

1271
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:42,000
think many of them would have stuck around before they were like, God, fuck this person. You know

1272
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:48,640
nothing. She was a horrible person on Twitter. I don't know. It's, it's funny because like,

1273
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:54,320
if you think she's a terrible person, I think you probably think the same about me. So why,

1274
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:59,840
why do you listen to this podcast that I am on every episode of? I don't get it.

1275
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:09,680
Uh, that's weird. It's weird, man. Damn! Damn! Um, did I have anything else to say about that?

1276
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:22,720
No, not really. Strange, strange times we live in. Next one is Son of Marowak. I know this guy.

1277
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:25,760
Uh, three, two, one, go.

1278
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:35,200
All right. Son of Marowak here. Yeah. So I just been watching the series of videos by Lindsay Ellis,

1279
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:42,160
talking about an omega verse lawsuit that's been going on for like the past year and a half or so.

1280
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:51,360
I've seen those. The first video she made is just her talking about the lawsuit in question and

1281
02:19:52,320 --> 02:20:01,840
how much of an asshole the villain of the lawsuit is. The second video is her in response to

1282
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:09,040
the villain of the lawsuit. It's giving Lindsay crap about the video that she made.

1283
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:16,960
And Lindsay goes through all of the points in documents that were sent to her in regards to the

1284
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:24,480
video and owns how each or every single one of them were wrong. Like this villain of the lawsuit

1285
02:20:24,480 --> 02:20:31,120
is a complete asshole. It doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Go watch these videos

1286
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:40,160
if you haven't already. Tell me what you think of them. Oh, that's the question. I just want to

1287
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:48,400
know what we think. Have you seen those? I've seen those. I, like in terms of Lindsay Ellis videos,

1288
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:52,240
I didn't really give a shit too much. Like I've watched the first one and then, you know,

1289
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:59,680
the second one was like, okay. But it's like the crazy idiot who does a lawsuit that is stupid

1290
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:06,560
and then gets angry at a YouTuber exposing this stupid lawsuit, you know, double combo,

1291
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:11,680
is like a pattern I've seen like a hundred times on YouTube. So like for Lindsay Ellis video,

1292
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:15,520
wasn't that interesting to be honest? It felt like a repeat of like everything else.

1293
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:24,880
Like the H3 thing with the thing and then. Was it Graham Linnum? Was there, what was the H3

1294
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:31,680
lawsuit? Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking of H Bomber Guy. Oh, H3. This sort of stuff has happened

1295
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:37,040
so many times. It's like, yes, we all understand. Oh, Jim Sterling, another person, like he made

1296
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:43,120
a bad review of a video game. He got attacked by what's his face. Kind of remember him. But

1297
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:47,360
that like they're always stupid. The lawsuits always fail because they're stupid clearly.

1298
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:53,760
And it's just like, yeah, that's another one of these. I know what you mean. I thought that,

1299
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:59,120
I thought that the first one about the Omegaverse was pretty interesting. I thought it was funny,

1300
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:04,800
you know. Yeah. But yeah, the second one about like now I'm being sued, it's like,

1301
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:10,640
yeah, that's a funny fact, I guess. But like the story about it is, it's like you said it.

1302
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:16,640
I've seen this kind of thing before. And I'm like 100% sure that Lindsay Ellis will be fine.

1303
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:23,200
So I'm not like worried. Yes, she seemed more fine than most because she had like YouTube

1304
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:28,160
protecting her apparently. Oh yeah, that's true. That's unusual.

1305
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:33,680
It was on you. That was the most interesting part was the how much YouTube was on her side about it.

1306
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:40,960
Which seems, I don't, does that make me like YouTube more or less? That they will protect

1307
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:45,680
anyone or that they will own? No. Am I glad that they'll protect anyone or am I angry that they

1308
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:51,760
will go to such lengths to protect someone big and do nothing for anyone else? Yeah, it's the same

1309
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:56,800
old like she's big, she's a published author now, she's like a big deal and she's got a huge

1310
02:22:56,800 --> 02:23:06,560
Patreon. Of course they would help her. Yeah, yeah. Which I'm glad they at least do that sometimes,

1311
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:11,120
but it's like it still speaks to YouTube's ineptitude on the lower levels. In this case,

1312
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:18,720
it's nice that they did something for someone who is obviously in the right, I guess. But yeah, like

1313
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:26,240
would I be like super broken up if Lindsay Ellis got like, I don't know, some copyright claims

1314
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:34,240
against her? Like whatever, she's fine. Yeah. No, I thought the first one explaining the whole

1315
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:39,680
like debacle like beforehand though and going into like what is the Omegaverse was like pretty

1316
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:50,960
entertaining. Have the legal eagle man come in? I feel there's something about there's something

1317
02:23:50,960 --> 02:24:02,000
about legal eagle man that like upsets me. Is it the Dr. Wolf jaw? He does. They have the same,

1318
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,560
oh my god, you're right. You're right. The first thing I noticed about him is like,

1319
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:10,960
oh this guy, this is like a good version of Dr. Wolf where everything went right.

1320
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:18,080
You know, I have watched my fair share of legal eagle and I think it's fine. It's fine content,

1321
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:26,720
but like there's something so manicured about him and like his and like I get that like that's the

1322
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:31,600
point. Of course he wants to come off as like polished and professional. His whole thing is

1323
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:38,720
that he's a lawyer. He needs to like appear as like a professional. I don't know, I guess I'm like

1324
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:46,160
he's just he's too plain to be like a relatable character on YouTube, do you mean? Yeah, maybe

1325
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:53,840
a little bit like he's so like the fact that he just kind of shows up, does the YouTube thing

1326
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:59,200
and just, you know, duly rewarded for it. It's like a little frustrating

1327
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:03,280
whenever I see that. Like this guy hasn't even beaten Sans in Undertale.

1328
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:14,000
I guess, I don't know, I don't know like, I guess I wonder like to what extent

1329
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:18,320
professionally is he like a lawyer versus a YouTuber, do you know what I mean?

1330
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:24,800
Yeah, it feels like he's so like hard in the YouTube game that it feels like this must be

1331
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:29,760
his full-time shtick, but he sort of sells himself on the premise that like his job is that he's a

1332
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:35,840
lawyer. Like I don't know, does he even practice anymore? Because he's like fucking, he's fucking

1333
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:43,360
hobnobbing with like big, big, you know, YouTube people making like, what's that like Nebula,

1334
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:48,560
making Nebula with fucking like Patrick H. Willems and Lindsay Ellis and whoever the fuck else.

1335
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:53,280
I mean, I could imagine he's a, he's a lawyer that has like

1336
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,880
got into the YouTube thing just as a hobby, because it's like, don't have work right now,

1337
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:05,680
I may as well use my knowledge to make content. And you know, he's just so, he's just so goddamn

1338
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:14,720
handsome that it makes me mad. It's just like, oh, of course, this guy was like, hmm, I'm a lawyer,

1339
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:21,280
and I'm disgustingly good looking. You know, I should probably, I should probably flex that

1340
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:26,480
to also become like wildly successful on YouTube as well. And he just does it and it just happens.

1341
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:35,280
You know, that sucks. It's not to say that like he didn't, like, I mean, you know, he made the

1342
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:40,640
content, I guess, I guess he put the work in, I guess, but in a way that's like,

1343
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:48,880
you know, this is how I always feel. People, I feel this way about everyone rich and people say,

1344
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:53,360
like, oh, I'm just like salty. I'm just like, oh, you're just jealous. I'm like, yeah, sure, I guess.

1345
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:58,720
It just always frustrates me. It frustrates me whenever I feel like what I'm seeing is like a

1346
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:04,400
person being rewarded in a way that's incommensurate with the work they put in. And I feel like that's

1347
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:09,760
true of like basically everyone, that's true of like everyone who's rich at all. And it's true of

1348
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,680
like most people who are successful on YouTube. It was part of a, you know, a growing up, I assume,

1349
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:23,280
I don't actually know. Like, wealthy enough to go to law school at all is a pretty big step up.

1350
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:31,040
To do all of the law school stuff is not easy, obviously. It's like, you know, the opportunities

1351
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:37,680
provided to him to go to that sort of place is like, you need money already and can't do that

1352
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:45,600
unless you live in at least a middle class family. Probably. Yeah, sure. I mean, that too.

1353
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:54,000
Yeah, I don't know. It's just, it's just to see, you know, he does a very formulaic stick and it's

1354
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:02,320
a fine stick. And it just frustrates me whenever I see someone do it by the book. And it just works.

1355
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:07,280
That's what I see when I look at legal legal. This guy just showed up was like,

1356
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:11,200
what's the formula? Okay, I'll do that. And it worked, you know?

1357
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:18,400
Like Captain Christian. Captain Crispin. Like Captain Christian. Yeah, Captain Christian, I know.

1358
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:26,240
I think that's his name. The video essay man. The video essay, like, perfect algorithm.

1359
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:31,040
Yeah. Perfect thumbnails, perfect release schedule.

1360
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:34,560
I like, I like talk shit about him on Twitter one time and he responded,

1361
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:41,680
I don't know, to like call me jealous or something. And, and it's like, same thing. I just,

1362
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:50,320
I just think, I just think, you know, I just think it's, it is kind of like jealousy because it's

1363
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:57,120
like, everybody wishes that they just happened to do all the right things at the right time,

1364
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:02,240
first try. Well, not first try. You don't know how many times these people have tried, but

1365
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:08,720
like, it all seems, because that's, you know, internet personalities in a nutshell,

1366
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:11,920
everything seems to be the perfect version of everything that's going on.

1367
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:18,080
Yeah. Like, it's, oh, it's just so happens that everything went perfectly and I'm a perfect

1368
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:21,840
person and you feel like you are inadequate because you're not me. Ha ha.

1369
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:30,160
Indeed. And it's like, nobody sets out to make people feel shit, but it happens.

1370
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:44,880
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, the, the Lindsay Alice. Yeah, whatever. Cool. Next up, voicemail.

1371
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:48,960
Margar is dead. Three, two, one, go.

1372
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:56,960
Oh, I can't believe how easy it all wasn't yet.

1373
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:07,680
Months of planning, months of hard work. Ben, all I had to do was wait for your other enemies

1374
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:15,680
to set me free. And now I'm on the outside. Samurai came for me just as I knew he would.

1375
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:23,200
I knew he couldn't wait that long. And when he came to my cell, I just used a little deception,

1376
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:28,640
a little murder origami to create a fake copy of myself. Now I'm officially dead.

1377
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:35,120
The oldest trick in the book. You can't convict a dead man. So I'm out and I'll be seeing you real

1378
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:39,120
soon, Ben. Just know it didn't have to be this way.

1379
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:46,800
Is that, that was Margar, right? I'm, I, yeah, I believe so. Oh, no, he's out.

1380
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:55,600
He played me like a fiddle. He played you like a fiddle by being so boring that someone decided to kill him.

1381
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:58,240
This is fun all along.

1382
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:10,960
Well, it reminds me of two things. Reminds me of the time on Twitter that Chris Chan said that she

1383
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:18,720
would be like seeing me soon. Remember that? I mean, as she said that like 10 times,

1384
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:24,240
isn't that every time you cross paths? Maybe more than once, but it was at least one time that

1385
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:30,480
she said like she would be seeing me soon in person and like the, yeah, yeah. And like the

1386
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:38,400
implication was that she was going to be like astrally projecting to curse me or something or

1387
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:43,760
maybe just to talk to me. I don't know. So, you know, that's just one more thing to be afraid of,

1388
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:52,720
I guess. And the other thing it reminds me of, in, did you, do you remember the essay or do you

1389
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:57,680
remember the thing that gets read in Frog Fractions when you're in the underwater segment?

1390
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:05,440
The essay is about boxing before the punching meta had arrived.

1391
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,320
Did you, did you watch, did you rewatch either of those no-clip documentaries?

1392
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:11,600
I did, yeah.

1393
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:16,640
Do you remember the part, this part killed me. It's not, it's not what it is. It's the way that

1394
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:23,760
he said it, that Jim said it in that he said like the essay is about the idea that like

1395
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:28,240
punching is not an essential part of boxing. It is only emergent from the rule set.

1396
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:35,120
And that like before anyone just, that really boxing is just a contest to knock your opponent out.

1397
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:40,080
And it used to be about like you just had to bore them to sleep with stories until someone

1398
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:44,080
discovered that, wait a minute, actually the fastest way to get someone to be unconscious

1399
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:48,240
is just to punch them. That's how like modern boxing was invented.

1400
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,800
It's really cool. Yeah, yeah.

1401
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,320
It's a great lateral thinking.

1402
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:01,200
Yeah. Well, I guess, I guess I've been outsmarted once again. I guess this is just the theme

1403
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:08,960
of the voicemails now, but that's fine. You know what? It's better this way. Who wants to know

1404
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:19,360
everything? Last, last voicemail is called I miss old PCP cry face. Three, two, one, go.

1405
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:25,920
Hey, you, yeah, you guy instantly commenting and disliking the last episode of the PCP

1406
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:32,320
commenting on how you miss the good old days. It was so much fun and better and you fell in love

1407
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:40,080
with everyone on the first 50 episodes. And now things aren't good because Ben bad and Ben

1408
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:43,440
invited Mallory on and you don't like her or something. Lol.

1409
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:47,760
Commenters rule number one, you fake PCP fan.

1410
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:55,520
Commenters rule number one. I guess I'm a fake fan myself. Number one is the don't comment

1411
02:33:55,520 --> 02:34:00,480
so you watch the whole thing, right? Yeah. Like, you know,

1412
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:07,520
that's the thing I was imagining most people were not listening to what Mallory had to say

1413
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:11,200
before commenting that she's a terrible piece of shit because she doesn't come across like one.

1414
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:22,560
You know, I, I don't know. I think that probably, I don't know if that's the problem

1415
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:26,000
is that people weren't watching the whole episode because I'm pretty sure that if you came in

1416
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:32,720
thinking that way and being, being like, if you come, if you, if you, if you're like,

1417
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:36,960
Oh, I hate new PCP. If you're like, Oh, I hate this guest. If you hate Mallory specifically

1418
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:41,120
or whatever, I don't think that watching all the way to the end, like I don't think that anything

1419
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:46,400
that we said in the episode, well, I mean, maybe it's possible that something we said on the episode,

1420
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:50,000
you might be persuaded like, Oh, you know, this person isn't like I thought or whatever, maybe.

1421
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,960
But I think a lot of people would not be persuaded and they would just be like,

1422
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:55,200
Yeah, this is what I, this is what I expected to hear.

1423
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:00,400
You know, maybe, I mean, I would need to know what they think.

1424
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:03,440
Yeah, like what their assumption was.

1425
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:09,520
You know, I think, I think that no, I'm, I'm partially wrong. I think that probably a lot of

1426
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:19,120
people would hear Mallory say like, you know, the new guy comic was like just kind of like a spur

1427
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:22,240
of the moment thing that I didn't even really think about too hard and be like,

1428
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:26,720
I guess, I guess what doesn't really matter. And like to hear her say like, okay, well,

1429
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:32,720
the shoplifting thing is just like, you know, it's, you know, when you're poor, it's just about

1430
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:37,440
like being poor as a kid or whatever, it'd be like, I guess that makes sense. But I don't think

1431
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:43,760
everyone would be persuaded. I think maybe half and half, I don't know. So while yes, of course,

1432
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:49,360
we always encourage comment to rule number one, but I don't know if, I don't know if it solves

1433
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:54,560
the issue. I don't know if it, I don't know. I mean, what we talk about in the episode was more

1434
02:35:54,560 --> 02:36:00,640
about like how her own people turned against her, not really people who already don't like her.

1435
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:05,440
Because if it were more about the other people, we would have had explanations and more like

1436
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:10,400
in depth talk about like why shoplifting could be an okay thing.

1437
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:16,320
It's true. Yeah, we didn't even really talk about it from that angle. Yeah.

1438
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:25,680
I don't know. I think we've done a really great job of burning off the old PCP heads.

1439
02:36:26,560 --> 02:36:36,560
We've we've seared away the crust, the cruft, the chaff left with only the cream, the wheat,

1440
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:39,200
uh, if you will.

1441
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:46,320
That's not keto. I'm getting hungry. No, it's not. No, it's not. God damn. I made,

1442
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:55,600
I made the most delicious grilled cheese and spam sandwich today with keto bread,

1443
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:01,920
with low oven fresh keto bread. Have I talked about low oven fresh?

1444
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:07,440
No. What is keto? How do you make keto bread? Is it cut of flour, dust?

1445
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:13,040
Well, well, you know, I think I've talked about, I was looking for,

1446
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:20,560
this is a funny note to end the episode on, but I looked all over. I tried all kinds of

1447
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:24,400
different bread replacements. I tried the one that everyone tells you to make is cloud bread.

1448
02:37:24,400 --> 02:37:30,240
Cloud bread sucks. I hate it. There's another, there was another one that sort of, I ordered

1449
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:34,240
like a mix to like mix it yourself and make a loaf out of that. That one was like, okay.

1450
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:39,680
I tried ordering some like loaves online and from Amazon and like they would like,

1451
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:43,600
either they would have a weird texture or they'd have a weird taste or like when you toasted them,

1452
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:48,320
they would get really hard like a cracker. They had all the, all these different things. And then

1453
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:53,520
I found this, this one brand that they sell, they only sell it at Aldi as far as I'm aware.

1454
02:37:54,080 --> 02:38:01,040
And it's called Love and Fresh L-Apostrophe O-V-E-N. And the main ingredient is,

1455
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:07,520
is it wheat gluten? I don't know. It's, it's, it's got some like wheat derivative and it's,

1456
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:12,320
it's perfect. It's amazing. I can't believe it. It just tastes exactly like normal bread.

1457
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:16,320
All the other ones were like weird or bad in some way or just like kind of marginal,

1458
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:20,720
like just good enough that like it's all right. This one's just like, no, they did it.

1459
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:24,480
They, they fucking did it. And it's like three grams of carbs per slice. So,

1460
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:28,480
you know, I can't eat a whole loaf in a day, but I can eat like two or four slices in a day and

1461
02:38:28,480 --> 02:38:35,760
it's fine. And I made a fucking grilled, spam and grilled cheese sandwich. So good. So fucking good.

1462
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:40,160
I've been, I've been buying all these different cheeses, making different kinds of grilled cheese

1463
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:47,120
out of them. So far, Monster is my favorite in case you were wondering. I know you were for sure.

1464
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:54,720
Hmm. Yes. Yeah. So yeah. Monster Cheese, highly recommended.

1465
02:38:56,960 --> 02:39:05,280
Anything else we have to do before? No, we gotta say, we gotta say patreon.com

1466
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:12,240
slash the procrastinators. That's right. And we gotta say teespring.com slash stores slash the

1467
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:19,520
dash pro dash procrastinators. To get the first loser find purpose November t-shirt.

1468
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:27,840
And we gotta say speakpipe.com slash pcp voicemail. And are we forgetting anything?

1469
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:31,680
Oh, we got bonus episodes. What was the last one we did? Was that with digi?

1470
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:39,680
Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was, it should be coming out this week, right? It should be coming

1471
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:47,520
out to the beginning of November, the commentary track. Yeah, the commentary track on the first

1472
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:53,840
episode. The commentary track. I think it should be, I think it should be available on Patreon

1473
02:39:53,840 --> 02:40:03,280
by the time this episode is out, probably. Yes, we actually, we actually did it. And if people

1474
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:10,560
like it, we will do more. So I hope that's not a complete clusterfuck, or that it is,

1475
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:19,760
but people like it anyway. So yeah, Patreon for that. And I guess that's it. Thanks for listening,

1476
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:28,160
everyone. Hey, I guess I should say, here's something. If you like our guests, or if you

1477
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:33,200
liked seeing them on the PCP, and this, this would go for any of our guests actually, Jim,

1478
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:41,920
or Mallory, or Aria, or Mary, or anyone, if it would be cool, if people would like maybe on their

1479
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:46,080
Twitter or something like message them and say like, Hey, I saw you on the PCP, you know, I liked,

1480
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:49,680
I liked it, liked your conversation there, like listening to you, thought it was cool,

1481
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:55,600
thumbs up, good job. That would be a cool thing for people to do. You know, if you're so inclined,

1482
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:58,800
if you like someone we have on, and you want to let them know you appreciate them,

1483
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:05,920
I would think that was pretty based. And go get the frog fractions DLC. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1484
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:12,240
I am, I am going to buy that. I'm going to buy that today. Actually, I will buy that like right

1485
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:21,360
after this episode is done. And you should too. For old pal Jim. All right. Is that it? We done?

1486
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:27,760
Good night, everybody. Good night, everybody. Good, good, good morrow to you so long and thanks

1487
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:42,800
for all the fish. Fish, delicious. Bye.
