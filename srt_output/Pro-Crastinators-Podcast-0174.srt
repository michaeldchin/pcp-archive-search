00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, Best.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've also got Worst, aka Ben. Hey, buddy, how's it going?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Shut the fuck up. That's wrong.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, you're actually everybody's favorite.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You're spreading wrong information. That's illegal.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They call me the father of lies for just this reason. We've got Endless Jess over here.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, we've got the best guy, we've got the worst guy, and we've got the medium guy.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Everyone's most electrifying character. We've got Tom Oliver.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello, I'm here. The medium rare guy.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, no. There you go.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And we've got Digibro.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Everybody, we've got such a big show for you this week. There's so much news in the world of capitalism and communism.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There's so many political things happening. There's politicals coming out of my eyeballs.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Before we get to all that juicy capitalism communism stuff that everybody loves, let's take it back.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go old school and be mad about a comment.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay, sure.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I just saw this come up in my notifications as I was getting ready to do this from last week's show.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, most of the comments last week were shitting on Ben, which is fine, but this comment is shitting on me, which is not fine at all.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A lot of angry centrists last week.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, I hate them. I hate them. Pick a side, cowards.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This villain decided that he didn't like me.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So there was one point when we were talking about Nate's dog.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, this one? Yeah.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I said something like...

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You were cruelly and viciously roasting my perfectly proportioned, corgi dog.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He's half corgi, it makes sense.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, I remember that.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I said something ridiculous like...

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
On his birthday, dare I say.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It was his birthday!

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Never let us forget.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You know, I just threw out there like, it doesn't matter.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You know, everyone knows that a dog being fat has no negative impact on its health whatsoever.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Of course.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Obvious sarcasm that everybody understood in the entire world, except for this one commenter who's like,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
stupidest comment of the podcast definitely goes to Jesse.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why does it matter if a dog is fat?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It doesn't affect it in any way?

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In parentheses, paraphrased.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, thanks.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So, I responded to him and I just said, I know, right?

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's almost as stupid as not being able to detect sarcasm.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That was a good one.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And then, just now, 18 minutes ago, he responded to my response.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And he turned so vicious.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He's like a mad dog, you might say.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, a mad, fat dog.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He goes impotent.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't try to save face, dude.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You may be funny, but you're not intelligent.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Your theory finger quotes of anarcho-communism is actually nonsensical.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And not even a political theory you ignoramus.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Learn some philosophy and come back with a systematic approach to politics that isn't just an assertion of facts,

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but based on actual proof.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We've gone astray a couple of times.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He's either confused you for me, or he's misquoted anarcho-communism.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All the fucking time is, I know our voices on the PCP are somewhat similar,

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but for fuck's sake, if you're gonna have opinions about us, figure out who we are.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You guys implemented visuals.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can literally watch the clip where you heard us talk.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Look at whose fucking icon is flashing.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Figure out who that guy is.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm so sick of people telling me about my opinions on things that are Nate's opinions on things.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
God damn it!

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We work our fingers to the bone, whipping Oblivionfall to make him give the visual indicators.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Working day and night to whip up these opinions for you.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just to have you mix them all up in a food processor.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just as you make whipped cream by taking cream and whipping it really fast,

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you take normal decent political discourse and you whip it really fast,

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and you turn it into a delicious topping of comedy that you can put on top of anything,

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but it's just pearls before swine, I guess.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't think that he's mixing us up.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think he's just a fool.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think he has just misspoken and was talking about the anarcho-fascism thing.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you took that exact quote and just replaced it with anarcho-fascism or whatever,

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
then I would understand, so I think it is simply,

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Occam's razor, I think he simply made a mistake.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's simply trying to break down the capitalistic allegory of the overloaded dog.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Everybody knows about that theory.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's so common.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, people.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Anarcho-fascism is obviously absurd.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's called anarcho-fascism.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's funny because the other definition is equally absurd.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The definition that I found was like some weird racist shit.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, yeah.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's fascism.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I looked up the definition of fascism just to be sure,

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and whoever said it, Mussolini or something, didn't bring up racism,

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
so I'm assuming that Mussolini is a pretty smart guy about most things.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I would also defer to Mussolini on most issues.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's probably one of the experts.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe it needs a different name, like anarcho-tyranny or something.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But the whole point of it is to be absurd and to argue with people

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and convince myself of it, which is even more funny,

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
because when I start arguing and articulating,

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can almost believe it and I go,

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
cool, this is stupid.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Did we mention on the PCP that time?

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's not anarcho-communism.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Did we mention on the show the time that Jim Carrey was shitting on Mussolini on Twitter

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and then Mussolini's granddaughter came and was telling him a piece of shit?

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That was crazy.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That was fucking hilarious.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I was reminding everybody that happened.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What he did, what he did, and this is kind of understandable,

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
what Jim Carrey actually did was, you know Jim Carrey's gotten into art and painting and stuff?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What he did was, he painted a picture of Mussolini,

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and I think it was his wife or his current lady or whatever it was,

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and he drew, he painted them being hung from their feet after being assassinated or whatever,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and Mussolini's granddaughter was like, this is pretty fucked up.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And of course you understand both sides,

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
not a big fan of Mussolini, most people.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Also his literal granddaughter is probably going to have some feelings.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I mean, that was what made it so great.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know if I was Mussolini's granddaughter,

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't know if I'd really want to be out there on social media

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
sticking my neck out, dying on the hill of, let's defend my grandfather's honor.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It takes balls to defend your family when your family is Mussolini.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It does.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It does.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I would want to be in the camp of, hey, I'm not like my grandfather, I'm a cool Mussolini.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm taking it back.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, exactly.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I don't know if I agree with her tactic on this one.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well fuck her, she didn't make Ace Ventura.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Gotta make Mussolini great again.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, you know what I did recently?

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I watched the Boba Duke, and I've gotta say, it was a cinematic masterpiece,

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and I was in fact Boba Duke spooked consistently the whole time.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's such a Boba Duke spooky movie.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
One more can you ask for it?

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You know, there was really an amazing arc in that movie.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I guess slight spoilers for people, but it was just Nate Movie Guy

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
weighing in once again on the new movie he saw.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It starts off with this mother and child who are, like this weird hyperactive,

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
possibly kind of a genius, but he creates all kinds of problems.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He makes all these weird tactics and stratagems to fuck up his mom's life

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and make her miserable because he's too hyperactive and their dad died or something.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He starts the movie as the clear villain, but by the end,

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
he becomes the Macaulay Culkin fucking trap genius

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
fighting against a literal demon attempting to murder his mom and himself.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I was team kid, I did not expect to be,

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but kid proved to be such a fucking badass in that movie, and it was great.

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then they make peace with the demon in the basement,

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and he just lives there now, and they feed him worms to placate his rage.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I guess it's like a metaphor.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's the best interpretation of that movie I've ever heard.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I mean, like most people try to go nerdwriter about it and be like,

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
the Babadook is a metaphor for depression, and we see at the end,

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
she's learned to lock her depression up.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
She can never truly get rid of it, but she's learned to,

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and you're just over there like, ah, that didn't become friends with the Babadook,

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and he lives in the basement.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's fucking dope, right?

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I know writers who've used subtext, they're all cowards.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Sometimes the service level is the only level.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's my motto.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In fact, that's mostly the case.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Anyway, it was great, and I very much enjoyed it.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I recommend it to everyone.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The Babadooks are great.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And also check out, what was it, Jesse's Dark Souls 2?

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, that's where you're the Babadook.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, check out the Babadook and the sequel.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh yeah, the continuing adventures of the Babadook in the Babadook.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There's so many chapters of that saga now.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's gone from Dark Souls 2 to Dark Souls 1 to Dark Souls 3,

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
back to Dark Souls 1 Remastered.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The Babadooks pooxpen everywhere.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What channel is that on again?

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I forget which of your channels.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I upload them all on the Blue Glow.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They're all unlisted, because most of them are Patreon exclusives.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, I see.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What I'm doing with the Blue Glow is that I'm just stockpiling unlisted videos

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
until I have enough to release a video every week for the rest of time.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Nice.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's a good method of doing that, actually.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've had many times where I tried to be like,

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
alright, I'm going to fucking schedule a video to come out every week forever,

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but I have to make like 52 videos initially to cover the whole year.

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And so I will set about trying to do that and make like 10,

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and then I'll have 10 weeks of videos and it's great,

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
but releasing them to just patrons is a better way of going about it,

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
because then you're still making money off of it.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, someday I will come out and be like,

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
hey, everybody, guess what? The Blue Glow is every fucking week now,

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and everyone will love me,

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and everyone will finally get to see the entire saga of Babadook Spook.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But until then, Patreon.com slash endless jests and fuck shit.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I have already kept up with the saga of Babadook Spook.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You just have to keep playing Dark Souls forever,

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
because that way no one will ever realize that they've all been made 10 years ago.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's like, why is he playing 10-year-old games?

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Because Dark Souls, duh.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can mod yourself, you can mod the Babadook into perhaps,

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
well, Bloodborne, I'm sure there's some Babadook Spook stuff you could do.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
In Sekiro, you could definitely mod in some Babadook.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You see the mod the guy made for Bloodborne,

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
where you can control the enemies and play as all the enemy characters?

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No, that sounds sick.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, it keeps popping up on Twitter, it looks fucking rad.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Apparently, like the way the debug mode in Bloodborne was designed

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
is that all the enemies work like playable characters,

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
so he just like brought that to the forefront,

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
so you can just play as enemies in the game now.

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Does that include bosses by any chance?

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know, but I would assume so.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm gonna play as the one reborn and lumber around and like puke on enemies and shit.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That would be insane.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're fucking sick.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
People are gonna be like, hey, why are Jess and Digi playing Tomb Raider fucking

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and talking about Ratton 2?

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Tomb Raider 2.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We're just reminiscing, that's all, wink, wink.

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Jesse, we lost like all that Luigi footage, right?

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have the files, but I like cannot get them converted on any program.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They're like just a weird file type that I can't get to work anywhere.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's fucking mega unfortunate.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We have like 20 hours of us playing fucking New Super Luigi bros that like,

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
for some reason cannot work.

230
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Someday, the world will see them.

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm dedicated to it.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's like how you have to put a person who has like terminal cancer to cryostasis

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
until the technology has to save them in a thousand years.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Man, speaking of computers, messing up my entire life by not working properly

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and file types being weird.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I spent like all of this month because I finally got my computer like set up

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
in my nice cozy little office.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And so I was working on a big like a vlog project video.

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It was like, it was gonna be like a classic endless Jess style video where it starts

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
as just a weird bit and a vlog and then it spirals out of control

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
into some complex three hour nightmare that nobody should ever want to watch.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I was making that I was filming it all month for my for my friendly patrons.

243
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I was just, I just, I can't do it now because like something about the file,

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I filmed it on the webcam of my laptop, all of it.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And something about the file when it's in Sony Vegas,

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Sony Vegas immediately crashes every time I open it.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And like, it'll let me work on it for like five minutes and then it'll crash.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And it's just like, okay, video is not that good.

249
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I give up.

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Fuck it.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm just gonna throw this out here.

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Because I recently, after years and years of Unison Vegas,

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I discovered, if maybe this is something similar,

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that if I simply put too many MOV files in one Sony Vegas project,

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the whole thing simply stops working and will eventually, I think it crashes.

257
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So maybe if too many MOV files, I don't know.

258
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's possible.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Who knows.

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey, give it a try.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Maybe it's, maybe.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Handbrake, handbrake, all to MP4.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, no.

264
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I try to handbrake.

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Like I turned them all into MP4s to get them to play.

266
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But even then, they're like bad MP4s.

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They just kill it.

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I've had issues like this.

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Vegas is fucking terrible.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I know everybody just uses Vegas because I recommended it way back

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
because that was what I used.

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But everybody's always like, why do you use Vegas?

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's fucking terrible.

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Go learn Premiere.

275
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I'm like, but it looks hard.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It does look hard.

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It is hard.

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I used it just the other day.

279
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's not that hard.

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's not that hard.

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay.

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Specifically with Premiere.

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I thought you were a Premiere user.

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I didn't know you were using Vegas.

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No.

287
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I have used it here and there.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
In fact, just the other day.

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I've seen you do things that I didn't think you could do in Vegas.

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, that is true.

291
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But like I've just kind of gotten a lease.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I've always meant to transition to Premiere like long term.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I just never summoned the testicular fortitude to, you know, put in the effort to make the

294
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
transition.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I used it for a good long time back in the day.

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't know.

297
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think TBAP stuff.

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But like, I was just the other day.

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
All right.

300
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,120
I was doing a little fucking around at Premiere trying to do something.

301
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
And I was just trying to like copy a section.

302
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,760
And it was like, like, okay, I have, I drop in a track.

303
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,120
I cut it at a certain point.

304
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,600
That's reasonably easy to do.

305
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,800
But to try to copy one section of footage proved impossible.

306
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,840
I could not figure out how to do it other than to like, I cut off the section I wanted.

307
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
I moved it aside in the track.

308
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,080
Then I like re-dragged out the piece that I had cut off from the original piece, cut

309
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,520
it again, and then like dragged it over so I could work with like the second piece.

310
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,320
Control C, control V.

311
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,840
I tried control C.

312
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm pretty sure I tried that.

313
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
I don't know.

314
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Maybe I fucked up.

315
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
It sucks.

316
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm pretty sure that works.

317
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm pretty sure that works.

318
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,960
I was giving you the most, the scoffest scoff I have ever heard.

319
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Okay.

320
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
I'll give you another thing.

321
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm just very confused.

322
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
I know that this doesn't work in Premiere though.

323
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,760
I haven't used the new version of Premiere, so maybe they changed it.

324
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,840
I mean, that's an Adobe thing to do to just, they changed all their hotkeys in like last

325
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
year and everyone was pissed.

326
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Here's something though.

327
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,520
Here's something that Vegas can do and is unironically superior to what Premiere does.

328
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,480
And it's that if you've got two video files in Vegas on the same video track and you drag

329
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,880
to overlap them, Premiere just doesn't let you.

330
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,960
And it's like kind of annoying and it sucks.

331
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,920
What Vegas will do is instantly overlap them and fade between them automatically.

332
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,720
Now that is convenient.

333
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,120
Premiere just doesn't do that and it sucks.

334
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
It's insane that it doesn't do that.

335
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Man, I don't.

336
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
You have to like manually create a fade on both tracks and put one on a separate.

337
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Alright, we gotta stop talking about this.

338
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
I don't understand any program.

339
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Alright, it's gonna hurt the fuck we're talking about.

340
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
It's fine, fine.

341
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,520
You know, it's the same, it's the same horrid fear that I have every time that I'm like,

342
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm looking at my desktop and I think, I'm gonna try to make a dope rap beat on Fruity

343
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,920
Loops and I open it up and I look at it and I go, no.

344
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,480
This isn't a real, this is not a real program.

345
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
No one actually uses this.

346
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,560
I don't believe it.

347
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,840
This is bullshit.

348
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,040
It's like looking at a system of like steam work pipes and like organs like controlled

349
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,600
by instruments and shit.

350
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,400
Like Fruity Loops is one of the least like intuitive to look at out of the box programs

351
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I've ever seen.

352
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,160
And like the only reason I figured out how to use it is that I watched my brother's

353
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,400
shade do it.

354
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,880
But I'm also retarded with programs like the fucking May has been using Vegas for a while

355
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,120
and she's planning to start using Premiere on her new laptop.

356
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,760
But like, but like she found things that you could do that I have been using this program

357
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,920
for seven fucking years that didn't know like basic things that she figured out it could

358
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
do.

359
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,320
So I'm just like, okay, well, because I don't think about, and I know Tom, you're a tech

360
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,240
guy and you said something that kind of blew my mind one time when you were like, yeah,

361
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,840
like if there's a problem that I run into in tech, I assume that there's a solution

362
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,840
and try to find the solution, like, you know, and then like give up if I can't find it.

363
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,320
Like my methodology has always been, I just, I just work with what I know to work.

364
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,260
You know, like I don't go and say, oh, I want to do this.

365
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,440
Let me figure out how I go.

366
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,400
What can I do that I know how to do?

367
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,240
And then I do that, you know, it's interesting how these thought process, if you look at

368
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,480
our videos, they're informed by these thought processes and our approach, very, very simplistic

369
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
stuff.

370
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,880
I mean, I will throw like, if I can't figure out how to do something, if I do have on

371
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,240
the rare occasion, I have like an idea.

372
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,600
If I can't figure out how to do it in like 10 minutes, I throw it away.

373
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,120
I'm just like, yeah, fuck it, you know, it's also like, it's, it's, it's lazier, but it's

374
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,160
also funnier to do it bad at this point that's like, I worked for so many years to like learn

375
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,680
how to do things right and how to edit well.

376
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,480
And then like now I look at it and like, yeah, but it's funnier if I edit poorly.

377
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,440
So I just like throw it literally prefer poorly edited.

378
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,480
Like goofy things cause they seem self aware and cute and charming as opposed to like visual

379
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,160
effects, art history, but there is like, which looks phony on Kenny Valley shit.

380
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,880
There is like no beat making programs that I will ever understand the, the only good

381
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,320
one, the, the classic program that I used to make all my great music and rap beats on

382
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,120
was a program called magic's music maker 16.

383
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,720
And that's where I made the butt chugger beat and the reapers beat and all those classic

384
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,640
tunes that everyone loves.

385
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:19,480
I, you know, and it was like, it's like considered by people a bad program because it's not like,

386
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,880
I don't know, I guess you can't do all the fancy like actual producers shit, but all

387
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,320
it was, it's just like a shitload of genres and samples from like every conceivable genre

388
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
of music.

389
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,040
And you just click and drag the samples and build them on top of each other and build

390
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
what you want.

391
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
It's like musical lego.

392
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,680
That's exactly what the, on max, they have something called garage band that like often

393
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,480
just comes at new max and it's exactly like that.

394
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,120
It was so intuitive and so fucking easy to use.

395
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,920
And I made beats on it that people remember and love.

396
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,440
Everybody loves the butt chugger beat.

397
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,880
Everybody loves reapers.

398
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,800
And so like, I, I've always wanted to like recapture that magic, but like the program

399
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,720
is so old that it doesn't work on like new computers.

400
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,560
I've even, I've gone back on Amazon and like, I've bought the program again on a disc and

401
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,360
tried to get it to install on my new computer and like, it just doesn't work right.

402
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,200
It always is fucked up now.

403
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,040
So I have to use fruity loops, which doesn't work.

404
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
So I give up.

405
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,840
That's a talent that I no longer have, I guess, because they took away my Legos.

406
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,120
I got to these roblox.

407
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,640
It's just not the same.

408
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Yeah.

409
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,040
Have you seen this video?

410
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Maybe.

411
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,680
You know, Diplo blocks, something, uh, those, those big ones, this one, Diplo musician.

412
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
I don't.

413
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
I don't.

414
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Duplo.

415
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Duplo.

416
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Yeah.

417
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
That's the one.

418
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
That's the one.

419
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Or Lego Technics or Mega Blocks.

420
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Mega.

421
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Or Playmobile.

422
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
That's more like it.

423
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Hey, speaking of Mega Blocks.

424
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Bionicle.

425
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Oh, do you?

426
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,240
Speaking of Bionicle, you know what we should do?

427
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,640
Buy Greenland.

428
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
This is a proposal that we should a hundred percent as a nation do.

429
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Don't we already own Greenland?

430
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
No.

431
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Denmark owns it.

432
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
We already own the entire world.

433
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
The rest of the world doesn't realize it yet.

434
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,440
I thought we were going to sell Greenland to Denmark.

435
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,340
The quite the contrary.

436
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,920
I don't think it's going to happen.

437
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm just saying we should definitely do it because it sounds sick.

438
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Yeah.

439
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
And Greenland is really big.

440
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,640
So I saw Trump tweeted that the Denmark lady didn't want to, didn't want to do it.

441
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Very true.

442
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
But we got to put the squeeze on her somehow.

443
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,360
Didn't the Denmark lady said she doesn't even have the authority to do that?

444
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
I don't know.

445
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
I did not look into this.

446
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
It's, it's real estate.

447
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,960
I was too busy responding to some idiot on Twitter to pay attention to this.

448
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
It's real estate.

449
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,600
If we invade with the military, it'll basically be free real estate.

450
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
We can make it free.

451
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
We can make it free.

452
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,000
Is there a reason we actually would want Greenland?

453
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Maybe.

454
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Okay.

455
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,360
Like literally all I know about Greenland is that everyone kills themselves there.

456
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
One, it's sick.

457
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Okay.

458
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,280
Two, there's some bullshit about like the ISIS thawing and it might improve shipping

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
routes.

460
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I don't care about that shit.

461
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,080
I just want to buy fucking Greenland.

462
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
It would be sick.

463
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
I could go there.

464
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,520
I think that we're, we're, we want it because like the, like global warming has made it

465
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
a better place.

466
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Like, is that real?

467
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,640
Well, not now, but the, the theory is that in time that will do so.

468
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Isn't the North Pole, Greenland is like kind of the North Pole because the actual North

469
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,280
Pole, you can't stand there because it's water and ice.

470
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Something like that.

471
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Yeah.

472
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Yeah.

473
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,320
But Greenland, the northern most point of Greenland is like where Santa probably hangs

474
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
out.

475
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,960
Oh, if we, if we control Christmas, we control the world.

476
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,440
That's what he's doing.

477
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Exactly.

478
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
It's tactically beneficial.

479
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,400
The thought that like Santa would reside in the country with like the highest suicide

480
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,000
rate in the world is really sad.

481
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,520
Why do you think he does Christmas is to keep him from offing himself?

482
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,160
He has to give himself purpose.

483
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,720
He's probably like one of those like evil horror movie Santas like rare exports or the

484
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,400
Bill Goldberg one Santa's sleigh and sleigh is spelled S L A Y.

485
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Yes.

486
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,240
Nate, I saw this video the other day.

487
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Have you seen this?

488
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,600
It's a video about Tifa and it's by some like, it's a, it's like a real lefty boy

489
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,520
who clearly has never played a video game in his fucking life.

490
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,480
The video is called the outrage is about control, not breasts.

491
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,080
And it's a 20 minute video of him like calling everybody in cells and not understanding shit

492
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
about fuck.

493
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Of course.

494
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,120
And he like rambles about like institutionalized racism for like 10 minutes, which has nothing

495
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
to fucking do with anything.

496
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,400
Is that like cause a barrette or something?

497
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Is that?

498
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,960
No, he just has no idea what he's taught.

499
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,640
He's just like spewing the talking points that he knows in relation to every single

500
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,080
topic, even when it has nothing to do with them.

501
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,160
You and I just aren't the target audience because we actually play a big game.

502
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,600
But the reason I bring it up is because right in the beginning of the video, he uses your

503
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,440
tweet as an example of like stupid in cells on the internet.

504
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,040
You know, quite a few people used my initial tweet about like, I think, I would, I would

505
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,280
I was pretty, pretty extreme, but I was like extremely disappointed about them nerfing

506
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,200
TV, blah, blah, blah.

507
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,640
He has like, he has like your tweet next to a bunch of like clips, like a bunch of images

508
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,600
from 4chan people saying like, we should mass murder Square Enix and that's right in the

509
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
middle of those.

510
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,320
I've been good company boys.

511
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm the, what I'm the crypto fascist to their, you know, full on fascist.

512
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,800
Oh God, that I'm glad that we're bringing that up.

513
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Somebody told me in my, in my discord that like, that their friends were like, we're

514
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,640
like, oh Digi bro, that guy is a crypto fascist.

515
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,680
And I was like, what in the name of fuck is that?

516
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,320
And where do I sign up to be one?

517
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Cause it sounds awesome.

518
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
It sounds sick.

519
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,120
It sounds like the coolest thing to be.

520
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,520
It's not as, it's, it's not as cool as you think.

521
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,800
No, apparently it just means it's actually worse than a rate.

522
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
It's actually lame or than a regular fascist.

523
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,800
I guess, I guess like sends subliminal messages out to people.

524
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,800
I just, I just, every time I hear a fascist who won't admit it.

525
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Okay.

526
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,760
I just, it just to me, it sounds like a fascist who's really into Bitcoin is like waiting

527
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,360
for the market to swing up again.

528
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
You would hope.

529
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
You would hope.

530
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,400
So I think it's, they could be as well.

531
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,120
I think they just like to put crypto on things now.

532
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,040
Like crypto is one of those, he's just like, he's a hardcore fascist for bitcoins.

533
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,160
Like fuck Ethereum.

534
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
That shit is gay.

535
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
None of that lefty eats in my presence, Bitcoin cash only.

536
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Here's the thing.

537
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,280
It's that punk as a suffix is no longer interesting.

538
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,920
Like nobody cares about being punk anymore.

539
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Everybody wants to be crypto.

540
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
What if you're a crypto punk?

541
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
You want to go into the internet.

542
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
So you have to be, oh my God.

543
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
I don't think you want to be crypto.

544
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
My mind is fucking blown.

545
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Crypto punk.

546
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Crypto punk dude.

547
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Crypto punk.

548
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:51,120
Crypto punk would be like a, I don't know, like a business guy who wears like a

549
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,680
suit and stuff, but then like, he's like secretly, he's like a revolutionary or something.

550
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,840
He's like secretly in a rock band.

551
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,600
He's wearing like a suit, a suit coat, but underneath it, it's like a t-shirt with an

552
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,000
alien giving the peace sign and like smoking a fat dub.

553
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,960
And he's got like a, he's got like a bandana around his head.

554
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,040
He like wears a suit all day, but like he has like sleeves all the way down like his

555
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
arms.

556
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
He just hides them with his suit.

557
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
He's like, yeah.

558
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Yeah.

559
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Crypto punk happening.

560
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Real trademarked.

561
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Kind of neat.

562
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,480
To that, to that guy in that video, I mean, you know, I totally understand on a surface

563
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,080
level why people complaining about a minor character detail being changed seems superfluous

564
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
and unnecessary.

565
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
I get it.

566
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,640
I expected fully people like on the video I made about it to like not care and think

567
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm an incel and a dumbass.

568
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
That's fine.

569
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
That's fine.

570
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
But I don't know.

571
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,560
I just, it's just that they don't care.

572
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
And I do.

573
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,320
He's taking a very specific outrage and he's applying it to his idea of the world.

574
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,800
And like he's clearly not a guy who fucking like loved this game and doesn't, he doesn't

575
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
understand it.

576
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Like people just don't want shit change.

577
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
People don't like remakes.

578
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
That's like, what's.

579
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
This is my.

580
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,680
What's the more believable answer that everyone, whether they know it or not, is secretly hates

581
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,320
women and doesn't want like the power to balance in the direction of women or that people just

582
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,040
don't like remakes and don't want shit changed.

583
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Right.

584
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I mean, you'd think people wouldn't be.

585
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Well, okay.

586
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,280
I mean, people wouldn't like Tifa because she is literally a strong independent woman,

587
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,480
but she does spend a lot of the game fawning on cloud to be fair.

588
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Yeah.

589
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,840
But I hate the notion that that is not a strong female character.

590
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,520
I mean, that that's very like a strong female character nowadays is basically a strong male

591
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
character.

592
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,480
Like they can't do anything traditionally female at all.

593
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
They can't.

594
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,560
It does raise the question of what, what is a feminine way to be as opposed to a masculine

595
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
way to be.

596
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
And I'm not sure what.

597
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,520
I mean, like it just feels like an overcorrection in general, you know, when it's like women

598
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,000
are different and certain feminine traits can also be strong and cool.

599
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,880
They're not like abnormal, but they these when people want like strong female characters

600
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,360
to not have any flaws, it's like they're overcorrecting to such a degree that they're

601
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,520
making the character weird and unrelatable because they're not acting like a fucking

602
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,400
woman.

603
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I mean, true.

604
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,600
Now none of this necessarily applies to Tifa because we haven't played the game, but you

605
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,440
know, these are these are the general concerns of people.

606
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,840
Hey, what can you do?

607
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,000
She has to get pregnant and have a baby and and like have a, it's been the whole game

608
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
with like one of those like front backpacks that hold your baby in it every battle.

609
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah.

610
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,120
And she has to be a single mother protecting her baby.

611
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,360
She has to and she has to give birth to it without screaming or crying at all.

612
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Just totally stoic.

613
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
I don't know.

614
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I don't know.

615
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
That's too traditionally feminine.

616
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
She also has to be a techno billionaire.

617
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,080
I don't think she'll have to like found a startup corporation.

618
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,600
I don't think like much of modern feminism angle usually paints like like even the character

619
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
as a mother.

620
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
I think like motherhood is seen as like two.

621
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,360
Oh, she has to be a mom.

622
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
It's very stereotypical.

623
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Yeah.

624
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Yeah.

625
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
Agreed.

626
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
The whole mom thing.

627
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,000
Well, on the opposite side of the being a mom is cliche now in modern cultures on the

628
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
office.

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,840
You know, there's, I don't know if I said this before, but there's one extremely hilarious

630
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,360
lefty tweet I saw that I actually thought was incredible from, I don't know, some girl.

631
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,000
I don't remember her name, but she was just like, like, mother gives birth to female child

632
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
father.

633
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,400
You know, I just feel like it's kind of pandering to have these like female children.

634
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,520
It's just like playing into the, it's an overcorrection at this point.

635
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
You know what I'm saying?

636
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Why did it have to be a female?

637
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
Why did you have to make this political?

638
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Yeah.

639
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,000
Well, on the, on the opposite side of this baby is SJW propaganda.

640
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,720
On the other side of the insane people who take everything too seriously coin, I also

641
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,560
found like the opposite of that video.

642
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,240
And it was like, uh, it was a, like a real, it was like a real right wing guy, I guess.

643
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Yeah.

644
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,560
He was, the channel was called blackpilled.

645
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:04,000
So that should tell you, he was talking about the, he was talking about the movie, the stepford

646
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,400
wives and how like, you know, it was made by Jews and it's secretly propaganda to make

647
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,440
women not want to be housewives and manufacture that, manufacture unhappiness and the American

648
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,920
female and all that stuff.

649
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,000
And he's like, and he's just like every single thing that happens in the movie, he's like,

650
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,680
he's going through how it like is propaganda to make women unhappy and think they have to

651
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,280
rise up against men or hate men or something.

652
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,160
But like, it was equally hilarious because like, even if like, I don't know, like one

653
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,120
in every five points is coherent, but like, he's so, he was so angry about it.

654
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,720
He was so disgusted by this, by this old horror movie.

655
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,680
That's just, you know, I, for one, am glad that the Jews are manufacturing discontent

656
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,760
among women since it's our main cultural export.

657
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
It's never been more profitable.

658
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
It's our bread and butter.

659
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,440
I mean, like, I don't know, even if it was true and I agreed with every word of it, uh,

660
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,560
I mean, if, if making propaganda to make women unhappy results in like cool old horror movies

661
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,480
then go right the fuck ahead.

662
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,920
Uh, yeah, pretty much, pretty much.

663
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,200
If making women unhappy is wrong, I don't want to be right.

664
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,120
If sowing discord between the sexes and destabilizing society is wrong.

665
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,600
That guy's argument, just going by what you presented just now is like, uh, like obviously

666
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,160
the movie is born out of the fact that like, there are some women who feel like pressured

667
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:36,400
to be this way and they want to present that like the horror of that, like to, to suggest

668
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,000
that it's like a weird Jewish propaganda.

669
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
It's like, no, it's just relatable.

670
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:49,560
Like, yeah, I mean, like, I do believe that everything is propaganda to destroy society.

671
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,320
I'm just smart enough not to say the word Jew because that's what you get in trouble.

672
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,240
We all know what I mean, but I just don't say it.

673
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,320
Uh, you gotta be like John Tron and say global elites.

674
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,240
Yeah, that's the way we all know that all kinds of a parentheses, parentheses, parentheses,

675
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,920
people make movies, you know?

676
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:16,880
Yeah, I mean, like I'm probably, I'm probably, uh, it, uh, in the case of a total crypto

677
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,560
fascist, those crypto fascist black pillars that would be crypto fascism.

678
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:21,800
Right.

679
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,280
Like the, the, I mean, like, he didn't, just the crypto anarcho fascist.

680
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,400
I'm just everything.

681
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,160
Just keep tacking on words.

682
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,280
Keep tacking on labels until I have encompassed all labels.

683
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
And that's how I'll finally destroy labels.

684
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:43,040
Crystal, Eiko, Anarka, uh, when, when everyone is every label, nobody is any label.

685
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,720
Black pills, blue pills, more pills than your body.

686
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,600
I'm just the fucking pill bottle over here.

687
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,480
I hold them all.

688
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,360
I, yeah, the guy didn't come off like totally retarded or stupid or anything, but like

689
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,520
just the fact that he was so into this and so mad about it was the funny.

690
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,280
You know, it's, uh, uh, this just reminds me it's pretty much whenever we, we, we look

691
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,960
at any media we consume through our own particular lens.

692
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,920
And it's just natural that we get out of it.

693
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,200
The things that we want to, uh, I don't know, like, like, it's interesting to

694
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,120
know, like the way that I watched Garin log and compared to those guys I talked

695
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,880
about last time, they got a totally different message and everyone's going

696
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,960
to be like that with everything.

697
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,880
I see the Babadook and I see, yes, I do hate children.

698
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,240
And then it turns around and it says, wait, children can be good.

699
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,800
And I'm like, well, now I'm just confused.

700
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,480
I don't know what I'm supposed to believe anymore.

701
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,520
Uh, I speak, speaking of the shonen Ronan, I like how he bombed into our

702
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,600
comment section on the last episode to say, to say that Ben was right about

703
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,120
everything and we were all retarded.

704
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,160
And I'm assuming Ben logged into the, the TPC account and

705
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,680
favorited the comment because it has a heart on it.

706
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,480
I just happened to be logged in the only comment with a heart on it.

707
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,520
He said, he said, he said, he said someone called the why, one of the, I forget

708
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,160
which of the two like lefty current videos, but he said someone called it Ben

709
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,640
St. Corp and it was the highest compliment that they could receive.

710
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,960
And he was correct.

711
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,520
I, uh, you know, what's up, shonen Ronan.

712
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,900
That's what I, you know, actually, I, I, I don't think this is like a

713
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,240
secret or anything, but I know, remember that guy at the Hunter Hunter,

714
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,440
2011 Dick writing association guy?

715
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:14,480
Yeah.

716
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,880
That guy is like the biggest lefty meme dude in the world.

717
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,600
That person is, is I think one of the people working on the shonen run.

718
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,120
It's like a team of people or something.

719
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,520
So there, so there's a little bit of info for you.

720
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,280
And by the way, I commented on their video.

721
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,240
Like the, the second one sounded particularly aggressive and mean towards

722
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,600
me and I just, in a cordial way, just posted like, Hey guys, just so you

723
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,640
know, I'm not, I'm not actually like an anarcho capitalist.

724
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,520
I don't believe in these things, but you know, it's okay.

725
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,600
We have different interpretations and I wish you well.

726
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,440
Good luck everybody.

727
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,800
And, uh, we just proceeded to have a very cordial discussion about, uh, this.

728
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,080
So we're on good terms.

729
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,360
Me and the shonen Ronan, uh, as a collective shout out to Hunter Hunter Dick

730
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,840
writing association and sort out online dick writing is Dick writing

731
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,880
association, both very long time commenters who have been.

732
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,440
One, a pure capitalist, one, a pure communist.

733
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,520
So there could be no peace between the two.

734
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
Well, now what?

735
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm, I'm going to be fucking like Onyx Pilled.

736
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,720
I need, I need to invent a new pill for me, for my people.

737
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,720
Fucking pill, you know what?

738
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,320
Cause you know, people call themselves black pilled, but they're not really black

739
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,600
pilled. They care too much.

740
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
They're too mad about stuff.

741
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,240
If you were truly.

742
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,640
Oh, you have to be, uh, you have to take the iron pill.

743
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,520
You ever read those iron pill comics?

744
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,560
I feel like I've seen the images, but I don't, I don't have them all memorized.

745
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,120
That's a pretty funny, uh, comic series called take the iron pill about a guy who

746
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,160
is like transcended above all the other pill guys.

747
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,000
That sounds cool.

748
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,880
I want, I want a little bit of that weightlifter.

749
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,400
I want a little bit of the iron pill.

750
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,600
It sounds like it's not, you know, those comics about like all the different

751
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,720
countries, like talking to each other, Poland ball.

752
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,360
That is exactly what it's like.

753
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
It is exactly like that.

754
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,280
Poland ball is one of them.

755
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,440
Yeah.

756
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,080
But with pills, I want to go to the pharmacist and I just want to be like,

757
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:07,840
Hey man, give me like a, give me two iron pills, one black pill, half a red pill.

758
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,440
And, uh, and also some Onyx pills, which haven't been invented yet, but get on it.

759
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,360
Uh, and then I'll have the perfect brain.

760
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,960
I want to, I want to go to a pharmacy and request moods or feelings specifically

761
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,200
and just say like, Hey, I'm looking for like, you know, two thirds happiness,

762
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,640
uh, one, one contentedness, three fourths, you know, rage, it's like,

763
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,480
it's like, it's like a replicator from Star Trek, except you stick your head in

764
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,760
it and it zaps you with radiation to make you feel what you need.

765
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,920
That sounds great.

766
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,160
This, this should, I mean, this should be possible, right?

767
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,000
Like with current technology, like, I mean, we have uppers and downers at the

768
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,200
very, at the very, you know, outset.

769
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Yeah, we've got 60s drugs and 70s drugs and 80s drugs and they all do

770
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,360
different shit.

771
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,440
This is how, you know, when we've reached crypto punk is when we can do this,

772
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,040
like easily over the counter.

773
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,640
That's definitely a crypto punk kind of thing.

774
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,720
I want to be a big drugs head.

775
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,640
Yeah, uh, same, same.

776
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,000
You know, I don't know if it's, if it's just me being, uh, when I was young,

777
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,520
I was legitimately scared of alcohol because it made my dad at goofy and weird.

778
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,760
And I didn't understand what was going on and so I was like spooked by it.

779
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,280
Um, and then later on when I became an adult, I got more, more at peace with it.

780
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,120
And I did my drinking for a while and now, now I'm back in a place where I'm

781
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,880
like drinking is fine on occasion.

782
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,880
It could be a loosening experience, but I just don't really need it like day to

783
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,160
day, but like, I kind of like, I just don't like the idea of like taking

784
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,640
chemicals to change me.

785
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,040
But then I think, well, am I, am I so perfect right now?

786
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,160
Maybe drugs would improve this whole scheme I've got going on in here.

787
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,720
I mean, why is my natural state necessarily the ideal or best one?

788
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,720
I think about that a lot.

789
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,440
And I always feel like, uh, anything that I accomplished with the use of substances

790
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,480
is cheating, but that's saying that anyone who's like depressed or

791
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,040
takes antidepressants is cheating.

792
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,960
Your whole brain is just made of chemicals.

793
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,160
I unironically believe that using antidepressants is cheating.

794
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,800
Well, you know what?

795
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,080
You know what?

796
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,600
And it's not the right way to think.

797
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,800
It just is how I think.

798
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,600
I know what you mean.

799
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
I don't understand.

800
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,680
Aren't you fucking like all about transhumanism?

801
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,640
Like how can you reconcile these two things?

802
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,360
Because transhumanism is, uh, uh, modifying your body with like machines and stuff.

803
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,440
And it's like a conscious thing.

804
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,800
Like you're choosing to do that.

805
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,160
Whereas with, with drugs and stuff, it's altering your mind state.

806
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,680
And you can't like, you're not thinking, like, I didn't expect you

807
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,920
to make this distinction, Tom.

808
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,000
This is interesting because like in, in Ghost in the Shell and whatnot,

809
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,320
people just like install shit that makes them, first of all, they can

810
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,120
like connect to the internet with their own brain and absorb info.

811
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,840
I think the thing about like subsistence and stuff specifically that I find weird

812
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,200
is that like you're, you're changing your mind state, right?

813
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,360
And you're, you're no longer like the thought processes of like the things

814
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,560
that you're thinking and doing, they're not entirely 100% rooted in yourself.

815
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,800
No, your mental state at any given time is your mental state at any

816
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,080
given time is just an output of like your chemical makeup.

817
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,920
Well, not change the way you think at all.

818
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,320
Like it's not like that.

819
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,640
I, I mean, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just changing your

820
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,040
perception of the way you think.

821
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,600
It's just changing like, sure.

822
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay.

823
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,440
For instance, when I dropped acid, basically it was, it was not

824
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,880
difficult to understand what was happening, which is simply that on average,

825
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,280
you intake a ridiculous amount of sensory data, like you're constantly

826
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,360
intaking gallons and gallons of it and your brain is sorting it all out and

827
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,040
ignoring the vast majority of it.

828
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,280
The only difference when you're on acid is that it does not

829
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,840
sort those things the same way.

830
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Like you don't make the same distinctions between like what is valuable

831
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,200
data and what isn't.

832
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,080
So like if you're staring at a picture or something, your brain is so

833
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,320
overwhelmed by the amount of data it's taking in that the picture starts

834
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,920
moving because it can't quite fixate on it.

835
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,640
You know, it's just getting too much information, you know?

836
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,320
So it's not that your brain is thinking different necessarily, it's just

837
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,280
that, you know, it's not fixating on the same thing it would, it would

838
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,600
always fix on, you know?

839
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,240
I don't think that you interpret what's happening that differently.

840
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,160
Like, you know, I don't think that like the way I act or the things I say or

841
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,480
think about when I'm high are any different from the stuff I would say

842
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,400
or think about when I'm not, it's just that I'm more concentrated on it.

843
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,920
You know, it's just like, I want to be thinking because it's fun.

844
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,080
Cause I'm, you know, really in my head and I'm thinking faster or like it's

845
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,400
like time dilates a little bit, you know, like the flow of time doesn't feel the

846
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,800
same.

847
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,600
So you might be sitting there for 10 minutes and have thoughts that feel

848
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,640
like they've lasted an hour, you know, because you're just thinking faster than

849
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,600
you normally would be.

850
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,000
But like, again, it's not different thoughts.

851
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,880
It's not like you're a different person.

852
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,880
So to me, it just feels like, I mean, basically just modification.

853
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,920
Like I made a video called metahumanism began way back when I first got really

854
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,520
into weed where I was talking about how like, you know, different strains of weed

855
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,720
literally have different effects and you can figure out what they are.

856
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,840
And like, if you want to calm yourself down, like you can consistently take

857
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,120
indica and just, you know what mind state is going to put you in.

858
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,800
So it's not like it's just taking agency away from you.

859
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,240
I think people feel robbed of agency when they do drugs or drink alcohol because

860
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,840
they don't understand what's happening.

861
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,680
Like they don't know why it's changing them.

862
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,400
They don't understand the mechanism of it.

863
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,040
They don't know exactly what the changes are.

864
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,360
Once you know the changes, they're consistent.

865
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,560
It's always the same thing.

866
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,960
I can drink and I always know how I'm going to act.

867
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,160
I always know exactly what's going to happen because I've just observed the way

868
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,200
I act when I get like different stages of drunk.

869
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,800
You know, if I if I smoke an indica, I'm going to lay on the couch.

870
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,600
I'm going to do nothing but watch anime and eat everything in the house.

871
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,640
If I take a sativa, I'm going to have, I'm going to start dropping black pills

872
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,880
like bombs on Yokohama.

873
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,800
I'm going to fucking have a billion thoughts in my head and I'm going to

874
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,000
want to write something, you know, and it's like, that's consistent.

875
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,920
I can track it.

876
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,600
That's why I think drugs are cool.

877
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,400
Well, okay, you know, that's all perfectly reasonable.

878
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,640
And I fully admit, I don't have a vast experience with drugs.

879
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,080
I did a bunch of drinking and I did some weed in college fairly regularly.

880
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,880
And like my only experiences have been across the board are simply that,

881
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,800
like I've just lost the rest of the day.

882
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,360
It might be really fun, but I can't do any work.

883
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,640
And so, like for me, most of my day or whenever I'm like, should I just

884
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,600
like get drunk this afternoon, which occasionally crossed my mind.

885
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,000
It's like, well, no, because I've got things to do.

886
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,320
So that would just interrupt that process.

887
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,800
Where do I get that new drug?

888
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,720
What's it called?

889
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,800
Happiness.

890
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,080
Who's working on that one?

891
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,560
I don't know.

892
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,760
Yeah, hasn't been released yet.

893
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,720
The trailers look sick.

894
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,600
I've been, I've been searching for it in every comment section on YouTube,

895
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,560
but I haven't found it yet.

896
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,640
You might not be that into weed or alcohol, but have you ever considered

897
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,040
just like taking Adderall or something?

898
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,240
Considered, sure.

899
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,720
Because it is, it's like the few times I've done that.

900
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,440
Adderall is unironically the only good drug.

901
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,560
Adderall is, I mean, again, it has all these drugs have different

902
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,520
effects on different people.

903
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,920
So, you know, consult your pharmacist before use.

904
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,120
I'll be your pharmacist.

905
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,960
No, don't actually ask me about drugs.

906
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,280
Just listen to my podcasts about them.

907
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,320
Um, Adderall makes, for me anyway, it, it makes me feel like really charged up.

908
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,720
My skin starts tingling and I'm like, I have to sweat.

909
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,600
Like I have to do something to sweat or else I'm going to catch on fire.

910
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,760
So I'm going to clean the entire house.

911
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,160
Like every time I've done Adderall, it's just like, bam, house gets cleaned.

912
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,600
Everything gets organized.

913
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,880
Everything gets put away, ready for work.

914
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,560
Like super focused.

915
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,880
Did you, I'm with you.

916
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,320
This is perfectly reasonable.

917
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,720
And I'm sure it could definitely have these effects, but when, when

918
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,400
these types of things come up, I feel similarly to what Tom was saying before.

919
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,760
And it's that, okay, let's say that like I'm able to be very productive

920
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,800
with Adderall or whatever.

921
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,960
And maybe I can even afford it, but like there could come a time

922
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,080
where I don't have that Adderall.

923
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,880
And what I worry about is that this artificial boost to my productivity

924
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,560
or whatever falls away.

925
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,440
And then I'm now at a reduced state of my natural.

926
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,360
Think of it like you're playing Mario Kart and you got to get those mushrooms.

927
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,280
So you can go a little faster, you know.

928
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,080
The mushroom is a one time use item.

929
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,720
You just, you hit the mushroom and you go a little faster.

930
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,440
But did you, but did you, when I play RPGs, I'm the kind of guy, when I play

931
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,560
a JRPG, you have those single item use, like stat boosting items that you know

932
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,280
are really good, but you save them for the entire game.

933
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,080
Because you never know when you're going to actually quote unquote need them.

934
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,000
And you end up being the final boss without ever using them once in the game.

935
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,800
I did that too.

936
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,680
And like in a lot of games, there's trade offs where like, you know, in Pokemon,

937
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,560
if you use a rare candy, doesn't give you the same stat boost, right?

938
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,280
Like it, right?

939
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,560
Like I've used an EV stone kit.

940
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,480
So it's like, you know, that's, that's like, there are some, you know,

941
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,080
performance enhancing drugs that have drawbacks.

942
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,760
You're not really building the muscles in the natural way or whatever.

943
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,080
It's not, you know, not building everything up correctly.

944
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,160
But like I said, I think of it less as like, it's not a permanent upgrade, you know,

945
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,800
it's like hitting, again, it's like hitting a mushroom.

946
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,360
And I don't know why I keep saying hitting a mushroom because you would normally

947
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,840
use a mushroom in a, you know what I mean?

948
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,440
Oh, wait, in Mario Kart.

949
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,400
Oh, no, in the in the minecart ride in Super Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars,

950
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,920
you do in fact hit the mushroom and gives you a speed boost as opposed to, you know,

951
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,720
you know, it's weird.

952
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,560
I've never like been dependent on any substance.

953
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,920
I've never like become addicted to something.

954
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,520
Like I, I get really drunk three times a year and I'm good.

955
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,480
And like, I get, I like, I'll take like an Adderall when I can find one,

956
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,960
which is almost never because nothing is available.

957
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,040
That's probably the trick.

958
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:04,520
I just know that I've been vaping THC all the time to help help the pain of being a broken boy.

959
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,680
And I have drunk before a bunch of times.

960
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,240
And every time that happens, my mind just escapes me.

961
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,200
And I hate the feeling intensely because I'll start having thoughts that I can't control.

962
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,600
They come like 10 million miles a minute and it's really annoying.

963
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
I hate it and it's a terrible feeling.

964
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,480
You got to, you got to manage it.

965
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,680
It's like everything happens in, in a gradation, you know, like if you want to get high,

966
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,040
if you just take like one hit, then you can measure the results of that,

967
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,560
take another hit, measure the results of that, you know, and like chart, like, okay, here's this,

968
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,880
this is how high I get off of three hits and like how, what is the effect of that?

969
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,280
You know, like with beers, we talked about this extensively way back in the day

970
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,320
that the Dick Masterson three beers rule that like if you drink exactly three beers,

971
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,760
it gets you just in the right mood to be like upbeat and talkative and having a good time

972
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,360
and like feeling the vibe of the room.

973
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,160
But as soon as you hit the fourth beer, that's when it's like you start acting like a fucking idiot.

974
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,240
You know, so it's like, you just got to stay at that, that three beers level.

975
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,440
I don't have that. I don't have that because I've, I've tried the three beer rule before

976
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,720
a few times and usually you're a lightweight than three beers is probably too much.

977
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,920
I mean, even like one, one beer, I can do one beer, okay.

978
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,240
But like as soon as I hit two, like when I don't, I don't have that midpoint.

979
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,160
I literally just shut down whenever I'm inebriated in any sort of way and I'll just

980
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,720
stare at the floor and my brain will be freaking out and that's just what happens and I hate it.

981
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:41,720
Oh wait, modern haiku, everything happens in a gradation across this gay nation.

982
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,800
Right? There we go.

983
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,040
I don't know if that's a haiku, but it's close enough.

984
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,560
It's a western haiku.

985
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,560
In a gradation across this great nation.

986
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,080
I said gay nation, god damn it.

987
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,680
This gay nation, dude.

988
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,320
Can't give America too much credit.

989
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,040
You can add some more syllables. I don't know, whatever.

990
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,640
Is it jumping off point, clearly?

991
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:11,080
Yeah, I think another reason why I feel I am okay with transhumanism and not with drugs

992
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,760
so much with the mental state thing, just because I was raised on shonen anime where

993
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,920
it's all about pure willpower.

994
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,920
I feel that, I feel that in a big way.

995
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,000
Though, you know, if you think about it, okay, it's true that yeah,

996
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,960
everyone wants to like do it through their force of effort, like fucking Vegeta and just

997
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,480
man up and like be powerful, but the reality of the world is some people are like literally

998
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,320
born with more juice of focus or whatever than other people.

999
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,400
That's literally unfair.

1000
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,720
I mean, that's the entire point of Dragon Ball Z.

1001
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,880
Yeah, I mean Saiyans are just better than humans who are better than...

1002
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,840
Vegeta is just constantly cucked by Goku's talent.

1003
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,080
That's true. And you know, there's that whole monologue, that legendary monologue at the end

1004
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,480
of the Buu Saga where Vegeta questions why it is that Kakarot has

1005
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,080
consistently done better than him.

1006
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,160
And his conclusion is that I think it's that he has mercy like while fighting.

1007
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,640
Like it's for him, it's not about power, it's about the love of the battle or something.

1008
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,280
I don't know.

1009
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,200
Makes sense in a way, because if you want to be able to defeat your opponent without

1010
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,760
killing them, you have to be overwhelmingly stronger than them,

1011
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,600
as opposed to just a little bit stronger than them.

1012
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,240
Maybe that's what he meant.

1013
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,760
He did kill Vegeta, didn't he?

1014
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,000
I mean, Frieza.

1015
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,360
Or did he just leave Frieza?

1016
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,480
He does kill his enemies.

1017
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Goku didn't want to kill Frieza.

1018
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,440
He let him live like three times.

1019
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,600
Is that only in the English version?

1020
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,360
Because I know he's very different in Japanese.

1021
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,520
Yeah, in the Japanese version, he's just an idiot.

1022
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,400
In the English version, like for example, with the first Vegeta fight,

1023
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,960
he let Vegeta go and he said, oh, Krillin, I believe he can be good one day.

1024
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,600
But in the Japanese version, it's totally different.

1025
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:52,040
He said he lets Vegeta go specifically so that Vegeta can get stronger and fight him again.

1026
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,440
Like it's very selfish.

1027
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,120
Right, Goku is like a real sociopath.

1028
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,960
Yeah, Goku is the same.

1029
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,640
And in the sub.

1030
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,440
Not a cool character at all.

1031
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,200
What a fucking badass.

1032
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:02,760
But that's it.

1033
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,760
Maybe it's his like, even Vegeta becomes more of a moral fag than Goku.

1034
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,920
Yeah, Vegeta is like the way better guy by the end of the fucking series.

1035
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,520
Yeah, especially by the end of the series.

1036
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,880
Dude, the fucking sickest part of the whole dub is like in the boo arc,

1037
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,600
when he's like fucking broken and battered on the ground.

1038
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,240
Hell yeah.

1039
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,480
Boo kicked his ass and Goku's up there fighting him.

1040
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,640
And he's like, you're the better one, Kakarot.

1041
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,600
You're the better one.

1042
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,200
He finally just accepts it that there's just this gap that can't be closed.

1043
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,640
It's such a cathartic moment.

1044
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,320
And by the time everything this man was about has just been closed in a negative way.

1045
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,080
But he's found his family his other way to give himself meaning,

1046
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,120
despite this long standing goal never being able to be.

1047
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,240
Oh, it's so fucking good.

1048
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,440
It's good shit.

1049
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,920
And in Super, he's like a total family man.

1050
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,360
He's like cranking out babies.

1051
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,600
He's like, yeah, he's just like a good boy.

1052
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,080
And he's like, and Goku's like, we gotta go train.

1053
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,800
He's like, I can't.

1054
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,760
My wife's pregnant.

1055
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,720
You retard.

1056
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,360
He actually tells his wife how long he'll be out training,

1057
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,040
as opposed to Goku, who just instant transmissions the fuck out of there.

1058
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,280
You know, it's funny that you brought up that you like grew up with Shonen stuff

1059
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,200
that was all about concentrated power of will.

1060
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,440
I grew up with nothing but drug music.

1061
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,320
So maybe that's why.

1062
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,200
I sure these things in form are.

1063
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,640
Yeah, like I'm thinking about like the most like foundational stuff to my

1064
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,600
personality is like listening to the Mars Volta where like in their interviews,

1065
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,000
they're like, yeah, we've done every drug there ever has been, you know,

1066
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
like just like listening to all the drugs they did on that.

1067
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,600
I grew up with wrestling.

1068
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,080
And that's why nothing that's real matters to me.

1069
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,720
And I just want everything to be as insane and colorful and ridiculous as possible at all times.

1070
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:47,480
You know, that's why I'm that's why I'm a crypto punk anarcho fascist fucking gay boy.

1071
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,800
What else is going on team?

1072
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,760
I'm tapped.

1073
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,160
I learned I learned all about Twitter yesterday.

1074
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,720
I learned I've been using Twitter completely wrong.

1075
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,520
Yeah, how so?

1076
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,040
Because I made I made a tweet yesterday because yesterday it was D23.

1077
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,320
Wait, let me guess.

1078
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,200
You you complained about the Twitter in some way and somebody immediately was there with

1079
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,400
the tweet deck link, right?

1080
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:18,360
No, no, this is this is like so what the story is is that yesterday was D23,

1081
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,360
which is like Disney's big like, oh, we're announcing that we own half the world again

1082
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,000
sort of thing.

1083
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,480
Right.

1084
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,040
And I don't know if you've seen Disney's new logo.

1085
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,480
Have you seen Disney's new logo?

1086
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,680
Oh, I saw your tweet.

1087
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:33,640
The Disney plus logo where it's just Disney plus Pixar plus Marvel plus Star Wars plus

1088
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,360
National Geographic.

1089
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,480
They're like whipping their dick around.

1090
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,240
They're like, yeah, we own half the world.

1091
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,160
So I just I just screen capped it and like official logo from the end of the trading the

1092
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:41,720
tramp trailer.

1093
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,720
Everyone else find this low key dystopian.

1094
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,320
That's a lot of plus just like haha.

1095
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah, Disney's getting pretty weird.

1096
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,560
And so someone quote tweets me some random person.

1097
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,280
I don't know.

1098
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,000
And they're like, ah, the quintessential.

1099
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,680
I don't consume any media outside of a few major entertainment companies.

1100
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,080
And now I'm scared because Disney, the company that I worshipped, now bought them and I'm

1101
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,680
somehow surprised.

1102
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,200
That's a lot to infer.

1103
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:04,520
Yeah.

1104
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,520
And so I just like yeah.

1105
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,000
So I responded to them and I was just like, if you think I'm like a Disney show, you got

1106
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,120
the totally wrong idea.

1107
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,040
Just like casually dismissing it and then they they responded to me again.

1108
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,960
They're like Twitter pro tip.

1109
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,720
If someone quote tweets you, they're not referring to what you're saying.

1110
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,680
And I'm like, what?

1111
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,680
What are you fucking talking about?

1112
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,840
And so was there OK?

1113
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,160
Sorry.

1114
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,640
Go on.

1115
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,160
And I'm just like, what?

1116
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,640
And like everyone just started dog piling on this guy because it was the most retarded

1117
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,360
thing of all time.

1118
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,160
OK, well, that's good.

1119
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,480
Go on.

1120
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:35,880
I hope he died.

1121
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,160
I hope he died.

1122
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,400
Yeah.

1123
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,440
He's like Twitter pro tip.

1124
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,440
When someone quote tweets you instead of commenting, it's probably not about you.

1125
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,280
And then I respond and said, then why are you quoting if you're not referring to the

1126
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:46,920
quoted tweet?

1127
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,400
Yeah.

1128
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,680
What is the point?

1129
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,720
Just steal the image.

1130
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,360
If you just yeah.

1131
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,960
And then they just got really fucking mad.

1132
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,440
They're like, oh, you're getting so fucking bent out of shape about it.

1133
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,080
I'll delete it.

1134
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,160
But I'm just like, I just think it's funny.

1135
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,440
And I'm just like, oh, I guess quote tweets aren't for quoting a tweet.

1136
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,880
I've learned something new today.

1137
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,920
So you did not actually learn anything.

1138
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,280
This was an ironic.

1139
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,600
It was an ironic message.

1140
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,880
I learned learning.

1141
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,120
Yeah, it was some crypto learning.

1142
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,240
We're all on the same page as, you know, as Jesse discovered at the start of this podcast,

1143
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,640
not everyone in our audience knows what the fuck we're talking about when we are sarcastic.

1144
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,760
But true, true.

1145
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,080
Yeah, we need we need some sarcasm tags.

1146
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,680
Oh, yeah, we do.

1147
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,440
Bro, we just need to put a slash s at the end of every title of every episode.

1148
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,160
Oh, God.

1149
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,400
Yeah.

1150
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,520
Thank you.

1151
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,400
That save us.

1152
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,560
Is that a thing slash s for sarcasm?

1153
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,040
Yeah, I've never seen that before.

1154
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,640
How how thank God, you know, speaking of things.

1155
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,000
I say that are probably sarcastic, but I've not got to think about it.

1156
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,120
Uh, you know, I don't care if Disney takes over the world.

1157
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,680
But if I see one more live action trailer for an old fucking Disney movie, I'm just

1158
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,480
Lady in the Tramp.

1159
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,840
Oh, yeah, I saw it.

1160
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,640
I saw it.

1161
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,880
Oh, lady.

1162
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,440
And the only thing people remember about Lady in the Tramp is the spaghetti sauce scene.

1163
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,240
That's the only thing that I remember.

1164
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,880
I remember that at the end they have babies and all the boy babies look like the dad and

1165
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,960
all the girl babies look like the mom.

1166
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,880
Reinforcing gender stereotypes.

1167
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,240
It's beautiful.

1168
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,760
I just know how it should be.

1169
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,600
I just know the part where like Lady gets all like butt flustered and mad at the tramp

1170
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,680
because he's got too many other ladies.

1171
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,880
And it's like, bitch, you can't fucking hold this dude down.

1172
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,320
Damn.

1173
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,920
That sounds like a MGTOW anthem, dude.

1174
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,640
I got to get in on this.

1175
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:36,440
My fucking Lady in the Tramp, the original MGTOW movie, the original red pill.

1176
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,120
The fucking theater reel in my brain just unspun for a second because you guys were talking

1177
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:47,560
about this and I'm picturing 101 Dalmatians because that's also getting a live action.

1178
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,200
Emma Stone.

1179
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,080
Oh, Cinderella, yep.

1180
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,800
That one already had a live action remake.

1181
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,160
Wait, they're making it again?

1182
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,720
Yeah, they're doing it again.

1183
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,440
What the fuck?

1184
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,560
What the fuck?

1185
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,440
Wait a minute.

1186
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,480
Holy shit.

1187
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,920
I totally forgot about that.

1188
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,960
They're literally remaking the live action remake.

1189
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:06,680
Okay, but this one's going to be like Tim Burton Direct, you know?

1190
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,600
It's going to be like Edward Scissor, like what's that one about the Barbershop,

1191
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,400
Sweeney Todd style.

1192
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,120
Is that true?

1193
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,960
Is Tim Burton directing it?

1194
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,920
I don't think so.

1195
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,200
It just has that kind of attitude.

1196
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,440
All these live action movies feel like a Tim Burton nightmare because they're just all so uncanny.

1197
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,800
Hot take.

1198
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,960
Tim Burton is a shitty director.

1199
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,880
No, it's not true.

1200
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,280
I like some of his work.

1201
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,080
I like Batman Returns.

1202
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,400
I unharmonically love Sweeney Todd.

1203
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,200
I think Sweeney Todd's a fucking modern masterpiece.

1204
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,320
And Big Fish.

1205
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:37,880
Shut up, did you?

1206
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,520
Get out of here.

1207
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,000
He's cool.

1208
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:46,200
I like Sweeney Todd, but I don't think that anything good about it is attributable to Tim Burton.

1209
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:53,960
Okay, I will say that the character design of Todd himself is the most over-the-top,

1210
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,800
ridiculous style of character.

1211
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,960
That's honestly my biggest criticism.

1212
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,360
That Sweeney Todd himself, he looks like such a caricature of this character

1213
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,920
that there was no way other than him becoming a murderer from the moment he adopted this hairstyle.

1214
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,720
It had to be done.

1215
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,760
So that's a little on the nose.

1216
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,640
Other than that.

1217
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,240
That just seems like his style, Tim Burton.

1218
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,560
Yeah, why couldn't he barber himself better if he was such a great fucking dare?

1219
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,920
That was his pathos.

1220
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,240
He could cut anyone else's hair except his own.

1221
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,480
That should have been the main story of the thing.

1222
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,000
Oh, just trapped.

1223
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Trapped on that prison island, Australia or whatever,

1224
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,240
as before he could get back with his shaving tools.

1225
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,920
But alas, he just can't quaff his own quaff.

1226
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:41,160
They have to make the Avengers so that Sweeney Todd and Edward Scissorhands can finally barber each other.

1227
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,360
Yeah, exactly.

1228
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,600
And solve all their problems.

1229
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,000
Speaking of movies and world and things,

1230
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,720
okay, can anyone break down for me what the deal is with this whole Spider-Man leaving the MCU thing?

1231
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,840
Because I don't understand what's going on in if I should care.

1232
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,960
Well, back before...

1233
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,800
You shouldn't. I can help you with that.

1234
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,400
Before Marvel was successful in the late 90s when they were kind of struggling a bit,

1235
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,080
they sold off a bunch of their properties to other movie studios for cheap,

1236
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,200
like Blade and the X-Men and Spider-Man went to Sony.

1237
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:15,160
So now they're successful, but those other companies still own the shit.

1238
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,120
And so Sony is...

1239
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,280
So Spider-Man was leased out to Marvel for the MCU scene.

1240
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,520
Yeah, Sony bought the film rights to use Spider-Man.

1241
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,680
Right now, Sony has all the cards and they're like,

1242
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,680
fuck you, Disney, fuck you, Marvel.

1243
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,440
You gotta pay us trillions of fucking dollars if you want Spider-Man back.

1244
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,240
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1245
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,680
I heard that like Disney...

1246
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,000
I don't know.

1247
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,120
There's no bad guy, good guy.

1248
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,720
And these kind of like corporate decisions or anything.

1249
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,160
But I heard that like Disney was like asking for unreasonable terms.

1250
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,920
They wanted 50% of everything from the Spider-Man movies.

1251
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,680
And Sony's the one footing the bills for everything.

1252
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,880
That seems like a lot.

1253
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,120
Yeah.

1254
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:51,320
So I would be in favor of Marvel itself owning all of Marvel's shit.

1255
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,280
That just goes without saying.

1256
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,440
But because Marvel is also Disney, it becomes gray.

1257
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,960
And gray and gay.

1258
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,040
Yeah, exactly.

1259
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,920
Okay, fair enough.

1260
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,840
So I guess it's just done.

1261
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,920
Well, that's the whole thing is like they're saying that there's still two more Tom Holland

1262
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,520
movies that they're going to make, but they're not going to be referring to the MCU anymore

1263
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,120
because they legally can't at this point.

1264
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,640
Which kind of fucks up the end of Homecoming since it was all...

1265
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,080
The last movie was tied into the MCU like entirely.

1266
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,200
So like, what are they going to do?

1267
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,880
How odd.

1268
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,920
It's very strange.

1269
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,400
Yeah.

1270
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,880
And people are like, they're just going to reboot Spider-Man again.

1271
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,520
They did.

1272
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,280
They're going to bring Sam Raimi back.

1273
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,560
What the fuck were they doing?

1274
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:35,400
They were like, Sony offered to let Tom Holland play the character at least one more time in like a Sony movie.

1275
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:43,080
And the last Zoomer Spider-Man movie did end sort of setting things up where like it could be

1276
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,480
like a self-contained next Spider-Man movie without any MCU stuff if they wanted.

1277
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,680
They could certainly write it.

1278
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,480
Because it ends with Spider-Man getting framed and everybody turning on him and the whole world

1279
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,120
hates Spider-Man.

1280
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,680
So it's kind of going back to the typical status quo of what Spider-Man has always been

1281
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:03,480
as opposed to this weird Zoomer Tony Stark Jr. Spider-Man that they've been agreeing with.

1282
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,560
The stage is set for them to do something cool.

1283
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,960
And I hope they do because I'm not a huge fan of many Iron Man being Spider-Man.

1284
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,680
Spider-Man's supposed to be this guy who's just like the world endlessly shits on him

1285
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,800
and he just goes out at night and spandex and tries to clear his head.

1286
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,320
He's just like a working class dude who's got a deal with shit.

1287
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,120
All right, yeah.

1288
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,720
Not some bourgeois corporate elite Iron Man suit wearing, you know, motherfucker.

1289
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,840
Yeah, the Zoomer Spider-Man is a class traitor is what he is.

1290
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:32,840
It's so true.

1291
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,680
I remember those, I mean I was never, I never read any comics growing up like pretty much

1292
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,560
at all but I fucking love those Spider-Man shows back in the day.

1293
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,320
Remember that one where he went to like weird negaverse and he had like a watch

1294
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,200
that was filled with like bugs that would automatically build his head.

1295
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,160
That was fucking insane.

1296
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,200
That was Fox's answer to Batman Beyond and it was.

1297
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,520
It was so sick and there was like a sexy girl bat or something that he made out

1298
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,960
with that one time and he got sexy pictures of Spider-Man kissing

1299
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,800
that girl villain or something or maybe-

1300
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,440
Interesting that you remember that scene specifically.

1301
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,560
That's, it came to my first baby boner and I'll never forget.

1302
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,280
Good times.

1303
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,240
We need more of that shit.

1304
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,880
I know I said this before but like I just happened upon watching like one episode

1305
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,520
of like the classic 90s X-Men and it just-

1306
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,160
Hell yeah.

1307
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,040
Soul.

1308
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,320
Soul out the ass.

1309
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,960
There was so much soul in every fucking cream.

1310
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,120
That show holds up like a motherfucker.

1311
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:28,520
It's so good.

1312
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,080
It does.

1313
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:29,640
I just recommend.

1314
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,880
Morph, this one's for you, Morph.

1315
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,520
Yeah.

1316
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,640
Yeah, fuck yeah.

1317
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,080
Man, I remember, I remember seeing the like first two episodes.

1318
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,600
I think maybe we had them on VHS or something.

1319
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,320
Yeah, I think we did.

1320
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,200
The first two episodes of the old X-Men cartoon.

1321
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,800
Remember Jubilee fucking up that handsome arcade owner's property because she's an asshole?

1322
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,320
And then I never saw any more of it and I was like, what happens?

1323
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:54,440
So much of that show.

1324
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,760
There's like a whole universe here and I don't know any of it.

1325
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,920
Did these X-Men ever become the Y-Men let alone the Z-Men they were destined to be?

1326
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,920
The characters are so pitch perfect in that show.

1327
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,200
Like just in the very first episode when you first see Gambit

1328
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,720
and he's in a store and he's buying a pack of playing cards

1329
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,960
and the lady behind the counter is like, oh, you like to play cards?

1330
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,680
And he just goes, I like Solitaire, okay?

1331
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,560
Unless I got someone to play with.

1332
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,320
And it's just like, that's Gambit.

1333
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,440
That's all of Gambit right there in that one line of dialogue.

1334
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:25,720
I gave him so much.

1335
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,360
Was that?

1336
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh my god.

1337
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,560
Was that?

1338
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,520
Remember that?

1339
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,160
It's much easier.

1340
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:38,120
Hearing Lunchie say that made me instantly sad that I know that Joke is older than he is.

1341
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,920
Listen, I used to load up YouTube.

1342
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,360
I used to open up fucking Bud Light commercial or whatever the hell it was.

1343
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,440
Song of the Hedgehog and Doom and Duke Nukem and all those sorts of people.

1344
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,360
And they would all say, was that?

1345
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,760
I would feel like nothing much, bro.

1346
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,840
Dude, I am in fucking bliss right now.

1347
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,120
I've lived from piss to bliss right now.

1348
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,640
And I woke up earlier today and the piece of fuel is going to happen in like five minutes.

1349
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,920
I was like, oh man, well, yeah, I would like to record the piece of fuel, but I got a shower.

1350
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,440
I'm in a good fucking routine.

1351
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,760
I'm on top of the world right now, guys.

1352
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,440
And so I took a shower and now I'm here to record the PCP.

1353
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,120
I don't care if I'm going to get a big penalty.

1354
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,080
I don't care about anything.

1355
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,800
I don't care about money.

1356
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,520
Don't pay me anything.

1357
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,880
I just want to record with the piece.

1358
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,560
Yeah, was that?

1359
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,560
Was that?

1360
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,080
Fuck yeah.

1361
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,240
Munchie, what's your current life status?

1362
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,360
Are you in school yet?

1363
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:30,760
Are you?

1364
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,560
Where are you right now?

1365
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:31,720
What's going on?

1366
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,800
Blitzed to hell and back.

1367
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,200
Baked, if you will, like banana bread.

1368
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,000
Nice.

1369
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,160
I am one week away from going to school.

1370
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,520
This is my last piece of PMA record as a free man, as a free mate.

1371
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,560
Incredible.

1372
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,200
Incredible.

1373
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:44,600
This is it.

1374
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,160
This is my last appearance for, I don't know, a little bit.

1375
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:52,280
Not as in I'm leaving, but as in like, oh, I can't scream really loud and wake up my roommates.

1376
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,680
Fun fact right now, I'm in a room alone, by the way, right now.

1377
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,160
For the past couple of months, I've been with Kazzy and she's been in the room,

1378
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,440
but they're all off doing bullshit and I'm not here because of UPS.

1379
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,000
I'll tell my UPS story in a little bit, but to answer your question,

1380
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,880
I, my school, not there yet, but will be soon.

1381
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,280
So this, this, this is my last gasps.

1382
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,400
When's your, when's your move in?

1383
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,600
When's your move in?

1384
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,920
Uh, literally next Saturday.

1385
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,160
So.

1386
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:13,720
Incredible.

1387
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:13,800
Yeah.

1388
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,680
Incredible.

1389
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,960
Literally, literally last one.

1390
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,720
It, it, we're on, we're on the brink, fellas.

1391
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,080
We're on the brink.

1392
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:19,560
Oh my god.

1393
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,640
So when people hear this, it'll be tomorrow.

1394
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,360
Then people hear this.

1395
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,640
Oh yeah, it will.

1396
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:23,720
He moves in.

1397
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,520
Oh my god.

1398
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,200
Oh yeah, um, send me your ones.

1399
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,280
Can we, can we get a one in chat for the future?

1400
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,680
Which is, I guess, the present for you now viewer.

1401
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,680
What were we talking about?

1402
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,360
What's this been, what's this PCP been about?

1403
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,320
What like, like level of interest are we at right now?

1404
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,560
We're talking about X-Men, the animated series.

1405
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,840
We were just talking about, we were talking about classic 90s cartoons.

1406
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:49,320
We talked about, uh, buying Greenland and how it makes all the sense in the world, uh, various things of this nature.

1407
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:49,720
Yeah.

1408
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,520
It's all over the place.

1409
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,800
Greenland would be a fucking sick buy, honestly.

1410
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,680
Once global warming kicks in and that shits all fucking green.

1411
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,960
That's what I'm talking about.

1412
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,440
Yeah.

1413
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,000
Yeah.

1414
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,640
Literally.

1415
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,040
Yeah.

1416
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,120
I like, I like the forethought of our president.

1417
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,240
I'm not just like, man, the climate kind of ruined the planet.

1418
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,640
We could stop it or, or, we could capitalize on it.

1419
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:16,760
You know, we could just do, we could just do what Ben Shapiro says and once global warming kicks in and all our houses flood,

1420
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,240
all our houses flood, we just sell them and move.

1421
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,200
Damn, he's so right.

1422
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:27,080
You know, uh, Andrew Yang's policy on climate change interested me because he said, he was like, you know,

1423
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,920
we could try to do something about it, but America only makes up for like 15% of the problem.

1424
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,920
And you're not going to get all the other countries on board.

1425
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,000
Yeah.

1426
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,960
How are we going to get China and India, which are most of the problems to do it?

1427
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,840
So his advice was, we need to move to higher ground.

1428
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,760
Greenland baby, Greenland just moved to higher ground.

1429
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,840
It doesn't get higher than Greenland, baby.

1430
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,920
Talking, talking latitude and all right now.

1431
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,360
Yeah.

1432
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:50,840
Good thing.

1433
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,960
I don't own a house.

1434
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,240
Yep.

1435
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:53,640
Owned.

1436
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,040
Or rather the opposite.

1437
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,160
Dude, this is great.

1438
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,440
This is great.

1439
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,120
All the landlords are going to get fucked.

1440
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,240
That's yeah.

1441
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:01,400
Yeah.

1442
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,520
Only some of them.

1443
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,160
Some of them.

1444
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,720
I mean, a lot of them.

1445
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,280
Only some.

1446
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,080
Well, only some of them and some of them are going to profit immensely.

1447
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,320
Yeah.

1448
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,520
So the landlords are going to be the ones who have the money to re-locate.

1449
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,640
Break out the champagne.

1450
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,240
Have that concentration of wealth.

1451
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,360
How's that for redistributing?

1452
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:14,840
Yeah, yeah.

1453
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,880
Moving money from some landlords to other landlords.

1454
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,520
All right, never mind.

1455
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,960
I just hope that when the title waves come and everyone's rushing to get to higher ground,

1456
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,360
it is there's helicopters blasting higher ground by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

1457
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,440
The whole time that it's happening.

1458
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,280
I'm so ready for global warming and all the seas just to rise

1459
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,040
because then we'll be able to do away with Democrats, Republicans, blah, blah, blah.

1460
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,440
Nothing.

1461
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,000
This will only be about the Obi-Wan's and the Anakin's anymore.

1462
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,320
The high landers.

1463
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,760
The low landers and the high landers.

1464
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:42,920
Yeah.

1465
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,560
The only two political factions that exist.

1466
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,040
Oh my God.

1467
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,000
People are going to meme.

1468
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,760
I mean, that scene's already been mememed to hell.

1469
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,920
But the high landers are going to meme the low landers so hard every day of their life.

1470
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,760
They're going to be the new, you know, the new untouchables of society, basically.

1471
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,640
What was that?

1472
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,720
Was that cartoon with Will Ferrell as the dad where it's like there's like the hill people

1473
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,760
and the valley people and the valley people and the valley people are all like mutated

1474
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,000
from like from like radioactive waste.

1475
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,200
That's exactly what it's going to be.

1476
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,720
That's where we're going.

1477
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,760
That'd be so cool.

1478
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,520
Oh, I'm like, dude, I've never been more high for global warming than I am right now.

1479
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,840
You guys have really sold it on me.

1480
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,040
That is already what it is like.

1481
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,520
Like the idea of the oblogs is that it is meant to be reality.

1482
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,040
Well, I mean, there's no, I assume you mean like in terms of economic strategy.

1483
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,720
Well, like because in LA in particular, the rich people live in the hills.

1484
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,280
Like they all live up on the mountains and everybody down in LA is a fucking cesspool.

1485
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,920
Well, it's like it's like that song.

1486
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,720
It's like that that one tin soldier song is like the valley people versus the mountain people.

1487
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1488
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,840
I mean, literally throughout all time, kings have been at the highest point.

1489
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Like they always they're at the high ground.

1490
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,440
Like this is just how they have structure.

1491
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,800
They have the high ground.

1492
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,160
It is just the reality.

1493
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,720
I want to be in the Obi-Wan this whole time.

1494
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,440
Yeah, okay.

1495
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,800
Complain about white people all you want.

1496
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,120
But I remember when fucking Liam or whatever his name is, Obi-Wan came over and fucking beat

1497
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,240
the shit out of me and no one cared.

1498
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,840
No one called that racial profiling.

1499
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,800
It's not right.

1500
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,920
Wait, what?

1501
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,720
When a racial profiling is piled by Obi-Wan Kenobi, no one bad their fucking eye.

1502
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,680
This is the real system.

1503
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,560
Munchy, you got to look out.

1504
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,680
You and McGregor confirmed to come back as Obi-Wan for a Star Wars show.

1505
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,000
No.

1506
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,040
He's coming back around to beat your ass in the ground again.

1507
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,640
I'm going to go to Star Wars 500, like the Indy 500, but Star Wars character running around

1508
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,880
in cosplay over in a track over and over again.

1509
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,760
I'm going to sit in my seat.

1510
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,960
I'm going to settle down and think, oh, I sure hope I am beating up today.

1511
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,680
And then Ian McGregor is going to come out with his fucking bath robes on and his BDSM gear.

1512
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,880
What about the ball gag and just fly it, sling it to me.

1513
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:49,560
And I have to put it on and dance around like, fuck you Obi-Wan.

1514
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,200
The Sith really are the most persecuted minority.

1515
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,000
That's so true.

1516
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,760
You give them the old sheave spin, my dude.

1517
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,160
I mean, they are the smallest minority.

1518
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,160
It's said in Star Wars there's only ever two of them.

1519
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,840
A master in apprentice is only two.

1520
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,840
They're the smallest marginalized group.

1521
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,640
There's not only two.

1522
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,760
That can't be accurate.

1523
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,840
Not only two at any given time.

1524
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,880
They have enclaves.

1525
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,640
That's what the prequels said.

1526
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,760
That's why they're fucking weird.

1527
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,560
Wait, really?

1528
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,840
There's two, a master.

1529
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,880
Yeah, they said there was two.

1530
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,000
There's two at a time.

1531
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,520
Well, it makes sense.

1532
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,480
It started out, there was like a whole Sith community.

1533
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,360
You see, you like go to their little town in Knights of the Old Republic.

1534
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,560
But by that point, it's already destroyed.

1535
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,400
Back in the old days, but now in the modern Republic times,

1536
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,560
aka prequel times, there's only two.

1537
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,280
Okay.

1538
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:35,080
I know that the new movies have like uncannonized all the old books,

1539
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,240
but is Knights of the Old Republic still canon?

1540
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:37,880
I don't believe so.

1541
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,520
It's the only good Star Wars thing ever made.

1542
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,400
I mean, that was like way back in the distant past, right?

1543
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,200
It could have been.

1544
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,760
It was like a thousand, a couple thousand years before.

1545
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,720
Yeah, everyone, yeah.

1546
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,080
A couple thousand years.

1547
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,960
By the way, guys, that game is like great and worth playing, right?

1548
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,760
That's what I always hear.

1549
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,560
It's a fantastic game.

1550
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,280
It says it's really good.

1551
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,480
It's like Mass Effect.

1552
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,840
Yeah, it's like Mass Effect 1.

1553
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,720
It's on par with that.

1554
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,360
Okay, okay.

1555
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,720
You're all saying that, but you mean story-wise.

1556
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,840
Because I tried to play that game after I played the Mass Effect games,

1557
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,560
and I thought it was completely incomprehensible,

1558
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,080
and I had no fucking idea what was going on.

1559
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,600
Well, the game is incomprehensible, did you?

1560
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,720
You don't have to do anything.

1561
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,480
It's just like it plays like an MMO.

1562
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,520
You just walk up to shit.

1563
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,800
Oh, okay.

1564
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,840
Well, that sounds...

1565
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,640
It's exactly like Final Fantasy XII.

1566
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:21,960
I like Final Fantasy XII.

1567
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,440
I actually like Mass Effect, probably less than Final Fantasy XII.

1568
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,560
I thought the Mass Effect combat was pretty shit, like consistently.

1569
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,080
Mass Effect 1 combat sucked.

1570
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,280
2 and 3 was fucking good.

1571
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,800
Okay, I only played one so far.

1572
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,000
I gotta get back to those fucking games.

1573
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,960
What am I doing with my life?

1574
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,360
All right, whatever.

1575
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:40,120
Speaking of the Sith, I remember one of the most memorable nights of my entire life

1576
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,800
was I got back from watching Rogue One,

1577
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,160
and I thought, I like Star Wars now, I think.

1578
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,520
I said my right and left brain out of sync.

1579
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,240
Doing a hearty run.

1580
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,600
I mean, shake with each other.

1581
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1582
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,920
And so I got home, and I was like,

1583
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,360
okay, I'm gonna do two things right now.

1584
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,840
I'm gonna binge watch a bunch of Star Wars lore,

1585
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,920
and also try to cook a steak for the first time.

1586
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:04,520
And so I basically, what ended up happening was,

1587
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,280
I didn't know how to cook steak, and I didn't bother looking it up.

1588
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,720
So I just like basically, I would describe it as I tried to deep fry steak,

1589
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,480
aka I just like loaded like a bottle's worth of olive oil into a pan,

1590
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,000
set it on high heat, and then after I was like dropped in a frozen steak into it.

1591
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,920
Meanwhile, I'm watching the Emperor Try to Star-esque videos of like,

1592
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,880
the entire history of the Sith Wars every year,

1593
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:29,480
and it starts in like fucking like 315 BBY before the Battle of Yevon,

1594
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,000
and it's just one big circle and dots, and there's just like one,

1595
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,360
like a set of like red dots are over taking blue dots over and over again,

1596
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,240
for like an hour.

1597
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,080
Meanwhile, I scalded my fucking hand,

1598
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,760
I'm just dropping a steak into olive oil,

1599
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,800
and I'll never forget that night.

1600
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,320
Fuck you, Star Wars.

1601
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,160
You scalded your hand just like Anakin Skywalker scalded his entire body.

1602
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,520
Is that what Obi-Wan got you, dude?

1603
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,320
Yeah, it was a recap of that scene,

1604
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,240
where instead of there, they're on the lava planet,

1605
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,200
it's just Obi-Wan and Anakin like being really bitchy in their kitchen,

1606
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,480
and then Obi-Wan drops a frozen steak into a pot of olive oil,

1607
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,400
and Anakin just scalded, and he's just,

1608
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,920
and then he also turns into Darth Vader.

1609
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,760
Munchy yells at his steak,

1610
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,840
You were the chosen one!

1611
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,440
You were supposed to bring balance to my hunger and stomach!

1612
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,320
This wouldn't have happened in 45 BBY!

1613
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,760
Fuck you, stupid shit!

1614
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,160
And then the steak yells back, I hate you!

1615
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:26,600
Dude, okay, okay, when you were cutting that steak later,

1616
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,560
it was probably like that scene where Obi-Wan cuts Darth Maul in half,

1617
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,040
and he goes like,

1618
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,040
Oh fuck, you're cutting me, bro, don't...

1619
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,880
Actual dialogue.

1620
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,400
Okay, so you know how we have the voice jail, right?

1621
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,080
You know how we have like a set,

1622
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,000
like a cell of villains that we have,

1623
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,960
that we like absolute with like sticks and stones?

1624
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:48,120
I propose we have a new jail for people who aren't in the voice jail,

1625
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,680
but just are like general villains of the PCP.

1626
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,560
I don't mean internet careers,

1627
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,680
I mean like institutions.

1628
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,440
A rogues gallery, perhaps?

1629
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,920
Because Ben came up with the idea of hating systems, not people.

1630
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,920
He invented it, as we all know on PCP.

1631
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,480
Read my book.

1632
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,000
I want to complain.

1633
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,200
I want to have a formal complaint and submit to the real jail,

1634
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,920
the entirety of UPS.

1635
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,440
Not like the CEO or the higher ups,

1636
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,920
like every single like service worker there,

1637
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,200
everyone involved with the opera,

1638
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,000
like the graphic designer made logo, they're going inside.

1639
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,680
It's going to be a crap, it's going to be a fucking,

1640
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,680
it's going to be like September massacres.

1641
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,920
They all have to fit into one cell in the jail.

1642
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,400
Yeah, so all right, I'm going to paint a picture for you,

1643
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,080
because I've just been like toiling,

1644
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,640
I've achieved a broken brilliance,

1645
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,760
because I'm in a great move now,

1646
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,120
but for the past like week,

1647
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,920
I've just been in utter despair of the chain of events that have happened,

1648
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,240
due to the male situation.

1649
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,760
And so, like a week ago,

1650
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:46,280
Caroline's brother is going to Montreal for college.

1651
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,680
He's doing that and he's leaving this weekend.

1652
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,040
The original plan is her father is going to take him to Montreal.

1653
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:52,920
Why does this matter?

1654
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,600
Well, because five days ago, he says,

1655
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,040
or I'm sorry, four days ago, he's like,

1656
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,160
Hey, do you want to come with us?

1657
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,520
And I'm like, yes, I would love to go to Montreal.

1658
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,120
How many times do you go to Montreal in your life?

1659
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,560
Never, what a great opportunity.

1660
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,160
It would have been amazing, incredible.

1661
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,600
But I didn't bring my passport,

1662
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,560
because I'm just going to,

1663
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,840
originally I didn't pack a whole lot,

1664
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,640
because like, you know,

1665
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,160
I'm just going to go to Montreal,

1666
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:09,960
I didn't pack a whole lot,

1667
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,440
because like, you know,

1668
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,080
I'm just going to Boston before I go to a fucking college.

1669
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,080
I don't need a passport right now, do I?

1670
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,040
Turns out I did.

1671
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,880
So I'm like, okay, mom, here, here's like,

1672
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,760
here's like $25.

1673
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,960
Can you please ship this overnight?

1674
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,320
So make sure it gets here.

1675
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,000
She said yes, she does that.

1676
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,320
And also, she sends my computer,

1677
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,400
because I need that for an endless war thing,

1678
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,480
for an endless war update ARG,

1679
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,000
that I've been like really like trying,

1680
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,280
like just grinding working out.

1681
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,560
I have like tons of fucking like images and writing that I've created,

1682
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,280
been also made of a line of flavor text,

1683
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,160
and it was cool.

1684
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:43,160
So this contributed 0.1% to this effort,

1685
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,680
so I'm technically in it.

1686
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,040
Yeah, and it was going to be great,

1687
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,720
and I'm so looking forward to it.

1688
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,480
And so there's a dilemma in my side of my mind, right?

1689
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,560
Ooh, I want to release this on a weekend,

1690
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,240
because that'll be the most players are active,

1691
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,600
but you know, I really want to go to Montreal.

1692
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,200
Okay, I want to go to Montreal.

1693
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,120
Friday, two days ago, you know,

1694
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,240
my passport isn't here.

1695
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:03,080
So I unfortunately am forced to not go to Montreal,

1696
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,400
because the fucking pieces of shit at UBS

1697
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,800
just did not like listen to overnight.

1698
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,720
They were late by two days,

1699
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,440
and couldn't fucking deliver my passport for some reason.

1700
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,640
And so now I'm forced to live in this fucking broken,

1701
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,880
shambled shanty house with no one in it.

1702
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,960
Well, well, my girlfriend and all of her family

1703
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,840
and all of the fucking seven elves from hell go up to Montreal,

1704
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,920
and have a gay ass fucking time without me.

1705
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,760
But I think, okay, okay, silver lining,

1706
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,440
there's silver lining to every story, right?

1707
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,520
You know, okay, so I'm able to like work on an endless war,

1708
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
I'm able to finish it and release it on a weekend.

1709
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,880
Oh, but wait, but wait,

1710
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,080
a critical part of the ARG is there's a file

1711
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,240
that's only accessible on my desktop,

1712
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,760
which also isn't here,

1713
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,760
even though I called a total of six fucking times

1714
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,600
to ensure that it was shipped to, you know,

1715
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,880
the right address at the right time.

1716
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,960
I called the day of it was supposed to be delivered.

1717
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,680
And you know what happened?

1718
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,400
You know what happened?

1719
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,440
I called them, they said,

1720
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,880
hey, hey, we got the right address,

1721
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,160
you know, you've been calling us,

1722
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,840
we're asking us that we fucked up the address,

1723
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,760
and you know, we fixed it, we fixed it for you.

1724
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,880
Please stop making fun of us.

1725
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,480
And I say, okay, I will.

1726
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,080
And then guess what?

1727
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,680
I'm on my laptop, I'm on my laptop,

1728
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,600
it opened up the tracking,

1729
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,040
and you know, I'm watching it rigorously.

1730
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,440
I'm just waiting, I'm listening for like a bat,

1731
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,200
waiting for the sonic waves of the doorbell

1732
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,440
to ring inside my ear or for the door to knock.

1733
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,640
I guess instead of any of that,

1734
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,200
I get a ding in my laptop, oh, failed delivery,

1735
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,640
you didn't answer us.

1736
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,240
And then like, I look outside,

1737
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,240
there is no truck outside,

1738
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,480
they just fucking straight up lied.

1739
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,040
I like just, they didn't do what they said.

1740
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,040
And so now I can't even do that.

1741
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,040
I can't even fucking release in this work

1742
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,080
that I've been working on.

1743
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,200
So I have nothing.

1744
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,920
So I'm just inside this fucking frozen tundra

1745
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,480
of a cozy bedroom in Boston that I have,

1746
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,920
and I'm just fucking wallowing away.

1747
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,920
And I think, okay, how can I drown in my sorrows?

1748
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,760
How can I drown in the pain?

1749
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,640
Play Minecraft.

1750
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,000
So I go to download Minecraft,

1751
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
and Mojang wants to have my credit card.

1752
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,160
So I can't even play Minecraft.

1753
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,000
I can't even do that.

1754
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,280
Where does the world come to?

1755
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,560
That's rough, buddy.

1756
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,440
It's a nightmare.

1757
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,320
It's a literal nightmare.

1758
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,640
And so like last night,

1759
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,560
I was just pacing around like UPS, ARG, Minecraft,

1760
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,600
just pacing back and forth,

1761
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,200
running across my room over and over,

1762
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,120
just seething up in fucking pain.

1763
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,200
And I just like, something about my brain

1764
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,160
just like broke that day.

1765
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,120
Something about my brain,

1766
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,960
just like a little bit of it chipped off.

1767
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,960
And now I've just been in like a great mood

1768
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,000
and I recorded like a weird like pseudo podcast last night,

1769
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,600
but I'm not gonna record,

1770
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,600
I'm not gonna post because I only record it,

1771
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,040
so it wouldn't appear weird to my brain

1772
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,160
that I was talking out loud.

1773
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,240
It was great.

1774
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,280
It's, I'm great now.

1775
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,080
Everything's good.

1776
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,360
You know, my life's ruined.

1777
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,360
I'm not able to release any of the things I wanted to.

1778
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,440
I'm also not able to have fun in Montreal.

1779
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,880
So like everything's gone wrong

1780
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,000
and I want to kill myself.

1781
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,280
And that's, and that's where I am right now.

1782
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,480
I hate the UPS.

1783
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,440
They've done this to me.

1784
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,560
They didn't allow me to go to Montreal.

1785
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,640
They didn't allow me to release this ARG.

1786
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,080
So I don't have to release in a weekend.

1787
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,800
No one's gonna play it.

1788
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,840
No one's gonna like it.

1789
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,040
No, I've done nothing.

1790
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,800
Nothing I've ever done will amount to anything.

1791
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,760
This is the end, guys.

1792
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,280
This is the insta-times for Munchie.

1793
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,920
I think, I think it's time to go into war.

1794
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,080
This week, and by next week,

1795
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,360
interest is just gonna be gone.

1796
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,160
It will.

1797
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,520
If the moment will have passed.

1798
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,760
No, no, literally, because now all the people,

1799
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,840
the people who play in this war are all like children.

1800
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,160
So they're gonna be in school on these days.

1801
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,200
Oh.

1802
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,640
Oh, no.

1803
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,280
Well, we'll still have the weekend.

1804
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,880
You just, you just gotta, you gotta,

1805
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,760
you have the opportunity here.

1806
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,480
No, no, no.

1807
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,440
Don't you remember, Ben?

1808
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,640
This is my last weekend.

1809
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,840
Next weekend, I'm moving in.

1810
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,200
Oh.

1811
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:30,200
Well, ooh, uh, uh, uh, yeah, um.

1812
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,320
This was it, Ben!

1813
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:36,120
You should have had a bigger brain and a bigger dick,

1814
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,280
so it's that this situation never arose

1815
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,720
in the first place, Munchie.

1816
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,400
I just call it.

1817
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,240
You know what, this isn't Munchie's fault.

1818
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:43,800
This is not Munchie's fault.

1819
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,680
Shame him.

1820
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:48,120
The UPS does this all the time.

1821
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,720
They are under, I don't know if it's because

1822
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,920
they're under a ton of pressure

1823
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,600
or they're just fucking retards,

1824
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,320
but constantly, they will not ring the doorbell.

1825
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,840
They will not knock on the door.

1826
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,560
They will just drive by your house sometimes,

1827
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,240
like they weren't there, LeMau,

1828
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,400
and they say it's a failed delivery.

1829
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,080
This happens constantly.

1830
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,360
Was it UPS?

1831
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,640
I forget if it was UPS.

1832
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,080
I don't know.

1833
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,400
I don't remember if it was UPS or FedEx or whatever,

1834
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,160
but one of the people that like,

1835
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,520
I ordered the pins, right?

1836
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,560
This was like a long time ago.

1837
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,640
This was like way before I was even getting close

1838
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,320
to getting it, which I am close to getting it done,

1839
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,240
but for the Vapors 2 Kickstarter,

1840
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,440
when I ordered the pins,

1841
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,600
the new pins for the second Kickstarter,

1842
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,800
and I ordered them,

1843
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,000
and this was right as our parents moved house, right?

1844
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,600
But obviously, if they moved,

1845
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,800
they left instructions for like,

1846
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,160
this is our new address,

1847
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,360
but whoever was delivering them just didn't listen,

1848
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,680
and they just said undeliverable,

1849
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,560
and they just didn't deliver,

1850
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,760
and they just disappeared,

1851
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,360
and they just disappeared in the mail,

1852
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,120
and I paid for the order,

1853
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,160
they were shipped to them,

1854
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,520
but they just threw them away

1855
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,760
because they didn't go to the right address.

1856
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,920
I just want to say that, again,

1857
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:54,920
this is like a malicious thing on UPS's behalf, by the way.

1858
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,200
I don't think this is like an accident.

1859
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,360
I think this is a premeditated attack

1860
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,960
on yours truly, Munchy Shatsky.

1861
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,480
They're probably a bunch of killers, dude.

1862
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,520
They're probably a bunch of killers.

1863
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,320
Yeah, literally.

1864
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,040
You know, yeah.

1865
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,880
So, again, I just want to reiterate

1866
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,640
that I called them incessantly,

1867
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,760
just over and over and over again

1868
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,040
to make sure that Patrick would be delivered time,

1869
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,600
and then after I got the infuriating remark

1870
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,040
that they tried to deliver it,

1871
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,000
but were unable to,

1872
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,680
motherfucker, you weren't even here.

1873
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,200
I called them again, it was very stern,

1874
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,120
and like, hey, what the fuck is your problem?

1875
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:20,840
Like, what can I do?

1876
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:21,880
I didn't say what the fuck is your problem.

1877
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,640
I was like, I'm really upset right now.

1878
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,920
Can you please explain why?

1879
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,920
But I said it in a really stern tone.

1880
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,640
And then, by the way, none of them were speaking English.

1881
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,320
A single person was a native English speaker,

1882
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,480
and I couldn't understand half their accents.

1883
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,640
And then they had the gall to say,

1884
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,360
oh, well, if you want to pick it up yourself,

1885
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,400
you can on Monday.

1886
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,200
That would be $35 to pick it up in person.

1887
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,440
They charged me to do it in person

1888
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,440
when they just couldn't fucking deliver it to me in person.

1889
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:46,760
By the way,

1890
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,040
by the way, I just want to say that that computer,

1891
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,720
I didn't just, like, it wasn't just like, you know,

1892
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,120
like, oh, I picked up in a bag and I took it to the UPS.

1893
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:54,840
No, no, no, no.

1894
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:59,240
So it was $200 to ship it to me,

1895
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,280
because it's my computer,

1896
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,880
and I had to get extra fragile shipping,

1897
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,560
and there were like three boxes for all the stuff

1898
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,160
that was accumulated with the monitor

1899
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,520
and the desktop and everything else.

1900
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,920
So a $200 to ship it to me,

1901
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,080
probably is lost in transit and broken by now,

1902
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,840
because it's just been loaded on and off a truck

1903
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,400
so many times,

1904
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,960
because they can't fucking speak anything.

1905
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:16,760
They are just dumb.

1906
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:17,240
They're stupid.

1907
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:17,560
I hate them.

1908
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,200
Yeah, yeah.

1909
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,240
Time, time, murder.

1910
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,560
So UPS, I have these problems all the time.

1911
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,000
They, I have a doorbell.

1912
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,200
They don't seem to ring it.

1913
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,000
It sucks.

1914
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,560
They're terrible.

1915
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,560
But, but even worse, I don't know if you guys,

1916
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,720
do you ever get like Amazon delivery from,

1917
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,920
like, there's like an Amazon independent delivery system

1918
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,280
that works like they've got, you know,

1919
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,000
like independent people.

1920
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,120
It's not UPS or FedEx.

1921
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:36,680
It's Amazon.

1922
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,000
They have their own shipping fleet now.

1923
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,320
Yeah.

1924
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,120
So, okay, obviously,

1925
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:43,160
there are a million times worse than anyone else.

1926
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,400
And like multiple times now,

1927
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,600
at least twice.

1928
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,400
There's been instances where like, I just,

1929
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,320
and I've called them to ask their customer support.

1930
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,920
They have told me this,

1931
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,920
that they are delivering something.

1932
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:55,400
They get here.

1933
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:55,960
I'm checking.

1934
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,960
They're like, oh, we couldn't deliver today.

1935
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,160
I'm like, that's odd.

1936
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,040
I checked the thing.

1937
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,240
It says it was delivered.

1938
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,680
I say, that's weird.

1939
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,080
I call customer support and say, excuse me,

1940
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:05,960
it says it was delivered.

1941
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,840
It's not in my place.

1942
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,480
What's going on?

1943
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,000
They tell me, this has happened twice.

1944
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,240
I'm pretty sure now, like, oh yeah,

1945
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,440
sometimes our delivery guys

1946
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,720
are just trying to meet a quota.

1947
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,880
So they just put it down as delivered.

1948
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,400
But it's not actually delivered.

1949
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,240
Like, just hang on a couple more days.

1950
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,600
And like, maybe it'll be there.

1951
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,480
I understand, sir.

1952
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,080
What?

1953
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,760
Of course, sir.

1954
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,080
Did Jeff, I would put Jeff Bezos on the phone.

1955
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,360
I need to talk to the man in charge.

1956
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,640
He needs to know what's going on.

1957
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,360
This, this has happened to me multiple times.

1958
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,360
I can't believe this is acceptable.

1959
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,800
Five of the people who do this.

1960
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:39,080
Have you ever had the bowling ball service before?

1961
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,280
No, I don't think so.

1962
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,240
This is something unique,

1963
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,120
I guess maybe to my house,

1964
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,320
because we have a driveway on a downward slant.

1965
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:48,280
But sometimes they'll just park at the edge of the driveway

1966
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,080
and just roll the package down our driveway and take off.

1967
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:51,960
Wait.

1968
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,240
And like, I got a laptop?

1969
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,080
I got a laptop and I was waiting for it to come

1970
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:00,520
and they just rolled the laptop box down my driveway.

1971
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,520
And I ran, I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1972
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,720
But they're already driving away.

1973
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,200
And yeah, yeah.

1974
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1975
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,840
So they did this with a laptop?

1976
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:09,080
Yeah.

1977
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:10,920
It was just a box.

1978
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,040
Uricle laptop?

1979
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,560
How does it even roll down the...

1980
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,720
They just take a box and they just pitch it

1981
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,640
and it just starts rolling down the fucking...

1982
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

1983
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,400
This is the quality you get with the Amazon delivery system.

1984
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:23,960
This is how they do it.

1985
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,960
It's disgusting beyond words.

1986
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,560
Deb, have you ever seen an Amazon graveyard?

1987
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,440
Do you have any of those?

1988
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:35,720
Like, because like, there's an old, there's a like a plaza

1989
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,320
near my house that used to have like a stop

1990
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,360
a chop at a bunch of other places.

1991
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,200
There's still a couple small businesses there,

1992
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,120
but it was bought by Amazon.

1993
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,920
So the parking lot that used to support tons of businesses

1994
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:51,320
is now just full, completely full of Amazon vans.

1995
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,640
It's just like, and like, it's a big parking lot.

1996
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,320
So like you drive, it takes like three minutes

1997
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,680
to get across it and it's just a fucking ghost town

1998
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:02,120
except for hundreds of Amazon branded vans.

1999
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,520
And it's the most dystopian feeling of all time

2000
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,640
going through there.

2001
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,520
Are these the, is this the fleet doing the deliveries and like...

2002
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,720
This is like where they keep all the vans

2003
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,640
for all their contractors to do all their deliveries

2004
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,320
because there's, they bought, there was an old

2005
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,240
like caterpillar billing that they bought

2006
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,840
and now it's an Amazon delivery service.

2007
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,000
So like, they just bought the entire parking lot

2008
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,280
to use as their parking lot for their vans.

2009
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,680
And it's just literally hundreds.

2010
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,760
And you're just like, oh, I remember when like,

2011
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,320
people would come here and go grocery shopping

2012
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,160
and now it's just a ghost town.

2013
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,400
I know that other people disagree with me on this.

2014
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,720
Like in a possible world, perhaps this is naive,

2015
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,960
perhaps this is unrealistic, but in a world

2016
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,200
where all power is constant, like we'll like,

2017
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,120
where wealth and power are concentrated

2018
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,560
in a very small number of people

2019
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,080
and those people like do everything.

2020
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,720
If those people don't do immoral things,

2021
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,680
I don't have a problem with it.

2022
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,440
Maybe that's naive, maybe it's inevitably gonna happen.

2023
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,040
Okay, that's fine, we can discuss that.

2024
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,400
But nonetheless, the fact that it's all being concentrated

2025
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,680
in such a shitty system, in such a terrible,

2026
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:02,120
awful fucking system where such things are just tolerated,

2027
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,120
I guess it's tolerated the way that like,

2028
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,440
YouTube recently like constantly tolerated people

2029
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,120
abusing their copyright claim system

2030
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,440
because there's just too many fucking people

2031
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,760
with them making videos and with Amazon

2032
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,640
just asking for bullshit that nobody cares about,

2033
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,400
including me every day by an Amazon shit.

2034
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,440
Oh my God, Nate, you're getting it.

2035
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,800
You're starting to see through the veil.

2036
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,960
My class consciousness is spiking right now.

2037
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,800
My power levels are surging.

2038
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,440
The problem is that like, in order to get far in the world,

2039
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,920
you have to like inherently be a bad person.

2040
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,600
Like that's just...

2041
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,640
I don't agree with that.

2042
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,440
I don't agree with that.

2043
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,080
You kind of do.

2044
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:37,720
You...

2045
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,000
Now I totally agree with that.

2046
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,560
Well, it depends.

2047
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,040
In order to get to that upper, upper echelon,

2048
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,880
like to really get to the tippity top,

2049
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,200
like to get to the 1%, like to be like a student.

2050
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,160
Okay, I've got a question.

2051
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,040
I've got a question for you.

2052
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,480
Okay, we all know that like,

2053
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,200
if you're like a CEO of a gigantic company or something,

2054
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,600
like basically any decision you make

2055
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,760
is going to like benefit one group

2056
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,440
and like penalize another group,

2057
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,600
such that almost any decision you make

2058
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,880
like has winners and losers

2059
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,240
and those could be fairly serious.

2060
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,000
Like people could like lose their jobs,

2061
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,120
lose their livelihoods, you know,

2062
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,000
could fuck them up.

2063
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,240
But like you have to make decisions.

2064
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,560
Like are you defining that as evil?

2065
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,360
Because like a good person might just be paralyzed.

2066
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,080
I would say that to get to the tippity top,

2067
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,880
you have to be evil because you must,

2068
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,800
like you must exploit,

2069
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,880
you must exploit the work of employees

2070
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,360
in order to like generate capital.

2071
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,880
I don't even know, I mean that's true.

2072
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,240
I don't know if I'd go that far

2073
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,360
in what I'm talking about.

2074
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,880
I just mean that in order to be the best,

2075
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,680
you have to be overly aggressive to a point

2076
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,480
that most people would find it morally uncomfortable.

2077
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,840
Like you have to be,

2078
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,560
you can't be afraid to step on other people

2079
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,080
and like use a pile of like corporate corpses

2080
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,840
to climb your way to the top.

2081
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,280
That's just the way the system works

2082
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,600
and most people don't have the stomach for it.

2083
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,680
So inevitably the people who are at the top

2084
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,760
are the people with very little more consideration.

2085
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:02,920
If you're not 100%, if you're 99% ruthless,

2086
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,040
that guy who's 100% ruthless is going to edge you out.

2087
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,160
That's quite possible, that's quite possible.

2088
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:11,240
If you're only 99% ruthless, you're in the 99%,

2089
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,280
it's just how it is.

2090
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,320
Yeah.

2091
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,560
Ruthless is a world.

2092
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,320
Is there such a thing as being ruthless?

2093
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,920
Can I be a ruthless person?

2094
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,920
Yeah, Ruth Grader Ginsburg.

2095
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,760
Let's ask the Urban Dictionary show.

2096
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,920
Welcome to the PCP, the topic is being ruthless.

2097
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,320
Guys, how have you been ruthless lately?

2098
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,360
Okay, top definition for Ruth.

2099
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,520
Ruth is a very pretty girl

2100
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,160
with the shiniest and prettiest brown eyes.

2101
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,640
She has a warm heart and is very caring.

2102
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,840
She could light up the whole room

2103
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,440
with her presence around, especially with her humor.

2104
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,720
One click by, one click by, one click by.

2105
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,360
She can be the kindest person you have ever met.

2106
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,360
She's very loving and the best person

2107
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,520
to go to for a shoulder to cry on.

2108
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,400
She will put her loved ones first and her friends second.

2109
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,600
She is honest and loyal and has the prettiest smile.

2110
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,840
Okay, all those, all those things.

2111
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,360
Is that the girl, every girl?

2112
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,840
Is that the girl everyone's been talking about?

2113
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,440
Guy, sure is.

2114
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,720
That's Ruth.

2115
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,160
So I hope that's cleared it up for you.

2116
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,600
That all defines Ruth.

2117
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,760
Top definition of ruthless on,

2118
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,520
so lack of this person is simply without Ruth,

2119
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,760
lack of Ruth, no Ruth.

2120
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,840
That's the full definition of ruthless.

2121
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,320
Thank you for helping us be thanks guys.

2122
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,400
So if you're Ruthless, then you're an incel

2123
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,160
and you don't have a pretty girl with shiny,

2124
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,200
pretty brown eyes.

2125
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,240
Correct, and that's what turns you evil.

2126
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:34,040
What else sets the stage for a corporate takeover

2127
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,840
of society than not having a Ruth in your life?

2128
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,640
Damn.

2129
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,920
That all makes sense.

2130
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:41,160
I'm just gonna say right now, the radicals are Ruthful.

2131
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,840
The radicals are a Ruthful race.

2132
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,800
A routful, rooty, race, revunctious rats.

2133
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,000
Killers are Ruthless.

2134
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,280
Killers are absolutely Ruthless.

2135
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,240
They're the Ruthless.

2136
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,120
That's the difference.

2137
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,480
That's the difference in world view.

2138
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,440
We're just imbued with so much Ruth,

2139
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,360
that it's just, I really don't have a picture of Ruth.

2140
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,120
I think this is why, I think this is why

2141
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,240
more Slime Corp employees gravitate towards the,

2142
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,640
towards the killer side.

2143
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,880
Because one of the first psychological checks you do

2144
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,960
when you're entering Slime Corp evaluation is,

2145
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,000
do you have empathy?

2146
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,440
If so, get out right now.

2147
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,840
You just leave, leave the premises.

2148
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,520
You'll get edged out in the free market.

2149
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,280
If you have, if you have Ruth.

2150
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,880
You just slide a picture of Ruth

2151
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,240
over to the potential employee.

2152
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,840
What's the first thing that comes to your mind?

2153
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,200
Depending on their answer.

2154
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,640
When they slide that picture of Ruth over,

2155
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,280
you need that like Russian propaganda picture of that guy

2156
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,320
holding up his hand going,

2157
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:29,640
HIT!

2158
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,080
Saying, you know.

2159
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,160
Well, I just want to put like a little bow tie

2160
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,680
on the UPS store.

2161
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,880
I just want to say that it wouldn't bother me so much

2162
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,760
if it weren't for like just the deception.

2163
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,760
If it was just incompetency,

2164
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,160
like if it was just like they like fucked up,

2165
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,760
or even if it's like a scummy worker

2166
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,760
that just is like trying to fill up a quota.

2167
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,920
Even that is like, you know, fun.

2168
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,560
It's the fact that like every single,

2169
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,320
like I feel like there's nothing I can do

2170
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,800
because I am constantly getting positive affirmation

2171
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,960
that what's happening is going to be okay.

2172
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,680
Like I'm getting constant like we have your address.

2173
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:03,640
They're gaslighting you.

2174
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,240
They're gaslighting you in a bigger way.

2175
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,080
Like like in the exact same day,

2176
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,480
I will, I will call them and like say,

2177
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,200
this is my address.

2178
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,160
Make sure you're delivering it right.

2179
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,440
Because it doesn't look like you're delivering it

2180
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,880
to the right address on your website.

2181
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,320
And they'll be like, okay, you know, we've updated it.

2182
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:16,440
Okay, so it's going to this address.

2183
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,000
Okay, good.

2184
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,480
Don't worry.

2185
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,680
We're going to this address.

2186
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,040
Like the same day, like,

2187
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,040
oh, your address was wrong, by the way.

2188
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,640
We didn't get your company name.

2189
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,120
We need your company name for some reason.

2190
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,000
We just assume.

2191
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,240
Rowdy fuckers, cop killers.

2192
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,080
We kill crime HQ.

2193
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,200
Yeah, come on.

2194
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,760
This is, this is why I like dealing with USPS

2195
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,120
because like they're incompetent,

2196
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,960
but it's they're always on the nose about it.

2197
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,080
Like, you know what you're getting into

2198
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,560
when you deal with a post office, you know?

2199
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,040
Yeah.

2200
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,280
There's a bunch of slums who just don't give a shit.

2201
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,640
And they don't pretend to.

2202
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:45,960
Yeah.

2203
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,280
Yeah.

2204
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,960
I mean, I've had issues with the post office,

2205
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,240
but it's never been a rigmarole.

2206
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,920
It's just like, yeah, we fucked up.

2207
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,960
Sorry.

2208
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,800
Mike, go fuck yourself.

2209
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,560
Just in case anyone was wondering,

2210
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,560
yes, it seems that Ruth, spelled with an E before the U,

2211
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,640
was a middle, was a middle English word,

2212
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,080
meaning pity or compassion,

2213
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,000
has fallen out of use.

2214
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,160
So that's where that comes from.

2215
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:07,880
Hell yeah.

2216
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,760
So I was just taking a big old shit and.

2217
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,320
You did type an emergency.

2218
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,600
That's what was urgent.

2219
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,320
And that was an emergency.

2220
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,800
I said BRB, urgent shit.

2221
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,280
Oh, I didn't think you meant like it was literally a shit that

2222
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:18,760
was urgent.

2223
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,840
I had to take it back.

2224
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:22,760
All right.

2225
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:26,840
So I went to took an urgent shit and I was reading the manga

2226
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:30,120
Planetes, the previous copyright over here.

2227
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,440
From the guy who wrote Vinland Saga.

2228
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,640
Have you read it yet, Nate?

2229
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,400
It's by the guy who made Vinland Saga.

2230
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,840
Yeah, I didn't even fucking realize that either.

2231
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,320
Are you?

2232
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,520
I had no fucking idea.

2233
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,560
I only got like.

2234
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,960
You'll be like, oh, OK, I got like two.

2235
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,800
I mean, that was from way back in the day, right?

2236
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,160
Oh, that that blows my mind.

2237
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,240
I mean, obviously I just made a wee Agwa about fucking

2238
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:47,720
Vinland Saga.

2239
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,680
I'm a big fan.

2240
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,800
Yeah, blew my mind, too.

2241
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,600
OK.

2242
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:51,480
Well, I was just reading it.

2243
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,160
Well, I guess if you've already read the first couple

2244
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,440
chapters, then I don't know.

2245
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,280
You probably don't remember them, but like.

2246
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,160
I just spent a while.

2247
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:58,920
Chapter two seemed like it would interest you a lot.

2248
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,520
It was about the main character.

2249
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,080
So for those who don't know, Planetes is about people who

2250
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,760
are junk collectors in space.

2251
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,200
They collect space debris.

2252
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,800
They're literally just trash men.

2253
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,640
It's mostly about like the economic disparity of how we

2254
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,440
treat people who do like blue collar jobs, essentially

2255
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,840
even in space.

2256
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,720
And in chapter two, the main character is like having

2257
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,480
his doubts about whether space is cool.

2258
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,360
He's like, space is kind of shit.

2259
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,200
You know, everybody out here just kind of gets cancer

2260
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,080
and loses their mind.

2261
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,600
So it's not that great.

2262
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,240
It's a tale of learning to love space.

2263
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,960
Well, he was just like, man, what the fuck is the point?

2264
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,280
Because like back on Earth, it takes place in a period

2265
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,360
where like the sea levels have already risen.

2266
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,800
We've used up most of the natural resources.

2267
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,720
Did we buy Greenland, though?

2268
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,520
I don't know.

2269
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,880
I mean, I don't even know what country he's from necessarily

2270
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,960
because it's in space.

2271
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,040
But they're on the moon.

2272
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,160
They have like a moon base.

2273
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,800
It's basically like we've colonized the moon to some extent.

2274
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,840
And we've got spaceships and stuff.

2275
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,040
We've explored the outer belt, I guess, or inner belts

2276
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,320
or whatever belt.

2277
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,840
Anyways, he's like, I don't know, man.

2278
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,160
Maybe fucking we weren't supposed to come to space.

2279
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,520
And then the other lady's like, man, fuck you, dude.

2280
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,480
We got to be in space.

2281
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,720
It's the only way forward for humanity.

2282
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,000
Like we just got to do it.

2283
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,880
And then he meets this girl who was born on the moon.

2284
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,600
And she's like, I can't even go to Earth

2285
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,040
because like my body can't handle their atmosphere.

2286
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,080
But like I'm letting them study me for science.

2287
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,400
And I want them to fucking figure out how to progress

2288
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,720
and fix a lot of these problems that we have with space.

2289
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,080
And he's like, you know what?

2290
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,520
Maybe space isn't so bad.

2291
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,560
It's got space in the place.

2292
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,280
Hashtag to my 2003.

2293
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,840
I thought you'd appreciate it, Nate, because it's just like he's

2294
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,920
having his doubts about human progress

2295
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,360
and whether it's all worth it.

2296
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,560
And then this girl from space is like, nah, dude.

2297
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:50,840
That was a good chapter.

2298
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,880
This guy's, fuck.

2299
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,760
These guys are living and doing real shit,

2300
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,880
facing real issues.

2301
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,400
But like ultimately, I mean, what are you going to do?

2302
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,400
Good chapter also though, long.

2303
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,040
Not, I was, you know, I'm just trying to read a chapter

2304
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,840
while I take a shit and get back to the PCP.

2305
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,560
And I'm like, oh God, like what the fuck does this end?

2306
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,200
I have to go back.

2307
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,200
I'm going to get a penalty if I fucking miss too much.

2308
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,840
People have been telling me for a long time

2309
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:15,240
that I should, you know, read, watch whatever

2310
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,680
Planet is because I would love it.

2311
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,680
I never, I didn't get that far into it,

2312
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,040
but I read a bunch.

2313
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:23,240
It's funny, Nate, that you haven't like read it completely

2314
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,560
because you gave it to me as a gift, like the first one.

2315
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,360
I know, I know.

2316
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,280
And you were talking up like, yeah, this is great.

2317
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:28,760
You'll love it.

2318
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,920
And I was like, oh, this must be a favorite of Nate's.

2319
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,520
And you're just like, yeah, I never read it.

2320
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,720
Well, people told me that and I read some of it

2321
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,240
and thought it was great.

2322
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,640
So I'll get, I'll finish it one of these days.

2323
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,120
Speaking of, it's not even that long.

2324
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:42,840
Yeah, I think you're right.

2325
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:43,800
I think you're right.

2326
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,360
Speaking of reading, what a common thing, right?

2327
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:53,960
I don't want to get too deep into all the punk ass

2328
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:58,360
bitches in the comments last episode railing against me,

2329
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:02,520
but one common refrain was that, oh, Ben, oh, Ben, just what?

2330
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,840
Ben's just parroting a bunch of YouTube people.

2331
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:08,360
Ben, just watch, he uses the talking mouthpiece

2332
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:11,640
for all these YouTube, he's never even read a book.

2333
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,840
Well, I read a book.

2334
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,200
I finished Peter Kropotkin's Conquest of Bread yesterday.

2335
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,160
And here's my, here's my review of it.

2336
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:26,680
It's, it's, it's informative, but it's very outdated.

2337
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,560
He talks a lot.

2338
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,280
Okay.

2339
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:31,480
He talks, he talks a lot about why we should communism,

2340
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,200
which cool, a lot of that comes off as kind of

2341
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,720
sermonizing, but I don't mind that.

2342
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:36,760
It's pretty good.

2343
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:37,720
I like it.

2344
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,680
And a lot of it is him talking about like, okay,

2345
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:43,480
but how will we do the revolution?

2346
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,680
How will we survive?

2347
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,200
How will we feed ourselves?

2348
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,680
And there's a lot of nitty gritty, like with

2349
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,960
intensive farming methods.

2350
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,640
Here's how many bushels per acre,

2351
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,520
you know, the typical Parisian farmer could produce.

2352
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,520
And, and, and it's very outdated.

2353
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,240
And he's like, did you know that in America,

2354
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,120
they actually, certain cities actually pump hot water

2355
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,200
into homes in addition to cold water?

2356
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,560
We could do that too, guys.

2357
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,080
The future is going to be fucking sick.

2358
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:07,880
Okay.

2359
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:08,440
Okay.

2360
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,200
So it's, it's pretty short though.

2361
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,520
How, do you know when he wrote it and where he's from?

2362
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,480
I just, so I,

2363
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,840
Well, he's, he's from Russia.

2364
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,160
Okay.

2365
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:15,640
Russian.

2366
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,120
Ben.

2367
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,400
I don't know the exact year.

2368
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:17,560
Okay.

2369
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,960
Ben, if you're going to be reading political books,

2370
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,000
I have one I recommend, which is fucking Yang's book.

2371
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:24,280
I read it.

2372
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,400
Oh, the war on normal.

2373
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,240
Yeah, I read it and it was great.

2374
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,040
And I agree with everything he has to say.

2375
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,000
Yang is my man.

2376
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:32,840
Yang is pretty cool.

2377
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,200
I won't say agree with everything he has to say,

2378
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,000
but most of it, like the vast majority of the

2379
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,840
just his perspective on,

2380
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,040
I think the most important thing about Yang to me

2381
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,520
is not just his ideas of like what to do,

2382
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:47,080
but just the fact that he seems to actually know

2383
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:47,960
what's happening.

2384
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,400
Like the thing that I've been saying about like

2385
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,320
all the politicians and stuff is like,

2386
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:56,680
they're talking about plans of action for a world

2387
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,600
that to me doesn't exist.

2388
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,400
You know, that I'm like,

2389
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,000
that's not the way things are though.

2390
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,360
Like if you're not taking into account the internet,

2391
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,200
you don't understand how like

2392
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,280
the businesses are run there,

2393
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,040
then you don't know what the fuck the world even is

2394
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:10,600
right now.

2395
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,480
You know, and we know.

2396
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,560
I mean, Yang's like 40 something.

2397
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:13,880
Yeah.

2398
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,080
Yang's like 40 something.

2399
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,600
All the other like of so many of the other

2400
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,680
Democratic candidates are like 80 plus.

2401
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,640
He's like 40 something.

2402
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,880
And he's his whole entire background is working

2403
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,760
it for startups.

2404
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,800
You know, like all he's done.

2405
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,840
He's also a gamer.

2406
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,160
He is.

2407
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,200
He played a lot of Starcraft.

2408
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,320
Starcraft player.

2409
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:27,400
Yeah.

2410
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,200
Yeah.

2411
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,040
He mentioned, he thought there's a whole chapter

2412
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,920
about gaming in the book about like basically

2413
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,200
how video games have.

2414
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,160
How they need to rise up.

2415
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:38,440
Well, mostly he's talking about how he's like,

2416
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,360
you know, I understand video games and how

2417
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,920
addicting they are and like why they're so good,

2418
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,920
but they are ruining our men like.

2419
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:45,960
Yeah.

2420
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,800
He's he's it's a case.

2421
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,400
I know is like the type of men he describes are

2422
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,520
literally guys.

2423
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:55,640
I know like guys who have completely been

2424
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,960
subsumed into putting the focus on the wrong

2425
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:58,360
people.

2426
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,200
Women need to compete with video games with

2427
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,600
enhanced surgically enhanced sexiness.

2428
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,920
It's the only way to keep the arms race going.

2429
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,200
We have to do it.

2430
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,320
Yang is pretty cool.

2431
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,040
I like him.

2432
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,080
I know I've been hyping him up.

2433
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,920
I've been hyping him up on Twitter lately,

2434
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,120
selling Yang shirts.

2435
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,240
It's all pretty great.

2436
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,440
I'm not voting for him.

2437
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:15,000
My motto is vote.

2438
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,120
Well, he won't win anyway, so.

2439
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:17,400
Vote Bernie where Yang.

2440
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,360
Yeah, I'm voting Bernie.

2441
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:21,480
I love if the polls changed and like Yang surged

2442
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,600
ahead, I would vote for him.

2443
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:22,840
Okay.

2444
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:23,880
But like he's not going to win.

2445
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,000
I'm going to vote for Bernie because he can

2446
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,040
actually and also I like Bernie.

2447
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,480
Let's say you had the vote.

2448
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:28,840
Your only vote mattered.

2449
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,720
You are.

2450
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:30,600
No, throw.

2451
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,000
Okay.

2452
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,320
Okay.

2453
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,160
Did you throw your vote away on Yang so

2454
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:34,120
Biden will win.

2455
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:34,760
Great.

2456
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:35,400
Thanks.

2457
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,040
Thanks a lot.

2458
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:36,600
Okay.

2459
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:37,960
You're talking about like what if you just don't

2460
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,280
care.

2461
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:38,920
He's right.

2462
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,640
I don't know.

2463
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,400
Yeah, I'm talking about what makes you think

2464
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,880
that like I would not vote for Bernie.

2465
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:44,680
Like I wouldn't do that.

2466
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:45,880
Why would you not vote for?

2467
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:46,440
Oh my god.

2468
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,160
Why would you not vote for Bernie?

2469
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,000
I wouldn't vote for anybody but Yang.

2470
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,720
I would not vote for anybody but Yang.

2471
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:51,960
Peer.

2472
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:52,920
Oh my god.

2473
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,200
Digi, you don't understand.

2474
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:54,760
You don't understand.

2475
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,400
What do I not understand?

2476
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,040
What's the stake?

2477
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,200
Fucking Biden's going to win.

2478
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:58,760
Biden.

2479
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:59,800
Okay, Biden's not going to win.

2480
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,080
Like you, Biden's going to win.

2481
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:01,160
All right.

2482
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,040
First of all, none of them are going to be

2483
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:04,600
Trump.

2484
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,200
No, he's way worse than Obama.

2485
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:06,760
He sucks.

2486
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:06,840
Okay.

2487
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,400
Also, he's literally demented.

2488
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,400
Like he's clearly has like brain.

2489
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,520
He does not seem particularly on the ball.

2490
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,160
He is not on the, he's not on the fucking ball.

2491
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:16,520
I agree.

2492
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,680
And Bernie fucking rules, okay?

2493
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:19,800
I don't know if you know anything about

2494
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,000
Bernie but Bernie rules.

2495
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,720
If the Democrats pick Joe Biden, they will

2496
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,560
be just signing their death warrant.

2497
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:26,360
There's no profit.

2498
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,080
Exactly.

2499
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,040
Yeah, that seems true.

2500
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:28,600
It seems true.

2501
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,160
Yes.

2502
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,480
That's one, that's one of the things I'm

2503
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,680
saying to you.

2504
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:33,400
From what I've heard,

2505
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,560
Bernie is currently third behind Warren and Biden.

2506
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,040
Here's the thing.

2507
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,240
Here's the thing about Yang.

2508
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:37,960
I like Yang.

2509
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:38,680
He's not going to win.

2510
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,680
But he's young, right?

2511
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,640
Like he can run again.

2512
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:44,120
Well, that's why you have to vote for him

2513
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:45,880
because you need to build up the

2514
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,400
cachet of his reputation.

2515
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,280
But he's, I want like you.

2516
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:50,520
Okay.

2517
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,800
Look, Democratic Party.

2518
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,800
I see what you're saying, but I don't agree.

2519
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,720
Nobody, none of the Democratic candidates

2520
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:57,640
have a fucking chance against Trump.

2521
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,560
Maybe Yang would, but he's not big enough.

2522
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,280
No, Bernie could win.

2523
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,280
I start, Bernie could absolutely win.

2524
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,080
I don't know.

2525
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:03,880
I don't know about that.

2526
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,560
He could, he could have won in 2016.

2527
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:06,520
He could win in 2012.

2528
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:06,680
A lot of people do not like Trump.

2529
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,840
Bernie is the only one who I think would

2530
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,840
even have a chance, but like.

2531
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:10,920
Exactly.

2532
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,360
I also think that.

2533
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,840
Exactly, exactly, did she?

2534
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:15,240
I don't think he would.

2535
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,120
Oh my God.

2536
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:17,800
Well, okay.

2537
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:18,520
I don't agree.

2538
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:18,920
Whatever.

2539
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,440
Man, what happened to hating boomers?

2540
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,120
Let's bring back the hatred of old people.

2541
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:23,400
That's the bad I know and love.

2542
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,720
There's a, there's a small undercurrent.

2543
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:25,880
Okay.

2544
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:27,640
There's a small undercurrent.

2545
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,840
Bernie's the good kind of boomer.

2546
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,600
Bernie like threw trash at like,

2547
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,120
separatists during the civil rights movement and stuff.

2548
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:34,920
Bernie's a champion.

2549
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,640
This conversation is the war on normal people.

2550
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,120
Wait, hold on a minute.

2551
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:41,000
Wait, I want to.

2552
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,280
Speaking of books, speaking of books,

2553
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,440
there's another, there is a book that I do really want to read

2554
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,960
that's called Bullshit Jobs.

2555
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,440
Uh-huh.

2556
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,320
You ever heard of that one?

2557
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:47,880
I don't think so.

2558
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,880
It is just, it's just about how like.

2559
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,360
Every job, every job.

2560
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,960
It's just about how like most job,

2561
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,880
or like tons of jobs.

2562
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,480
I mean, in, in like the modern world.

2563
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,200
Hey, hey, you know how.

2564
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,960
Literally do not contribute anything.

2565
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,280
You know how micro does that show dirty jobs?

2566
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,840
They exist purely to be middlemen who like just,

2567
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:07,400
just like do not contribute to the actual chain of supply.

2568
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:08,840
Micro does that job dirty jobs.

2569
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,840
I want to do my show bullshit jobs.

2570
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,440
Just too pointless.

2571
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:14,680
Don't add value to the world or anyone.

2572
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,720
That's, that's going to be my show.

2573
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,080
You're already doing the bullshit job right now.

2574
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:18,040
We're all fucking on YouTube.

2575
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:18,600
Yeah.

2576
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,320
You're right.

2577
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,720
By Dave, David, Bullshit Jobs by David Graber.

2578
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,160
This is a book I've been hearing about a lot

2579
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:23,800
that I want to read.

2580
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,680
I have two books.

2581
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,520
One for Ben and one for the audience.

2582
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,720
For Ben, I recommend God and the State

2583
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,480
by Mikal Bakunin.

2584
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,760
Mikal Bakunin.

2585
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,080
God and the State.

2586
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:33,960
Oh Bakunin.

2587
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,680
Oh Bakunin.

2588
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,840
Bakunin is the guy who thinks inheritance is immoral.

2589
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,160
He's my boy.

2590
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:37,240
Yeah.

2591
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:37,880
Basculean.

2592
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,600
Basculean.

2593
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:39,080
Bananas.

2594
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:39,400
Yes.

2595
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:39,800
I understand now.

2596
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,040
Yes.

2597
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,080
Bananas.

2598
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:41,480
Okay.

2599
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,120
That's right.

2600
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:44,760
So I've been, it warrants my heart that you actually

2601
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,920
paid attention to a reference or like a reference

2602
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:47,480
that I gave you.

2603
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:48,440
Yeah.

2604
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:49,880
The, that, that, the revolution.

2605
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:50,040
Yeah.

2606
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,200
I listened to the, I want to go back and listen to more

2607
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:52,840
because there's probably more.

2608
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:53,240
Oh yeah.

2609
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,040
Oh, there's way more.

2610
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:54,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2611
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:55,720
Yeah.

2612
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:56,680
Oh God.

2613
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,520
It's so cool that bird, bird.

2614
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:58,760
Dude.

2615
01:41:58,760 --> 01:41:59,160
Okay.

2616
01:41:59,160 --> 01:41:59,880
I, I was good.

2617
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,080
We're talking about theories.

2618
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,040
What's the other book though?

2619
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:03,480
Well, hold on.

2620
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:03,640
Wait.

2621
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,880
Actually before that, because this is way more important.

2622
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:08,600
I was pacing back and forth last night again,

2623
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,760
as I mentioned, just running back and forth in my room,

2624
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,240
just seething in anger about UPS.

2625
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:15,560
And I got thinking about how like it's,

2626
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:18,120
it's sort of a weird melodramatic statement.

2627
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,800
But I don't mean it any such thing,

2628
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,560
but I almost feel like I don't relate to anyone anymore.

2629
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,680
Not that I have surpassed them in any level of intellect,

2630
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:29,480
not even remotely that, but just as in like,

2631
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,560
I feel as though my interests are so different

2632
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,000
from the people I surround myself with,

2633
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,760
that like we just have different interests.

2634
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,520
And it's not a bad or good thing.

2635
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,160
It just is a difference in taste.

2636
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,920
And hashtag parents will never get it.

2637
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:41,320
Got it.

2638
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:41,960
No, no.

2639
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,600
That's, specifically, no.

2640
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,960
What you are describing is how I ended up in the internet

2641
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,160
and in this group.

2642
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:52,680
Like this is exactly, it was just like a gradual process

2643
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:55,880
of like the more I got into being a YouTuber

2644
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,160
and doing things that not, that most people don't do,

2645
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:02,040
the more it's like my friends just literally can't relate.

2646
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:04,360
It's just like, it wasn't like we had a falling out

2647
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:05,640
or we stopped being friends or anything.

2648
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:07,880
It's like they were into playing video games.

2649
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,640
I was into making YouTube videos.

2650
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,120
And like they didn't really want to make YouTube videos.

2651
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,800
And I didn't really want to play video games.

2652
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,280
And like the only people I could find

2653
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:18,520
who I could really relate to are other people

2654
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,680
who were doing not just YouTube videos,

2655
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,520
but like a similar type.

2656
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,600
Like that's kind of how this group got formed.

2657
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,640
It's like, oh, these are all people who are not just even

2658
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:30,520
like doing my little pony analysis videos,

2659
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:35,320
but like doing it with a certain attitude of like being capable

2660
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,000
of like a more in-depth analysis,

2661
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,920
but not taking it seriously, having this attitude of like,

2662
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:43,960
yeah, we could just have fun and be kind of edgy.

2663
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,920
And you know, just like analyze this show

2664
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,840
because it's entertaining to do

2665
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:51,240
and intellectually stimulating exercise.

2666
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:54,120
But like, you know, it's like, yeah,

2667
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,880
these are the only people doing this,

2668
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,320
something close enough to what I'm doing

2669
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:58,920
that I can even have a conversation

2670
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,640
about the things that I'm, that like matter to me.

2671
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:04,280
Cause like even, you can't even like talk to fans

2672
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,360
or like other kinds of creators

2673
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,600
if you're just trying to talk about like the reception

2674
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:11,640
of your work or like what it's like to do this job.

2675
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,880
No one fucking gets it at all, you know?

2676
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,200
And you can like, you can make it vague enough

2677
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,960
that other people kind of get it.

2678
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,360
You know, you can kind of say, you know,

2679
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:24,040
use metaphor to some extent to make people understand

2680
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,000
like what you're dealing with,

2681
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,280
but like just the specifics of it,

2682
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,080
it's like, it's, it's a new job.

2683
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,760
No one's done it and nobody gets it.

2684
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:34,280
It is definitely the most alienating hell imaginable

2685
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,000
and you will lose everyone you love and care about.

2686
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,280
That is definitely true.

2687
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,800
Those are maybe a negative.

2688
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,000
I'm feeling that didgy, but not so much for what I'm doing.

2689
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,960
More so like, it's funny that you use that metaphor

2690
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,280
as in like what got you into this group,

2691
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:50,680
whereas suppose I feel it's almost shifting away,

2692
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,520
not in a, in a, in a, and again,

2693
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,920
it's like so easy to take the words I'm saying

2694
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,600
and assign like a malice or a sort of like, I don't know,

2695
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,680
even a victim hood, that's not all I mean.

2696
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:02,040
I'll even expand on what I said and say,

2697
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,440
like I feel the same way about this group too,

2698
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,600
that I don't talk to these guys as much

2699
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,320
because we're not as much all doing the exact same thing.

2700
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:12,920
And like all of us kind of have other stuff going on that like,

2701
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
we're definitely in late stage PCP.

2702
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,840
Yeah.

2703
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:18,680
This is going down soon.

2704
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,480
It's like, it's harder for me to communicate

2705
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,560
with like Munchie or Ben because,

2706
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,760
or anybody who's in the fucking endless war

2707
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,000
because I don't participate in it

2708
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,160
and like a huge amount of the conversation.

2709
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:32,000
Like for anybody wondering, like when we get together now,

2710
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,800
if you get Ben and Munchie in the same room,

2711
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,880
it is an endless war of endless war.

2712
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,480
It's just endless war all the time.

2713
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:43,000
And it's like, I literally don't know

2714
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,400
what they're talking about.

2715
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,240
So like.

2716
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:49,360
I understand Digi in this war's rock.

2717
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,840
I click the link in the description.

2718
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,480
I feel whenever I get on the PCP,

2719
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,840
I have shows where it's like,

2720
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:57,280
the core appeal is my personality

2721
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,520
and I'm selling my ideas for, you know,

2722
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,360
I'm to the people, to the masses,

2723
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,600
the PCP and RFCK, the show.

2724
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,960
And it's weird because I get on these

2725
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,160
and I'm like, okay, I'm ready to talk

2726
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,840
and I have ideas in my mind

2727
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:11,880
that I'm really passionate about

2728
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,720
and I think about it.

2729
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,280
I meditate on day in and day out.

2730
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:17,960
And I get on like, oh wait, like I would be really boring

2731
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:20,440
if I were to just like monologue for like an hour

2732
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,640
and then like say a thing

2733
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,280
and then like no one has anything to input on

2734
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,640
because none of them are thinking

2735
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,360
or care about the same things I do.

2736
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,880
And a chief among them, I mean, there's more than this,

2737
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,480
but chief among them is like the thing

2738
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,560
that I always bring up and feel super embarrassed about

2739
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,080
which is history, where there's no way you can say

2740
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,280
that you like history

2741
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,200
without being a fucking pretentious snob.

2742
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,400
And just, and people like,

2743
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,440
even when they hear the words history, they're like,

2744
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,880
oh God, look at the, who does this guy think he fucking is?

2745
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,960
Whereas I've always maintained that just is anime,

2746
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,960
just is media, history just is like a cartoon show

2747
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:52,800
that you watch.

2748
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,280
And it's interesting the exact same,

2749
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:57,120
literally exact same ways that any other show would be.

2750
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:59,440
So that's where most of my ideas come from

2751
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,080
and most of what I'm thinking about.

2752
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,600
The book that I was going to recommend

2753
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:06,040
is a 32 hour Napoleon biography,

2754
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:07,760
Napoleon A Life by Andrew Roberts.

2755
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,280
Fantastic, great book.

2756
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,760
And I just had so many ideas

2757
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,160
and I was thinking so much about it

2758
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,440
about all the quotes from Napoleon,

2759
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,600
all the ups and turns of that.

2760
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,120
I just wanted to talk to someone about it so badly

2761
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,960
and just suggest it, but like there's no one

2762
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,240
I can do that with that I know.

2763
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,320
Like there's absolutely no one, like no one would care.

2764
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,160
Like it's-

2765
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:25,000
I care.

2766
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,840
I care about Napoleon.

2767
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,520
I remember the time that he went to the water park,

2768
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,600
that was really cool.

2769
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,240
Oh!

2770
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,080
Yeah.

2771
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:32,920
Yeah.

2772
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:35,240
Trash.

2773
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,720
I, it's boring for both people, right?

2774
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:40,160
Where it's like, it's boring for someone who doesn't care

2775
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,320
to be like, oh yeah, he's like just saying things to me now.

2776
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,880
Like he's just repeating a thing

2777
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,480
that has happened before, yawn.

2778
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,320
It's also boring for me

2779
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:49,360
because it's like I'm just saying a thing to someone

2780
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,560
and then they're like, cool.

2781
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:51,840
You know, there's no conversation.

2782
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,760
There's no actual discussion of things.

2783
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,040
It's fucking, it's boring.

2784
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,880
I feel like stifled, but not in like,

2785
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:59,640
again, it's not like an outward,

2786
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,520
like people have done it to me.

2787
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,720
It's just like, I don't know.

2788
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,560
I don't know how to fix it.

2789
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,400
I don't know how I got on this.

2790
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,520
I don't know, I started talking about this.

2791
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,960
Munchy, did you read God in the State?

2792
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:10,280
Yeah, I haven't finished it, but I read like,

2793
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,880
I think I read like a third of it.

2794
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,680
Munchy, here's what I reckon about, unironically.

2795
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:17,000
Podcast.

2796
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,800
I'm glad you reminded me about Bacuna.

2797
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,520
Podcast about all these things

2798
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,560
because what I found in,

2799
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,720
this is what I originally loved about Twitter

2800
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:27,320
and it's also true of just anywhere.

2801
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:31,520
If you just like talk about something in a big enough sphere

2802
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,240
where enough people see it,

2803
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,640
guaranteed one of them cares.

2804
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:38,720
So like, if you make a podcast about Napoleon,

2805
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:42,920
like 99% chance somebody in your comments

2806
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,960
knows even more about Napoleon than you do

2807
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,680
and would love to have a conversation

2808
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,400
about Napoleon with you, you know?

2809
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,320
So like, you just got to kind of like farm around.

2810
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:52,920
You know, you just got to like make public,

2811
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,080
cause like, I think I described Twitter once

2812
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:58,480
as a place where you could just announce your desire

2813
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,560
to have a conversation with somebody

2814
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,840
to as many people as possible

2815
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:05,200
and maybe one of them wants to have that conversation,

2816
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,200
you know, which is something that, you know,

2817
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,040
you can't do at home.

2818
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,600
It's just there's not enough people around you

2819
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,600
with the same interests.

2820
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:13,480
It's fun you bring up that specific thing

2821
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:16,880
because last night, again, I was, oh, you PS Minecraft,

2822
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:17,960
did you bro?

2823
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,840
Because I was thinking a lot about the whirling dervish

2824
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,320
about how I really, really have enjoyed it so far

2825
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,840
and I listened to all of it.

2826
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,320
Yeah, and I've gotten really like,

2827
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,920
because more and more I felt like, yeah,

2828
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,560
conversations are good

2829
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,520
and like I love listening to podcasts

2830
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,520
when both the co-house are on the same page, right?

2831
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,360
But like, there's something so direct

2832
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:39,320
about the whirling dervish

2833
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,960
because just is like you just saying what you believe

2834
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,600
and it's not like, it's not like you are saying it

2835
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,480
and then the other person just has to constantly give like,

2836
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,920
yeah, or it's like they butt in about like,

2837
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,440
I don't know, just whatever, you know,

2838
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,720
you could just have like a full complete point

2839
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,800
and it feels so much more dense than another thing.

2840
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,400
Even if it had the exact same content,

2841
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,080
just the idea that there's another person there

2842
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,640
who like isn't speaking can like clutter the perception

2843
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:05,560
of it just being like a one-sided conversation

2844
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,600
that feels somewhat awkward.

2845
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,200
So I love that, I was thinking about that.

2846
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,120
And last night, I don't know, I think I said this earlier,

2847
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:13,480
but I opened up a voice recorder

2848
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,360
and I just wanted to speak aloud.

2849
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,780
I was going to write down all my thoughts,

2850
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:19,080
but writing is really agonizing for me

2851
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,760
and I hate it even when it's extremely conscious.

2852
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,720
Like it just, there's just something wrong with my brain.

2853
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,360
And so I wanted to talk aloud and just speak to myself.

2854
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,280
I thought it'd be awkward.

2855
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:29,000
So I just recorded a podcast that I wasn't going to release.

2856
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:29,840
I might release it now,

2857
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,480
but it was literally what you were describing

2858
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,720
just like about the point about what I was thinking about.

2859
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:35,960
And also just like all about what I have just described today.

2860
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,600
I had practiced around for this very podcast last night.

2861
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,720
Yeah, I mean, I've done that plenty of times as well.

2862
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,080
Just like recorded a podcast about something

2863
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,000
and then just been like, yeah, well,

2864
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,720
I understand that I wanted to get that off my chest,

2865
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:49,080
but that was not interesting.

2866
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,320
So I just throw it away, you know.

2867
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:55,320
Did you guys know that dinosaurs are a conspiracy?

2868
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:56,320
They're not real.

2869
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,480
They never existed.

2870
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,560
I just know that endless jess is a conspiracy.

2871
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,400
I think I've probably believed you.

2872
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:03,120
He's actually an ARG that I created.

2873
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,880
What's the basis of this?

2874
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,840
I've been getting really into this no dinosaurs conspiracy.

2875
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:09,840
All right, I want to know.

2876
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,040
Cause I mean, like, I'm sad about it.

2877
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:13,360
I'm already engaged.

2878
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,800
I mean, like I'm really, I'm really actually upset about it

2879
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,800
because like my baseline is that I believe

2880
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,400
every conspiracy is true until proven otherwise.

2881
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:24,600
So if I just hear something that sounds like outrageous enough,

2882
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,400
I'm like, oh no, that must be true.

2883
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,360
Oh no, the world's even worse than I thought it was.

2884
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:31,600
And so I found out there's no dinosaurs

2885
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,120
that it was all made up.

2886
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:38,640
There's a guy who like, I guess like they, you know,

2887
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:41,360
paleontologists are only allowed to dig in certain areas

2888
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,120
and they came in and they put the bones there

2889
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,040
and the bones are made up

2890
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,720
and they were made out of salt or something,

2891
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:47,000
some shit, I don't know.

2892
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,400
It made no sense, but I believe it.

2893
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:52,880
God put them there to trick us into thinking

2894
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:53,840
that evolution was there.

2895
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,400
Well, yeah, that's the thing.

2896
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:00,360
It's like a subset of the evolution as a myth conspiracy.

2897
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:03,280
You know guys, I believe the Creeges Museum in Kentucky

2898
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,720
right across the river from here

2899
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:07,920
and they have confirmed, they have confirmed for me

2900
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,280
that man, dinosaurs were on the ark with Noah.

2901
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,040
They just died of unrelated causes afterward.

2902
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:16,320
Well, I hope so because that's better than the alternative.

2903
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,200
The dinosaurs were totally fake and never existed

2904
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,960
because the idea that they existed as we believe,

2905
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,160
I don't believe that anymore.

2906
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,280
I already saw the conspiracy

2907
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:25,480
so I have to believe it.

2908
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,640
Sounds right.

2909
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,400
You know, yeah, because I guess,

2910
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,600
I think the gist of it was that like the powers that be

2911
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,520
don't want us to believe the truth,

2912
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,360
which is that God created Adam and Eve

2913
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,440
and they wrote on dinosaurs or something.

2914
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,280
Okay.

2915
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:41,760
No, they want us to believe that there were dinosaurs

2916
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,160
and then people were monkeys and then came into,

2917
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:46,800
I don't know, the point is some guy said it,

2918
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,400
so I believe it, fuck it, and I'm sad now.

2919
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:50,720
I want there to be dinosaurs.

2920
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:51,560
You know what?

2921
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,400
Conspiracies are bullshit.

2922
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,200
I'm not a conspiracy guy anymore.

2923
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,320
I'm totally, in fact, I'm anti-conspiracy.

2924
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:59,200
I don't believe anything anyone tells me unless it's cool.

2925
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,040
You know what?

2926
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:00,880
That's my new philosophy.

2927
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:02,360
Forget all my previous philosophies.

2928
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,760
My new philosophy is only believe what's cool.

2929
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,840
And if you hear something that sounds cool, it's true.

2930
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,680
And if you hear something, no, no.

2931
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,880
And if it sounds bad, then it's not true.

2932
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,440
That's, it doesn't know, fake and real are constructs.

2933
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,680
Honestly, that's like a healthy way to live.

2934
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,200
That's like a real way to live.

2935
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:19,000
What if I think like basically everything sounds cool

2936
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,080
no matter how bad it is?

2937
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,280
Like, am I the only one who,

2938
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,360
when something like really awful happens,

2939
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,080
I feel kind of like, like, yeah.

2940
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:27,920
No.

2941
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:28,760
I get what you're saying.

2942
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,880
Like, what do you define really bad, did you?

2943
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,920
Like a school shooting?

2944
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:34,160
Like 9-11 happened, you were like, yeah.

2945
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,000
No, no.

2946
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:35,840
Yeah.

2947
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,960
You're quietly to yourself.

2948
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:37,800
Yeah.

2949
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:40,960
I guess more like complex things

2950
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,520
that seem like they would happen on TV, you know?

2951
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,360
You go like, oh, shit, that's right.

2952
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,600
Like, people really are fucking complicated

2953
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,440
and weird and crazy.

2954
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,920
It's like art really does imitate art.

2955
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,800
No, I mean, yeah, there's a whole George Carlin

2956
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,920
bit about that where he's like,

2957
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,880
I kind of like it when a lot of people die.

2958
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,960
And it's like, yeah, yeah, I'm with you, man.

2959
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,000
I'm with you 100%.

2960
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,880
It's fucking cool and funny when a lot of people die.

2961
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,280
Maybe it'll help me articulate this better

2962
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,400
because I literally just spring into my mind.

2963
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,160
I don't know how to articulate this at all.

2964
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:10,720
And he made that bit and he recorded it for an album

2965
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:13,960
and like the next day, September 11th happened.

2966
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:14,800
Oh my God.

2967
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,760
So like it had, that album wasn't released,

2968
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:19,360
but it's hilarious.

2969
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:21,080
I just want to say, by the way,

2970
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,240
before we lose sight of the real point of this conversation,

2971
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,160
which is dinosaurs being great.

2972
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:28,160
Digi, Digi Dino has been sitting in a cell for years.

2973
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,680
Now he's turned into a fossil.

2974
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:30,880
When will you revive him?

2975
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,520
Please, please, please, please.

2976
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,120
What do you want me to do with Digi Dino?

2977
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:38,120
Please, please.

2978
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:40,280
Have him post meme review or something.

2979
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,440
I don't know.

2980
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,960
I don't even think I have the files anymore.

2981
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,280
That's on like an old computer.

2982
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,160
Dude, don't worry, bro.

2983
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,000
He's got you covered.

2984
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,440
No, I got you, bro.

2985
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,760
We're going to get like 50 animations.

2986
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,280
I'm always hesitant to use.

2987
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,160
I have like some, you know, certain pieces of old munchie

2988
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:57,320
art on my computer.

2989
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:59,400
I'm going to, in fact, post one in the chat

2990
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,240
so we can have it in the show notes.

2991
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:06,480
One that I've used it one time for a shitty attempt

2992
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,240
at a freestyle that I posted on SoundCloud.

2993
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:12,120
I don't even remember this.

2994
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:13,880
That's the only thing I've ever used it for.

2995
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:17,400
It's this one, the Special Forces Anime Guru Hobo Digi.

2996
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:20,240
Oh, yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember this.

2997
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:23,320
I'm always hesitant to use any old munchie art for anything

2998
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:26,800
because munchie will scream at me about how it's shit art

2999
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,120
that he made when he was a baby and he needs to redo it

3000
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,520
and replace it every time.

3001
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,600
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3002
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,480
Okay, Digi, hold on.

3003
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:35,240
I just want to clear my name, by the way,

3004
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:38,160
because I understand why you would think that.

3005
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:42,560
But I just want to like remind you that like things change

3006
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,640
and it's been like four years since that this last happened.

3007
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,000
That's not true.

3008
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,920
I don't know if it's been four years, but maybe two years.

3009
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,600
Well, okay, it's been literally four seconds

3010
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,560
since Muncie questioned every piece of art

3011
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:58,120
he's ever put pen to paper on and created.

3012
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:01,000
I think old munchie art looks really like grody

3013
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:01,960
for about like a better word.

3014
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,480
Like it looks like weird.

3015
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:05,200
If you look at my old like pony art,

3016
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:09,280
it's like a fucking like, it's like a wax museum.

3017
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:12,080
It's like a strange uncanny experience.

3018
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,400
But I have no problem with anyone posting it in any context

3019
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,280
and I would love it if you were to use

3020
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,920
any art of mine ever, Digi.

3021
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,880
So I'm just going to use this hobo as my avatar

3022
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:23,080
everywhere from now on forever.

3023
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:27,360
This is the best art of me that exists probably.

3024
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,840
But just make sure you realize that you are Asgore

3025
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,480
and you were destroying the undertale.

3026
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,600
Instead of mercy, it's a good taste just there.

3027
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:37,000
Oh, am I supposed to be Asgore?

3028
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:37,840
What the fuck?

3029
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:38,680
Yeah, yeah.

3030
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:40,080
It's got a trident and a cape, I guess.

3031
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:40,920
Yeah.

3032
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,240
I had no hype.

3033
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:46,200
Ever.

3034
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,040
Remember Asgore, guys?

3035
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:49,200
Yeah, he's pretty cool.

3036
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:51,240
Best anime ever.

3037
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,160
He was daddy.

3038
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,800
He was a daddy in a big way.

3039
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:56,600
Yeah, but yeah, see, look at this fucking dinosaur hoax

3040
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:57,600
page I just linked.

3041
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,720
I mean, look at how many words are on this page.

3042
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,720
It must be true.

3043
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,680
And they've written so many words on this map.

3044
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:08,280
Why did they label it themselves as a conspiracy?

3045
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:11,280
No, they labeled it as a conspiracy.

3046
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:13,040
We've got to move to Dinosauria.

3047
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,240
When everyone's like, oh, the sea levels are right now, fuck.

3048
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:16,920
I'm fine in Dinosauria.

3049
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:21,480
Guys, the PCP has assigned a single release contract

3050
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,360
with Dinosauria.

3051
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:25,160
It's going to be the one-stop shop for the PCP from now on.

3052
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:28,560
Jesse, I think you're going to have to rethink your logic

3053
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,600
here, because there's actually not that many words.

3054
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,280
If you only go 40% of the other way down the page,

3055
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,280
it becomes the comments.

3056
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,240
So half of this page is comments,

3057
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:39,960
and also the formatting of the page

3058
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,360
is such that there is just one tiny column.

3059
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,360
So you're right.

3060
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,840
It's mostly comments.

3061
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,360
It would be like five paragraphs, and that's it.

3062
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,760
You see, that's right, because I form most of my opinions

3063
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,440
on 40% of anything.

3064
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:53,120
Makes sense.

3065
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:55,280
That's as much as I care to read.

3066
01:57:55,280 --> 01:58:02,320
I just saw this on the page, and I appreciate it immensely.

3067
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:03,320
Make your own.

3068
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,320
Make your own.

3069
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,120
Make your own.

3070
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:09,880
Full proof instructions for budding paleontologists.

3071
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:12,640
You know that I really wanted to be a paleontologist

3072
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:13,520
when I was a kid?

3073
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:14,120
So did I.

3074
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:15,600
That's a real kid goal.

3075
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:17,040
I wanted to be an astronomer.

3076
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,640
Obviously, because of Jurassic Park.

3077
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:23,320
But I had a book called The Big Book of Dinosaurs.

3078
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:26,440
It was like fucking 12,000 pages,

3079
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:29,920
this gigantic phone book of every page

3080
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,960
which just had a different dinosaur and a shitload

3081
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:34,080
of facts about them, which had blown my mind,

3082
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,520
because there's only 12 dinosaurs anybody talks about,

3083
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:40,320
but this book had like fucking hundreds of dinosaurs in it.

3084
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:40,840
That's pretty sick.

3085
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:42,160
That was more of a space kid.

3086
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,000
Honestly, like the planets.

3087
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,080
If someone can actually convince me

3088
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,160
that dinosaurs never existed, you

3089
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:53,160
will make me depressed for the rest of my life.

3090
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:55,160
Well, I mean, this guy, apparently the guy who

3091
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:58,240
makes this blog, Eric Dubey, I clicked on the link

3092
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,480
to see what he is.

3093
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,280
I mean, this is in very tiny resolution,

3094
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:04,720
but there's this picture of him in a meditative pose.

3095
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:05,760
He looks so smart.

3096
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,520
Oh, crap.

3097
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,920
He definitely wasn't in that bed.

3098
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,720
He definitely took a picture of himself in a meditative

3099
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:14,440
and then Google search like cool eclectic meditation bedroom

3100
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:16,480
and then Photoshopped himself on top of it.

3101
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,800
Yeah, it's a high level, high IQ move.

3102
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:22,680
His blogs, Natural First, Eric's Esoterics, The Atlantean

3103
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:27,720
Conspiracy, the Happy Health Homepage, and Bangkok Wing Chun.

3104
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:31,040
He's a yoga and Wing Chun part time teacher

3105
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,520
while exposing the New World Order.

3106
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:34,840
This is his claim about him.

3107
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,600
Oh, Hulcogan, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash.

3108
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,400
They're at it again.

3109
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,800
The New World Order is always messing shit up for everyone.

3110
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,040
I want to give a shout to my, when I was a kid,

3111
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:48,520
I was like, it's weird to think how when I was a kid,

3112
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,880
I just believed conspiracy theories

3113
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,360
and wasn't even scared about it.

3114
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:54,800
Wasn't even like, placed a lot of emphasis on it.

3115
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,600
I was just like, oh, spirit science?

3116
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:57,800
That's probably true.

3117
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:01,400
Oh, just whatever conspiracy, that's just probably true.

3118
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:02,240
That makes sense.

3119
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:05,720
Unironically, love all conspiracy theories.

3120
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:08,760
And I believe a few of them.

3121
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:13,000
OK, wait, I've got a recommendation for Jesse.

3122
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,520
Storm Cloud's Gathering.

3123
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:17,920
Storm Cloud's Gathering has some classic Obama conspiracy

3124
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,040
videos, just classic.

3125
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,720
A lot of World War III predictions

3126
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:24,320
that he says is going to start in 2014.

3127
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,920
So I'm excited to see how he's justified it.

3128
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:29,320
It's a very cold war going on, very cold war.

3129
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:33,040
I want to make a channel, just for a separate YouTube channel,

3130
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,760
just for talking about conspiracies

3131
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:38,600
and how cool they all are, even the scary ones,

3132
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:39,840
especially the scary ones.

3133
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,240
I would be damned for that 100%.

3134
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:45,280
And have it not even attached to me in any way

3135
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,040
that anyone can trace back to me.

3136
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:50,400
Because the sad thing is that you can't even

3137
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,480
appreciate conspiracy theories, because if you

3138
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,920
talk about them at all, people label you something,

3139
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:58,800
or this or that, or think you're an evil idiot asshole.

3140
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,800
But it's like, I don't care if it's true or not.

3141
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,240
They're just fucking cool.

3142
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:04,560
They're all awesome.

3143
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,880
Have you guys ever watched any of that?

3144
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:08,840
Fall down a rabbit hole and finding the evidence,

3145
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:12,120
and finding the connections, and hearing people,

3146
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:15,000
like the experts on them, like the crypto experts and shit.

3147
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,880
It's so fun.

3148
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:17,480
It's so cool.

3149
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:20,840
Have you ever watched, before Alex Jones did his radio show,

3150
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:23,480
he made huge documentary movies.

3151
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:25,920
And I've watched all of them, and they're fascinating.

3152
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:26,520
Oh, OK.

3153
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,480
If you never had no idea.

3154
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:29,280
You got to watch The Obama Deception.

3155
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,120
That's a fucking masterpiece.

3156
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,640
What's the gist of that one?

3157
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:35,040
That Obama's a puppet of the New World Order.

3158
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,440
And there's a whole thing.

3159
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,560
That's definitely true.

3160
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:38,120
Easy.

3161
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:41,800
His first videos where he storms Bohemian Grove

3162
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:45,080
and tries to break into this place where all these rich people

3163
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:45,840
hang out.

3164
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,200
That's how you get them.

3165
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:50,160
You start them with stuff that's totally obviously true.

3166
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,160
Like, yeah, Obama's a puppet of the New World Order.

3167
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:54,120
So that's how you get into conspiracy.

3168
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:56,480
And then from there, you can slowly get more and more

3169
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,200
until you're where dinosaurs weren't real.

3170
02:01:58,200 --> 02:01:59,200
Oh, shit.

3171
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,200
What?

3172
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,440
You know, this first comment by Alex Jones.

3173
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:06,200
It's all about the clockwork elves and the psychic pedophiles.

3174
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:08,360
Oh, you know, the biggest thing he thinks

3175
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:11,280
is, I've seen some of this, the biggest thing he thinks

3176
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,080
is that the elites of our world are attempting

3177
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:18,120
to create an interdimensional psychic separation where

3178
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,480
they're going to, I think, clone themselves.

3179
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:22,480
It's like literally the plot of Evangelion,

3180
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:25,360
where they're trying to separate themselves

3181
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,240
into a higher plane of existence.

3182
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:27,880
I believe that.

3183
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:30,080
In some interdimensional connection thing,

3184
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,280
it like leaves the rest of humanity behind or something.

3185
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:34,760
There are very few things Alex Jones has said that I didn't

3186
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:35,280
think.

3187
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:38,080
Yeah, that sounds plausible.

3188
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:41,480
I mean, I have definitely changed the wording a little bit.

3189
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:43,720
It definitely seems reasonable to me

3190
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:49,000
that there are extradimensional beings that have manipulated

3191
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,520
and convinced the elite of our society

3192
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,240
that by sacrificing children and having blood rituals,

3193
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:56,400
they can ascend to a higher plane of being

3194
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:59,000
by selling humanity's souls, by convincing everybody

3195
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,400
that we don't have souls.

3196
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,480
What else do you have to do at that point?

3197
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,600
You've conquered all of new society at that point.

3198
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:08,120
I've been getting really into the paranormal board

3199
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:11,840
on 4chan, which is like pole times 1,000.

3200
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,280
It's like, it's where the really wild stuff happens.

3201
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:18,120
If everyone wants to really pull back the lid,

3202
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:21,600
I recommend the paranormal board on 4chan.

3203
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:22,680
That's the cool shit.

3204
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,400
Because all the information is 4chan.

3205
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:28,040
So it's all conveniently put into these little PNG images

3206
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,800
and these old graphs.

3207
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,760
And you can look at one image and go, oh, shit.

3208
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:31,960
I understand the whole world now.

3209
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:34,760
Everything's fucked and there's no dinosaur as shit.

3210
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:39,000
I didn't realize how conspiratorially driven X was.

3211
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,760
But I guess I should start going on there.

3212
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:44,920
I mean, it used to be, years and years ago,

3213
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:47,600
when I first started looking at it and stuff,

3214
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:50,080
it used to be just creepy postures and scary shit

3215
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:51,640
and spooky ghosts and stuff.

3216
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:54,880
And then from there, it turned into a lot of Tulpa shit.

3217
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:59,000
And then from there, somehow that morphed into more New World

3218
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,480
order.

3219
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:01,680
I guess because the whole world just got way too political

3220
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,120
at a certain point.

3221
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:04,680
Probably around 2016.

3222
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:07,840
So all the scary spooky shit kind of dissipated from X.

3223
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,800
And it sort of got more and more into like, hey,

3224
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:11,600
you know these fucking New World order guys

3225
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,880
are sacrificing children to alien beings.

3226
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,720
Oh, you know what the best part of the 2016 presidential

3227
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:18,280
election was?

3228
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:20,880
Was learning about Hillary Clinton's spirit cooking?

3229
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,760
That was legitimately my favorite fucking part,

3230
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,640
was learning about spirit cooking,

3231
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:26,840
about all the crazy shit that Hillary Clinton does

3232
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:30,560
and her fucking dance pad orgies with spirit cooking.

3233
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,440
What is spirit cooking and why do I keep hearing about it?

3234
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,960
Well, it's because it's my favorite thing in the entire world

3235
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:38,600
and I constantly bring it up.

3236
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:42,680
So it's a thing where you take like a mutilated corpse

3237
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:44,600
and then just start eating it and boiling it

3238
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:47,640
and just sort of just fucking around with it in the kitchen.

3239
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:50,360
It makes it a delicious meal, man.

3240
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,320
So it's just cannibalistic?

3241
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,160
OK, listen to this.

3242
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:52,760
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3243
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:54,880
It doesn't say cannibalistic, too.

3244
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:55,520
That's another big aspect of the police.

3245
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:57,320
Urban Dictionary's goddess covered with this.

3246
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:59,720
OK, spirit cooking, a verb, an action

3247
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:02,680
in which ranking members of the Democratic Party

3248
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:06,240
ejaculate into an open wound on the breast milk soaked

3249
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:09,760
left hand in a quote, art form, similar to that

3250
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,080
of watercolor finger paints.

3251
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,040
That doesn't explain anything.

3252
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:14,200
No, I don't understand.

3253
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:16,240
That's the only definition on here, by the way.

3254
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:17,760
It doesn't even have anything to do with eating.

3255
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,960
I don't know.

3256
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:23,520
I know, first of it is that it's spooky cannibalism,

3257
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,640
not normal cannibalism, but just like specifically

3258
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:28,880
is cannibalism meant to scare you?

3259
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:31,000
You know, actually, the time I heard spirit cooking recently.

3260
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,360
That's totally OK.

3261
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:35,960
Out of interest, I wanted to hear Alex Jones take

3262
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:38,680
on the whole Epstein thing, who, by the way, was like,

3263
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:41,320
the thing about Alex Jones that's fucked up

3264
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:45,800
is that he seems to spout these wildly ridiculous claims.

3265
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:49,040
And then like 20 years later, he's proved like mostly

3266
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:50,440
correct about some of them.

3267
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:54,840
Like everything that we know as being true in history

3268
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:57,480
was at some point labeled a conspiracy theory.

3269
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:58,160
That's true.

3270
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,680
And I'm not saying that Alex Jones is right over time.

3271
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:03,160
I remember reading about Epstein and his island

3272
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:04,480
in like 2009.

3273
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:06,280
Alex Jones was one of the big guys saying

3274
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:09,160
Epstein was up to fuck shit like before anyone else.

3275
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:10,720
Everyone now is taking it as a given.

3276
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:12,520
Like it's like, oh, yeah, that totally happened.

3277
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:13,960
Well, like when people were saying

3278
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:15,720
it was happening eight years ago,

3279
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:18,200
everyone was saying, no, you're a conspiracy buff.

3280
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:19,360
Yeah.

3281
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:21,720
Well, I heard Alex Jones say that specifically

3282
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:25,320
they were doing satanic spirit cooking on Epstein's island.

3283
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:27,320
It always has to be fascinating.

3284
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:30,960
I talk about it in some of my videos for the last year.

3285
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,600
So this idea I have of the Otaku hero

3286
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:36,560
and how it's split between a character

3287
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:39,880
that I call the mad scientist and the living computer.

3288
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:41,440
And the mad scientist is somebody

3289
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,360
who can make all these connections

3290
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:46,120
and figure out all these things that are happening in the world.

3291
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:49,280
And he understands that they must be true,

3292
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:53,440
but cannot prove it or cannot find a way to convince people.

3293
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:56,960
And the living computer is the extremely logic driven person

3294
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:01,520
who is able to just like take in all this data.

3295
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:03,880
But like they will only believe something

3296
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:06,320
when they have the data in front of them.

3297
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:07,160
And like-

3298
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:08,000
I think there's a third version here,

3299
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,200
which is the fuck machine,

3300
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,280
which started with Tenchi Muyo back in the day,

3301
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,160
which is the original breeder.

3302
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:14,000
Anyway.

3303
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,400
But go on.

3304
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,360
So like, I think that a mad scientist

3305
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:20,160
will always figure things out before everybody else does,

3306
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:21,680
but nobody's gonna believe it

3307
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:24,200
until the computer has proven it, you know,

3308
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,040
until we have the data.

3309
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,000
And that's the drama of the series.

3310
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,560
It's just funny because like,

3311
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:30,080
wait, the what?

3312
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:31,800
The trauma-

3313
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,120
That's the drama, like the drama of the series

3314
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,120
is that he knows something,

3315
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:36,120
he's trying to prove it to the rest of the world.

3316
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:38,960
That's just the life story of Johnny Old School.

3317
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:41,880
Yeah, well, I mean, it's the life story of anybody,

3318
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:45,280
like anybody who is capable of recognizing things,

3319
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,000
they can't explain, it's just like,

3320
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,440
you can talk about it all day,

3321
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:51,160
but nobody's gonna believe it until they see the data.

3322
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:54,200
And like, you know, I think all of us have a few things

3323
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:58,680
that we like, we are fairly confident are true.

3324
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:01,880
And we're like, we're like, I know that

3325
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:04,960
I've seen all the connections, but I don't know how to,

3326
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,360
I don't know how to verbalize them,

3327
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,600
or like, I don't know where I can pull the evidence from,

3328
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,160
or like, I don't have the science to back it,

3329
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:13,360
but it is observably the case, you know?

3330
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,720
Most people feel that way, I'm sure.

3331
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,920
Yeah, and like, other people will just say,

3332
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:19,120
oh, you say it's observably the case,

3333
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:22,360
but I mean, you know, it could be this other thing.

3334
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:25,000
And it's like, okay, yeah, I guess, it could be that,

3335
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,040
but also, this is obviously true, you know?

3336
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:30,240
So it's something like the Epstein thing, it's like,

3337
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:31,600
yeah, unless there was evidence,

3338
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:35,240
no matter how obvious it might've been that it was true,

3339
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:37,320
it's just not going to be believed.

3340
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:39,800
And I mean, when you hear something

3341
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,960
that at first sounds completely impossibly insane

3342
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,840
and outrageous, like all the millionaires and billionaires

3343
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:48,400
are secretly fucking kids, you know?

3344
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:50,200
But then that turns out to be true?

3345
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,840
Well, then why wouldn't you also believe,

3346
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:53,280
oh yeah, also by the way,

3347
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:56,600
the world is run by like satanic cannibals that also,

3348
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:59,000
like, yeah, I believe it, I mean, fuck,

3349
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,360
no one believed the kids thing,

3350
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,760
but that turned out to be true, fuck it.

3351
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,640
I mean, we're just talking about like,

3352
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:07,600
the path of conspiracy, conspiratorial thinking.

3353
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:10,840
I mean, this first comment here by anonymous really,

3354
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:13,840
really spells out how we all feel.

3355
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:14,840
I think he goes,

3356
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:17,720
dude, my brain can't handle another lid

3357
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:19,840
being blown off the lie machine.

3358
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:24,600
First I find they messed with the shape of the earth,

3359
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:28,200
set up a military industrial complex like space agency,

3360
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,920
and now all the dinosaur bones shoved in my face

3361
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:34,200
since I was a child as a hoax too, my heart is broken.

3362
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:37,080
I have been lied to on so many levels my whole life.

3363
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:37,920
Why?

3364
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,760
The only thing that makes the most sense

3365
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,920
is their fear of God and his power to make or break creation.

3366
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:45,320
If anything, it proves more and more

3367
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:46,640
we have been warned in the Bible

3368
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:49,360
that the enemy is the father of lies.

3369
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,400
What's next?

3370
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,640
Radical Islam is the pure religion

3371
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,160
and the sheep will run to it.

3372
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:56,040
So sad.

3373
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:56,880
I'm so sad.

3374
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:57,720
I'm with you anonymous.

3375
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,560
What's this about late jazz?

3376
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:03,720
Yeah, written by my alter ego, anonymous.

3377
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:05,800
What does he mean they fucked with the shape of the earth?

3378
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:07,640
He's talking about flat earth shit, clearly.

3379
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,200
He's clearly, you know.

3380
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:11,800
They unflattened the earth.

3381
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:14,680
Like the earth was flat, but these fucking globalists.

3382
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:17,360
That's why they're called the globalists.

3383
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:20,360
Yeah, the parentheses, parentheses, parentheses,

3384
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:23,280
globalists took that flat earth and wrapped it into a ball

3385
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:24,120
just to fuck with all of us.

3386
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,120
So they could hold it in their hands

3387
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:26,440
as they power over everything.

3388
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,960
The deepest conspiracy of all,

3389
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:30,200
to turn the world into a globe.

3390
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:32,520
They did it.

3391
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:34,360
They did it, those monsters.

3392
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:35,720
Who's got any more spell side?

3393
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:37,040
We can't top this.

3394
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,200
Peace of the HQ ice wall.

3395
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,840
We should do it at the ice wall.

3396
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,520
Radcon five, atop the ice wall.

3397
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:51,360
We threw the earth this flat at Radcon five.

3398
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:52,840
That's the big vlog.

3399
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:55,440
That's the big vlog, on air.

3400
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:57,640
Let's go to voicemail's people.

3401
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:00,280
Link below, speak pipe, leave us voicemails.

3402
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:01,200
You know the drill people.

3403
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:02,520
We will play the good ones.

3404
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,120
We got like six, I think.

3405
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:05,240
Okay, first one.

3406
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:08,040
This is from, I think it's a misspelled rusty shackle

3407
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:10,080
for it, but I think that's the idea was going for.

3408
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:12,720
And he's apparently got a big problem.

3409
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,520
So let's see what he's got for us.

3410
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:15,840
Go.

3411
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,160
All right, PCP, I got a big fucking problem for you.

3412
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:19,800
I just recently moved into college.

3413
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:21,760
And you know, my dorm mates, they're pretty cool guys.

3414
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:23,360
You know, no problems there.

3415
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,840
The big problem is I can't fucking have time

3416
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:27,080
to jack off here.

3417
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,960
There's no fucking privacy.

3418
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,160
There's always somebody in the dorm

3419
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,600
that would hear me do it.

3420
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:35,680
And I just, I just need to do it.

3421
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:37,600
I need to jack off.

3422
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:40,720
Please, please tell me how I can find time to jack off.

3423
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:41,560
I got it.

3424
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,880
I know the answer.

3425
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:43,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3426
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,080
That's definitely you problem.

3427
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:45,920
You got it.

3428
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,240
Get a girlfriend, bro.

3429
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:48,160
Get a girlfriend.

3430
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:49,200
And here's why.

3431
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:50,800
People will leave you alone with your girlfriend

3432
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:51,880
thinking you're going to have sex there,

3433
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:53,920
but then you can jack off.

3434
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:58,720
That's not a bad strategy, but I also think, look,

3435
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,960
I've shared rooms with people many times.

3436
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,280
I've gotten away with jacking off nightly

3437
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,960
with other people in the room.

3438
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:09,640
All you got to do is build on the edge of your bed,

3439
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:12,880
just put like a fuckload of blankets and pillows.

3440
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:14,720
Just like build a fort, essentially,

3441
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:17,720
like a wall of like, I used to have,

3442
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,680
I shared my room with two other guys.

3443
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:22,240
I had a big, just like one half of my bed.

3444
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:24,440
I just had like all of my pillows and blankets

3445
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:26,640
just stacked on that side of the bed.

3446
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:28,160
So you could not see.

3447
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:30,800
I mean, I don't know if there's a reason

3448
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,280
that you're jacking off is loud,

3449
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:35,200
but I mean, all you need is to not be seen, right?

3450
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:38,520
Digi, I don't know if you're on the bottom bunk

3451
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,640
of a bunk bed, that's probably pretty difficult.

3452
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:44,760
I mean, put up a sheet, just put a cover around your bed,

3453
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:48,160
like just staple a sheet around the bed.

3454
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:51,080
I think it's generally considered socially uncouth

3455
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,920
to do it with other guys in the room.

3456
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:54,240
I'm not going to pretend like.

3457
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:55,920
I don't care about the socially uncouth.

3458
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:57,400
You have to jack off.

3459
02:12:57,400 --> 02:12:59,240
You can't just not jack off.

3460
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:00,440
I'm not going to pretend.

3461
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:03,040
I haven't in emergency situations

3462
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,040
jacked off with other guys in the room.

3463
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,880
I certainly have, as I think most God fearing Americans

3464
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:08,720
have expressed to do.

3465
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:11,280
I mean, if you have to share a room with other guys,

3466
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:14,880
it's like you're either sacrificing jacking off forever

3467
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,680
or you're jacking off in a room with other guys.

3468
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:18,520
You could just go do it in the bathroom.

3469
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:20,160
Yeah, that's the obvious choice.

3470
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:22,200
Like I don't understand why it's even a question of like,

3471
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,240
you have to do it in the room.

3472
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:27,800
Some of us don't like to hide our,

3473
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:31,280
we don't like to build a wall of shame between us.

3474
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:33,840
Some people like to sit in an office chair like a man,

3475
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,960
pull down our pants and go to town

3476
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:39,800
on a big wide computer screen with some sound at maximum

3477
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:41,520
so everyone can hear what I'm doing.

3478
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,400
Yeah, what does this mean?

3479
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,960
That jacking off can be quiet.

3480
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,440
I don't believe you.

3481
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,680
You can improve your hygiene as well.

3482
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:50,920
You can just go take a shower

3483
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:52,480
whenever you want to jack off.

3484
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:54,040
That's a lot of noise.

3485
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:55,520
Kill two birds with one stone.

3486
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:56,920
What produces noise?

3487
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:00,840
I personally, I like to jack off when I go to bed.

3488
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:03,360
Like it helps me get to sleep.

3489
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,320
As I think Jesse once said,

3490
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:07,320
it's the only activity that can wake you up

3491
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:10,120
in the morning and put you to bed at night.

3492
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:11,160
Sure.

3493
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,760
I don't remember saying that, but it's funny.

3494
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:14,040
So I'll take credit for it.

3495
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:15,760
I think you said that.

3496
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,040
But yeah, it's, you know, I can't,

3497
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,720
I have like a pevlavian response.

3498
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:23,080
Like the second I lay down in bed, I get an erection.

3499
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:25,240
So I have to do something about it.

3500
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:26,920
Shit.

3501
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:28,240
Look, I know exactly how this guy is.

3502
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:29,080
I hate it.

3503
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:29,920
I can't stand it.

3504
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:30,760
It's unfortunate.

3505
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:33,240
And the second I see a woman, it's gone.

3506
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,400
I remember this exact problem.

3507
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,720
When I was in college, I shared rooms and stuff.

3508
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:39,720
I remember like, I should have been like, sure.

3509
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:41,880
I remember I had my PSP,

3510
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:44,120
because this was like before we had, I had a smartphone.

3511
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:46,920
I'd bring my PSP with the like four porn tracks

3512
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:48,280
that I had loaded onto there.

3513
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:50,920
I would trundle my fat ass down to the bathroom

3514
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:53,320
and jerk off a few into the turlet.

3515
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:54,160
And it was horrible.

3516
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:55,000
And it was shameful.

3517
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,160
And it was terrible.

3518
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,160
Like, you know, like to watch porn.

3519
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:00,120
Checking up in a bathroom is not that comfortable.

3520
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:00,960
Like, if you-

3521
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:01,800
No, it's not.

3522
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:02,640
I agree.

3523
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:03,480
Try it.

3524
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:04,320
I mean, even in the shower, like you-

3525
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,800
I would feel so, I mean, it would feel uncomfortable

3526
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:08,120
doing it with like, you're in the bed.

3527
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:09,520
There's another guy in like the bed

3528
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,160
across the room or whatever.

3529
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:12,480
And you'd be like, I don't know,

3530
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:13,760
doesn't it take you out to be like,

3531
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:14,600
oh, what if he hears me?

3532
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:16,440
Oh, what if he sees the vibrations or whatever?

3533
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,720
It's just fucking good enough system that they can't.

3534
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:20,960
Like, again, if you're on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed,

3535
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:24,240
just put literally staple a fucking blanket

3536
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:27,200
or something around your bed and just have a sheet.

3537
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:30,040
Notice how we're offering no real solutions to his problem.

3538
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:30,880
What do you mean?

3539
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:31,760
We're telling him like, this is,

3540
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:33,120
that's not a solution, did you?

3541
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:33,960
That's not a solution.

3542
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:34,800
How is that not a, wait.

3543
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:37,040
He asked, how do I get away with jacking off

3544
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:38,560
with other people in the room?

3545
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:40,320
I'm talking about a permanent-

3546
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:41,160
Okay.

3547
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:43,080
Put a sheet around your bed forever.

3548
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:44,600
Don't just do it when you jack off.

3549
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:46,560
Just put it around for privacy purposes.

3550
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:47,400
Yeah, okay, okay.

3551
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,080
Because then you could have a fucking fort you live in.

3552
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:50,360
Like it's, first of all,

3553
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:52,560
I would do this even if it wasn't for jacking off.

3554
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:53,400
Just pretend.

3555
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:55,360
Just pretend that you're retarded.

3556
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:56,680
And then you can do it in front of people.

3557
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:58,160
Hold hands with your bro while you're sleeping.

3558
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:00,080
And, you know, like, good God-fearing Americans.

3559
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:02,120
Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna have to do it secretly

3560
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:02,960
with other guys in the room,

3561
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:04,240
you might as well just do it openly

3562
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,280
with other guys in the room.

3563
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,960
You might as well all jack off together.

3564
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:09,120
You might as well just all be gay.

3565
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:12,280
You might as well just be boyfriends with your boys.

3566
02:16:12,280 --> 02:16:15,080
This method is tested and proven by me.

3567
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:15,920
It works.

3568
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:17,920
Build a fort of blankets.

3569
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,080
Jack off quietly.

3570
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:22,920
Whatever happened to hiding a bunch of playboys

3571
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:24,280
in a tree stump in the woods?

3572
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:25,120
Whatever happened to that?

3573
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:25,960
I mean, that works too.

3574
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:28,960
Back when I grew up in the 1970s, that's what we did.

3575
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:31,040
Beep, beep.

3576
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:31,860
Solid play?

3577
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:32,700
Just, yeah, jacking off in the woods

3578
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:34,520
is also a good option.

3579
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,400
In the woods, in the woods.

3580
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:37,400
Good, good, also.

3581
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:39,640
Yeah, in the 100 acre wood.

3582
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:42,160
That's where Christopher went.

3583
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,600
The only problem with jacking off in the woods

3584
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,960
is A, in the winter, cold.

3585
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:47,720
B, bugs, grunts.

3586
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:49,080
Winter's coming, winter's coming.

3587
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:50,480
I think that's what the Starks were talking about.

3588
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:52,880
You know, we saw the Christopher Robin movie

3589
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:55,280
where he's old and he's reconnecting with Poo.

3590
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:58,920
I wanna see the middle school era, Winnie the Pooh movie,

3591
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,640
where Christopher Robin, all of his friends

3592
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,000
wanna hang out with him in the 100 acre woods,

3593
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
but he's like, I just came in here to jack off, Poo.

3594
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,200
Leave me alone, god damn.

3595
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:06,040
Oh my god.

3596
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:08,040
This reminds me of, this was probably the most,

3597
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:10,960
it was that exact scenario you just described,

3598
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:12,920
but it was of Andy in Toy Story.

3599
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:15,200
It was a robot chicken skit.

3600
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:16,600
And it was that he became a teenager

3601
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:18,960
and was like, oh god, this makes me actually wanna cry.

3602
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:21,120
It was Buzz Lightyear.

3603
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,840
And he's like, oh shit, we don't have a bong.

3604
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,040
This'll do.

3605
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:26,720
And they grab him, they like stick a straw into his brain

3606
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,440
and then they're like, use him as a bong.

3607
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:30,360
And then they put him back and Buzz like,

3608
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:32,960
oh, what happened guys, are we going to play today?

3609
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:35,840
And he's like, it's okay, Buzz, it's okay, you're gonna make.

3610
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:37,720
I wanna actually cry thinking about

3611
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:39,320
how he fucked up Buzz Lightyear

3612
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:40,960
and made him literally retarded.

3613
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,360
It's not, how could you do that robot chicken?

3614
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:44,640
You went too far.

3615
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:48,520
Let's do another voicemail before I burst into tears.

3616
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:50,920
Hey P, he probably filmed himself coming all over

3617
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:54,040
with Bo Peep a few times and posted it on 4chan.

3618
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:55,320
Most people do.

3619
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:56,680
That's just part of growing up.

3620
02:17:56,680 --> 02:18:00,080
Okay, next voicemail is unhuman core.

3621
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:00,920
And if I remember correctly,

3622
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:02,760
I think this guy was kind of hard to understand.

3623
02:18:02,760 --> 02:18:04,080
So, so pay attention.

3624
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:05,080
So you picked it.

3625
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:05,920
Great.

3626
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:06,920
Okay, yes, it's good.

3627
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:10,360
So let's just go with the term

3628
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:12,720
trying to come up with the definition of human core,

3629
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:14,120
you guys.

3630
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:15,200
It was like,

3631
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:18,720
I came to a conclusion about the most unhuman core thing

3632
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:19,880
I ever did.

3633
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:22,200
And I think it might help you guys

3634
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:24,520
because the second opposite of human core,

3635
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,280
monster core, demon core.

3636
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:27,120
Okay.

3637
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:27,960
I think I ever did.

3638
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:31,920
So, I went to the movies with this show,

3639
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:33,440
my grandma bought to me,

3640
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:35,200
it was a floral pattern.

3641
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:37,440
Got me looking pretty gay.

3642
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:41,920
So when I got inside the movie theater with my boys,

3643
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:44,960
I decided to bring up the scene from the Simpsons.

3644
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:46,600
I don't know if you ever saw that episode,

3645
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:48,560
the best fucking episode.

3646
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:51,280
And when they meet John Waters,

3647
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:53,080
they meet a gay man,

3648
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:56,800
and they get paranoid that Bach might be gay.

3649
02:18:56,800 --> 02:19:00,040
And Bach comes like walking,

3650
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:02,800
like a little faggot with fucking flowers.

3651
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:06,080
So I got up on my seat to imitate that scene.

3652
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:10,640
I accidentally kicked my fucking popcorn on the floor.

3653
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:14,080
And my friends started laughing at me.

3654
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:17,080
I fucking ate the fucking popcorn

3655
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:19,240
right out of the fucking floor,

3656
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:21,800
looking straight into the fucking night.

3657
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:25,320
So they don't fucking know me.

3658
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:27,400
I am a slave to society.

3659
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:28,960
I don't live in a society.

3660
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I am the guy from Seven,

3661
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,320
I am the Joker, and I am a demon.

3662
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:39,360
So that's his demon's core story.

3663
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:40,840
That's the most demon core.

3664
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:43,120
Demon core is eating your movie popcorn off

3665
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:44,560
while staring at your friends in the eyes.

3666
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:47,560
After you kick it off your lap,

3667
02:19:47,560 --> 02:19:49,240
because you're laughing so hard

3668
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:51,000
at the scene where Bart's cross-dressing

3669
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,360
in the John Waters episode of The Simpsons.

3670
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:54,200
Yes.

3671
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:56,200
That is a very demon core.

3672
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:57,520
Yeah, I understand.

3673
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,760
But he, some, he just,

3674
02:19:58,760 --> 02:19:59,760
I understand none of it.

3675
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:01,320
He's watching The Simpsons on his phone

3676
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:02,160
in the movie theater.

3677
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:03,080
He made me misunderstand,

3678
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:05,760
he didn't, I think his friends maliciously

3679
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:06,600
to make fun of him,

3680
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,680
and that's why he's defiantly eating the popcorn

3681
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:09,520
on the ground.

3682
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:10,360
Oh, you think so?

3683
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:11,840
That's why he said that you don't own me.

3684
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:12,680
That's why he's saying,

3685
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:13,760
he's looking in the,

3686
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:15,280
I mean, it's fucking honestly,

3687
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:16,520
like we're all trying to interpret,

3688
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:17,640
because I could,

3689
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,560
it was all of my mental ability

3690
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:20,720
to understand that guy.

3691
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:21,640
What's fucking accent?

3692
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:25,040
That was like a fast Andre the Giant.

3693
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:32,480
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

3694
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,880
All right, well, that mystery behind us.

3695
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:36,080
Something South American?

3696
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:36,920
I don't know.

3697
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:37,760
Yeah, I don't know.

3698
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:40,160
Just tell me where you're from on human core.

3699
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:41,320
Okay, next up,

3700
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:43,720
Stalin's ghost is calling in.

3701
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:45,800
All right, let's do it, go.

3702
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:49,440
Hello, this is Stalin's ghost.

3703
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:51,680
Yes, God, this is he,

3704
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:54,400
Stalin, recording from hell,

3705
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:57,720
where all the fucking people call me scum,

3706
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:59,480
go when they die.

3707
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:00,320
Okay, sure.

3708
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:03,840
I have message for Mr. Nate Biestum,

3709
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:07,320
just a little something that's been on my mind

3710
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:09,440
for quite a while.

3711
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:12,480
And I just needed to cool about it

3712
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:14,840
to set the record straight.

3713
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:19,840
And by straight, I mean, fuck you, Nate.

3714
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:24,400
Multiple fucking times on the podcast.

3715
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,920
Nate's best guy ever,

3716
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:29,040
has referred to highly civilized

3717
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,800
and ancient practice of programming

3718
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:34,960
as motherfucking coding.

3719
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:37,240
And I'm just wanting to say, Nate,

3720
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:41,520
my dude gave some fucking self-respect.

3721
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:45,760
I don't blame Tom or Manchi.

3722
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:48,060
They're just little busy babies

3723
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:51,840
that haven't gone to school to learn this sheet.

3724
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:55,800
Be advised, Nate Biestum,

3725
02:21:55,800 --> 02:22:00,080
you are on notice and we are watching

3726
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:02,920
you for further infractions.

3727
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:04,180
Slava Rodinia.

3728
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:08,540
Is coding like a disrespectful way

3729
02:22:08,540 --> 02:22:10,420
to refer to programming or something?

3730
02:22:10,420 --> 02:22:11,260
They're just different.

3731
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:12,580
Well, they're not the same thing, are they, aren't they?

3732
02:22:12,580 --> 02:22:16,180
Coding means creating codes from one language to another.

3733
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:18,340
Programming means to program a machine

3734
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:20,580
to perform a certain set of instructions.

3735
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:24,900
But you write code to program, right?

3736
02:22:24,900 --> 02:22:26,980
I have no idea.

3737
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:28,300
I have no clue.

3738
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:30,300
It sounds like some semantic bull.

3739
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,140
It does.

3740
02:22:31,140 --> 02:22:31,980
It definitely is.

3741
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:36,020
Is that guy's fake accent sound like Manmode's real accent?

3742
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:36,860
A little bit.

3743
02:22:36,860 --> 02:22:37,700
A little bit.

3744
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:38,540
Is he Russian?

3745
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:39,380
Is he Ukrainian, right?

3746
02:22:39,380 --> 02:22:41,420
He sounded a little bit Wisconsin.

3747
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:42,740
A little bit of Wisconsin in there.

3748
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:43,700
That might have been bleeding through.

3749
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:45,220
Oh, don't you know.

3750
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:47,100
Maybe Stalin escaped Russia

3751
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,500
and is living in Wisconsin this very day.

3752
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:52,220
That's my, well, he is actually Stalin's ghost

3753
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:54,060
and he did say was calling him from hell.

3754
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:56,580
So, okay, I guess nevermind on that one.

3755
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,420
Okay, moving on.

3756
02:22:57,420 --> 02:23:01,100
Quarren, Quarren, I guess is calling in.

3757
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:02,020
Okay, great.

3758
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:03,620
Go.

3759
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:05,740
All right, listen up you Judsters.

3760
02:23:05,740 --> 02:23:07,380
Watching Radcon 3 content

3761
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:10,860
was some of the best fucking shit I've ever seen on YouTube.

3762
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:11,700
Nice.

3763
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:15,060
Now, I won't say that I'll be able to provide

3764
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:18,500
every single cent that is needed to fund Radcon 4,

3765
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:19,940
where I will remind you,

3766
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:23,260
Muggie is now fully legal and fully fuckable.

3767
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:26,260
So, Muggie is totally possible.

3768
02:23:26,260 --> 02:23:27,100
Not gonna lie.

3769
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:28,860
But,

3770
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:29,700
Not gonna lie.

3771
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:34,140
But, if you were to have an upward limit

3772
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:38,420
of like imagination of how much

3773
02:23:38,420 --> 02:23:40,980
Radcon would require financially,

3774
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:42,300
what would that be?

3775
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:43,140
And,

3776
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:47,500
how much gay sex would be provided?

3777
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:48,340
Thanks, bye.

3778
02:23:48,340 --> 02:23:50,900
Is this guy like a billionaire investor or something?

3779
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:52,900
He's our angel investor.

3780
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:55,060
He's a hundred-air investor

3781
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:58,340
and has a few hundred dollars to flip around.

3782
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:02,380
Hey, Radcon 4 plans have been started.

3783
02:24:02,380 --> 02:24:03,220
They've been discussed.

3784
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:04,380
To be floated around.

3785
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:06,300
We're probably gonna try to do it.

3786
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:09,980
Probably, we'll probably just request this

3787
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:11,820
like around the same amount of money

3788
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:15,140
because that seems like reasonably what we can get.

3789
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:17,360
But like, you know, we'll promote it more.

3790
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:19,540
We'll probably keep our costs a little lower

3791
02:24:19,540 --> 02:24:21,700
because we literally run over budget

3792
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:22,900
on all of these so far.

3793
02:24:22,900 --> 02:24:25,140
So like, we're gonna try to make sure

3794
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:26,740
everybody actually gets paid this time.

3795
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:30,180
So, if you're asking what the absolute most

3796
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:32,140
that we would ask for is,

3797
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:33,140
it would be infinite.

3798
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:35,100
Like, we want as much money as possible

3799
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:36,540
to do the thing, obviously.

3800
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:38,940
I can't see us going above our last.

3801
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:40,660
We did $9,001.

3802
02:24:40,660 --> 02:24:43,540
That's gotta be, like, I can't possibly see us asking

3803
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:44,380
for even that much.

3804
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:45,420
Is it literally $9,001?

3805
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:47,140
I mean, that was the joke for T-Bat Resurrection.

3806
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:48,620
Right, but how much do we actually make?

3807
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:49,460
Like, should we even?

3808
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:50,460
Like, $9,185.

3809
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:52,140
It was in the 9,000.

3810
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:54,700
I remember the meme number, I think it was 9,185,

3811
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:55,540
I believe.

3812
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:57,420
I think we're probably,

3813
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:59,300
we did a pretty good job with three

3814
02:24:59,300 --> 02:25:01,300
of like not over-promising too much.

3815
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:03,940
Like, keeping it reasonably to stuff we knew we could do

3816
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:06,340
and then having a lot of time to do other shit.

3817
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:08,700
So like, we'll probably use a similar tactic next time

3818
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,940
of like, you know, there'll be a few core things

3819
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:13,140
that'll be, but like, you know,

3820
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:14,820
there are ways that we can make it

3821
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:18,020
so it might be more worthwhile to pay more

3822
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:21,140
or that just, you know,

3823
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:24,540
yeah, again though, I think the focus this time

3824
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:26,340
is gonna be on like, keeping the cost lower

3825
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:28,180
and making sure everybody gets paid.

3826
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:29,660
And I think like, yeah,

3827
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:31,020
getting paid is part of the equation,

3828
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:32,300
but like, one of the things was like,

3829
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:34,140
for example, with T-Bat Resurrection,

3830
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:36,900
like with all the, the shipping and everything

3831
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:39,900
ate up so much more money than we thought it was going to,

3832
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:43,380
that like, I think Ben and I, I think we made like,

3833
02:25:43,380 --> 02:25:45,900
I made $0, I definitely lost money.

3834
02:25:45,900 --> 02:25:50,780
I think we made like $1 for doing all the T-Bat Resurrection.

3835
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:52,580
Because of the fact that I got a hotel

3836
02:25:52,580 --> 02:25:54,580
so that May could come with me to Boston,

3837
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:57,020
it was like a huge deficit for me.

3838
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:58,140
Yeah, it's understandable.

3839
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:00,340
I mean, oh, it's almost like we provided a place

3840
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:01,900
to stay for you and you chose not to use it,

3841
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:02,740
but yeah, fair enough.

3842
02:26:02,740 --> 02:26:04,700
You know, you provided a place for me to stay

3843
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:06,220
and I don't travel alone.

3844
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:09,500
That's true, that's true.

3845
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:10,620
All right, well, whatever.

3846
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:12,500
There you go, people, there's some information.

3847
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:15,020
We'll get back to you, we'll let you know what's going on.

3848
02:26:15,020 --> 02:26:18,900
Radcon 4, for me, it's gonna be all,

3849
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:20,700
it's gonna be all lectures.

3850
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:23,740
It's just gonna, that's my goal for Radcon 4

3851
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:27,380
is crank out like at least two, at least two new lectures,

3852
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:28,460
maybe more.

3853
02:26:28,460 --> 02:26:31,460
Can you tell us, like, let's get people hype right away

3854
02:26:31,460 --> 02:26:32,740
and what kind of lectures you got in mind,

3855
02:26:32,740 --> 02:26:33,580
if there's any.

3856
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:34,420
If you want to.

3857
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:38,980
Well, I know for sure I will do a Sonichu 102.

3858
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:40,940
Excellent, finally a 102 course.

3859
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:45,060
I will definitely do a follow up to the Christian lecture.

3860
02:26:46,460 --> 02:26:49,980
I had another idea to do one about the Digi Clips.

3861
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:52,580
Right, yeah, John, I really want that one.

3862
02:26:52,580 --> 02:26:56,700
Is that the cult of the real digital believers?

3863
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:57,540
It sounds great.

3864
02:26:57,540 --> 02:26:59,900
Like, I have scrubbed the old sources

3865
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:03,700
and like all the archives of the forums have been deleted

3866
02:27:03,700 --> 02:27:06,740
so it would be, it would, it would probably be short.

3867
02:27:06,740 --> 02:27:07,580
Ladies and gentlemen, if you.

3868
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:09,340
There's just not that much out there.

3869
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:12,700
If I had a chance, our listeners have any info on that

3870
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:15,140
that would be of use, please let us know in the comments.

3871
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:15,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3872
02:27:15,980 --> 02:27:17,340
That would actually be, you know, very helpful.

3873
02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:20,260
Anyone's got resources about like, yeah,

3874
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:22,340
the Digi Clips and the real digital believer

3875
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:23,420
or the real Digimon believers.

3876
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:24,260
Ben was in there deep.

3877
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:26,100
It's just that all the forums like got cleared

3878
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:26,940
or something right.

3879
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,540
When it was being raided by something awful,

3880
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:31,500
I was in there like watching the chaos

3881
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:33,380
and now like the archives don't exist.

3882
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:34,220
That's fucked up.

3883
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,060
Jesse.

3884
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:37,020
Have you tried like the way back machine or anything?

3885
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:40,420
I have, yes, I had no, very little luck with that.

3886
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:42,860
Jesse, if you were to come to Radcon 4,

3887
02:27:43,860 --> 02:27:48,460
I want, I really want an insane clown posse lecture.

3888
02:27:48,460 --> 02:27:49,300
Yeah.

3889
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:50,740
That's the one that I probably would do

3890
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:52,580
that I've been thinking about.

3891
02:27:52,580 --> 02:27:54,620
I don't know why I haven't done a lecture yet.

3892
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:55,540
Cause, well, I know why.

3893
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:58,140
It's cause I detest planning for anything

3894
02:27:58,140 --> 02:28:00,660
and I like to show up on the, at the last minute,

3895
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:02,060
two days into it and be like,

3896
02:28:02,060 --> 02:28:03,340
I don't know what the fuck I'm here

3897
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:05,260
and just go with whatever happens.

3898
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:07,100
And I mean, like the idea of like planning

3899
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:09,660
and getting a whiteboard and drawing stuff on.

3900
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:10,500
I was like, ah.

3901
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:11,340
Oh, it's fucking easy.

3902
02:28:11,820 --> 02:28:14,380
We just bullshitted them as we went along.

3903
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:15,220
I don't know about you guys.

3904
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:18,620
I spent like two whole days before my like,

3905
02:28:18,620 --> 02:28:20,540
like planning it out and making notes

3906
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:22,740
and like arranging things on like a whiteboard

3907
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:24,900
and like, like putting thumbtacks and things

3908
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:25,740
and putting red stuff.

3909
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:28,860
What do I look like to use a guy who's not lazy?

3910
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:31,500
For the Kingdom Hearts one,

3911
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:33,620
I literally did zero preparation.

3912
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:34,980
I'll be honest, like I've,

3913
02:28:34,980 --> 02:28:38,060
I had wanted to do a co-heating Cambria one

3914
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:38,940
and I still might,

3915
02:28:38,940 --> 02:28:40,860
but like there is a lot of research

3916
02:28:40,860 --> 02:28:42,700
I would have to do in terms of just like reading

3917
02:28:42,700 --> 02:28:44,660
all the comics and like tie-in novels

3918
02:28:44,660 --> 02:28:48,340
and all that bullshit, which is a little gay.

3919
02:28:48,340 --> 02:28:50,180
And also it occurred to me that like,

3920
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:52,580
it'll be a weird lecture to give to a bunch of people

3921
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:54,460
who don't really know the music.

3922
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:58,260
Cause like a big part of the intrigue as a fan is like,

3923
02:28:58,260 --> 02:29:01,100
oh wow, that song is about this.

3924
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:02,700
That's crazy.

3925
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:06,220
But the story is not the last one to talk about.

3926
02:29:06,220 --> 02:29:08,220
I don't know if I said this on a podcast before,

3927
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:10,860
but the, the, the law, okay.

3928
02:29:10,860 --> 02:29:11,980
After the time skip

3929
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:14,540
and after like Chris's transition and everything,

3930
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:16,620
there comes a point in Sonichu

3931
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:19,980
where the lore becomes completely insane.

3932
02:29:19,980 --> 02:29:21,500
And it is, it goes,

3933
02:29:21,500 --> 02:29:23,740
like the comic basically just completely breaks down

3934
02:29:23,740 --> 02:29:27,300
and there's so much shit that is like canonically occurring

3935
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:30,220
that it just has to happen in like text dump and montage,

3936
02:29:30,220 --> 02:29:31,060
but it's in there.

3937
02:29:31,060 --> 02:29:32,380
It's canon.

3938
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,220
Fascinating.

3939
02:29:33,220 --> 02:29:36,020
And it, it's, it's, and it just all comes in at once.

3940
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:37,940
And it just completely muddies the waters

3941
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:39,420
of what's, what the deal is.

3942
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:41,300
And it, it needs, it needs a lecture.

3943
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:42,140
Well, fantastic.

3944
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:42,980
That's great.

3945
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:43,820
That's great.

3946
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:46,100
Is he still like, oh, never mind, never mind.

3947
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:47,460
I could do like an ICP one.

3948
02:29:47,460 --> 02:29:48,300
Is he still making comics?

3949
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:49,140
Yes.

3950
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:49,980
Slowly.

3951
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:51,580
I could do an Incinclon Posse one.

3952
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:52,540
And I could also,

3953
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:55,180
I could definitely feasibly do like a wrestling one.

3954
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:58,180
I just don't know like the angle I would approach that from

3955
02:29:58,180 --> 02:29:59,140
to really encompass like-

3956
02:29:59,140 --> 02:29:59,980
That's a huge topic.

3957
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:00,940
Yeah.

3958
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:01,940
Like what's his face?

3959
02:30:01,940 --> 02:30:03,900
Max Landis with just his, uh, what's that?

3960
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:04,740
Well, who's the one?

3961
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:05,580
Yeah, it's all, yeah.

3962
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:06,620
It's all just about triple H.

3963
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:09,580
That's not wrestling.

3964
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:10,420
You know what?

3965
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:12,260
It would be the most entertaining to me.

3966
02:30:12,260 --> 02:30:14,420
Jesse would just be like,

3967
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:18,100
like the whole history in as brief as possible.

3968
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:19,140
Of wrestling?

3969
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:20,100
Like of the company?

3970
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:23,460
No, of just all, like anything currently relevant,

3971
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:26,940
you know, like any, anything that has affected the way things

3972
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:30,180
are now, like getting you caught up to speed kind of like-

3973
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:32,220
Like the current wrestling landscape?

3974
02:30:32,220 --> 02:30:35,940
Like if you wanted to get into wrestling and just tune in

3975
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:37,260
to- How to get into wrestling?

3976
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:38,140
That actually would be pretty useful.

3977
02:30:38,140 --> 02:30:39,100
Yeah, that would work.

3978
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:39,940
Yeah.

3979
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:41,180
Cause I'd kind of like something like that.

3980
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:43,380
So I could be up on shit.

3981
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:47,660
Or I could just do an entire lecture all about the repo man.

3982
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:49,860
That sounds great.

3983
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:51,460
The greatest wrestler of all time.

3984
02:30:51,460 --> 02:30:55,140
He was a guy with like a hamburger mask and a rope

3985
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:57,700
and he would go around and he would repossess people's shit.

3986
02:30:57,700 --> 02:30:59,300
He'd repossess your car.

3987
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:02,140
And the only way to stop him from repossessing your stuff

3988
02:31:02,140 --> 02:31:03,940
is to beat him in a wrestling match.

3989
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:05,460
You-

3990
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,940
He's a real guy.

3991
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:09,380
Just with these one, this one mention,

3992
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:14,380
I think you've created a demand, a searing massive demand.

3993
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:17,220
And at very least at me, if no one else,

3994
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:20,180
I want to know the full tale of the repo man now.

3995
02:31:20,180 --> 02:31:21,540
I mean, that's pretty much it.

3996
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:23,340
That's the full tale of a red bear.

3997
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:24,780
Oh, that was a great lecture.

3998
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:25,620
Thanks.

3999
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:26,460
Hey, you know what?

4000
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:28,140
Also, here's an idea.

4001
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:31,940
A lot of us know a lot of things that we've talked about

4002
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:33,700
and we don't remember what those things are.

4003
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:35,580
So if anybody else remembers something

4004
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:37,340
that you think we should do a lecture on

4005
02:31:37,340 --> 02:31:39,020
because you think we could, let me know.

4006
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:39,860
That's fair.

4007
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:40,700
Yeah, why not?

4008
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:41,540
Yeah, what do you want?

4009
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:42,980
What do you want me to do a lecture on?

4010
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:43,820
I'm open to suggestions.

4011
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:45,220
I've said it before, I'll say it again.

4012
02:31:45,220 --> 02:31:47,980
I do plan on doing anamorphs for the next lecture.

4013
02:31:47,980 --> 02:31:48,820
Yes, indeed.

4014
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:50,140
Oh, that's a great idea.

4015
02:31:50,140 --> 02:31:50,980
Dude, that's great.

4016
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:53,500
I'm the target audience for that.

4017
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:54,340
I'm ready.

4018
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:56,140
It's going to be good.

4019
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:57,100
I'm going to throw out a number though.

4020
02:31:57,100 --> 02:31:58,500
Just to answer the question at the beginning,

4021
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:00,380
like how much, here's my guess.

4022
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:04,100
I bet if we are able to raise $5,000

4023
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:05,940
as some kind of minimum, I'm sure

4024
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:08,540
that's like a good target for us to start with.

4025
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:09,900
But okay, whatever.

4026
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:10,740
That's totally made up.

4027
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:11,820
We'll see if that pans out.

4028
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:15,340
I bet we could get more.

4029
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:16,180
Like I bet we could.

4030
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:17,020
Oh, I bet we could.

4031
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:18,860
That was the final number that was bigger than us.

4032
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:19,700
I'm just saying.

4033
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:21,780
Like the goal of the Kickstarter

4034
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:25,140
should ultimately be higher than the last one was

4035
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:27,060
because the last one had stretch goals

4036
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:28,540
that went all the way to 9,000.

4037
02:32:28,540 --> 02:32:31,780
But the initial goal should be higher

4038
02:32:31,780 --> 02:32:33,020
and then should have stretch goals

4039
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:35,060
that go higher than that.

4040
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:38,340
But I would like us to make more money for the next one,

4041
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:40,420
not because I think we should raise the cost of it,

4042
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:43,500
but just because again, we have gone over budget every time.

4043
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:48,660
I still have all the fucking uncreated blue rays

4044
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:50,260
sitting in a box in my closet

4045
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:53,420
that I can't afford to do it.

4046
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:54,620
I don't really, yeah.

4047
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:56,780
Wait, Redcomb blue rays?

4048
02:32:56,780 --> 02:32:58,500
Redcomb two blue rays,

4049
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:01,860
the Pleven the Weave blue rays that me and Jesse signed.

4050
02:33:01,860 --> 02:33:04,180
We signed like a hundred cases

4051
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:05,860
and I have a hundred cases

4052
02:33:05,860 --> 02:33:09,420
and a hundred fucking discs blank sitting in my closet.

4053
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:12,340
Okay, the Pleven the Weave,

4054
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:14,980
that wasn't a Radcon Kickstarter.

4055
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:16,580
I mean, Pleven the Weave wasn't at all.

4056
02:33:16,580 --> 02:33:17,420
It was.

4057
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:18,540
I mean, it created,

4058
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:20,060
Redcomb two was paid for

4059
02:33:20,060 --> 02:33:21,900
by the Pleven the Weave Kickstarter,

4060
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:25,460
but it was me and it was really my Kickstarter

4061
02:33:25,460 --> 02:33:28,220
that I had broke Jesse into.

4062
02:33:28,220 --> 02:33:29,060
Yeah.

4063
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:29,900
Was it really paid for?

4064
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:31,380
Did we get really immersed in anything?

4065
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:33,780
Well, everybody's flight was paid for by it.

4066
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:35,220
Yeah, but there was a stretch goal for that.

4067
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:38,220
Every stretch goal of the Kickstarter was somebody's flight.

4068
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:42,580
Oh, because of the guests' appearances.

4069
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:43,620
That's right, that's right.

4070
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:46,420
The idea of it was supposed to be that,

4071
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:48,940
because when we did the first Radcon,

4072
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:52,420
we were all like, oh, we could do this every year

4073
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:54,380
like we were going to Bronycon,

4074
02:33:54,380 --> 02:33:57,940
or because we could all afford to meet up once a year.

4075
02:33:57,940 --> 02:34:00,060
We were like, let's meet up more often.

4076
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:02,340
Let's try to do a Kickstarter-backed one

4077
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:04,100
so that we can meet up sooner.

4078
02:34:04,100 --> 02:34:06,740
And so it was just a few months later

4079
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:09,940
and just the Kickstarter was a huge success.

4080
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:11,460
So we were like, oh yeah, let's fucking do it.

4081
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:14,460
And then once there was a Kickstarter involved,

4082
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:17,260
there were backer rewards and ways to go over budget

4083
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:21,260
and suddenly it was a different kind of animal, you know?

4084
02:34:21,260 --> 02:34:23,380
You gotta get those Blu-rays out, dude.

4085
02:34:23,380 --> 02:34:25,500
I can't afford it, he's still waiting for his.

4086
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:27,460
I cannot afford to, but first of all.

4087
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:28,780
What do you need to afford it?

4088
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:30,300
Like what's stopping you?

4089
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:32,300
Is it the shipping costs?

4090
02:34:32,300 --> 02:34:34,780
Shipping costs, and I, okay.

4091
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:37,380
I have to get art made, I have to actually print.

4092
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:39,620
I do not have a Blu-ray burner, so.

4093
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:42,140
That's not probably not too expensive anymore.

4094
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:43,980
Probably.

4095
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:45,820
I mean, at this point, you might as well wait

4096
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:47,740
because you originally,

4097
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:49,500
your original thing on the Kickstarter

4098
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:51,380
was to do two more seasons of it.

4099
02:34:51,380 --> 02:34:52,220
Two seasons, right.

4100
02:34:52,220 --> 02:34:53,740
And we still have it made the second season.

4101
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:54,580
We did season two.

4102
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:55,420
I think that's not really gonna happen though.

4103
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:56,260
I mean, let's be real here.

4104
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:58,500
It could, I mean, me and Jesse made four episodes

4105
02:34:58,500 --> 02:34:59,700
of a season two.

4106
02:34:59,700 --> 02:35:00,660
I think that they are being cost.

4107
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:04,020
Okay, we made season two and it took forever,

4108
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:06,180
but I was really happy with how it turned out.

4109
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:08,060
And I thought like, at the time I thought like,

4110
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:08,980
should there be more?

4111
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:11,900
I don't know, this seems like a good way to end it and stuff.

4112
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:16,900
But Digi came over to my house in like the summer of 2017.

4113
02:35:17,540 --> 02:35:21,560
And we recorded four episodes in the furnace room.

4114
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:24,500
Which I don't know, they just,

4115
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:27,180
without Vic being there to film it,

4116
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:28,820
I thought it looked shitty.

4117
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:29,900
It looked really bad.

4118
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:34,020
It didn't look, yeah, on par with like what we had.

4119
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:36,840
I didn't wanna go back in terms of quality.

4120
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:39,780
So I don't think the show can really be done without Vic.

4121
02:35:40,620 --> 02:35:42,820
If we do a season three,

4122
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:45,720
I mean, I've sort of like been taking notes

4123
02:35:45,720 --> 02:35:49,400
and like writing down episode ideas every once in a while.

4124
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:51,160
So I've got about like,

4125
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:53,160
10 or so ideas for episodes of it.

4126
02:35:53,160 --> 02:35:54,000
So we could do-

4127
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,880
Well, you know we should have just another season.

4128
02:35:55,880 --> 02:35:58,320
And instead of like,

4129
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:01,040
like I don't know what to do about those four that we filmed.

4130
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:04,440
And maybe I could just release those four episodes

4131
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:05,680
as season three.

4132
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:07,480
And season three can be crappy and short,

4133
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:09,400
like my little pony season three.

4134
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:13,500
And then we can do season four the next time or whatever.

4135
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:16,720
We should have a Radcon four stretch goal.

4136
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:19,360
Digi actually releases the DVD.

4137
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:21,720
If we wanted to do that, I could.

4138
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:23,320
But like, yeah, I mean,

4139
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:25,400
this is what happens with a lot of Kickstarter's

4140
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:29,240
is that they are like, as soon as you start,

4141
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:30,080
the number one thing-

4142
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:31,360
Not Radcon three, baby.

4143
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:32,200
We did it.

4144
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:33,320
Yeah, well, you win, ladies and gentlemen.

4145
02:36:33,320 --> 02:36:35,240
I mean, we did go over budget for Radcon three.

4146
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:36,080
Like the number one-

4147
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:37,120
I mean, we lost money,

4148
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:38,720
but that means we got the moral victory.

4149
02:36:38,720 --> 02:36:39,560
And I'm okay with that.

4150
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:40,720
Yeah, well, that's right.

4151
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:41,560
That's right.

4152
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:43,320
The biggest thing that goes wrong with Kickstarter's

4153
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:46,680
is that every time you add in a new thing,

4154
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:49,440
it increases the cost of everything else in kind.

4155
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:54,440
So it's like, I stretch goals, fly a person out.

4156
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:55,640
Okay.

4157
02:36:55,640 --> 02:36:57,960
Well, that's like another trip to the airport.

4158
02:36:57,960 --> 02:37:00,400
Another person who has to be,

4159
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:03,160
basically taken care of for the time they're there,

4160
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:05,640
like drive around, make sure they get their food.

4161
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:08,080
Like they have to now spend money

4162
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:09,680
more than they would living at home

4163
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:11,080
because they're eating out all the time

4164
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:12,520
with their friends and like all this shit.

4165
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:15,360
Like all that cost doesn't get factored in

4166
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:17,040
when we make the Kickstarter goals.

4167
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:18,760
Crowdfunding is bad.

4168
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:19,600
I don't believe it.

4169
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:20,440
No, you just got to know,

4170
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:21,760
you just got to plan it out.

4171
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:24,120
Well, Radcon three really helped us.

4172
02:37:24,120 --> 02:37:28,600
My Vapors Kickstarter was a huge success

4173
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:29,920
and didn't go over budget.

4174
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:32,720
And all my stretch goals were delivered upon

4175
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:34,240
and Vapors two will be the same thing.

4176
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:35,080
For the record.

4177
02:37:35,080 --> 02:37:36,480
It will be a triumph.

4178
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:37,320
For the record.

4179
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:39,240
Absolutely nothing is my fault

4180
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:42,040
in terms of the DVDs and the plebe and the weave.

4181
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:44,160
I literally woke up one day

4182
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:46,120
and saw my name on a Kickstarter

4183
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:47,280
that I had no idea about

4184
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:50,320
that already had like $8,000 attached to it.

4185
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:52,600
And I'm just like, well, I guess I'm doing this now.

4186
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:54,240
It pretty much went like I said,

4187
02:37:54,240 --> 02:37:55,880
hey, Jesse, we should do a Kickstarter

4188
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:56,960
for plebe and the weave season two.

4189
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:57,920
And he was like, sure.

4190
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:59,800
And then I posted it immediately.

4191
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:01,000
Like I just did that.

4192
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,040
And then, yeah.

4193
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:05,200
But no, I mean, the circumstances around it were crazy.

4194
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:07,640
Like it's not, I don't feel bad at all.

4195
02:38:07,640 --> 02:38:10,240
Like I don't give a shit if anybody thinks

4196
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:12,560
that that was like a failure because it was.

4197
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:14,440
I don't consider it a failure just because

4198
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:16,760
I think the episodes turned out really good.

4199
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:18,280
Yes, people enjoyed it.

4200
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:19,760
It came out good.

4201
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:22,840
I am still holding on to all these fucking Blu-rays.

4202
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:25,360
So it's not as though it is,

4203
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:26,680
it's not as though I give it up on.

4204
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:28,240
We're gonna have green-rays by the time you're done with these.

4205
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:29,120
I don't really give a shit.

4206
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:31,440
I mean, like, you know, whatever.

4207
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:33,200
Time is completely relative.

4208
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:34,320
You know, one time I own,

4209
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:35,600
I've told this story before,

4210
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:38,280
but one time my friend bought me $60 worth of art books

4211
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:40,200
and I told him I'll pay you back when I get a job.

4212
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:41,760
It took me 60 years to get a job.

4213
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:43,880
But I paid him back on my first paycheck.

4214
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:46,000
I will get the fucking Blu-rays out, you know?

4215
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,560
Okay, there you go, fair enough.

4216
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:51,080
You know, the thing about it is

4217
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:55,600
we just need to set the amount that we make

4218
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:57,760
just a lot higher than the cost

4219
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:00,080
of what it sounds like it should cost, you know?

4220
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:02,720
And of course, we feel a desire to not do that.

4221
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:04,000
So it's easier to meet the goal,

4222
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,520
but that's a negative if we end up just missing money.

4223
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:07,800
I would say, you know,

4224
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:11,400
set the goal higher than the amount we need

4225
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:14,080
and make sure people are actually getting paid to do it.

4226
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:15,280
That's another thing with Radcon 3.

4227
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:17,200
Like, we covered the cost of it,

4228
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:19,280
but that doesn't include actually paying anybody,

4229
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:22,200
which really becomes a problem when the editing starts

4230
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:23,600
and all of us have to get,

4231
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:25,800
you know, we have to rush back to our own patreons

4232
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:28,920
to make more money, you know, like nobody has time

4233
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:30,560
to edit the shit that we did at Radcon.

4234
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:33,480
So like, there needs to be editing fees,

4235
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,600
actual payment for doing it.

4236
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:37,040
And then like, yeah,

4237
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:40,000
just factoring in additional costs to just have around,

4238
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,320
like maybe like a bubble.

4239
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:43,240
I feel like a hundred dollar bubble

4240
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:44,880
that just goes to whatever it's needed for.

4241
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:47,240
And then once everything's complete,

4242
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:48,640
that money would just be dispersed

4243
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:50,280
to everybody equally or something.

4244
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:51,120
But like-

4245
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:51,960
I totally agree.

4246
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:53,440
And I just think that, yeah,

4247
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:54,520
questions are super important.

4248
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:55,760
There's things we don't predict.

4249
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:57,680
But just like after Radcon,

4250
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:00,280
like not even just the way that we assessed costs

4251
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:02,080
with Radcon 3, which was too little

4252
02:40:02,080 --> 02:40:04,800
and we'll like know somewhat better next time,

4253
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:05,640
but like even beyond that-

4254
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:06,480
And we weren't even that off.

4255
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:07,320
It was only like, what?

4256
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:08,240
How much did we go?

4257
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:09,080
Well, I mean, dude,

4258
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:10,800
the biggest thing we were off about was shipping costs.

4259
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,200
Shipping costs were so much more.

4260
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:13,200
But that right there,

4261
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:15,240
but the thing is we have the numbers

4262
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:18,240
of exactly what it costs for Tom to ship those out.

4263
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:19,560
Not that it would necessarily be him again,

4264
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:20,400
but like we,

4265
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:22,480
that is a super valuable piece of data.

4266
02:40:22,480 --> 02:40:23,320
So we know exactly,

4267
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:25,120
like we can way more accurately determine that.

4268
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:25,960
Even better now,

4269
02:40:25,960 --> 02:40:28,800
did you just find a way to get ship cheaper from his-

4270
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:29,760
Yes.

4271
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:33,360
Stamps.com is a great way to ship things cheap.

4272
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:34,200
We will definitely be-

4273
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:35,040
Wait, what?

4274
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,240
Stamps.com.

4275
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,320
Oh yeah, right, right.

4276
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:38,840
Okay, well, yeah, that's great.

4277
02:40:38,840 --> 02:40:40,880
So, you know, I think that we actually said

4278
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:42,720
5,800 was the minimum.

4279
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,760
So it's probably gonna be more than that, people,

4280
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,960
for the next one.

4281
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:47,200
So, oh, oh, I was just gonna say.

4282
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:48,040
I think we can do it.

4283
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:49,680
I mean, people loved Radcon 3.

4284
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:53,360
We got that funded after, you know, post-Radcon 2.

4285
02:40:53,360 --> 02:40:54,640
Radcon 3 still got funded.

4286
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:56,080
Radcon 3 went well.

4287
02:40:56,080 --> 02:40:57,360
People love the results.

4288
02:40:57,360 --> 02:40:58,520
I don't know if somebody,

4289
02:40:58,520 --> 02:40:59,560
I don't know if there's gonna be people saying,

4290
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:01,840
hey, you know, I wanna pay for Radcon 3,

4291
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:04,040
but they're stealing your dad's still as an out.

4292
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:05,680
So, you know, I don't know-

4293
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:07,000
Was that a promise though?

4294
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,680
No, it wasn't a promise, but...

4295
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,120
I mean, it was promised by me to people

4296
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:14,040
that we had done it and it would come out, you know.

4297
02:41:14,040 --> 02:41:15,160
That's fair.

4298
02:41:15,160 --> 02:41:17,120
You know, I will say the last thing on this

4299
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:19,800
is just that, like, I don't like doing things

4300
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:21,880
where I don't make a profit doing them.

4301
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:23,480
I just don't like doing them.

4302
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:26,240
So I really want to make sure that future Radcons

4303
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:28,640
are not just a financial black hole,

4304
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:29,760
because I'm trying to, you know,

4305
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:31,440
trying to earn while doing things like this,

4306
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:33,160
not just lose, just because they're fun.

4307
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:34,640
You know, I mean, I wanna do it,

4308
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:37,480
because, you know, I do think, like that guy said,

4309
02:41:37,480 --> 02:41:39,520
a lot of the best content we've done comes out of it,

4310
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,280
just because it's such a unique experience

4311
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:45,400
that, like, you know, when else would you get anything like it?

4312
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:46,240
You know?

4313
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,600
Yeah.

4314
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:50,080
What I like about living in Boston is that now I'm with,

4315
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:53,480
like, Ben and we, like, hang out, like, you know, for fun.

4316
02:41:53,480 --> 02:41:54,720
Like, we're friends or something.

4317
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:56,240
I don't like that. I don't like that.

4318
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:57,320
It's weird, right?

4319
02:41:57,320 --> 02:41:59,200
It's really cool, because what I really-

4320
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:00,040
It's quirky.

4321
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:02,080
What I like about Radcon is a lot of, like,

4322
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:04,360
just, like, being around people who are also creative

4323
02:42:04,360 --> 02:42:06,480
and I also respect and I think are, like, interesting

4324
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:10,160
and I like to talk to, and just outside of even just

4325
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:12,440
the pure, like, carnal, mortal pleasure

4326
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:14,160
being with your friends, which is great.

4327
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:16,400
Also, just, like, being with other creatives

4328
02:42:16,400 --> 02:42:18,600
and, like, coming up with ideas and projects together

4329
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:20,160
is, like, really interesting and valuable,

4330
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:21,000
and I love doing that.

4331
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,840
What's cool about Radcon is that we're all there to make-

4332
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,800
Yes. Agreed.

4333
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:26,000
Yes. Very true.

4334
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,880
We're all on the same page about what we're doing there.

4335
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:30,760
It's basically just, like, lightning ideas all the time.

4336
02:42:30,760 --> 02:42:32,880
It's just, like, everybody sitting around going, like,

4337
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:36,840
okay, well, we did that thing, what do we do now?

4338
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:38,720
You know, like, it could be literally, like,

4339
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:41,520
oh, Nate and Hippo are doing a podcast in that room,

4340
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:44,160
so fuck them, what can we do that is, like,

4341
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:47,600
that not only we can do without them,

4342
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:50,440
but also that is funny specifically because

4343
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:53,400
they are in that room doing that while we do this, you know?

4344
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:55,720
When I think about just the idea of Radcon,

4345
02:42:55,720 --> 02:42:57,360
my instinct is, like, oh, a bunch of people

4346
02:42:57,360 --> 02:42:59,560
get together and make shit, sounds gay as shit,

4347
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:01,400
except that every time we do it,

4348
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:03,960
it's just produces such actually good things

4349
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:05,960
that, like, I'm constantly kind of astounded,

4350
02:43:05,960 --> 02:43:08,320
like, wow, that's actually really funny and good.

4351
02:43:08,320 --> 02:43:11,880
I still have yet to post the soon-to-be,

4352
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:16,240
someday-to-be award-winning sitcom, The Man and the Boy.

4353
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:17,480
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

4354
02:43:17,480 --> 02:43:18,480
The Man and the Boy.

4355
02:43:18,480 --> 02:43:20,880
How's The Man and the Boy not alive yet?

4356
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:23,280
Is that, like, the only Munchy Jesse content, like?

4357
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:24,440
I think it is.

4358
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:25,400
Probably. Yeah.

4359
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:30,560
Me and Munchy at Radcon 3, we...

4360
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:31,640
Very impromptu.

4361
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:36,160
We conceived, filmed, improvised, and created

4362
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:39,360
an entire sitcom called The Man and the Boy,

4363
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:40,840
and there's multiple episodes,

4364
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:44,240
and it's probably a nightmare, but it's great.

4365
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:47,520
Jesse plays the titular man, and I play the titular boy,

4366
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,040
and then the adventures we get up to

4367
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:52,920
are unparalleled in scope and execution.

4368
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:53,840
We have to get that out

4369
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:55,240
because it's never gonna happen again.

4370
02:43:55,240 --> 02:43:56,080
If you do another season,

4371
02:43:56,080 --> 02:43:57,640
it's just gonna be The Man and the Man.

4372
02:43:57,720 --> 02:43:58,720
Oh, my God.

4373
02:43:58,720 --> 02:44:00,720
Oh, my God.

4374
02:44:00,720 --> 02:44:04,880
And if Munchy doesn't release the Stealing Your Dads episodes,

4375
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:07,440
then it won't be easy anymore.

4376
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:09,760
It'll be hard to steal Dads.

4377
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:12,320
It will always be easy.

4378
02:44:12,320 --> 02:44:14,080
I don't know. It seems pretty difficult right now.

4379
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:15,760
Yeah, it seems like it's been a...

4380
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,960
It seems like a big labor.

4381
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:18,120
It's hard for me to steal a Dad

4382
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:20,640
if I can't watch the episode.

4383
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:22,000
Okay, all right.

4384
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:22,840
Enough of this, people.

4385
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:26,320
Let's move on. We've got two quick last ones.

4386
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:29,800
Okay, first of all, we've got Mozilla Fennekin, human core.

4387
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:30,800
And this was the guy.

4388
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:32,720
This Mozilla was the one who asked us,

4389
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:35,080
yes, last time, what is human core?

4390
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:35,920
So let's hear.

4391
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:37,760
So now we're drilling this closure.

4392
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:40,600
I just want to say that just something about human core,

4393
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:42,760
just it rubbed me the wrong way.

4394
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:44,280
And like, just phonetically,

4395
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:45,120
just like there's just something

4396
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:45,960
I don't like about this community.

4397
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:47,360
I thought you were the one who like invented it.

4398
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:49,000
I thought you were the human core.

4399
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:49,840
I invented it.

4400
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:51,160
Yeah, we had this discussion last time.

4401
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:53,600
I remember me inventing it too,

4402
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:55,400
though I guess I will defer to Ben

4403
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:59,880
Okay, so if anyone remembers the invention of human core.

4404
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:00,720
Let us know.

4405
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:02,560
Who invented human core?

4406
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:06,520
I think it was like either one of us invented it,

4407
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:08,680
the other person ran with it, just either or.

4408
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:12,040
I think it was definitely like developed over time.

4409
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:13,480
Okay, well, let's hear.

4410
02:45:13,480 --> 02:45:16,520
However, I want you all to know,

4411
02:45:16,520 --> 02:45:18,680
I want you all to know that you can buy

4412
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:21,480
human core shirts at teespring.com

4413
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:23,480
slash stores slash Ben Dash thing.

4414
02:45:23,480 --> 02:45:24,640
Oh my God, that's all right.

4415
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:26,320
I'm selling them.

4416
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:27,640
I'm selling, you're buying them.

4417
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:29,800
And instead of giving Ben $5 on Teespring,

4418
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:31,840
just buy a shirt from me directly

4419
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:34,320
where I'll get all the proceeds.

4420
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:37,400
I get $10 per shirt, thank you very much.

4421
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:38,240
9.50.

4422
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:39,800
I've been told that the shirts from Teespring

4423
02:45:39,800 --> 02:45:41,880
smell bad and don't fit well.

4424
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:43,760
I've got some.

4425
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:44,600
Not my experience.

4426
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:45,640
They don't fit well.

4427
02:45:45,640 --> 02:45:46,800
I think they're fine.

4428
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:49,640
Oh, my, okay, I don't, all right.

4429
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:53,840
If you guys say so, I get the classic V-neck

4430
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:55,360
and they all fit great.

4431
02:45:55,360 --> 02:45:58,840
And like my Teespring shirts are like my favorite shirts

4432
02:45:58,840 --> 02:45:59,680
that I own.

4433
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:03,160
Well, if you'd like there to say, buy Ben's shirts.

4434
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:04,000
Okay, all right.

4435
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,880
Let's go, patron saint of human core,

4436
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:08,800
a paragon of wisdom in the human core sphere.

4437
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:11,600
Mozilla Fennekin, educate us, go.

4438
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:19,040
Last time I asked you what the most human core thing ever is.

4439
02:46:19,560 --> 02:46:21,840
It's something that all humans do

4440
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:24,360
and nothing else does it.

4441
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:25,880
It's only a human thing.

4442
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:26,840
Shitting.

4443
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:30,000
Your responses were very thoughtful and very interesting.

4444
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,680
I appreciate that you participated in this.

4445
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:36,040
And so you're wrong.

4446
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:41,040
The most human core thing ever is having a bathroom.

4447
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:47,200
Okay, hear me out, hear me out.

4448
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:48,520
Get out of here.

4449
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:51,080
I already said shitting, I was right.

4450
02:46:51,080 --> 02:46:54,880
Every animal or whatever, it's like,

4451
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:57,160
they just kind of shit wherever.

4452
02:46:58,520 --> 02:46:59,360
This is so bad.

4453
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:00,360
That's not even true.

4454
02:47:00,360 --> 02:47:03,480
We have our own designated shit space.

4455
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:05,360
Like we have to have our own room.

4456
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:07,640
What is a fucking litter box?

4457
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:09,080
I mean, you might think, true,

4458
02:47:09,080 --> 02:47:11,320
you know, cats have a bottle or whatever,

4459
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,360
but we decide that for them.

4460
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:14,560
No, they would do that anyway.

4461
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:17,080
Not for that, they just kind of shit wherever.

4462
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:19,000
Same thing with dogs, like we just kind of say,

4463
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,760
don't shit in the house, they'll just shit wherever.

4464
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:24,960
We're like the only people that just don't decide

4465
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:29,440
to just shit on the floor or throw it around or wherever.

4466
02:47:29,440 --> 02:47:31,200
God, humans are so fucking weird.

4467
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:32,280
What happened?

4468
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:34,400
Okay, okay, I'm pretty sure.

4469
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:36,000
I know that's a stupid answer.

4470
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:36,840
Yeah.

4471
02:47:36,840 --> 02:47:38,160
Get out of here.

4472
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:39,480
He's missing too.

4473
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:40,520
All right, full as we am.

4474
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:44,680
I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure there are animals

4475
02:47:44,680 --> 02:47:46,000
who have designated,

4476
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:48,960
like monkeys must have like a place they go to shit, right?

4477
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:50,880
They don't just like, well, unless they live in the trees,

4478
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:52,600
I don't know, but the ones that live on the ground

4479
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:53,840
must have like a place.

4480
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,080
They've got to, right?

4481
02:47:55,080 --> 02:47:56,280
I don't think he did any research.

4482
02:47:56,280 --> 02:47:57,760
Or they shit in the river or something.

4483
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:00,840
There has to be another animal that has a shit place.

4484
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:02,000
I'm sure there is.

4485
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,860
I'm sure there is.

4486
02:48:03,860 --> 02:48:05,120
I'm gonna Google it right now.

4487
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:06,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4488
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:10,280
Animals shit in a, in a shit place.

4489
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:12,920
Do they shit in a society?

4490
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,520
Oh, okay, right here, right here, earth.

4491
02:48:14,600 --> 02:48:17,400
Animals invented public toilets long before we did.

4492
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:19,760
Article on the BBC from 2015.

4493
02:48:20,680 --> 02:48:21,920
I'm afraid you're done.

4494
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:22,760
You're all done cheating.

4495
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:25,200
Animal latrine, places where the wildlife animals

4496
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:26,840
habitually defecate or urinate.

4497
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:28,000
There's a whole list of them

4498
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,480
and the whole list of people that do it.

4499
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:33,640
No, no, no, only humans have toilets.

4500
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:35,680
Only a human shit in the same spot.

4501
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:38,360
Mozilla, Fennec, we're just gonna land back.

4502
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:40,200
You're going in the voice jail.

4503
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:41,360
You're so fucking stupid.

4504
02:48:41,360 --> 02:48:42,200
Voice jail.

4505
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:43,040
Yeah, voice jail.

4506
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:44,760
You're probably falling with something

4507
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:46,440
that just is factually wrong,

4508
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:49,920
but then you have the gall to admit that it's stupid.

4509
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:51,920
You weren't even sticking to your fucking guns.

4510
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:54,160
I fucking hate you, Mozilla Fennec.

4511
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:57,600
Kill yourself, kill yourself.

4512
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,560
All right, let's go into jail.

4513
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:00,400
He's going to jail.

4514
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:01,560
Mozilla Fennec, I'm sorry.

4515
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:03,200
You were a good man for a long time.

4516
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:07,040
You gave us good stuff, but it's fucking over, dude.

4517
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:08,480
All right, well, incidentally.

4518
02:49:08,480 --> 02:49:09,320
Game over.

4519
02:49:09,320 --> 02:49:10,160
Game over.

4520
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:16,840
We have one more voice message from one Mozilla Fennec'n.

4521
02:49:16,840 --> 02:49:19,680
Actually, it's called Special Announcement.

4522
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:22,400
It's a special announcement from a man in jail.

4523
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:23,600
Let's hear what he has to say.

4524
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:25,320
OK, all right, go.

4525
02:49:25,320 --> 02:49:27,720
Hey, PCPs, sorry I haven't submitted a voicemail

4526
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:28,520
in a long time.

4527
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:32,200
I've been so busy doing this fucking compilation

4528
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:36,840
of all of the best and worst voicemails in the PCPs history.

4529
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:37,480
And you're in the worst.

4530
02:49:37,480 --> 02:49:38,440
You heard that, Mike.

4531
02:49:38,600 --> 02:49:42,680
Best and worst of compilation of PCP voicemails,

4532
02:49:42,680 --> 02:49:44,960
because that's the only thing people care about with this

4533
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:46,240
podcast now.

4534
02:49:46,240 --> 02:49:49,040
This is an ongoing project, and to prove

4535
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:50,680
that I'm not completely full of shit,

4536
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:54,680
I have already made a compilation for the 2018 episodes.

4537
02:49:54,680 --> 02:49:57,920
You can find it at my side shit channel, Luxvanlavixi.

4538
02:49:57,920 --> 02:50:02,320
That's L-U-X-V-A-N-L-U-V-I-X-I.

4539
02:50:02,320 --> 02:50:05,120
I'm going to post a 2019 compilation at the end of the

4540
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:08,280
year, but I'd like some feedback from some other people.

4541
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:12,120
Suggestions as to which voicemails to include would be nice.

4542
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:16,480
But mainly, I want to know if I should include 2018's voicemails

4543
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:19,520
in the 2019 compilation, since voicemails weren't really

4544
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:22,200
introduced until around August last year.

4545
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:26,120
It also has some continuing sagas, like the Great Discord

4546
02:50:26,120 --> 02:50:27,640
War that happened.

4547
02:50:27,640 --> 02:50:29,000
So let me know.

4548
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,240
Comment on the video.

4549
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:33,320
You can find me on Twitter at Mozilla Fennigan.

4550
02:50:33,320 --> 02:50:35,040
I'm in the Patreon Discord as well.

4551
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:36,560
I'm really easy to find.

4552
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:37,560
OK.

4553
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:38,560
He's in the voice chat.

4554
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:40,600
I just want to let you know that's what I'm doing.

4555
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:43,720
See you in like five months, unless I kill myself or something.

4556
02:50:43,720 --> 02:50:44,720
Go away.

4557
02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:47,120
I can't wait to see the 2019 where it's just you.

4558
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:51,520
It's just all of your voicemails compiled into this section.

4559
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:53,280
Poor bastard.

4560
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:54,760
Well, I'm glad someone's doing it.

4561
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:55,960
Yeah, no, this is a good thing.

4562
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:57,720
This is a good service he's doing.

4563
02:50:57,720 --> 02:50:58,560
I appreciate it.

4564
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:00,360
I don't know if he's doing it.

4565
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:01,720
I don't know if it's a good thing.

4566
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:04,760
That's like saying Hitler had some good ideas.

4567
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:06,840
I mean, we all know that's true.

4568
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:11,120
At least he's staying productive in jail, getting something done.

4569
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:12,360
Should we let him out of jail?

4570
02:51:12,360 --> 02:51:13,360
No.

4571
02:51:13,360 --> 02:51:14,360
No.

4572
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:15,360

4621
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:11,520
that's the only way you can find grimp is you search a grim but you search for

4622
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:14,480
a channel you set the filter to channel I guess I'm spelling it wrong okay

4623
02:52:14,480 --> 02:52:18,160
whatever I wanted to actually go check this out maybe if I find it maybe it'll

4624
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:22,600
be the show notes I don't know we'll see okay anyway that's it people better

4625
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:28,280
voicemails then next time please you said something that was factually

4626
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:31,960
inaccurate on the PCP because we all know that this is just a pillar of

4627
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:38,920
objectivity on the show speak pipe link down below give us voice messages and

4628
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:44,400
patreon.com slash the procrastinators five dollars you get the bonus episodes by

4629
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:48,720
the time you hear this we'll a new one be out real quick proposition Nate I

4630
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:53,160
think we should do this for the voicemails and I don't know if you've

4631
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:58,080
listened to dick Masterson does this on his show who are these podcasts started

4632
02:52:58,080 --> 02:53:02,240
doing it as well where they they have like the ending of the show and then

4633
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:06,800
they do voicemails like they'll play an outro they they they say all their you

4634
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:10,440
know all the plugs and everything then they do voicemails just because so many

4635
02:53:10,440 --> 02:53:14,800
people hate voicemails that like people love the voicemails they're like

4636
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:18,120
everyone's favorite part I mean it really depends on the person I mean I

4637
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:20,880
don't know how people feel on this show initially seemed like there were a lot

4638
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:23,840
of people who had bigger problems at the voice get a straw poll and show notes

4639
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:27,880
let's find out just I just want to know like cuz like these shows are long as

4640
02:53:27,880 --> 02:53:32,680
shit and I know when people see like three hours it's just like oh my god how

4641
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:36,560
long is this gonna be you know but like if we had an outro after the before the

4642
02:53:36,560 --> 02:53:39,600
voicemail so just make people who didn't want to sit for three hours just feel

4643
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:43,440
like oh I can go now you know I hear you and I'm sympathetic to that and I want

4644
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:46,760
to do things if that's we can clean people are more likely to listen through

4645
02:53:46,760 --> 02:53:50,560
that that's good but you know we'll a half an hour make that much difference

4646
02:53:51,280 --> 02:53:54,880
usually an hour bro yeah it's like it's pretty long okay you might be right you

4647
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:58,840
might be right let us know what do you think of this idea okay yeah let us know

4648
02:53:58,840 --> 02:54:02,200
I'm open to although I made it far enough to hear me say that clearly

4649
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:06,040
listens to the full episode oh shit I you're right that's that's a just that's

4650
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:09,960
