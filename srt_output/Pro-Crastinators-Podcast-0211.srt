00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Hello everyone and welcome back to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best guy ever.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm doing what I do here on the YouTube as you do. And we're joined today by the usual boys Ben Saint.

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,560
More content grist for the mill.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
Indeed. Gibbontake. There he is.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,800
I got a comic content that you read right now. The lord of ghosts chapter six is out.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,120
Call me when it's been converted to anime. That is great though. I haven't read chapter six yet.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,920
It's all great so far. And today we're joined by a guest friend of the show. We haven't seen it a

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,160
while, but welcome back everybody. He's been doing great lately. FitMC. What's going on? How are you

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,760
doing guys? There he is. The oldest Anarchy Minecraft server in the game. In the world.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:05,680
All time man. Good to see you man. Really YouTube. I think the last time we spoke might have been

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,240
in the in the chat during Radcon 4 when I think you popped in for one of the live streams. But I

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,120
think yeah like the last time I was on the podcast wasn't it like three years ago already?

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,280
Something like that. I think so. That's crazy. At least a year ago. Have we even been a podcast

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,240
for three years? I think we're over three years now. I believe so. We did the math the other day.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,800
It was end of 2015. I think is when we started because it was a little bit after I started

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:43,920
BG. Just bury me. Yeah. I agree. End of 2015 pretty sure. Maybe I'm wrong but I think that's right.

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,680
Well let's just say for the record. So Fit has recently hit the legendary one million subscriber

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,480
mark. It's pretty great. I'm amazed. You'll still waste your time with folks like us down in the

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,960
slums. You can't forget where you came from you know. I always had a great time hanging out with

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,920
you guys. He owes it all to the progressives podcast. We basically invented FitMC. We invented the

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,440
old standard server in Minecraft. Yeah. That's right. You know and believe it or not I always

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,560
thought like there's no way like once you reach a million there's no secret YouTube Illuminati.

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,480
There is. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Is that so? Yeah. And it's like you actually get to talk to actual

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,600
YouTube employees. It's crazy dude. Oh sure. You know I did discover after I hit 100,000. Now I

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,240
wasn't the first of our group to do so. Did you had long ago but did you just a bit of a fuck up

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,800
when it comes to I don't know like engaging with the platform and talking to I don't know like the

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,920
employees and whatnot to solve problems. But the second that I hit 100,000 I was like let's get this

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,320
plaque going boys. Let's get that silver shit in my room. So I just logged in to the like the contact

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,320
the YouTuber help or whatever immediately got like connection with a person and we like instantly

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,440
sorted out like how to get the things sent out what form I need to fill out something that Digi

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
said was like a real hassle and he struggled with and he couldn't figure out or that there was like

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,400
some issue in the way. My instinct is that while the tools were available he was simply not capitalizing

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,280
on them in the appropriate way. So this is another call out to you Digi. I think you still have not

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,960
gotten your silver play button which you were certainly deserved or owed or whatever. So my

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,000
experience was that as soon as you hit that the tools did in fact open up to a degree and I could

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,440
only imagine that at the million mark it opens up you know even more so. The Illuminati is deeper

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
and wider than we ever thought possible. That's right starting to get to the inner circle man

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,280
like it's crazy all these conspiracies it's wild. I could go on for hours but I don't want to bogart

39
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,880
the podcast so. Thank you. Appreciate it. Did you have you filed for your gold play button out of

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,600
curiosity? They haven't sent me the code yet because normally like after a few weeks they'll

41
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,800
give you a code which they send it to you in the mail but I haven't received it yet but I know

42
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,080
there's been an issue with like YouTube verification like normally you know when you hit a hundred

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,240
thousand subs normally you get that little check mark. Well apparently no one's been able to get

44
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,120
that for like the past I want to say six months. Like a really popular Minecraft YouTuber Dream

45
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,000
just hit two million subscribers and he still doesn't have his yet. So it's it's yeah I mean

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,840
there's a lot of really strange things happening at YouTube right now. Not everybody is a Digi Bro

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,320
and by which I mean un-incompetent. It is possible he hasn't talked to the folks that

48
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,920
created support but maybe he has and he would he would you know just clarify. Yeah I don't know.

49
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,880
You know Nate I got to say I watched your entire lecture on One Piece and it was

50
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,040
phenomenal. I mean now I talk to my friends and I act like I've seen One Piece. Right.

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
Right. You never actually have to do it. It's fantastic. Save you the trouble. Did you hear that

52
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,800
guys? Fit likes my content. Oh my god that reminds me of there's a reason I'm having audio glitches

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,280
today and it's because guys fits at something nice about me you know how that makes me feel

54
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,040
a little bit like this. Yes I'm doing it. Easy money.

55
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,280
I did it guys. I figured out how to pipe the fucking soundboard into my audacity and so that

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,800
everyone can hear it. Congrats. Oh it feels good. That's the real celebration. Thank you. Thank you.

57
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,680
I gotta get one of those. Let me give you one of these. Dude it's it's it's good. I got my Elgato

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
soundboard that I've been using for a year or two. I absolutely love it but just this very day

59
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,760
I have figured out how to get it for podcast so I can do things like this.

60
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,760
It brings me so much joy every single day of my life. Oh Ben Ben tell us one of your really

61
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,120
boring stories. Tell us a really uninteresting story of your life. I well I was playing Dungeons

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,360
and Dragons. I hate this already. I was a little frog and I I missed I missed the pond

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,280
and I went to a cave and I and I and I killed a goblin and I had some some bore

64
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,920
from a mine. Come on. I spent it on on the wizard to make water for me because I needed

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,000
to live and breathe. Dude make sure to stay hydrated. You know what I'm saying. Oh yeah guys

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,040
mage is back. She's such a normie. I do Ben. Thank you. Thank you. Did you get the water that you

67
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,760
see? You're welcome. I did. I was very happy. Give it up for Ben everybody. Give it up for Ben's

68
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,560
D&D story. Thank you. This can't be how it is from now on. This is how it is from now on.

69
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,720
This is the world. He lived in a post soundboard world.

70
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:08,720
Yeah well now what were we saying? Back to the praise of my lecture which was great. Thank you

71
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,240
very much. What else was I going to say about that? Oh I didn't just want to take the opportunity

72
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,360
while the lectures came up to again shame those people who have not released their lectures

73
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,480
specifically Munchy because this is the one that I want to watch again the most because it was so

74
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,440
good and you get so little Munchy content day to day. I can't believe it. What is he even doing

75
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,280
with it? I'm just sitting on it. Just sitting on it. He's just shameful. He's doing his school

76
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,520
work. He's doing his homework. He's doing his little you know what was his lecture on? My comic.

77
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,560
That's true and are you aware of this fit? Ben's been his ode art by some of our members and it's

78
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,960
truly shameful. I am all right. I realize everyone hates me. Everyone hates me now because my

79
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,800
comic's not out. My book's not out. The reason why is because I waited until the school year

80
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,120
started to get them the the shit and then they all had because they're all little babies. They're

81
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,160
all in school. They've all got homework to do. They've all got to be on Zoom or whatever and

82
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,680
talking to their professors. Some summer vacation babies. Summer vacation finally

83
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,800
six month overdue book can be made at last. I will no longer be a liar.

84
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Oh yeah it's the end of May so that's going to be like any day now that summer vacation will be

85
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,240
upon us right? I mean it's practically already summer. I mean imagine you're a student in school

86
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,360
right now. Do you actually give a shit? Oh god. Absolutely not. It's got to be a true nightmare

87
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,080
and you have more, what's the word I'm looking for? More history with this than others. I was

88
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,640
watching your million subscribers special with great fascination fit where you talk about you

89
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,280
were an elementary school teacher when you got into Minecraft and you started playing it in

90
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,280
college and all that good stuff and you basically I just want to point out for those people who

91
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,560
don't necessarily think of this life path that you pursued a trait. You pursued a relatively

92
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,800
stable life path of being a teacher and whatnot doing something obviously you're interested in

93
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,120
and then you had a hobby that you loved and pursued independently and then once that

94
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,320
got to a point where it looked like that would be economically viable then you made a transition

95
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,440
and when you had already like developed your love for this your your skills in creating the medium of

96
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,720
YouTube content and whatnot and your your wit and witticism and also had developed the

97
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,320
bald head polishing technique that really gives your videos the edge that the kids crave and they

98
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,520
come running for. So just want to point out to everybody this is a very good life path to take

99
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,680
one that I would recommend to a lot of people and yes it is what I did so you can have a little bit

100
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,560
of bias in there but I think it's just a good idea. So looking back on it is there anything do you

101
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,840
feel any perhaps any any desire like looking back on as I compare myself to some of my contemporaries

102
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,160
online and whatnot that you should have like dived yourself in like as soon as possible sooner

103
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,000
and and weaned off of your job faster to get to a career that's been so great for you and so nice

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,520
and hopefully rewarding and all that. Any any wishes you've done sooner? Well for me I mean so

105
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,160
on June 1st that will be one year I've been YouTuber full-time and I would say the timing

106
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,560
worked out exactly the way it was supposed to because I had a very unusual rise to YouTube

107
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,240
fam I mean I went from zero subscribers to like 80,000 in like three months and that is right

108
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,560
not typical and it just I've been looking at your rise to a million was in the last couple months

109
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,880
from like 300,000 or something insane exponential growth. I know and it's just like with that first

110
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:06,320
initial explosive growth I didn't know how to maintain an audience so I needed to spend a few

111
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,120
years in algorithm hell to really learn how to be a YouTuber so I mean the timing it just kind of

112
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,360
worked out perfectly I would say you know. I'm still figuring it out myself I'll hopefully one of these

113
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,800
days it'll work out for me but you know interesting you say you'll be like one year officially being

114
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,640
a full-time Uber on June 1st my anniversary of being a YouTuber full-time will be on July 1st

115
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,280
exactly one month later isn't that isn't that fun that's awesome man yeah yeah hopefully I uh don't

116
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,440
die of starvation see how it goes the most important thing to to do in the YouTube I think is to

117
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
do it just my inner thoughts coming out

118
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:59,600
you know you you're a piece of work you are maybe I was just gonna rib you for not uploading videos

119
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
you're taking a real long time in that final fantasy lecture okay not like totally understandable

120
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,560
thing actual video right right oh where's the video I can't wait to hear your thoughts on this

121
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,040
Nate I cannot wait I won't spoil it for you if you haven't heard my rantings this far I'll keep it

122
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,160
completely out of this episode I'll let you I'll let you guess and then one day you can see when

123
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,840
the video does come out hopefully the world will uh you know just accept the argument for for the

124
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,000
points that are being presented there without bringing any too much baggage of things I've said

125
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,280
elsewhere um yeah yeah what do you feel fit have you played it any investment in the series

126
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,200
so well I watched since I don't own a playstation I watched a full playthrough of the remake

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,240
and I'm afraid to say my thoughts on it because I know it's just gonna piss you off man

128
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:01,280
uh okay yeah I'm saying I'm a fucking consumer I fucking loved it no more as a

129
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:08,560
fucking genius man you know I've got to say this uh the approach of just not playing this

130
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,960
movie game and just watching it on YouTube that's really the perfect experience that's the best way

131
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,640
to consume any video game I would say I mean I feel like I've played 2b2t more than anyone

132
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,680
because I just leave the videos on autoplay in the background and just impassively gaining the exp

133
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,160
of a real gamer uh so frankly I think I'm probably more of a Minecraft veteran than you could ever

134
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,440
hope to be because I have 10 screens going at once all the time and I'm absorbing the information

135
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,040
gameplay was a was a fun footnote in history it's time to just devote ourselves to movie games

136
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,000
and uh let's just cut out this wasteful middleman of actually playing video games

137
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,600
gaming via osmosis man that's right that's the future I I've been playing Minecraft recently

138
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,280
like uh I'm just some server and I've been I've been grinding away I've made like a castle on

139
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,080
the sea and I've been making a moat in the ocean uh of the sea like it goes this scene and then it

140
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,800
goes down as a moat of the right yeah it's very cool very epic but it's really time consuming

141
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,040
because I have to like put dirt under the water then fill it with sand and then delete the sand

142
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,800
and I'm just realizing that nobody comes to this part of the map nobody it's not a very populated

143
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,280
server I'm like why am I gaming right now what am I really getting out of this that's a great

144
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,800
question if I was watching somebody just like do a speed build of this it would be like how cool

145
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,040
but I'm doing it and I don't like that I have a I feel you very foggy memory last night of trying

146
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:49,200
to log into Pixelmon I I can't I couldn't do it yeah I couldn't type the password I couldn't

147
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,680
write my name like your Minecraft password yes my I I think the last thing I remember

148
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,880
before blacking out was just trying to fail to type my password into the into the Minecraft login

149
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,400
screen I couldn't manage it I wasn't up to the task no no there's a new version it said you

150
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:16,480
need 7.2.2 and I was like oh fuck and I struggled right right to obtain 7.2.2 didn't didn't manage

151
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,960
it couldn't do it it's pretty pretty simple gave up had you committed yourself to the drink

152
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,360
and now I'm hungover now my head hurts and so your soundboard is really doing me a lot of

153
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:37,680
favors today I'm really loving it yeah that feels good the point is I can't play Minecraft it's

154
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,800
impossible it's it's the hardest game ever made because logging in is just impossible

155
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,520
can't get over that initial the initial hurdle the skill floor is just too high

156
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,600
right right uh you know hey I have been playing just a just a little bit there there's exciting

157
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,000
news in the world of a little game known as good Minecraft aka Terraria which just said it's final

158
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,600
update yesterday time of this recording journey's end I played it for like an hour or two just to

159
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000

160
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,240
stuff get a couple iron me and munchie have to like I think we have to rebuild slime base

161
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,800
in the new in the new game or something I don't know I think we're gonna write it does the old

162
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,800
map not work I don't know he says there's been a lot of changes he said something about how we

163
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,920
would need to like redo I assume we're just gonna transport the old map and maybe something

164
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,720
changed about it I don't know I haven't seen the new updates is it uh is that the name of the world

165
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,480
slime base or just like no we built no no it's our we built a little a nice little slime cove

166
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,040
a nice little bubble in the ground it's full of is there a name for the server does have a specific

167
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,920
name I think it might just be called rfck rfck oldest anarchy server in terraria

168
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:01,840
endless war is the oldest anarchy server in discord in discord it is it is it's true uh we

169
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,920
that's true I would say and um we've said a bunch of times uh fit that like what what endless war

170
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,360
are you familiar you're familiar with endless war rfck all this shit okay it's a it's a it's a

171
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,720
disc well me and munchie and some other people made it it's a discord server but it's a game

172
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,000
it's like an rpg and it's and it's for cool kids who love slime and um it is what what it needs it

173
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,920
has lore it has like it has existed for like two years it has like a rich and storied history of

174
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,640
like legendary events committed absolutely true by the player base and what it needs is videos like

175
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,440
what you make uh about a 2b2t it needs that same kind of like like a narrative you know like like

176
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,880
take the events that happened construct them into a narrative make a video about it so anyone can

177
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,880
be like oh I get it oh so that's what happened oh so that's why you know this character that character

178
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,040
that user is like you know famous for whatever like that's that's what the meme is all about

179
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,320
that kind of lore at least from my opinion is kind of the main draw of rfck in general

180
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,800
that's the real uh attachment that I feel to it we of course I've enjoyed the game we made a um

181
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,720
there's there's another lecture I don't know if you've seen it uh there's another lecture on the

182
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,400
the lecture a playlist that is the me and munchie doing an rfck lore lecture and you know it brought

183
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,360
a big like influx of new players now who all threw money at the kickstarter and stuff it was great it

184
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,000
was great I was gonna say uh fit if you had to guess if you had to quantify any kind of

185
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,600
guess as to like how much the popularity of 2b2t you think has increased specifically due to you

186
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,760
know your work on youtube and whatnot I mean I know I first heard of it due to your videos

187
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,440
uh I would say I was probably probably the primary catalyst for new people coming in for a while but

188
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,480
now there's actually a russian invasion going on where a bunch of russian youtubers have like

189
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,840
been making videos and they're getting millions of views I used to be able to log into 2b2t at

190
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,400
five in the morning and get right in but now like at five am I have to fucking russians I gotta wait

191
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,720
like 20 minutes man it's bullshit it's it's we're gonna have another cold war dude and it's gonna

192
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,680
be a minecraft okay it's just that like clogged with traffic yeah and it's because that's when

193
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,880
they would all be logging in because that's their oh god you know fifth vodka shot of the daytime

194
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,120
yeah they're squatting at their uh dull laptops and just going crazy what are they what are they

195
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,920
doing like they just fucking around or yeah they're just walking around just fucking falling in the

196
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:50,880
holes it's those pissy russies oh man oh yeah russian a hole and watch them fall in that's

197
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,280
that's the way it goes tear down the minecraft wall but what I've been doing recently is I've

198
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,640
been trying to like sort of diversify my content a little bit and I've been just talking about

199
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,120
broader minecraft topics like I did a video about this server called the uncensored library

200
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,880
and it was a minecraft server for news articles from countries without freedom of press fascinating

201
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,720
it was really crazy shit yeah so like there's a lot of real there's like there's so many communities

202
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,320
in in minecraft because it's the best-selling video game of all time I mean you've got the pvp

203
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,080
community you've got the shrek erotic role play community you've got all these communities

204
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,160
and that's that's real by the way I wish I was down yeah I believe it it's ridiculous man I think

205
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:51,120
you'll find a few members in this very call thing every joke is now a double joke you just hit it

206
00:20:51,120 --> 00:21:00,960
with one of these when you're done I will eat your ass this should not be as funny as it is

207
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:13,040
so much I know I love my son he's like a pig in shit yeah you're right okay you know you know

208
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,720
call the comedy police all right I'm ready cart me away I hate him I hate him

209
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,080
okay all right what are we talking about I don't remember something about minecraft

210
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,120
shrek erotic here's another minecraft thing my brother the the infamous coder of run away

211
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,240
from snakes the video game not the winner of the most recent pcp royal rumble which is the sound

212
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,200
samurai aka hgb guy yes younger brother right yeah my youngest brother um the chas has been

213
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,680
often on he's like he's he's a coder boy he likes doing coding and he's recently got into

214
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,960
really into a coding and minecraft server with unique things in it and it's he's looking to

215
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,360
to like spread it around um I just wanted to take a little minute to explain how cool this is because

216
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,640
it started out like this one mini game called a rabbit catching where there are multiple different

217
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,120
maps and you you go to this area you teleport to this map and you and whoever else is playing

218
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,400
has to try and find all the rabbits and click them or stand on them and you get points and it's a

219
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,120
fun little game like that and for as a reward you get like a bunches of blocks and you would go to

220
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,840
build this island and then build stuff and so it was like a different way to play minecraft rather

221
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:45,120
than doing survival stuff and over time he has built so many great mini games like like with really

222
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:54,080
rich um uh I don't know I can't think of the words it's like really deep um well there's this one

223
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,200
mini game which is a king of the hill tf2 like slime rfck endless war thing where you choose a

224
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,520
pink team or purple team and you kill each other and you collect slime in a in an arena

225
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,160
wait what where's this where's this it's a server that my brother's working on I can send you a link

226
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:20,000
us royalties yeah we own pink and purple no no no I told him it was okay so it's fine you

227
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,040
all right well you pay palmy you can pay the price yeah I'll pay you in slime um

228
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,520
but yeah there's that there's um this pirate world which is my favorite basically you get on

229
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,240
this little boat and you whack this bell that's on the boat and suddenly you are in control of

230
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,760
this player owned boat and you have like a golden rod that is a navigation rod you right click the

231
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,640
navigation rod and your boat teleports in that direction and essentially that means you have

232
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,840
a pirate ship and you can sail around and like occasionally there's like random treasure chests

233
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,080
appear like buried treasure and if you have a compass it'll point to the treasure you go collect

234
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,880
the treasure there'll be like blueprints sometimes in the treasure chest you could take the blueprints to

235
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,520
like the pirate island in the middle of the map and you can change that in for like making your

236
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,080
ship bigger and it's it's like it's like a real pirate game it's really cool I'm really proud of

237
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:24,560
work ethic how is this possible it through lots of lots of Minecraft coding and programming

238
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,280
and smarts and it's really cool and I he needs more people to play on it so that it feels like

239
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,040
it's you know worth his time because at the moment he's just got a few friends and me

240
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,560
so I'm just shouting that out that's a little bit like uh you know fit you probably haven't

241
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,480
heard about this but we in fact have our own PCP Minecraft server that we have a patron for

242
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,000
to sustain the livelihood of and we've got like two admins we just brought on to work on it regularly

243
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,920
and they're constantly expanding and making like more features and stuff we're having a

244
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,120
Pokemon tournament it's it's a Pixelmon server primarily right now on uh on the 20th that you

245
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,120
if you want to stop by you should you should come check it out it's going to be at like 3 p.m. we're

246
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,320
all just going to be fighting Pokemon boys in the server so I don't know they're the invitation

247
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,160
look version come hang out some time oh you know I should know that offhand I don't remember

248
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,280
generally newer ones though generally more recent ones I can get you that later though

249
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,760
that's all good yeah I definitely want to check it out yeah yeah sure sure we got a lot of dope

250
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,800
stuff and um one of the things that they're building there's a bunch of ideas for like

251
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,240
unique stuff that we plan to do in the server it's generally Pokemon themes since that's

252
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,080
overall the the point of the server in general that we're thinking of expanding but but one of

253
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,960
the things that our boy Marenpan uh one of our admins is working on is like hey you like the

254
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,840
one piece lecture right well Marenpan is working right now on a like large-scale recreation of

255
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,160
the grand line from one piece uh like converted to like a Pixelmon progression system where you go

256
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,000
from island to island yeah what the fuck on the the board it has it's surrounded by borders that

257
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,360
function like the calm belt that prevent you from entering any place except from the beginning

258
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,800
of this area and you start on like you know I don't know like the twin capes or whatever it is

259
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,600
fucking what was the first one um oh what's the big cactus whiskey peak I don't know whatever island

260
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,080
it is I think they're just using the ones they visit in one piece and you're gonna go and like

261
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,520
fight trainers there and in some way that's still being worked out progress from island to island

262
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,840
going through the red line or through the grand line until you get to the end where there will be

263
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,120
something and it's we're still working it out but I haven't even the theory is sound I haven't

264
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,120
even fought my way to the top of endless war yet neither have I that's how much baby I am I just

265
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,120
haven't spent the time grinding up a team or anything though I do have only I could just type

266
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:57,680
my password into the freaking login screen it would be all uphill from there uh so but anyway

267
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,440
that's just one of the things that we're working on just the other day and I think we're gonna use

268
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,080
this for the tournament our boys built um like a new stadium like a Japanese themed tournament

269
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,160
stadium where we're gonna have like most of the battling for the tournament or something I don't

270
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,160
know it's just a great time those guys are killing it uh patreon.com slash peace be minecraft only

271
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,760
five dollars a month come play with us oh and it's it's free oh okay it was free but when you hear

272
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,080
this episode it will no longer be open to the public for like that five day event or whatever

273
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,160
but there will be more of those coming there are there we're planning to do more like every month

274
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,480
or something just to give people a chance to play well my my brother's minecraft server linked

275
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,840
the thing there's that's the ip uh that's free forever just just play the game it's it's fun

276
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,400
just hop in that he's recently made a like uh survive like resident evil survival horror

277
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,440
like pvp thing where like a button what everyone goes into the spooky house and then everybody

278
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,560
gets like the blindness effect except for one person uh who gets like a pumpkin on their head

279
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,760
and a scythe and they have to kill everyone and he's invincible and it's like that's pretty good

280
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:14,320
it is pretty good uh so it's really cool do things like this it's it's i mean yeah it's it's

281
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,080
basically you know he's not using any pre-existing mods he's coding all of this himself he's having

282
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,800
ideas and he's just doing it and he's just like really into that and i'm like i want people to

283
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:32,480
play it so that all of this time is not wasted that is way cool and i love it i've been uh i was

284
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,240
going to say that uh like in my recent experiences exploring the depths of various games specifically

285
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,560
like final fantasy seven i talked about this on my stream the other day so hopefully uh i don't

286
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,680
know most people haven't heard it but uh like as i was digging into just a bunch of features about

287
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,600
the game uh i noticed one interesting feature when i first started up like the pc version of ff7

288
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,200
which was the easiest to to get my hands on um like i noticed first of all that the music was

289
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,600
like horribly wrong and then like what is going on here and you do a bunch of digging and it turns

290
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,280
out that like first of all ff7 was a buggy mess that has notoriously been very hard for like

291
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,560
sort enix to like make updated versions of just for like ports to other systems and stuff so like

292
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,520
there's actually an extensive history of like all the problems with uh like the re-releases and

293
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,720
whatnot the like probably the biggest one being that the soundtrack is different and weird and

294
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,480
sucks uh on like all versions except like the original version so of course what i do is i

295
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,160
turn to the heroes in the modding community to just save me from this awful music so boom use

296
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,440
a mod and get the correct soundtrack in there thank god thank god now it isn't terrible bullshit

297
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,640
anymore um but beyond that there was like the next issue that i've been like looking into

298
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,840
and i i'm definitely going to touch on this at least a little bit in my um my ff7 remake video

299
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,720
and stuff but but uh to say it in a little more detail here because i want to have an opportunity

300
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,800
in that context it's that in the remakes of ff7 or rather the like the remasters the re-releases

301
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,800
and stuff characters in the field model they're they're lego models they have visible mouths

302
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,560
and they did not in the original i saw i'm talking about did you link that the video that was like

303
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,120
comparing all the different versions or did i just find that somewhere that is a popular

304
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,520
video that's making the rounds yeah i saw a video it's like yeah comparing all the the

305
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,240
different re-releases like the pc version yeah yeah but it those mouths look so bad like it's

306
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,640
insane yeah that i the first version i played was the pc steam version i saw the mouse i was like

307
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,720
okay that like for at first i was like are they is that part of the thing but then i saw like

308
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,000
yeah it was just in a in scenes that were very inappropriate the way they look right i was like

309
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,040
okay it's a glitchy thing i'm playing a different version of the game so i sort of ignored it but

310
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,800
it was still kind of like that sucks oh my god if i had known that like when you play oh sorry

311
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,560
were you saying something yeah i was gonna say i can't i can't believe i haven't told you this

312
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:07,920
nate the first time i ever played final fantasy seven was when the drummer of the plain white

313
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:16,800
teas was babysitting me when i was a kid yeah okay so a long time ago my cousin dated the drummer

314
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,520
from the plain white teas because you know my cousin's a lot older than me um and they were

315
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,000
babysitting me one night and he's like hey well kid check out this game final fantasy seven for

316
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,840
the playstation i was like what the and like they didn't have a memory card so i could only play

317
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:38,640
through like the midgar section like and i loved it man but like that's one of those i mean it's

318
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,800
it's good shit man that's it's no no no argument here it's one of those stories where i tell people

319
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,000
they don't believe me that's you know it's just one of those weird stories that is a weird story

326
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,280
midgar i was playing ff7 with my new best friend the friend fit mc the oldest anarchy server in

327
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:41,520
minecraft beautiful beautiful thank you thank you um what was i saying about that oh right so if i

328
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,800
had known give at that time that like the version you were playing of ff7 like on the steam release

329
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,080
or whatever had like this glitch which i didn't know existed i would have screamed and cried like a

330
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,240
pussy baby about how no you need to play the real version you're playing this shit i i couldn't find

331
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,040
i couldn't find like i went to my local game store that still existed at the time um i mean

332
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,800
they still exist but they don't have like old games anymore um and i i found final fantasy seven

333
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,680
no final fantasy eight and nine i thought oh they're really cheap some reason i'll get those

334
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,240
uh but i couldn't find seven so it was like whatever steam's fine i wouldn't know i don't

335
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,400
blame you at all i'm playing the steam one right now look at these fucking crisp polygons why are

336
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:34,560
they so shit why did we ever move past crts i i feel you we don't need any more bits than 32

337
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:41,440
everyone beyond there's a waste and a dude is fascinating i had my mom send me the the

338
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,320
playstation one and like some of the games just to fuck around with and like the memory card is 32

339
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,840
bits meanwhile i just purchased for like to transfer files for my ps4 whatever i needed a

340
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,400
micro sd card like a i think it was like a 256 bit in you know a little micro sd and i'm like

341
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,720
micro xd over here bro this is like crazy the technology you know what i'm saying that's

342
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,320
incredible it really do be like that sometimes yeah but uh on this model thing i so i looked into it

343
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,640
and i was gonna play the steam version i still am playing it and stuff the the sound thing

344
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,800
intolerable oh you probably played with like the shitty soundtrack to give oh i'm crying i'm crying

345
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:32,240
inside uh i do vaguely recall like a weird sound thing and i think i may have got a mod to fix it

346
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,200
okay that would be like if it was like yeah if it if you had seen it heard it and it was like

347
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:46,400
painful i i feel like i did something about that well that's that's great i mean to be fair it's

348
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,520
not like it's literally like broken and fractured i mean i'm aware i've been listening to that soundtrack

349
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,160
for like decades and it's like my favorite when i was a kid i didn't listen to albums i listened to

350
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,200
the soundtrack of final fantasy games oh wait no a little bit stuck in my brain yeah i do remember

351
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,320
because i downloaded the soundtrack and it sounded the same as i remember it from the game so yeah

352
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,360
okay great that's that's fantastic oh my god um i just want to say yeah i'm so glad i'm not alone

353
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,960
i used to feel like am i the only one that listens to video game soundtracks like when i was growing

354
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,760
up and like i fucking loved them man i'm glad it's a very i used to burn final fantasy soundtracks

355
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,640
to cds to play in my walkman cd player so that i could have them on the go and listen to the main

356
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,760
theme of final fantasy 7 whenever i damn well pleased and uh it was great i i had my mp3 player

357
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,920
which i still own and it's filled with like the entire okami soundtrack and things like that

358
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,240
fucking let me just like this is you i wish that were me

359
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,440
man all this remake talk i played through the original like all the way once i got a little

360
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,160
older like i was in high school and i just hope they keep sid smoking in the remake

361
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,600
oh that's one of the things that's one of the things that i fear fucking dynamite with his

362
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,360
cigarette for his limit sure does buddy he sure does i mean wait it's not a game for babies they

363
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,360
wouldn't take the cigarette out well i i certainly hope not but if they do i will scream and cry

364
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,840
like a little baby i would be which i am i will wet my diaper the game has guns in it it has guns

365
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:35,600
so it has to have cigarettes as well imagine if they had the guns with the orange plastic tips on

366
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,480
the end you know i noticed that'd be simply epic dude i mean for example i believe heitiger

367
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,920
but definitely president shinra has a big honkin cigar but he's evil so it's like oh yeah that's

368
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,840
okay the heroes can't smoke because winners don't do drugs forgets that absolutely right but hey

369
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,080
forget um the smoke and the cigarette will sid still be a literal wife beater or a girlfriend

370
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,040
beater because if they don't keep that i mean i'm just gonna say this is no longer our god this

371
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,680
is not the man like his assistant she's girlfriend too and there's there's a specific line in the

372
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,920
original where uh they say because it's okay to be your assistant it's not going to be a girlfriend

373
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,640
if you start dating or you have to stop beating her it's great there's a line at the end or in

374
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,840
what when you first meet number seven where i think tifa says like oh it's weird that you treat your

375
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:33,600
wife like that he's like oh god my fucking wife don't i'm gonna fucking puke i would never marry

376
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:40,080
you like a disgusting fucking piece of shit like her man so based so that sounds more

377
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:47,360
sincerity than than sincere no no he really hated it's not like i hit you because i don't

378
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,520
like you or anything he hit her because he really hated her and resented her on a deep level

379
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,200
amazing which is somewhat understandable heart or a hot take shara was 100 in the wrong she

380
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,560
should have known she was trying to saddle sid with the baggage of having murdered his assistant

381
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:13,120
to go to space no that's not that wouldn't maybe i'm remembering incorrectly didn't she find out

382
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,640
like the ship was gonna blow up if it took off and so she was trying to like save sid and that's

383
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,400
kind of his whole character arc you're absolutely right it's just in the the full series of events

384
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:31,200
is like yes sid was downplaying like some issue that could and probably would have like killed him

385
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,360
when trying to launch the rocket it would have been like some coolant was leaking it was like a

386
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,480
serious problem some of that star trek techno babble technical issue okay sure fine true

387
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,200
and shira was like i need to fix this because i want the launch to go off without a hitch

388
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,880
but her quote unquote solution was to put herself like in the cargo bay or whatever to be fixing

389
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,240
the problem which was going to be like flooded with radiation or space rays or something and

390
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,320
she was going to die in there and when sid says oh hey i'm about to take off you're gonna die if

391
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,720
you're in that room shira says just do it like that's fine i will die and i'm just saying

392
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:15,120
she should have known that no person is just gonna say sure yes i will just kill you shouldn't

393
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,280
achieve my dream she have just like not been in there i don't you know what i'm think the more

394
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,800
i'm thinking about the less sense this makes why didn't she fix it it's a very anime situation

395
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,840
why didn't they just put the launch off why didn't they launch like the next day that's exactly

396
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,320
i think the general idea was like shinra was getting frustrated the project was going to get

397
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,320
canceled soon if they didn't have results and also like sid was not listening to shira he was

398
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,880
like blowing her off and dismissing her as you know because he's the captain blah blah blah i

399
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,800
want to go do the space stuff and i don't want to delay this anymore because there's financial

400
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:01,120
issues she was backing us etc etc uh so like they concocted the situation it was rough sounds like

401
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:08,720
maybe final fantasy seven bad game oh yeah hard to agree gotta agree hate to say it i feel like

402
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,880
you'll have an easier time getting cigarettes in final fantasy because it's a video game it's not

403
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,320
like a movie like dude do you know how strict they are with movies like if you put a cigarette in a

404
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,960
movie yeah automatic r rating automatic really yeah that can't be true so if you have ever seen that

405
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,160
movie about walt disney you see him a tom hanks yeah you see him put out something and they don't

406
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,920
show what it is but it's a cigarette because disney was a huge smoker but they can't show disney

407
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,920
smoking or else the family friendly film gets an r rating so they had to be super clever about how

408
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,840
they did it Jesus fascinating she you know you can see the logic behind it but does seem a little

409
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:56,240
bit to seem a little bit silly yeah um anyway to make my final point here about this i was looking

410
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,360
into this mod situation uh to like fix the music and then when i noticed in the pc version the first

411
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,320
thing i saw was like oh my god big's his mouth and wedge and jesse are like horrible barrett and

412
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,600
cloud look fine or whatever um but then i i was like looking online or i remember that video that

413
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,800
puts the details together or something where uh you see that sephiroth's mouth is just like a

414
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,360
gape like jesse big's and wedge i can somewhat understand but sephiroth is like the most important

415
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,040
character outside of like literally cloud or maybe your main cast or something so they really should

416
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,720
have fixed that luckily for me there were two mods available online that people had made to fix this

417
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,240
issue one simply disabled all mouths to make it like the original and that's that's okay that's

418
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,280
acceptable you can see that one working but i did find that like because now everything is so much

419
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,760
more high resolution it kind of feels a little bit weirder so instead i found another mod that just

420
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,520
adds like better looking mouths to all the models to make them look better so like sephiroth no

421
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,680
longer has his horrible gaping o mouth or whatever and it's funny to think that like i don't know i

422
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,440
kind of feel like the mods solution in this particular instance is the most appropriate one

423
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,200
in keeping with like the spirit of the original it's like uh i don't know i don't know since like

424
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,320
fidelity has increased just due to time marching onward and everything looks so much more polished

425
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,200
it's almost kind of weird now to not have mouths but so you have to turn to the modding community

426
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,840
for the solution to this particular issue um and i don't know maybe this is obvious to people

427
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,040
who are experienced modders i haven't really done too much of it messed around with like securo and

428
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,080
oh i just installed uh the the cinders mod for dark souls 3 that my boy uh limit breakers just

429
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,880
advertised in one of his big old beautiful videos that you guys should all watch if you at all give

430
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,320
a shit about dark souls content or just you know good videos which he always makes uh yeah anyway

431
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:02,240
they made like his videos are too good they are too good they definitely are too good and i don't

432
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,800
know how or why he is one able to make them that good and two finds the will to put in the kind

433
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,040
of effort to make them as amazingly good as they are because the the full hit i would love to get a

434
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,720
behind the scenes scoop on like how he makes his videos because it must involve a complicated series

435
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,880
of like installing the mods he needs to make the particular like camera work and stuff happen like

436
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,200
in some way either green screening or like magically cropping to like an amazingly competent

437
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,880
degree the models out of like things to do is like super imposing animations and attacks and

438
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,520
stuff for like his various pans and fades and combining different footage of different stuff

439
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,360
i don't know he's one of the most amazing editors uh in the game in my mind and i love his style

440
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,760
so uh let's let's be best friends limit breakers i think you're the coolest guy

441
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,240
and his whole channel is final fantasy seven themed so he's a he's a good guy uh in my book

442
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,800
anyway mods are cool love to love to sip and uh you're welcome for fixing your shitty work

443
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,320
square enix i have found solutions that the community has found to uh improve your bad work

444
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,400
oh you know what last interesting thing i found on that was just that i was i was looking around

445
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,120
at different versions i noticed that uh the switch version which is like the most recent

446
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,600
port that exists anywhere i think their solution to this horrible mouth problem was like okay some

447
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,920
mouths work like cloud and tifa and barrett they look perfectly fine most of the time but like

448
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,400
sephiroth has the big o and the pc so what do we do they simply keep mouths for some characters

449
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,160
like cloud and tifa etc and they just like turn them off for other characters so now it's like a

450
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,200
new thing where just some characters have mouths and others don't have broken mouths they just

451
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,480
have no mouths and that's weird and doesn't seem quite right anyway anyway mods are great

452
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,560
they're uh the heroes we need in this world to save us from this hellscape of imperfect mod work

453
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,680
or imperfect developer remasters and whatnot so thank you boys and girls out there for all your

454
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:17,760
hard work i love mods right okay so this week i made gummy worms oh i saw my sweet

455
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,920
i missed it i have to go look it's so no listen i spent i said this on twitter i spent like

456
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,680
hundreds of dollars buying weird shit um right the key the key to the perfect gummy worm the

457
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:42,320
perfect keto gummy worm is iso malta oligosaccharides aka soluble soluble tapioca starch um it is a

458
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:48,080
miracle ingredient but they they they're out i bought one jug of it and i made the perfect

459
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,400
gummy worm i perfected the formula and i said i'm gonna do this for the rest of my life and then

460
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,120
i went back and the manufacturer's like now we're out now we don't make it anymore now that's there

461
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,240
it's gone i don't know i don't know i need it back i need it back listen listen i i was in

462
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,680
i was i've been like a mad scientist that all my all my roommates keep seeing me like making weird

463
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:17,440
goop in the kitchen making just cooking up some gels and jellies and slime and and and but you

464
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,240
know what they they can't argue with the results they can't argue the fact that this is not some

465
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,880
jello horseshit this is not some bullshit this is like this is this is candy like you'd buy in a

466
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,960
plastic bag on your corner store i even got i've even got the crystals i've even got the stuff

467
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,440
you know like you know you eat like a sour gummy and it's got the christly stuff yeah i've got that

468
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:46,000
i've got that stuff i made those you know what it is it's pure it's pure malic acid pure i have

469
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,360
big bags of pure crystallized acid that i eat now you can just eat it raw you can see the spoonful

470
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,480
of it if you want is it good to enjoy it well i wouldn't enjoy that much but you can you can

471
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,920
just tap tap your finger on it you just coat your finger on it and lick it off your finger

472
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,280
and it's actually kind of nice it tastes i mean it's it's very sour but it's very pleasant it's a

473
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,480
nice look at your work here it looks good did you get worm molds to do this specifically so many

474
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,240
i made like hundreds of them and i ate all of them and these were the last three that i had

475
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,640
to take a picture i was like i have to save these to take a picture with yes that was wise that's

476
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,360
wisely done but you've got the recipe now you have the secrets i've got the recipe but there's like a

477
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,360
there's like an x factor there's an x factor and that is xanthan gum because when i add xanthan gum

478
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,640
strange and mysterious things happen sometimes it like doesn't change the outcome at all other

479
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,680
times the same amount will make it like super thick like taffy like there was one time when i

480
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,600
couldn't even pour it into the molds because it was just too sticky i just had to like take a big

481
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,040
glob of it and glob it onto the mold and just kind of rest it on top of the mold and some of it sort

482
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,360
of went into the molds and then i had to just peel the entire lump off and sort of cut the worms

483
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:02,400
out of it right it was so rubbery but it was delicious it was just a taffy mass and i think

484
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,440
maybe because i i let someone else whisk at that time who's stronger than me because i'm a weak boy

485
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,720
i think maybe he just whisked it really hard and it stretched it like taffy in it and it gave it

486
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,480
that consistency um interesting anyway this has been this has been what i've been doing this week

487
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:25,440
this has been my project i succeeded um you know i am a miracle worker um yeah um every each

488
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,640
shit everyone fuck you you'll never make a gummy worm like me fascinating you you know you got me

489
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,400
beat you got me beat uh i don't know i am impressed and i see that you say here that you've invested

490
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,400
hundreds of dollars yes on all your your tinctures yes i the the commitment the oh the isomalta

491
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:49,280
oligosaccharides are pretty expensive maybe yeah how how are you supposed to mass produce these for

492
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:56,640
so cheap um i guess is it really just like a quantity makes it worth it um possibly well i mean

493
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,200
this is like because it because if i were just doing like regular gummies with sugar it's like

494
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,120
sugar and gelatin like non keto they would be much cheaper of course right right like these

495
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,160
i've been i was i was going broke bankrupting myself buying this brand at Whole Foods called

496
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,120
smart sweets and i was like i can't i can't spend four dollars a bag on these i'll be dead i will

497
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:25,440
die so i have to spend hundreds of dollars instead um um but i just looked at the ingredient list

498
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,080
and i was like hmm a lot of weird shit i don't understand on here let me just so i went on amazon

499
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,920
and on like net nettrition.com where you can buy just bulk food chemicals and i bought bags of shit

500
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,520
they ran out after after a while there i i don't know what i don't where did it go

501
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,600
how do they why do they not sell it anymore and it's not just them like every distributor i was

502
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,600
fine that sold from this i think this brand this uh uh uh fiber yum is what the brand is called i

503
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,640
think they just like died or like like stopped existing or decided like this this product

504
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,960
wasn't profitable anymore because that is the only kind is the only brand of it that i can

505
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,960
find anywhere and it disappeared and was made unavailable on every like retailer

506
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:12,400
shit man i don't know maybe it's these maybe it's these tough economic times i might be able to get

507
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,760
a powdered kind we will we will god bless we will god speed yes uh this has been ben's gummy time uh

508
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,560
please thank you thank you yeah i'm honored

509
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,880
oh that feels good one day also ben to his gummy worms i will eat your ass

510
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:42,720
i will um i will i i i will let you taste them one day one day oh yeah yeah i would love to i would

511
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,880
love to this is gonna be my thing whenever i have guests over i'm gonna be like all right welcome to

512
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,400
my house here's gummy worms i made them myself yeah i was gonna say here's happy have these gummy

513
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,160
worms and then then you eat them and it's like ha ha your keto now long got them i was gonna say

514
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:04,560
that uh there's probably some potential to like uh like selling these you know since you have such

515
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,400
labors to make them i want but it is food so maybe that's like i think i might i think i might like

516
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:17,040
get like custom molds made and make like rfck gummies you could definitely do it i could make

517
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,840
like slime corp gummies i could make uh you know i could just make slime i could just make a big

518
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:27,840
bag of like could make podrans i don't know make i would make them real sour make them real sour

519
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,800
green that's all super cool i love it i think it'd be pretty i think that'd be pretty fun and you

520
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,520
know now that you've devised the alchemical circle necessary to summon them from hell

521
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,920
it's the possibilities are endless it would probably much like the war selling them such a

522
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,160
thing would probably be really hard i would probably have to get like licenses i'd probably

523
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,040
have to get like my kitchen surveyed by the fda which like it certainly wouldn't pass because

524
00:51:53,040 --> 00:52:00,320
it's filthy um right but you know whatever perfect environment for worms to grow filthy delicious

525
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,840
delicious well that's it that's my gummy story i will eat your ass your wealth your wealth good

526
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,560
i look forward to trying some one day when i'm in the neighborhood

527
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:20,400
yeah or maybe you can sell them at the next radcon i will give them away for free much like our

528
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,720
uh put them in um the piece of cany's could we could we get away with making them like backer

529
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:32,400
rewards you know food seems like i mean i think you the only way to do it would probably be to

530
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,960
give them away for free because i think if you charge them you open yourself up to like some

531
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:43,120
kind of i wonder if like um if like Kickstarter would be like please don't make your backer

532
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:49,760
rewards like food like please don't send food in the mail yeah we will be i mean if i can uh what

533
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:59,280
was it the the drill andrew hussey kasey something kasey yeah those guys a collaboration like sweet

534
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:06,080
bro and hella jeff the book came with a backer reward which is you get hot sauce it you get a

535
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,640
bottle of hot sauce i didn't get that one because i didn't want a hot sauce i thought maybe that would

536
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:19,200
be sketchy but yeah apparently people had it wasn't bad they said it was food was it did it i'll

537
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,120
believe it did they just bottle it themself did it come with like a nutrition information and like

538
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:28,080
like you know labeled for retail sale and whatever i i don't know i think it may have been just a

539
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:35,040
funny meme bottle with like lol it's it's food it's sauce let me let me look this up

540
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,560
well that is dope because we've talked about the possibility we've talked about me and once

541
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:48,400
you talked about making fuck energy uh yeah but like and i looked a little bit into like how you

542
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,920
would do it like you there are machines that you use to do like the canning they're very expensive

543
00:53:53,920 --> 00:54:02,160
obviously and like i i assume they would i can't when i when i consider when i consider what it

544
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:08,400
must take to like get your shit approved and like get them onto like store shelves um it sounds it's

545
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,040
it's you know it's probably probably take years i wouldn't be surprised if it would take years

546
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,400
all right here's the bottle um i think this is the entire label this is for the high rollers

547
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:27,920
out there exclusive premium gourmet barbecue sauce sweet brown and hella juicy yeah dinner

548
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:35,920
flavored sauce dinner flavored sauce looks normal it looks normal ingredients it is 100

549
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:44,640
sauce i would use that i would definitely use that uh maybe maybe because it's not

550
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,520
considered like intended that you probably put a thing like not intended to be consumed like not

551
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,880
a nutritional supplement or you know some shit like that i don't know maybe maybe something like

552
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:02,320
that would get you past the guards either way this sounds awesome and i want them all uh in my

553
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,920
mouth and stomach it sounds like i should have i should have backed i should have backed the

rumble we need an actual fucking royal rumble at radcon with a wrestling ring i want munchie to put

560
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:57,440
me through a table like let's let's make it happen we've got boys with some wrestling experience

561
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,520
but with that i mean jesse that time he jumped on a table and broke it wait was that video was that

562
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:11,120
in um plebe and the weeb yeah did that did that right yeah that's the radcon to plebe and weeb

563
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,280
stuff i think that was the last episode when they the last episode where they trashed everything

564
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:22,000
and it was very confusing was this did this i'm and you were there i wasn't there i think somebody

565
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,320
broke a sword who broke the sword i don't know it's been a while i always forget like which of the

566
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,400
plebe and the weeb content got released and like i feel like some of it like never got out or like

567
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,560
was still like premium content or something there i mean i think it was all released okay i think

568
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,120
you're you might be thinking of like the whole blu-ray debacle about how they oh and there was a

569
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,400
second season promised that was not filmed or like i think they tried and it got like the

570
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,800
footage didn't work or something there were issues right so um one day one day hopefully uh we'll see

571
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:01,040
that happen uh don't hold your breath boys and girls um i do remember jesse going through the

572
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,440
table i he did it like twice right because he's like oh the first one wasn't good i have to jump

573
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:11,360
through the table again it looked like it really hurt he seemed to be in like very brave way afterwards

574
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,200
yeah you got to like dead in your nerves to be able to endure uh such such blows

575
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:25,360
listen i am weak if we do a live royal rumble we so we have to build we have to build a platform

576
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,320
i will get in there i will cower i will go down in one punch i will i will crack fall uh i will

577
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,720
you know sure but i'll but i'll be but i'll make it funny like i'll just i'll make i'll be like a

578
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,880
joke character i feel like the joke wrestler who goes in there just i don't know whether you're

579
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:49,200
aware but um germa who was the original royal rumble with stupid characters guy the already has

580
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:56,000
done a live action royal rumble where he and a bunch of people act out uh him and and you know all

581
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,320
of his stupid characters beating the shit out of each other on a real wrestling ring and it was

582
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:06,000
really funny but obviously extremely difficult and expensive to to make let me see what kind of

583
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,960
venue they're in here it's it's technically doable i mean we'd need a lot okay they got a whole

584
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,040
facility yeah yeah i mean a whole bunch of people to do it this is the sort of thing that we could

585
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,520
make a stretch goal on a kickstarter for rad gun five or something but it would be like

586
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:27,680
in of itself this would be like i don't know like a five ten k kind of price point to rent out a venue

587
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,640
get all the costumes get like the production stuff up i don't know big productions doable

588
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:39,040
i do let's let's just tone it down let's just do a street yeah right well we'll buy some knives

589
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:44,880
we'll kill each other now that that's something i'm down for uh i would love to do that uh there's

590
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,920
only six of us though so maybe we could maybe we need guests to come in we gotta get uh fit

591
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,720
flying out there we gotta we gotta get all all of the all of the guests and all of the voice

592
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:01,200
grail voice jail people oh for the villains and heroes yeah that's a great idea let's get

593
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:07,040
fuck die buster in there so i can fucking kill die buster fuck die buster that sounds great

594
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:16,320
oh you know uh speaking of physical activity and whatnot you know fit i you maybe you didn't

595
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,520
see this but i when i was in hawaii most recently visiting my girlfriend's parents i finally did

596
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:27,760
the thing i've been wanting to do which is go surfing i did it in real life and was super fun

597
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,920
and i absolutely loved it and every day more than missing the ocean i miss specifically being able

598
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,760
to surf which i now want to make my life's purpose uh because it is a better way to be alive than

599
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,200
being a piece of shit landlubber or any of that stupid shit yeah man first of all i'm curious

600
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,560
as a as a floridian do you spend much time in the ocean around the ocean on the beach

601
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:56,560
or do you find yourself you know mostly just doing land type activities um well i'm kind of biased

602
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:04,320
because i live on an island you do oh shit that's right that's right i'm i'm one block away from the

603
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:10,240
beach usually yeah when there's not a worldwide pandemic i'm there like right four times a week

604
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:16,880
and something because i'm on the golf side the surf it only like happens we only get like good

605
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,560
surf waves like twice a month so like i always am watching the beach cam and if i see some good waves

606
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:27,520
i drop what i'm doing and i head out there like instantly oh that's the surfing lifestyle man

607
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:35,440
it's a better lifestyle one i want to be a part of uh unironically uh i don't know i i talked about

608
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,640
this like months ago when i when i did this but like i like i've been skateboarding for last like

609
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,760
i don't know year or two or whatever and those skills applied perfectly to surfing basically

610
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:54,640
same same kind of shit and uh it really just feels better than just not doing that to be doing it

611
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,320
and like feel the momentum i don't know i feel like you're tapping into like a primal

612
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:06,400
aspect of like a human psyche that just loves to move fast and do cool shit yeah and it's i think

613
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:12,720
a big part of it is that it's mother nature that's getting you to go this fast it's a force that you

614
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:20,400
cannot control you can only go with it you know it's exactly true it's it's sort of like a feeling

615
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:28,720
of sliding down a hill really fast on a toboggan or something yeah it is like that true and i only

616
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:35,040
went the one time but i did manage to catch some waves on my first outing surfing then and it was

617
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:41,520
awesome and you know it actually reminded me of as you said like it's a natural force that's doing

618
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,880
this shit um yeah i felt like it reminded me of the time when in my last apartment here in

619
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:53,600
Cincinnati when the street was just flooding and i was completely powerless if the rain just kept

620
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,560
coming it would have submerged my apartment and the basement was already flooded and there was

621
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:04,240
a car down the street that was 100% immersed underwater and that car is definitely in the

622
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:11,200
trash right now and i would just i in that case i was terrified and felt helpless and like i was

623
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:19,120
going to die uh but when you're surfing it's like you feel i don't know like uh like you're using

624
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:24,960
this force for good it's like weaponizing the thickness of the wave for the forces of good or

625
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:34,400
something like that right right and uh i don't know the other thing is i've never seen a surfer

626
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,880
who isn't hot so i think that's just another real benefit you will be a hot person if you surf

627
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,400
regularly and also you know i'm thinking of moving to virginia pretty soon and they you know they got

628
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,640
they got summers they got waves virginia beach is right in the ocean so like i could potentially

629
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,280
go surfing in the summer or whatever but you can't surf that's one part of the year i don't know

630
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,320
i don't you can't do it it's impossible there are no waves there is a surfing ability in virginia

631
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,760
beach i looked into it a little bit but as you said like like fit over here is talking about like

632
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,080
once or twice a month the potential is there to go surfing this is like there's a block of time during

633
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,960
the year like one month or two months out of the year where potentially that might be the case

634
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,400
that there's like decent waves sometimes the month but that is just a very limited time

635
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:29,440
and you can hardly define your life around that sort of shit or live the sexy surfing lifestyle

636
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,400
of exactly as you said dropping whatever you're doing and going to surf which you know in hawaii

637
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:41,680
is like massive culture out there and i want to be a part of that it seems like a good way to live

638
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,080
i want to do something that's more interesting than just going to the gym and lifting weights

639
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:52,320
because that's on the schedule i want to actually kind of be excited to go do so because jesus christ

640
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:58,160
the workout i got i surfed for like three or four hours or something and it was like probably the

641
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:04,160
most intense workout i've gotten of like my upper body just paddling out and out and out

642
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:10,320
and killing my arms hurt so fucking bad the next day uh point is this is a great workout great

643
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:16,960
exercise and you just are a cool person uh when you do it so it's all benefit and uh i want i want

644
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:22,240
to do it more that's that's the point of what i'm saying right now good man good man yeah it's good

645
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:30,000
for the body it's good for the soul yep yep never we've never done it i'll become a master ben

646
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,520
and then you can double board with me we'll go out there t-bap lives again rides again rides again

647
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:49,360
on the waves sounds fun sounds fun um all right well that's that's all the shit i had to say

648
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,040
you guys got more you want to talk about or we certainly can go to voicemails if you want to

649
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,760
i'm ready for voicemails yeah i'm down for whatever i got a bunch of them so we can we can

how can you see

661
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,960
yeah

662
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:38,080
well i i mean i guess i could probably take a picture but i have like so many black roses now

663
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,880
i have excellent infinite of them i gave them i was playing with a

664
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,800
kazzie yesterday and i gave i put a bunch of pink and blacks on her island because she wanted them

i have i have them to spare now i'm i'm excellent i don't even want my pinks i have them by accident

666
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:02,480
i do need i have a bunch of purples but it's not enough it's not even close um yeah uh uh

667
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,040
oh man i went to another island i went to a separate island from one of

668
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:12,480
kazzie's friends and i saw what a five star island looks like and i realized what does it

669
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:18,880
look like amazing and like imagine like everything like the entire island like cobblestone with like

670
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:26,960
little like parks and like pathways and little like gardens like just immaculate um i did hit

671
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,840
three stars the other day so i did unlock the thing so i've been making paths and feel much

672
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,080
better about my life and it really goes a long way so that's an improvement i gotta move some

673
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:42,720
shit around you know i feel like i've been unambitious um you know lots of flowers is

674
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,920
fine but like you gotta you gotta arrange them you gotta put them in just the right place for

675
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,480
them to really be worth anything um you know uh it's sunday morning the day we record this

676
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,600
i was awake and i totally forgot but i happened to be wandering around doing my daily rounds

677
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:07,680
i found that little stock motherfucker yes a little piggy-wiggy yeah and i bought 200 000 uh

678
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:15,040
dollars worth of turnips for there were 92 bells each that's pretty i feel will give a great return

679
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:23,440
on investment i i forgot this week last week i bought 500k worth and i had a spike i it wasn't

680
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:28,560
as big as the last time i i was on like the last time i sold at like 400 it was amazing

681
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,520
this time i sold it like at like 200 something so it was still pretty good so what what should i

682
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:41,360
aim for if i see like a 200 or a 300 one day i mean to jump on that well yes but there's

683
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:49,040
okay should i just give like the full explanation of how it works right now yes the yeah all right

684
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,200
here's here's everything everything you need to know everything you need to know about uh uh

685
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,640
turnips and the stock market um you will like you know you buy them at whatever price it's

686
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:04,720
usually around 100 and then in on any given week there will be one of four patterns that occurs

687
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:12,320
it will either be random or it will be um a just a steady decline or it will be a small spike or

688
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:18,640
a large spike and there's a there's a website called turnip profit as in p-r-o-p-h-e-t you can

689
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,120
type you if you're checking your numbers consistently you can put in like what are they

690
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,400
throughout the week you need to check twice a day and if you do that this algorithm will predict it

691
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,120
will like read it and be like okay this is the pattern you're on and it will predict like what

692
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:39,680
your turnip prices are likely to be and if you're on a spike week it will tell you okay it will peak

693
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:45,520
here like here's when it will peak this is when you should sell because like the the the the the

694
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:51,600
small spike is like four rising prices that go up to like somewhere around 200 and then they drop

695
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,480
off the large spike is two rising prices and then the third one is like a big spike and then after

696
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,920
that it goes down so sometimes you might see a good price like if you're on us if you're on like a

697
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,720
if you're on like a large spike the price might go up and it might be kind of good

698
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:12,160
but then if that third spike is about to happen it will like skyrocket so like if it's more it's

699
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,360
if you want to really maximize it it's not about just like sell at this point you got to like

700
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:23,360
know what trajectory you're on and know like how yeah just just use turnip profit it'll it'll

701
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,880
it'll pretty much predicted for you most of this is my first week doing it i want that money back

702
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,120
i want to return on investment so i'm gonna do that i'm gonna track it get on turnip profit

703
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,360
commit to checking prices twice a day put in the numbers it will predict you you'll see it you'll

704
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,160
see it the first question it has here is is this your first time buying and the answer is yes this

705
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:50,720
is my first time i think on the first time you buy it's guaranteed to be a certain pattern i don't

706
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,640
know which one but i think that's it because otherwise there's like a probability of which

707
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,960
pattern it's going to be and it's affected by like what did you have last week because like it's

708
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:05,120
unlike you're less likely to get the same pattern twice in a row okay okay um we'll see so that's

709
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,680
that's my primer on that the long story short just use turnip profit

710
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,640
i definitely will uh for this time see how it goes all right well good uh that's settled hopefully

711
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,840
you will be a smart investor ladies and gentlemen out there in youtube land uh but let's go on to the

712
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:27,680
rest of our voicemails speak pipe link down below and uh let's see what the people have to say

713
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:32,720
we've got like 10 or 11 or something today we'll just motor on through them as fast as we please

714
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:39,360
god uh they were they were quality uh in general i can't speak for them uh you know one was just

715
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,920
saying like yay fit is on happy happy joy and i was like that's good but i get the idea and i

716
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:51,040
don't need to play this whole thing uh so the rest are all very critical of fit the rest are very

717
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:59,520
negative very nice very nice um uh they're like no i'm the oldest anarchy server in minecraft

718
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,200
it's me sir you're stealing my my crown all right all right let's hear this first one this is simply

719
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:20,800
from why why why are the ads for mobile games so bad like it's clearly not even the game that

720
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:30,320
they're advertising i don't understand what the fuck was that okay i know what he's talking about

721

any all i can say the mafia city ads are fucking kino have you have you actually like

722
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:46,960
watched the montages they're incredible man i'm all about that afk arena no that is good share

723
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:54,640
i'm getting a lot of ads for afk arena uh i mean they are because mobile games are bad

724
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:00,720
across the board none of them are good we all know that when you say it's a good mobile game

725
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,720
you're talking about in the context of mobile games which are all bad like when i did my ad for

726
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:11,680
that game whatever it was that i played the other day for whatever we agile episode that was that

727
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:19,040
game was fine uh i can't even remember it was it was fine it was just a spin-off of concolay or like

730
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,760

we got tectonic improv go so you guys like fully cooly right and nate did that video on lucifer and

757
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:45,840
the biscuit hammer um i have a question what in the hell is a biscuit hammer the reason i bring

758
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,240
up fully cooly is because the pillows obviously did the soundtrack to that and they have a song

759
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:56,720
called biscuit hammer but it came out in like 2002 or something and then lucifer and the biscuit

760
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:01,680
hammer came out in 2005 so what's the connection here because i tried looking it up and i couldn't

761
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:07,840
get anything i only got like stuff on lucifer and the biscuit hammer is it like like an actual hammer

762
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,480
that you use to like make biscuits with or something i have no fucking clue what this is can you guys help

763
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:19,920
me uh this is you know i hear people ask questions about this sometimes or be confused very simple

764
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,760
answer it's just that lucifer and the biscuit hammer is it just it does what jojo does jojo

765
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,880
just names things after albums or songs or whatever lucifer the biscuit hammer just named a bunch of

766
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:37,440
stuff after pillows songs uh that's that's that's that's a full extent okay follow up question is

767
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,880
why is there a pillow song called biscuit hammer i was gonna i wish i knew the answer to that

768
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:49,360
alas i do not i don't know since it's this uh an original song and songs mean you know usually

769
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,880
do this don't mean anything there's titles that is yeah like you could just be like hey what if

770
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,240
like there was a hammer specifically for smashing biscuits that'd be funny

771
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,840
i'm going to genius page on internet it's all in japanese though i somebody translated it

772
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,720
i'm sure there's some meaning i'm sure some simple googling would would determine the origin of this

773
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:16,320
but i don't know how they translate japanese people will will have a lot to do with it

774
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,480
maybe it means something else i don't know because biscuit means something in america and the uk

775
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,480
that's true that's what you call cookies maybe in japan maybe in japan it's something else

776
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,600
you know which even we know that there's two definitions of the word biscuit at least between

777
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,640
our two countries or whatever which one are these japanese individuals using i don't know is it a

778
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:44,080
cookie or is it a kentucky southern biscuit kind of thing yeah getting the gravy and whatnot i don't

779
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:50,960

821
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:23,440
one i have one particular i'm like i'm very picky about my rain sounds because if like it's too muddled

822
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:28,640
or like if there's thunder or if like it's yeah i have to be able to hear the individual drops

823
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:36,480
if like the drops have to be heavy or it's worthless so you know i got mine here under

824
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,560
particularly too yeah like a like a rain sound that it's like hitting a tarp and it's going

825
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,680
this is it this this is the one this is the one this is the sound of my life

826
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:52,800
except no substitutes okay cool cool i'll i'll listen to it i know that feel although the sound

827
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,040
of rain on a tarp does take me back to my boy scout days when i heard a lot of that and it was a

828
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:01,760
very relaxing time i think i would enjoy rain on a tarp sounds if they aren't too well they will

829
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,960
there at it there you go she's flashing oh wait this isn't a tent oh okay okay he's gotta be on a

831
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,200

how long they were watched for right like those types of videos were like insane for growth but

837
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,080
yeah it's not the same anymore our lecturers would have done even better in those days but

838
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:01,120
they still do very good oh man five hours imagine or imagine uploading like a 10 hour like a 10

839
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:07,520
hour like rain video you put ad breaks every like 15 minutes it gets millions of views yeah yeah

840
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,000
generates hundreds of dollars in revenue every single day that's the good shit people wouldn't

841
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,920
stand for ad breaks maybe like text ads oh they'll stand for it oh they'll watch what i tell you

842
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,920
they might it depends on the algorithm would force it in front of them right the whole point of an asmr

843
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:29,840
like two thing that happened like interrupt like hey you buy a product okay yes that's what i want

844
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:36,080
listen they'll do an advertisement asmr just like constant advertisements like layered on top of

845
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,720
each other reverbed not a bad idea appreciate although you know they will they will watch the

846
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:46,960
ads to support me the creator one person comes to mind i think her name's gb asmr she's she's

847
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:52,320
very well known one of the famous people who does it and uh i think she does a thing called sponsored

848
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:58,160
saturday which basically just means it's a whatever normal asmr video but at the beginning

849
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:03,760
she doesn't add but she just does it talking softly about whatever she has to say for the ad

850
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:09,120
and it it doesn't break the you know it works it works just fine for for listening to person talk

851
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,640
the you know i've been thinking recently the thing that annoys me the most about asmr is

852
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,520
i don't know because i mostly listen to people talking specifically i prefer the male voice i

853
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:28,800
find it relaxing and it's they they really are just fill in time man they will just find words

854
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:34,400
to say and they will just say those words and it is annoying i wish that there was a little more

855
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:41,360
substance to what people are saying the amount of like filler content that is stuffed in there

856
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:47,040
just to justify the runtime you know it's the game they're playing so i get it but when someone's

857
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:55,840
has said in 10 different ways like how i can't even think of of anything specific like you are

858
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:04,080
like a beautiful majestic creature and like everything is good and nothing is bad and they

859
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:10,160
just go on loops well it makes you feel better in like 20 years they're gonna have like ai

860
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:16,960
generated asmr and all the problems are gonna go away nate it's gonna be fantastic as will we

861
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,920
as we're phased out as a species and i look forward to it i can't wait for the ai generated

862
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,920
youtubers who have ai generated drama with other ai generated youtube

863
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:36,400
that's exciting stuff all right let's go on to our next voicemail but by the way two other albums

864
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:42,240
that are great go listen to you these are also famous mu core loveless by my bloody valentine

865
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:49,680
the essential shoegaze album give it a listen you probably love it and also prince's gold experience

866
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:57,760
yes it is le jo jo reference you are welcome uh great album great album more voice all right

867
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:06,080
yes all right here we go here we go this one is simply titled escape the voice jail all right go

868
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,760
it's been one week since i've been imprisoned in the voice jail for crimes against die buster

869
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:18,160
or not if i got this recording in too late it's been rough every time it's warden nate best

870
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,720
been shift he calls me dumb and gay which is really messed up because i'm not even gay

871
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:28,960
it's okay though i find solace in the dramatic irony of nate saying we'll never hear from fuck

872
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:34,160
die buster again and then immediately playing my next voicemail it gets me through the day

873
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:39,840
that and warden hypocrite the only member clever enough to see through my disguise and not altering

874
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:46,480
my monotone at all it gives me crayons and we doodle together chill dude can't say the same for the

875
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:51,840
rest of the wardens though then saint has been trying to convert me to communism indigibro keeps

876
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:59,200
placing me on various charts bad autism going insane in here need to break out nate i can't

877
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:05,680
believe you would give him there is a core the suck core yeah playing the satisfaction of playing

878
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:12,320
his his his male nate it's supposed to be that's true and that he's solitary that's true that's true

879
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:18,640
but i find this to be something to live for he what see what's the point of imprisoning someone

880
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:25,680
in the voice jail if not to have his story be available to others as a cautionary tale so his

881
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:30,800
suffering soft is being put on display so others can learn you think so remember what he said about

882
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:36,080
die buster he said he said he didn't like that's a bad thing he said i don't like that themes were bad

883
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:41,600
no that is a criminal offense you're absolutely right about that okay i will live and learn uh

884
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:50,080
forgive me let's try uh okay hey some helpful notes uh more cruelty less mercy less forgiveness uh

885
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:58,880
right okay okay uh relevant male here i think i like asmr now no what that's the voicemail

886
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:04,400
that's the name of the voicemail okay let's hear what he has to say so i never understood

887
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:11,520
nate's love for asmr i always thought it was weird and creepy and yeah his love for it was

888
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:19,680
probably sexual in nature yeah but i recently fell down a youtube rabbit hole of this channel

889
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:28,240
called cracking the cryptic in which a very nice and calm british man solves really hard

890
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:34,480
sudoku puzzles and all you hear is his nice calming voice and the quiet clicking of his

891
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:40,560
mouse as he gets more and more excited about finishing a sudoku puzzle over the course of

892
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:47,120
30 minutes or so and it's awesome so shout out to cracking the cryptic and also i i guess i'm a

893
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:53,120
freak who likes asmr now that's fucked up that's not asmr that's just a quiet man that's just a

894
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:58,480
bob ross asmr yeah like would you classify bob ross people say that all the time like a person

895
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:04,000
who is not shouting constantly i someone who is not usually a youtuber on youtube must be the bob

896
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:11,920
ross of whatever they're doing look asmr is different but a little bit like sexuality in that

897
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:18,000
you can be doing nothing or just standing there and someone can just find that attractive or

898
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,400
arousing or whatever like it could just be like your voice or something about you or it doesn't

899
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,560
have to be a person it could be anything um you know some drawing or art or whatever that you didn't

900
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:33,520
intend to be that way but people just interpret it that way so like what is bob ross asmr most people

901
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:40,000
believe that he is but like that wasn't the point um no that that has to be a fringe opinion

902
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:48,480
bob ross i mean i'm not saying he's a paint man he is a paint man i would never say that like he

903
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:54,080
was an intentional asmr guy but i just think that like nobody you don't get the head thing

904
01:31:54,080 --> 01:32:00,640
about from bob ross nobody does it's impossible i mean i never have either but still i find it

905
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:05,040
relaxing to listen to it seems like it i don't know i don't think that being relaxing to listen to

906
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:11,680
makes it asmr i don't know it's just a definitional it just sounds like this guy's trying to commit

907
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,000
honorable sudoku and that's what his channel is about

908
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:22,720
oh wait wait if you go through i really like sudoku i'm i'm really into sudoku there was a

909
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:30,400
there's a video like i made where it's like a sudoku with only four numbers huh and uh there

910
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,920
was some stipulations like the the night's move like a number could not be in an l shape to the

911
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,880
same number and the center square had to be a magic square where each row had to add up to the

912
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,480
same number and diagonal and stuff it was like using those stipulations it was actually possible

913
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:52,640
and i paused the video at the beginning and i figured out quite a lot of it i ended up failing

914
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:56,880
because i missed something halfway i couldn't remember where but it was so fun like i would get

915
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:03,760
stuck and be like oh dang it i clicked back on the guy and he's like hmm well well because this

916
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:08,880
and this and this therefore this and that and i'm like wow yeah yeah he's so smart now i'm smart

917
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:14,880
because i learned from him oh my god i see there's a comment on that rain video this guy says i

918
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,800
like this one because i can clearly hear the raindrops it's not blurred into white noise there

919
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:28,000
you go cj wonder struck 25 gets me i'm not the only one you know this this just reminds me that

920
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,960
the other day in my nuzlocke i was playing poke no i keep thinking pokeball flip but it's voltorb

921
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:41,520
flip the whatever the fuck it is oh shit i've got a video playing stop stop anyway voltorb flip is

922
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:51,840
the most brain breaking uh ahego inducing uh dojin you know mind break experience in any pokemon

923
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:59,760
game and i i'm way too stupid to do it reliably and eventually i got better but it was kind of

924
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,920
a nightmare and that game is bad and basically what i'm saying is i don't enjoy logic puzzles

925
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:11,440
because they're too hard and i'm stupid and that's just the fact jack damn there you go love logic

926
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:17,200
i'm so fucking smart i put a number in the right way so many things in your head i can't do it

927
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:21,840
you have to know like oh because this probability exists here there's like a probability cloud

928
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,320
that it now exists and there's like a totally separate probability cloud and you have to recognize

929
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:32,400
where those things intersect in logic brain functions and it's too hard i can't do it

930
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:38,080
nice my brain works very well i mean in sudoku at least period end of sentence there's there's a

931
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:44,400
few things where it's like sometimes i'm like i've got a lot of uh like things filled in but

932
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:49,200
there's like one number i can't i need this number to figure out everything else and so i try so

933
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:55,840
hard to find this number and in order to do it i need to like say okay so i do like a hypothesis

934
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,000
a hypothetical situation if the seven is here right that means the seven can't be here which means

935
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,680
the seven can't be there which means the seven can't be there which means that needs to be a six

936
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,400
this needs to be a five and that doesn't work so i have to go all the way back and put the seven in

937
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:14,880
the other spot and then it works and it's it's fun i it's really fun i get so scared physically

938
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:20,640
terrified of all the like maybes and i can't keep track of all the things that are definite versus

939
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:26,800
like probable versus we don't know oh god that's what the little notes are in sudoku where you put

940
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:33,680
the little number yeah you're right you're right possible it's too scary i'm already scared just

941
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,920
thinking about it all right well if you like it go check out crapton the cryptic everybody

942
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:44,880
all right next voicemail is called ellie is our fix it take it away i don't know if the last voicemail

943
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,800
sent about this topic uh went through because the uploading was kind of weird but anyways i'm just

944
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:54,480
going to speak fast to make for it uh so ellie's are the editor of the pcp fucked up in last week's

945
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:59,360
episode because he has a timestamp of this in the description there's a part talking about the final

946
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,280
seven spells that was a voicemail that i sent and then right after nate talks about his fucking

947
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:07,760
pokemon streams because there's another voicemail talking about these pokemon streams and he fucking

948
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:13,920
flipped the goddamn voicemail audio uh so it's like wrong they have the wrong reaction to each of

949
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:23,520
those two voicemails ellie's are you cuck idiot fix this oh man rest in peace ellie's are oh god

950
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:30,000
we're in the chat ellie's are typing right now oh no he just says the fuck that guy is what he

951
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:39,600
says in the chat i'm just gonna ask him is this accurate either way don't care pussy bitch

952
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:47,440
i think um even if this guy is an accurate i like i think it was it was true and ellie's are

953
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:52,480
noticed it in the the comments of the video and somebody said it and he replied like um

954
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:59,920
that was just the order that they came in which says to me that he didn't listen to it so it's

955
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:05,120
still a bad it does that's no excuse that's no excuse and i think we're gonna have to lash

956
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:09,840
we're gonna have to bring out the whip this time oh my god fucking ellie's are he is saying it's

957
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:17,520
true but i put them in the order that you sent me do your job ellie's are uh listen to the episode

958
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:23,680
bro okay but this is one minor flaw in a stellar history of ellie's are editing work so who could

959
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:29,040
be who could be too mad but hopefully he knows it could be uh they could be out of order on occasion

960
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:36,400
all right next one we got oh yes excellent uh we've got i'll die groveling

961
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:42,160
begs and pleads for mercy that is the full title okay let's hear what he has to say go

962
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,040
me a little less than a year ago i'm working the hustle making an amv i think hey i could

963
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:52,240
advertise it in a voicemail why not oh overstepped my bounds got sent straight to voice jail that's

964
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:57,600
okay i can respect it's reasonable but what's not reasonable is that like two weeks ago you sent

965
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:03,280
someone who thinks that die buster is shit in there and listen i love die buster that's the

966
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:08,960
problem i can't stand it in here anymore i've done my time now it the punishment far outweighs the

967
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:13,440
crime at this point you may i she's my favorite fucking director i can't i can't be seen in the

968
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:21,600
same list of names as this creature i gotta get out of here please please first of all his name is

969
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:29,760
surumaki who directed fully coolly and fucking uh die buster so oh embarrassing embarrassing moment

970
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,560
right there truly a bra moment um he may she wasn't maybe he was involved maybe he was like

971
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:40,320
producer or something i don't fucking know uh okay but but ben what do you think do we have any

972
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:46,080
policy for forgiveness or allowing people to come back into a polite society after they've been so

973
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:52,080
excoriated for such a long time i think ben's muted so he might not answer this so give

974
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:58,640
any any feelings about the should we forgive those who are repentant after some period of time

975
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:04,400
nah you don't get out of jail by just saying please let me out please that's not our words okay but

976
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:10,080
normally with jail there is like a time you you go in for a certain number not this is this is this

977
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:15,600
is the worst jail of all it's a meritocracy you have to be cool enough to get out that's i

978
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,880
suppose yeah you have to not just say i'm sad that i'm here with fuck die buster uh even though i

979
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:27,120
fuck up the director in bed truly embarrassing um you have to in fact just give us something cool

980
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:31,600
and then perhaps you could be saved like your old i'll die corporation stuff that we all enjoyed

981
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,960
but then that's funny he made a bunch of great voicemails we'd made one minor infraction after

982
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:43,120
contributing to the show and forever is in jail and there's no hope of redemption uh unless

983
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:48,320
uh who knows who knows maybe one day maybe one day all right anyway let's let's just move on to

984
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:57,920
our next one we have the notorious f a g calling with a voicemail let's hear away i'm back what did

985
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,480
i miss oh yeah yeah okay bed you can weigh in quickly let him uh did you hear the voicemail

986
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:09,920
did you hear that um no mercy no i did hear no mercy no no mercy but do you have any thoughts

987
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:19,040
on an eventual potential redemption plan for anyone in voice jail um he uh um no no never

988
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:26,640
okay no no one we're all clear understood understood uh has there ever been anyone who

989
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:32,240
has left voice only way to get wait the yeah i think someone went from voice i think someone

990
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:36,800
did voice grail or maybe the other way around but like it didn't we say i know the other way you

991
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:44,240
are in you can sacrifice your voice grail status to rescue someone from voice jail right oh so you

992
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:49,200
know who would ever do for leet strats you know what if you were if tactically i'll die you could

993
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:55,760
have someone else uh like call in work with them on a production to make it good so that they get

994
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:01,760
into voice grail and then they could use their status now as part of the voice grail to to free

995
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:06,240
you or you could just use them as a patsy you know to get uh to get the name on the on the board

996
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:11,440
and they could use that there's one plan do with it what you will all right anyway let's listen to

997
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:19,200
the norious notorious fag i've been dying to hear from all right go hey pcp the notorious fag here

998
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:27,440
so how do you guys feel about the fact that my little pony is on the official evil lineup

999
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:31,920
also what are your thoughts in general about them fighting herbs

1000
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:39,680
and if you haven't seen it's a pretty cool fighting game i recommend that a lot sure yeah yeah yeah

1001
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,120
um yeah i know i know about them fighting anyway this is i have no opinion i don't know how to end

1002
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:52,800
this i don't know how to end this shut up just stop that doesn't know um wait wait so okay yeah go on

1003
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:58,720
so what was that about like my little pony is the official evil list line okay first of all if you

1004
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:04,080
don't know what evo is oh he's like the biggest yeah the biggest fighting game way event so he's

1005
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:09,360
oh evo so he's saying that them's fighting herds is an evo okay but but hang on like the i played

1006
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:15,600
this because there was an interesting thing i went to the evo website and looked at the games

1007
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:21,440
first of all it's not among the games being played at evo so i don't know what that's about and

1008
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:27,600
second of all at the top of the thing it says evo 2020 has been canceled so double

1009
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:36,800
not happening wait hold on i just found something posted three days ago that says evo 2020 will be

1010
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:43,600
all online features four new games and it's this says one of them is uh uh them's fighting herds

1011
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:49,520
well shit i guess they're just main website hasn't been updated which is their fault not mine

1012
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:57,120
but uh okay how cool how long ago did they say it's canceled this update you know it doesn't say

1013
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:02,000
exactly when this was posted uh i mean probably the last you know month or two i don't know um

1014
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:08,240
even maybe this happened like yesterday or something i don't know i mean there's not

1015
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:13,040
much to think about it them's fighting herds was like it used to be a my little pony fan game and

1016
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:18,400
then yeah hasbro said no you can't do that and so it became an independent project and now it's just

1017
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,960
about animals beating the shit out of each other designed by lauren fast which is pretty cool yeah

1018
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:28,080
and it's like it's a it's a cute little game and i i don't know it looks all right the like it being

1019
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:37,200
in evo means very little um i agree i mean i guess it means it's got a like community around it and

1020
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:42,800
it's considered to be like balanced enough that it's a it's a worthwhile game to compete at so good

1021
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:50,000
i guess i i guess i think it's cool smash bros melee is it in that list of added games because

1022
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,200
i'm still pissed that melee has been removed from evo which is by far the game i'm most interested

1023
01:43:55,200 --> 01:44:00,720
in fuck modern smash don't care melee is way more interesting to me i mean i don't follow it follow

1024
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:08,480
any esports at all but that seems strange because it's so big isn't it melee still uh yeah at least

1025
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:13,600
maybe i'm like not in the scene and it actually is just like a vocal minority group or something

1026
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,480
but to me it seemed like the most popular fighting game like period except maybe for like street

1027
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:24,000
fighters and maybe modern i think maybe i'm incorrect on this didn't they get like pressure from

1028
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:30,480
nintendo to drop melee at evo i think there was some something like that going on keeps selling that

1029
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:36,640
game and i think it was a big issue for the evo staff because you needed like the crt televisions

1030
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:42,880
or whatever and they were fucking heavy to like take in and out maybe if they hit the gym instead

1031
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:48,640
of their pillow with virgin rage every night then they could lift those crt tvs and it wouldn't be

1032
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:53,920
an issue plus if it got added i'm curious how they'll do it because there's no net play on the

1033
01:44:53,920 --> 01:45:00,640
game cube so they'd have to use an emulator right that is true which could introduce concerns and

1034
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:06,000
issues and yeah you know okay okay but but they only did the online thing recently they cancelled

1035
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,480
it i think like last year is when they announced it before we knew any of this online stuff you

1036
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:16,480
know those concerns are reasonable they cancelled having to use special technical stuff uh yeah

1037
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:21,520
yeah it was like months and months ago why why was it cancelled i think some other i mean maybe

1038
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:26,240
because of fitz reason i a lot of people were wondering that i think i saw a video talking

1039
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:33,200
about it um i can't remember exactly but it was just sort of like management is bad evo bad

1040
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:39,760
you know there are reasonable concerns like technically like he was saying and if nintendo

1041
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:45,280
is like breathing down your neck about it i mean they should have no right whatsoever but excuse me

1042
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:52,800
that was uh e3 i think so it was it was some big thing that nobody cares about anymore that sounds

1043
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:59,520
like e3 definitely all right we've got one last voicemail we might as well get to and this is um

1044
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:07,280
riddle my ass batman i r l okay take it away my my hero my favorite he's back baby okay

1045
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,320

1046
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:19,120
