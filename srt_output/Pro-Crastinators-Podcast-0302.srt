1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Man, I have no idea what I'm going to talk about. But whatever.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well hey, isn't it AntonyLingland this weekend? Is that going on? Have you heard anything?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It is. Yeah, I've been there.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh, you were there?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've been there a couple of times, yeah.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, shit.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, Kazy Munchy and those guys have been there. I haven't been there the whole time.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've been there a few hours each day, a little bit.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I mean, that's pretty good. How much time are you really going to spend there?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, well, I mean, they're there.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Dawn to dusk. Which is fine. I don't know. I couldn't be entertained for that long.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
About six hours a day has been my limit. I did it in the evening on Friday and Saturday,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and then I went in the morning on Saturday because I wanted to go to a thing called a

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
pin trade thing because I had all my endless war slime pins and I was like,

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've got capital to trade, so I showed up and I arrayed all the RFCK pins on the table

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and I sat down like a little merchant doing business. It sort of worked.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I got a couple of good trades, although it seemed like, I guess I didn't realize it was a thing.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Some people that I asked were like, I'm only looking for fursona trades.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to trade my fursona for someone else's fursona.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, I guess in hindsight kind of makes sense, but I wouldn't have expected that either.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I didn't know that it's a thing to get your sona as an enamel pin, but now that I think about it,

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
yeah, why not?

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, I guess now you know how easy it is to get pins made, which maybe is before a seam donning.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's really not that hard and I asked some people and there are some, you know,

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
some enterprising furries who will handle it for you if you're a soned individual

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and you want to branch into that sort of thing.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There are people in the community that are connected and know how to do it.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you find yourself bisoned, then you may be able to.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, Kazzy drew me a, you know what?

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I want to show you the tag they drew for me.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They drew me one of those, like a badge?

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, a little badge.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, and that's classic furry contradiction.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You've got to have your cool artist friend draw you a badge to hang next to your con badge.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's funny.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Everybody's got them.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Everyone's got them, absolutely.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, literally everybody has a laminated little, because you got your ticket or whatever,

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
your actual badge that you paid for that you got to show to get into the dealer's den or what have you.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But that's bullshit.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right, nobody cares.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They want to see your character badge.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They want to know who you are, right?

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Because obviously you're not what you look like at the fur con.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Precisely.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And even like 10 years ago when I was going to cons more often, I did have a friend who drew me a badge and it was great.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I've still got it.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Got a little crack badge.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think, I guess the only, well I guess I went to Anthony New England.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What was it, three?

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What was it, two years ago now?

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Three years ago I had kidney stones, right?

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That was terrible.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Three years ago, you went for like one day and on your way, you were there one day and then on your way home, you stopped at my house.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Stay hydrated, buddy.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You brought me like Gatorade or something.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think I filled an Arizona jug with water for you or something.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I just carried you in a jug of water.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't die, buddy.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Wow, that was three years ago.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Jesus Christ.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I've dodged that medical debt ever since.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah, that all worked out, right?

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You pretty much just didn't have to pay it.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They just stopped, they told me we're sending it to collections and then I just never heard another word from them and I'm pretty sure, based on some information that I dug up later,

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm pretty sure that something called like a charity care clause kicked in wherein I was at the time too poor and they were not allowed not to treat me and therefore they couldn't like, they couldn't demand repayment.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, they try as they might.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Try as they might.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The law just was not on their side.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think that's what happened.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, so then I think it was the next year.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't buy a ticket.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I just walked in one day.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I just walked in and then I walked into the dance contest, the first suit dance contest.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It just in the middle of it and nobody checked my badge and I just got in.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Man, I don't know how they are these days, you know, corona times at this con, but usually those are pretty good.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
When I went two years ago, it was fun.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I did enjoy it.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But then this year, I was gonna go to that same thing yesterday,

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but I had gone there in the morning to do the pin trading thing and that was gonna be at like 6 p.m.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and it was like 4.30 and we were like, well, we got nothing to do.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We just kind of got to wait for the dance contest and that's gonna be an hour and a half and then the dance contest is gonna be two hours long.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And I was just like, I can't do it.

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Listen, guys, it's about my bedtime.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, it was about my bedtime, except, but you saw, because you're in my patron discords,

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you saw, I've been good use of that time yesterday.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I went home instead of going to some degenerate furry first suit dance contest,

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I went home and I cranked out the last five panels before Phantom's Revenge.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, and they're beautiful.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They're fucking gorgeous.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm happy with them.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's so good.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
They came out really good.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, here's my, here's a little bit of my dysfunctional workflow.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I got home from, hold on, wait, wait, actually, I found the picture.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm gonna post it.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, post that before we get too far away from it.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm gonna post the picture because it's Kuhl, because it's Kuhl and I like it.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not the best quality photograph, but this is my tag.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, yeah.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's good, right?

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's great.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, it's exactly what you need.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I know.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's fucking beautiful.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I know.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Cassie made one for everyone and they even confided in me that they thought mine came out the best and I agree.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, I don't have the other ones for reference, but I can't imagine how much better they could be.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, they're fine and all.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They're okay.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sure they roughly communicate the idea, but this one.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I love this.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, right.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So, right, so it was like five or so and I was like, all right, guys, I'm out.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And so I came home and I was home by like six and I sat down and I was like, all right, time to do some work.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then around about like midnight, 1am, I kind of start and stop and do a little bit.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And then I get the first of those five panels done that I had already done, had half finished.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I get that done around 1am.

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then from like 1am to like 4am, I crank out the other four.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They take me like half an hour apiece.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Nice.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And they're all, and they all come out really good.

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm just like, I'm just slapping colors down, just making them work.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The subtle little black outline on the green letters is so good.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I wish you were doing that sort of thing the whole time because it makes it so much more readable and it looks so much better.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hold on.

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The subtle little, let me go.

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're on the, there's one panel where it says bang bang and you've got this little black outline on the green letters.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, yeah.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, I just said, I do that sometimes on, I do that sometimes for like onomatopoeia sounds.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Just for legibility.

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If they had not, if they had not, just because like those green letters kind of on like the green, they're sort of adjacent to the green grass and like the light green on the white door background.

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It was just not legible without a.

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, I agree.

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think it's a huge improvement and I don't know.

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I just wish you'd do that all the time, but it would probably take forever.

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's like, I don't know how you're doing it if you got to like line around all the other lines.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It doesn't, honestly, it doesn't take forever.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I mostly, I just don't bother unless I think like, I don't know, because like two, two panels before that I have phantom touching the tree and he goes tap tap.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And I didn't give those a little sound effect, but, but those are just a little bitch sounds.

147
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Those are just a little tiny, little tiny noises.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They're not, they're not dramatic.

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
This bang bang is supposed to be like a reverberating bang bang.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Because, you know, the game starts, the game starts with two bangs and two bangs and a boom.

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Absolutely.

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
These are the last two panels before phantom's revenge.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And the first thing you hear when you hit, when you hit play on the phantom's revenge menu screen is you hear.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
As he, as he bangs twice on the door and then he explodes the door.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Spoilers for the first, for the very first instant.

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
For the very first second of the game.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So that said, is it, is it coming soon?

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Is it coming out?

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, I've got to.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So yeah, these ones that I posted yesterday, I have finished, it took me 42 panels, which is a little more than I expected.

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I expected maybe 30 something.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It took me 42 panels to get it up to the game.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Post game, I think, definitely, I'm going to say 12.

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm going to estimate 12 and it'll probably end up being more than I think.

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It'll be 12, maybe 16.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh, so another comic after the game.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, after the game, there's a little, there's a little post.

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's, there's like, after the game, you got to see what happens right after.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And then after that, I have to think of like, okay.

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then what, what are the actual like last pages of the comic?

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Like what's, what does like the V end look like?

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And I don't know what that is yet.

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I have no idea.

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So do you think by the time people are hearing this, is the game going to be generally available?

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Or is it going to be another week?

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sorry to ask you the tough questions.

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm going to, I'm going to guess it could be out by the time this is out, but I'm going to guess probably not.

180
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to say probably maybe more likely next week after, which, oh God, that's going to push into the next month.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, it's going to be March.

182
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Gib, Gib's going to beat me.

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Gib's secret project is going to come out before, before mine.

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, I'm excited.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't, I didn't realize how far along that was, but I was, I don't know anything specifically about it,

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but I heard from some, some patrons of Gib that, that it's real cool.

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So I'm excited.

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You, did you not, did you not hear any, you didn't hear any specifics?

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know anything.

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know anything about it.

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Really?

192
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I know what it is.

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, that's nice.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And I won't, and I won't be, I won't get into specifics either, but it is real cool.

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I am really excited.

196
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I am genuinely not, not even in like a, not even in like a happy for you sort of way, because I don't care about other people.

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm excited.

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Well documented fact.

199
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm excited in like a, in like a, yeah, it's a cool thing.

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's a cool project.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And I'm excited just to see like what people will say about it and what the reaction will be.

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's a, it's not as good as Phantom's Revenge, obviously, but it's good.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't, I mean, I want to see what, what people have to say about it.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I think it's, it looks great.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I've seen a little bit.

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I haven't seen that.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I know what it is.

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I haven't seen much of it, but I've seen enough to get, to get the gist.

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah.

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Good, good stuff.

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
She's going to beat me though.

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm thinking probably.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It just probably will.

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If, okay, okay, if, if I worked at the pace that I was working, not all last night, but just between the hours of midnight and like 5am last night, then I could get it done in a week.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I, historically, I can't maintain that sort of a frenetic activity.

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah.

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you need to do more than a page a day, I think it's safe to assume it's not going to happen, you know, on average.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Some days, some days I can crank out like eight pages, but it depends what the pages are.

219
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Like, kind of the reason, like you would see my, even see my, my uploads because you're in that channel, the Patreon channel.

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So you know that like.

221
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Shout out patreon.com slash Ben saying give him $5 you can get in the channel.

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Please.

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So you know that like the eight pages before that took me like two weeks because I don't know.

226
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They were just, I had a very specific, I had a very particular idea for what they ought to be and I had to make them, I had to make them meticulously match.

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's not even that they're like more complicated.

228
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's just that my, my mental image for them was very specific and I was like, I know exactly what they need to look like and I need to make them look like that.

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Whereas these ones that I did yesterday, I was like, I basically know what they're going to look like and like as long as they generally get the idea across whatever.

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I just kind of like just started and I just kind of started throwing lines down and I just like to tap a tap a tap a with my stylist for like 45 minutes and then like whatever was there at the end of that.

231
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was like, yeah, that works.

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay.

233
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Next.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Good.

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Go.

236
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah.

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah.

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah.

239
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So it's sort of, it lets you do kind of whatever.

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So it was just, it was just kind of like, I know it's going to be sort of in like the kind of dark looking woods.

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So I'll just start throwing down some woodsy looking details.

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, that was the first page.

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The first page where I drew the whole background took me, I did that like half yesterday and then half, or half two days ago and half yesterday.

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And, you know, I'll just, would it be a spoiler to post it?

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll show it as a tree.

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's not that spoilery.

247
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's not that bad.

248
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's not that spoilery.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
People know Phantom Horan's coming for his revenge.

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He's coming for revenge.

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I hope that's a spoiler.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah.

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So this scene with the tree, yeah, it took me a little bit to get the background, right?

254
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It took me two days.

255
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And then in the one, the post, the one after it, I just used the exact same background again, but I just kind of like reversed it and like zoomed in on one part of it and kind of like change the brightness, contrast, balance.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Just so it.

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, that's funny.

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You know, I didn't even notice that it's exactly the same and you wouldn't write it.

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

260
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's fine.

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's totally fine.

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I do that all the time.

263
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll just like take, I'll just take a background that I used before and be like, well, if I, if I, if I flip it and I like just change the color balance a little bit, like you would never know.

264
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You would never know that it's the exact same image.

265
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And that's such a good trick to get that fake depth of field to just like, well, I'm just going to adjust the color a little bit.

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You know, if it's desaturated a little people know, oh, that's the background.

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And it works.

268
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It works great.

269
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It looks deep.

270
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Exactly.

271
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And then it's like, okay, well, do I want to, in this one, I think I made it, I desaturated it to make like, to make phantom pop a little bit in the front.

272
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And then you can, you can make it, you can make it lighter.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You can make it lighter or you can make it darker.

274
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If you want, do you want the carrot?

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You want the character to be like a dark silhouette or do you want him to be sort of like a sort of a point of light focus focal point in like a dark area?

276
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can do whatever you can do.

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I want everyone to do it.

278
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I mean, that's just a theory though, you know, a color theory.

279
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah.

280
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's never, it's never been, it's never been tested.

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Never been tested, never been proven.

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
As you're saying, I don't know why I put the Yig tree there.

284
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It looks, it looks fine.

285
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It looks like it fits.

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It doesn't.

287
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think it's okay because if you didn't know what it was, it's like whatever.

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's just a weird looking tree.

289
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And it's totally reasonable for a weird looking tree to be there.

290
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Wouldn't you expect the thing that you're looking for to be in kind of a weird looking maybe artificial tree?

292
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

293
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So.

294
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Makes sense.

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
In the, in the context of what this is and like what place this is and why that tree is there, if you do, I'm trying to think if you do know what the Yig tree is.

297
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like what is, what is the thematic connection? Like what is being said?

298
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
See, because great, great artists don't think about these things beforehand.

299
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They just throw, they just throw shit together and then other people come up with what it means.

300
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You hang up those blue drapes and it's up to the audience and, you know.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
To infer.

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
To the reader.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That means I'm depressed.

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Exactly.

305
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So.

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It means that.

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, I mean, obviously it means that this is a place of villains.

308
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think, I think, I think that's the, that's, that's where my mind goes.

309
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is a place of villains.

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There's a villain, there's a villainous connection.

311
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is a place.

312
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This is not a place of honor.

313
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Nothing, nothing esteemed.

314
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No esteemed.

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No great, no great deed is esteemed here.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

317
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's what, that's what this tree says.

318
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But it also, I mean, obviously, obviously it's a Y, but it also kind of looks like a V.

319
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And it could be V for very bad things here.

320
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Or it could be V for pointing down because it's down right here is the thing you're looking for.

321
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You know, there's a lot of.

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, I won't, I won't show it, but yeah, the V pointing down, the V pointing down, that's true.

323
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then also around the back of the roots form a GG.

324
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And since this is a lead into the game, it's wishing, it's wishing you a good game when you, when you step through the precipice.

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah.

326
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The thresholds.

327
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It just works on so many levels.

328
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, it's incredible.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's incredible.

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Very good.

331
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

332
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Love the shoot.

333
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It all comes, it all comes together.

334
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This is, this is the real, the real artistry is not in throwing all this shit together.

335
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's in the sitting around and theorizing afterwards about how many layers of genius, of genius inference.

336
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Can I, can I retroactively read into this juxtaposition of elements?

337
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's, that's, that's the real artistry right there.

338
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Absolutely.

339
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Absolutely true.

340
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You know, all great art really is the summation of the references it can make.

341
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,000
All, all great art is made after the fact when you sit around trying to justify what it was you did.

342
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah.

343
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You come up with excuses for it later.

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Absolutely the case.

345
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And that's what I'm going to be doing with Slime and Punishment for the rest of my life.

346
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hey Ben, why did you spend two years drawing like a Sonichu fan comic?

347
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Uh, well.

348
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It just seemed funny at the time, I guess.

349
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And you know what?

350
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It was.

351
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What?

352
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So, so that's, I'm trying to think if I did anything else this week.

353
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Not really.

354
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I've been working on these, I was working on these, not specifically these panels.

355
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I was working on Slime and Punishment all week and then this weekend, uh,

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Anthro New England has been taking up a little bit of my time.

357
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And that's pretty much what I've been doing lately.

358
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What, what are, what about you?

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Man, well, first I want to plug very cool, uh, commission piece that I got.

360
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I think you saw it already when I would post it, um, by, uh, by Liz,

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
aka Monochromatics on, on Twitter.

362
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I did see this and I, I enjoyed, uh, looking around at the fine details.

363
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I can't believe the amount of work they put into the, uh, the PDP 12 here in this picture.

364
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Is that the, uh, the machine?

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah, this computer, it's a, it's a digital computer, digital equipment corporation.

366
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So the old Massachusetts, uh, computer company.

367
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah.

368
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Mainframes and mini computers.

369
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah.

370
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Punch, punch cards.

371
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah, it's got that.

372
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's, it's got it all.

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We got magnetic tape reel to reel.

374
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We've got, uh, we've got punch tape, uh, like big, big strips of tape reader.

375
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's also got, I don't know if you could see in the bottom right there.

376
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Those are a giant 14 inch, inch removable hard disks.

377
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Uh, oh, the big, the big round things.

378
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And you would slot those into those giant drives above it.

379
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Like, like big flash drives.

380
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Jesus Christ.

381
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Each holding a whopping like two megabytes or something.

382
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Like, like real service technology.

383
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I, I was reflecting the other day on how, uh, on how I, like darn, I'm old, I'm old enough

384
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
that I actually used floppy disks.

385
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's a, I think at this point that's a real, that's a real real.

386
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Like that, that's like my parents being like, yeah, we used eight tracks.

387
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Lamal.

388
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah.

389
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Man.

390
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Now eight track is a terrible format.

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That's.

392
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm not sure I've ever even seen an eight track.

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't know what it is.

394
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
They're awful.

395
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So the thing about eight track, uh, not to get too diverted here, but like, you know,

396
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
with compact cassette, your regular cassettes, um, it's just, it goes from beginning to end.

397
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And you can go forward or reverse.

398
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You can flip it over.

399
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Right.

400
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's two sided.

401
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
None of that with the eight track.

402
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The eight track is a continuous loop of tape and you can only go in one direction.

403
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So, so you can only play forward and you just have to loop it all the way through.

404
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes.

405
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Wow.

406
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Loop it all the way through.

407
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And they call it eight track because it's, um, eight stereo tracks.

408
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So it's, there's four songs that are like simultaneously encoded left and right channels.

409
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So you can pick which one you're listening to at any given time, but it's just like,

410
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
it's just in that part of the tape.

411
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You know what I mean?

412
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's, that's weird.

413
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Okay.

414
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I did not know that.

415
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Such a dumb ass format.

416
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I did not know that about, uh, about those.

417
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That's, that's fucked.

418
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah.

419
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What it would usually be a lot of the times like track one would be one song followed

420
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
by another song and then track two simultaneous to track one is one song followed by another

421
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
song.

422
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So you can get, so you can get eight.

423
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Well, you get 16 songs because each track is two songs.

424
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Uh, no.

425
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So it's an eight track, but there's actually only four song for four tracks you can listen

426
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
to because they're stereo.

427
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh yeah.

428
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You could probably get eight songs on there.

429
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean, they could put however much tape could fit inside the big cartridge.

430
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yeah.

431
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

432
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's a terrible format.

433
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
If it sucks.

434
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Amazing.

435
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Amazing.

436
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You know, I never, never seen it.

437
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You think a compact cassette like cassettes, like they're, they're kind of bad, but they're

438
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
so much better than eight tracks.

439
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I did.

440
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I did when I was like a little kid.

441
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I think when I was a little kid, I did have cassettes.

442
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I had like fucking baby.

443
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
When I was like a little baby, you know, I had the fucking little music cassettes on

444
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
a little, a little cassette player.

445
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I think, I think by the time I was like actually listening to music cassettes were already obsolete.

446
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah.

447
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Same.

448
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Like I, I definitely have, you know, I've got a small collection of cassettes and stuff

449
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and I listened to them when I was a kid a little bit, but it was, I definitely mostly

450
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
had CDs and then really mostly just downloaded music.

451
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

452
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah.

453
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
By the time I was in like high school MP, MP3 players and like a, you know, a lime, lime

454
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
wire and I kind of missed a nap.

455
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I missed Napster, but like Kazaa and lime wire and it was like, just get a fucking MP3 player

456
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
dog.

457
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I had a small CD collection.

458
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I bought a bunch of CDs of bands that my friends liked so that I would feel worthy of their

459
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
love.

460
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah.

461
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I need these, these totems so that they can, they can see the signals, right?

462
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
These shibboleths.

463
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
These shibboleths.

464
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I needed my, I needed my God, my God smack and my incubus and my cradle, cradle of filth.

465
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Incubus still, Incubus still a great band.

466
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I still love Incubus.

467
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
No.

468
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Do you?

469
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh yeah.

470
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I mean, I don't know.

471
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
They got, they got a couple of songs that are fine.

472
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm not, I'm not, you know, I'm not well versed in the, I'm not well versed in the,

473
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm only, I mean, I was never well versed.

474
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I like, you know, a couple of their, a couple of their hits.

475
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah.

476
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I still, I still.

477
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah.

478
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I think the hits hold up.

479
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah.

480
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Would also have, I don't know.

481
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
God, speaking of, speaking of this era.

482
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Obviously, obviously I had hybrid theory, Linkin Park, obviously.

483
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh, of course.

484
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Of course.

485
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Of course.

486
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Certified banger.

487
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I was just listening to Good Charlotte's The Young and the Hopeless.

488
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I love that album.

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I still love that album, Front to Back.

490
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's great.

491
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The first half of the album is just banger after banger after banger.

492
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'd recommend it.

493
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You should listen to it right now.

494
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Not right now, but you know, after this.

495
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Right?

496
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No, right now.

497
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Right?

498
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Eleazar.

499
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Eleazar.

500
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Cut that.

501
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Could you cut in the entire album?

502
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I was, I was going to say cut out the next 45 minutes.

503
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
No.

504
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm going to go give it a listen.

505
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay.

506
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
All right.

507
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

508
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I should listen to more, you know, I've said it before and I'll probably say it again.

509
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I should listen to more music because one thing that I know, one thing that I historically

510
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,000
know for a fact improves my creativity or improves my productivity is when I'm listening to music

511
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and I get in the zone with it.

512
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I can just drawing.

513
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
When I'm listening to podcasts or YouTube videos, they, they are not, I do not get in

514
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
the zone.

515
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They distract me.

516
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,500
And I, I mean, I can draw in spite of them.

517
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,000
I can just kind of ignore it.

518
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Sometimes I can draw and get and just kind of let them, let them wash over me, but music

519
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
is more likely to do that.

520
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So I should listen to more music.

521
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If I, if I spent more time listening to music, I would probably be a more effective person,

522
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I think.

523
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

524
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And, you know, it would also sort of open your mind to new things you haven't thought

525
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
about.

526
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You'll hear some new sounds and maybe that'll be reflected in your art, you know, so it's

527
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
always good.

528
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Possibly.

529
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Possibly.

530
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Could, could happen, I guess.

531
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I have a very, very limited, I have a very limited Sonic palette.

532
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's kind of cringe to say, but it's true.

533
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It is true.

534
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I didn't want to, I didn't want to call you out for it, but it's definitely true.

535
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No, it's true.

536
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's true.

537
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's just, you know, finding music is hard.

538
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah, it is.

539
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And I have historically often been like, eh, why bother?

540
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Eh.

541
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You know what's hard?

542
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And listen to the old, just listen to the old favorites and eh, music's not that good

543
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
anyway.

544
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The problem is making music is hard too.

545
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So like my, my favorite band, Sad Baxter, have just like fallen off the face of the

546
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
planet.

547
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
They're not doing anything right now.

548
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's been years.

549
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's like, come on guys, let's, let's get together and do another EP.

550
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Right.

551
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What's it going to take?

552
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah.

553
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I guess.

554
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I mean, I guess that's, I was going to say most bands, but I mean, I guess that's the

555
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
fate of every band eventually is too.

556
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I mean, yeah.

557
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's always a limited time thing.

558
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah.

559
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Unless you're like, unless you're like, I don't know, some Boomer 80s band.

560
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Unless you're Iron Maiden.

561
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
At which point you're just going to keep making another album every year for the, for the

562
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
for the foreseeable future until Bruce Dickinson and Steve Harris die.

563
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Or, or failing that you just, you know, you eventually just have a reunion tour that lasts

564
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
the rest of your lives because like you're never going to do anything.

565
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You know, you know, you're never going to, you're never going to, lightning's not going

566
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
to strike twice.

567
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah.

568
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You know, you're not going to have a second hit.

569
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The Rolling Stones bottle, right.

570
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Is they just keep torn.

571
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

572
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It's like, they're not going to write another, there's not going to be another.

573
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't know, sticky fingers or whatever.

574
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know.

575
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I can't even think of Rolling Stone albums, but I'm sure some were good.

576
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
That's sort of before our time even.

577
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah.

578
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I mean, I've never listened to the Rolling Stones.

579
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah.

580
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That's like my mom likes that.

581
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You know.

582
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yeah.

583
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

584
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I mean, Rolling Stone magazine.

585
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah.

586
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't even, I don't, I could, I could, I consider Rolling Stones to be, I would consider them

587
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
more brethren to like the Beatles.

588
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

589
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Same time period.

590
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
For sure.

591
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah.

592
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.

593
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay.

594
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
When I was, when I was a kid, people, people were listening.

595
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
My friends were listening to like Black Sabbath, but even that was like, that was like classic,

596
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
that was fairly old even at the time.

597
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You know.

598
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Sure.

599
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I mean, that's like, by our standards.

600
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It was like studying Mozart, for example.

601
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You listen to the Sabbath to get the context for the genre.

602
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Appreciating the great masters.

603
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah.

604
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Right.

605
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah.

606
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah.

607
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I was, you know, I definitely had a classic rock phase.

608
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think everybody has to if you're, you're growing up in that time.

609
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah.

610
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But none of you really stuck with me.

611
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm not that big a fan, except for, I always loved ACDC.

612
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think they're still pretty good.

613
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
One time, this is a very, I asked, my friends were going to Oz Fest and I wanted to go to

614
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Oz Fest and I asked my dad if I could go to Oz Fest and he made fun of me for it.

615
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, I would too.

616
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But he made fun of me in a way that he, he kind of, I think it circled back around in

617
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
him because the way that he made fun of him is he started singing what he thought was

618
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
an Ozzy song at me, but it was an eighth.

619
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He started singing dirty deeds, done dirt.

620
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You know, you know, the classic Osborn digger.

621
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So, so he was hoist.

622
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
He hoisted his own petard on that one.

623
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's funny.

624
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

625
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And I didn't know, I wasn't that familiar.

626
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So I didn't know at the time that like that's not an Ozzy song.

627
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So I couldn't call him out.

628
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I mean, it is an Ozzy song to be clear.

629
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Pretty close.

630
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm trying to think if maybe that's was what he was thinking, but like no.

631
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
No, I'm sure it's just a funny coincidence.

632
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah.

633
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
God, and speaking of this, you know, bands just coming and going, the chats down in

634
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Australia were doing sort of a modern punk take on what ACDC was.

635
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And the moment they, they taste a little bit of success, you know, they had this big

636
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
hit with Smoco.

637
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
They did one with a Dine and Dash song.

638
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I can't think of the name of it off the top of my head.

639
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The moment they taste that success, they fire their cool alcoholic fact guitarist.

640
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
They bring in some other guy and the band's ruined.

641
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You know, you need the alcoholic fact guitarist.

642
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We need pricey back.

643
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm begging the chats, bring back Mr. Price.

644
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm bringing pricey back.

645
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You need, I don't know, you need something.

646
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You need someone with someone's got to bring the sauce.

647
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Who are you talking about?

648
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Who is this person?

649
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Do you know the chats?

650
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'll post one of their songs.

651
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
No.

652
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's Dine and Dash.

653
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The chats, like the cats, like French?

654
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
No, it's, I thought that initially too the very first time I saw them, but it's, I guess

655
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
it's Aussie slang for like bad food or vomit.

656
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The chats?

657
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah.

658
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So if you, if you go to a crappy restaurant, they might give you a chat.

659
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The food might be chatty.

660
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Okay.

661
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Whatever, whatever you say.

662
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But this is great too.

663
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't know if you ever saw that old clip of the guy who was a famous Dine and Dasher, right?

664
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
He's getting arrested, you know, and the cops are, are manhandling him.

665
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
He's saying like, oh, this is democracy manifest.

666
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh yeah, that does ring a bell.

667
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They got that guy and he's in the music video for Dine and Dash.

668
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
This is democracy manifest.

669
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah.

670
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
He's like, oh, I see you know your Judah well.

671
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh yeah, yeah, he's like, who's an older guy?

672
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
He's an older guy.

673
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
He's very old in this video.

674
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I see you.

675
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I see you studied your Judah well, sir.

676
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Right, right, right.

677
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Crazy.

678
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I forgot about that, but yes, yes, you've unlocked a memory for me.

679
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah.

680
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And I think, you know, to everyone, to the viewers, please check out this song.

681
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And you will also have that memory unlocked unless you're like under 20 years old at which

682
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
point you definitely have no idea what it is.

683
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
No, no, I don't even remember when I, was I in college?

684
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
When I saw that, maybe it was later than that.

685
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh, I don't know.

686
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I think that clip is from like 2000.

687
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, really?

688
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah, that's old.

689
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Maybe.

690
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah, okay.

691
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I guess it could have just been an old clip that I just happened to stumble upon.

692
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Probably.

693
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah, I see.

694
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Hmm.

695
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
What are we talking about?

696
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
How'd we get on?

697
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You know, we're talking about this picture, this picture of the computer.

698
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Oh, yeah.

699
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We went down the storage, storage archive.

700
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Right.

701
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But anyway, the point I was making is it's a PDP, which is this one's not part of the

702
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
UNIX lineage, but the PDP 11 was another digital computer.

703
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So the cool thing about all this is it's sort of like, oh, there's crack, learn a program,

704
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
learn to write C, you know, back when C was being invented on the UNIX operating system

705
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
that was being invented.

706
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's just kind of cool.

707
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Man.

708
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It's a very historical piece.

709
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Making, I think I've complained about this same thing before, but I'll say it again.

710
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Making Phantom's Revenge has made me feel so late to the party.

711
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Like, learning GML, it's like, wow, okay, someone else, someone else who 30 years ago,

712
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
who actually knows how to code, decided what if I use my code to design like a baby code

713
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
for idiots to learn.

714
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And that's what I'm dabbling in right now.

715
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And I feel so patronized by these tools, by these tool sets that someone has laid out

716
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
for me.

717
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah.

718
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And you know, you know where that started in like 1964, right?

719
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They come out with the basic programming language, just called basic.

720
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Is that like, is that like one step up from like assembly language?

721
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
No, basic is all nice mnemonic words, things like go to and print.

722
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.

723
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And they made it because obviously normal people could not just write assembly code.

724
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It takes a certain kind of, you got to study it.

725
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You got to understand what the instructions do.

726
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So they come up with basic.

727
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And it's very basic.

728
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's easy.

729
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And basic is like a, I've never like tried it, but it's like a human readable sort of coding system.

730
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah, totally readable.

731
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Like regular source code, no weird syntax usually, although the early ones had kind of weird

732
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
syntax because, you know, computers were junky.

733
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Like you could fit like 40 characters of text on a line on your home computer.

734
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So they had to be a little terse.

735
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah.

736
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah.

737
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But like here's a, here's a picture of some Atari basic, which is very similar, like

738
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
a Commodore basic.

739
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, it's this.

740
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Ola Wikipedia.

741
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay.

742
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
10, 4, X1, 2.

743
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh, yeah.

744
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Okay.

745
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah.

746
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And in this type of basic, they have to number the lines.

747
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And then if you were to do a go to, you would say go to that line.

748
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But this one, this one happens to be doing a for loop, which is like, whoa, big, big

749
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Mr. Programmer over here pulling out the for loop.

750
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, programming jokes.

751
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah.

752
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah.

753
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But, you know, so, so since the very beginning, people have been like, oh, we got to make

754
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
a language so that more, we got to make it easier.

755
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah.

756
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And there's basic, there's cobalt is another big one that, that's still incredibly still

757
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
used today.

758
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
This ancient terrible language.

759
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Cobal.

760
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah.

761
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
C O B O L.

762
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah.

763
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Absolutely awful.

764
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Should have been dead 30 years ago and it's still going because they use it in like

765
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
insurance companies use this in like their, their mainframe computers that they haven't

766
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
changed since like 1970.

767
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Sure.

768
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So you got to keep the old language.

769
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You got to keep it going.

770
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You got to keep your cobalt going.

771
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
There's a bunch of these.

772
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Common business oriented language.

773
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
There's a, there's mumps is one used in the medical billing and coding field.

774
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It's another cancerous terrible language.

775
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah, I see.

776
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And if you, if you look for programming jobs, sometimes you'll see still listings for like

777
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
we need, we need a mumps guy.

778
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Those jobs are bad.

779
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You don't want it.

780
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You don't want that job.

781
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah.

782
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
No, seems weird, seems weird.

783
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Interesting.

784
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yeah.

785
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Massachusets general, that's not what I thought mumps was going to stand for.

786
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Massachusets general hospital utility multi-programming system.

787
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Okay.

788
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
All right.

789
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Massachusets general hospitals all in one letter.

790
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Okay.

791
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I guess that makes sense.

792
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Well, you know, it was really MGH utility multi-programming system, but they, they spelled

793
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
it out for, for the very basic among us.

794
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Gotcha.

795
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah.

796
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Or, or just M or just M for short.

797
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah.

798
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And it's so funny.

799
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
If you can, yeah.

800
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well, it's so funny because all these languages are kind of a similar vintage.

801
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Right.

802
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And then we have, we have C that comes out like maybe five, 10 years after this.

803
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah.

804
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And C is so actually good.

805
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I saw, I saw your comment on the last episode in response to Gamer's Tavern.

806
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Oh, he was talking about C sharp.

807
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
C sharp is a whole different animal.

808
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh, okay.

809
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Related only in letter.

810
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I assumed it was like a, like a child language or like a, like a.

811
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So, so with C sharp is sort of similar to Java.

812
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The idea is to make this like a nice virtualized language that has like garbage collection

813
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and automatic memory management and stuff.

814
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's sort of in the style of the C programming language.

815
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So like the, the semantics are similar, but it's not actually like you wouldn't say it's

816
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
based on C, you know.

817
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Okay.

818
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
All right.

819
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But it looks cosmetically very similar and it's got like some other things.

820
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Gotcha.

821
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I think.

822
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Okay.

823
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So, same story as Java.

824
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I also don't know much about Java.

825
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I used a little Java on my website once.

826
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I copied and pasted some Java.

827
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What's JavaScript?

828
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, which unfortunately is very different.

829
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
What the fuck?

830
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Okay.

831
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
C sharp.

832
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Oh, yeah.

833
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Nothing to do with C.

834
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah.

835
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Unrelated.

836
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh, JavaScript.

837
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
No, no, no.

838
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This is not Java.

839
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
No, no.

840
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
This is JavaScript.

841
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
No, this is totally different.

842
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah.

843
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You know, and the problem is like in the 90s, people just had Java on the brain.

844
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You know, they come out with the Java programming language.

845
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
They're like, oh, we need a language for the web.

846
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We need a language for the web.

847
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
JavaScript.

848
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's like they're barely connected.

849
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The only connection really is, again, that they all sort of copy the C semantics and

850
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
styling, you know, the symbology of the two.

851
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And it's not like, like the actual languages are not very similar.

852
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Well, that sucks.

853
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
That blows.

854
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Okay.

855
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah.

856
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Whatever.

857
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Right.

858
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So you were saying C comes out five, 10 years later.

859
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah.

860
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You know, sort of almost of the same era that maybe the next era of computer programming

861
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
to come out with C. And it's great.

862
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
It's the best thing that anyone's ever thought of.

863
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We're still using it today and it still kicks ass.

864
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like there's just nothing wrong with it and it rolls.

865
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I guess, I mean, I guess, I mean, I guess that's how it is with natural, with real languages

866
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
that you speak.

867
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You figure it out and like, well, if it works, you know, let's just keep using it.

868
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Makes sense.

869
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
You don't have to keep reinventing the wheel.

870
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I guess.

871
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You know, that's exactly it.

872
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So the problem was people would make these languages.

873
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You'd make your cobalt or your mumps and it would run on like this very specific computer.

874
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The mumps runs on the mumps computer, whatever it is, like this one computer.

875
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And when they come out with a new computer, somebody has to like reimplement the language

876
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
for that computer.

877
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Or there's a new language for that computer and they got to rewrite all the tools for

878
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
the new language for the new computer.

879
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
But the reason C has so much staying power is they wrote UNIX, right?

880
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And UNIX is this operating system that provides these API interfaces for the C language.

881
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And then anything that's written for UNIX works on UNIX no matter what the computer is.

882
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So you just port UNIX to the new computer and then everything, it's like a virtual machine

883
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
for all these programs.

884
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
All your programs just work.

885
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You can build them on the new computer.

886
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Hmm.

887
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah.

888
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And that was, you know, that was so fundamental and so game changing that just like it embedded

889
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
C and UNIX forever.

890
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Like they're just unstoppable juggernauts.

891
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So is UNIX sort of like an operating system?

892
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah.

893
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's an operating system.

894
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Okay.

895
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay.

896
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Okay.

897
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And then later on, of course, in the nineties, the line of store vaults comes along and he

898
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
says, well, UNIX is kind of big.

899
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It's kind of expensive.

900
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
People can't really get it.

901
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm going to make my own kind of UNIX like thing for, for little normal people computers

902
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
instead of for, you know, the big mainframes of many computers at institutions and universities.

903
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh, that's, that's line Linux UNIX line.

904
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah.

905
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's, it's cute.

906
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Right.

907
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

908
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Linus is like, I want to make my own little, you know, and the story goes that like his

909
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
CIS admin friend was making his home directory and mistyped his name Linus instead of, instead

910
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
of Linus, you know, who knows if that's true.

911
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And he was like, Oh, no, that's good.

912
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That's a cute, that's a cute story.

913
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Like, like the story of like, like, oh, Toru Iwatana, he was eating a pizza and he looked

914
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
down and he took a slice out of the pizza and he looked down at the pizza with a slice

915
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
out of it and he said, Oh my God, I've got a new idea for the next legendary video game

916
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
character.

917
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

918
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It comes to me in a flash.

919
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It might even if it's not true.

920
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Yeah.

921
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
That's okay.

922
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Yeah.

923
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's better if we act like act as though it is.

924
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You know, but, but so that's why, that's why C sharp and Java, they, they take this idea

925
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
that like, okay, we have this, this UNIX, this Linux operating system that is a virtual machine

926
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
for the actual computer.

927
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Right.

928
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And they say, what if we literally put on top of that another virtual machine layer that

929
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
abstracts the operating system?

930
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You know, so now instead of writing your, your program for UNIX, you write it for Java.

931
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And you build it for Java and the Java virtual machine just runs on, it runs on Linux and

932
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
it runs on Windows, right?

933
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And it runs on Mac OS.

934
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So you don't have to rebuild your Java code.

935
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You just, you just deploy it and they've got a JVM that's already built for that operating

936
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
system.

937
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But it turns out that sucks actually because in practice, like everyone just runs Linux

938
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
in their data center.

939
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So you could just build it for Linux.

940
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So there's no, you know, the whole value of Java and C sharp abstract in the operating

941
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
system.

942
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It just doesn't exist in the enterprise space.

943
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And like,

944
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Will you say, or no, sorry.

945
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
We're going to, we're going to say something else.

946
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Oh, I was just going to say also, so like the, in the enterprise space, everyone's just

947
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
running Linux and, you know, in the desktop space, everyone's just running Windows.

948
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So it's like,

949
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah.

950
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The value of, of doing it for Java specifically is like, why would you?

951
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Right.

952
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Okay.

953
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Just build it for Windows, you know, or just Java.

954
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So Java is meant to abstract the operating system as in like, okay, if you build a program

955
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
for Java, then Java will make it run on any operating.

956
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yeah.

957
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah.

958
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,400
You can pile it to bytecode for the Java virtual machine and then the virtual machine will

959
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,720
have been written for the specific computer and operating system that you're actually running.

960
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,120
So you just install one JVM or, you know, they call it a runtime environment on the computer.

961
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,680
And then it's like, oh, well now you've got this virtual computer that is the same as

962
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,960
everyone else's virtual computer.

963
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,280
I understand.

964
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
Yeah.

965
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,360
But, but in, but in practice, like everyone's, everyone's, everyone's running the same

966
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,360
operating system.

967
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
So why?

968
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Right.

969
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,360
I get it.

970
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,360
I get it.

971
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
If you're writing a game, right?

972
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,240
Like you just target Windows, realistically, and I say that even as someone who uses Linux

973
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,200
on the desktop every day all day a hundred percent of the time, like I just, I build

974
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,360
my games for Windows and then I run them in wine on my computer.

975
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:44,200
Like I, you know, wine is, isn't wine basically like a virtual Windows that runs on Linux?

976
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,480
Uh, sort of.

977
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,680
So what wine does is it provides like the API calls that Windows has.

978
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,360
It doesn't need to virtualize it because your computer is still the same CPU architecture.

979
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,640
Like the, the code that you built for Windows runs on this computer.

980
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,360
It just like, if it makes a library call out to like, uh, open a file dialogue or something,

981
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,740
like Windows provides that.

982
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,000
So wine provides a similar thing.

983
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,880
So it's not, it's not an emulator exactly.

984
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,880
And that's why wine is, it's an act.

985
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,200
It's like a nested acronym.

986
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,880
Wine is not an emulator is what wine stands for.

987
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,880
Wait, really?

988
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,880
Yeah.

989
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,880
Wine is not an emulator.

990
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,880
Oh my God.

991
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Wow.

992
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,760
Well, that's, that's what it is.

993
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,200
So it just, it just provides these, these libraries that you don't have because you're

994
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
running.

995
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,880
I just, I just assumed that the W stood for Windows.

996
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,160
Yeah, it kind of does, right?

997
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,480
It's like Winnie, but it's also, you know, yeah, it's got layers and very clever people

998
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,480
over there.

999
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:50,400
This, this reminds, damn, they build, they make computers, they know, they know how to,

1000
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,000
they do be making them computers.

1001
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:58,880
They all be making, they making those computers bigger and better and smaller and better too.

1002
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,200
This reminds me of, I showed you the weird, stupid dumb shit that happened to Slime, not

1003
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,000
Slime and Punishment, to Phantom's Revenge when I tried exporting it for, for, for, uh,

1004
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Yeah.

1005
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Yeah.

1006
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
For the web.

1007
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
What was it?

1008
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah.

1009
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,720
On HTML three, eight, five, there, uh, yeah, just, just acted different for, weird shit

1010
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,520
happened where like, did, did you see that, that the, like when I started the, the start

1011
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,200
menu, the point was like looping through all the images, the arrow, the arrow icon, instead

1012
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:39,680
of just displaying the icon, it looped through a bunch of similarly sized images as though

1013
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:46,280
it, as though it knew that, okay, this image that I want to display is a certain size.

1014
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,240
Let me find things that are a similar size and then randomly, not randomly and then sequentially

1015
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,760
loop through a sequence of them.

1016
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:00,200
It was, it was, it's like it knew something and, and then I tried to, I went in and I,

1017
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,120
and I re-typed the code, I tried, I put in a new instruction to change that to make it

1018
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:11,120
not do that and it didn't work quite right and then I undid the changes and then it worked.

1019
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,440
I undid, I undid everything.

1020
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,880
I went it all the way back, I reverted all my changes, but it worked now.

1021
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,880
That's so weird.

1022
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,880
I don't.

1023
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,920
Yeah.

1024
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,160
And you know, it's, it's all down to like, however, game makers compiling this stuff

1025
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,560
and it's probably taking your art and like building new sprite sheets with like similar

1026
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,200
sized pieces, you know?

1027
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,200
Maybe.

1028
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,200
And we, yeah.

1029
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,240
It's just all invisible to us.

1030
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,960
We don't know how it works.

1031
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:44,160
It has, it has, um, it has automated a bunch of, yeah, stuff, stuff like making sprite

1032
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,160
sheets.

1033
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,480
Like you don't have to, you don't really have to fuck around with sheets in, in game

1034
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:55,680
maker, but maybe in its own internal logic, it sort of does.

1035
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,680
Yeah.

1036
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,320
It probably, it's probably like arranging stuff onto a grid of images and it's like,

1037
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,400
it's compressing your data in some way, right?

1038
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,280
Like if you, if you were to look at the, the exe, it puts out, for example, like you won't

1039
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,720
find your image, like literally in there, but it's in there somehow.

1040
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,480
They've, they've compressed it and they've combined it with other things.

1041
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,360
And I guess the, the HTML exporter just does some, some goofy stuff.

1042
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
Yeah.

1043
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:27,960
Very, it's, apparently it gets real goofy when left to its own devices.

1044
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:35,360
I watched a video this past week that was called, um, it was explaining how JPEG compression

1045
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,360
works.

1046
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,360
Okay.

1047
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,720
And I was like, well, it was real fucking needle.

1048
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,280
Let me find, just to find the video.

1049
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,280
Yeah.

1050
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,960
So I, I'm trying to imagine myself how it might work, right?

1051
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,840
Like obviously it's lossy compression.

1052
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,280
So it's like somehow using maybe like some mathematical function that generates noise

1053
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,600
to somehow compress the data, which is, I don't know, I don't know how that works.

1054
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
It's cool.

1055
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,720
Here it is.

1056
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:07,280
The video is called the unreasonable effectiveness of JPEGs.

1057
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,240
And there's, um, Oh, that's funny.

1058
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,960
I, I remember seeing this.

1059
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,320
This was recommended to me, but I didn't watch it.

1060
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,800
It was recommended to me and I ended up watching it and, uh, a lot of good stuff in that video.

1061
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,200
There, there's, okay.

1062
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,100
Some of the stuff that it does is it basically just, it basically just loses color information.

1063
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,800
It simplifies color information while retaining brightness information.

1064
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,160
And like just that, just the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to brightness

1065
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,400
than the color does like so much work.

1066
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,960
Like you kind of don't even notice because your, your eye is more, it does like, um,

1067
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:51,480
it does like color sampling, like it'll take like, you know, it'll like average out between

1068
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
like four pixels.

1069
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,080
Like it'll, it'll, it'll do like average color sampling for color, but not brightness on

1070
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,240
a bunch of, bunch of different scales.

1071
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,880
And that does a lot of the work.

1072
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,720
And then it will, man, I mean, this is a long video.

1073
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,560
So I can't explain it really.

1074
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,720
I can't, I can't summarize it that much.

1075
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Dear, dear viewer, if you're interested, please watch this video.

1076
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:20,280
You should just watch the video, but like it'll, it'll, um, there's a, yeah, there's,

1077
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,920
there's like a dozen different things that does like, like the, the, the brightness signal,

1078
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:32,160
it ends up, like it sort of, it takes the pixel because most J, because most images

1079
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,360
are what it calls a low frequency, meaning that there was like, there tends to be relatively

1080
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,920
little change in brightness just from like one pixel to the next, right?

1081
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,520
Like two adjacent pixels are likely to be fairly similar.

1082
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,640
Uh, and the fact that the images are low frequency means that if you plot, if you

1083
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:59,640
plot the brightness data, the brightness values on a line and you associate a curve with

1084
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:06,240
that, with that plot, you can then create a, you can sort of approximate a function of

1085
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,560
that plot that you've just created by graphing the brightness data linearly as a

1086
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,400
sum of cosine waves.

1087
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:14,720
Oh, okay.

1088
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,640
And yeah, so that's, that makes sense, right?

1089
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,880
You sort of were expected to be something like that.

1090
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,760
When you look at the noise, it's like, it's very particular the way JPEG noise looks like.

1091
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:25,920
Hmm.

1092
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,680
Mm hmm.

1093
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,360
Yeah.

1094
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:37,920
I mean, I would, I mean, uh, it, it's, it's, it makes sense, like with enough data, it

1095
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,920
sounds like bizarrely complicated, like that you have to turn like a sequence of data points

1096
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,880
into this like weird sum of functions, but you know, with enough data, you know, if you

1097
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:57,120
can, if you can, if you can do that, then I can, I can see like, yeah, you can definitely

1098
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:03,480
store that sum of cosine waves in a smaller amount of data than just like, that is just

1099
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,120
a sequence of values, right?

1100
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,040
When you have like thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of

1101
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,080
Yeah, absolutely.

1102
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,200
Because I mean, you think of like, you think of an image, like if you wanted to store a

1103
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:19,320
literal bitmap, you know, that could be a, I don't know, three bytes per pixel, if it's

1104
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,760
a 24 bit color image, and if there's alpha channels, not non JPEGs, but like in ping,

1105
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,040
for example, you know, that's four bits, four bytes per pixel, that's up quick.

1106
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,280
There's a lot of pixels, even in a small image.

1107
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,760
It seems, I don't know, on face value, it seems ridiculous to suggest that you could

1108
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:44,640
just, that you could just, that you could just take basically any sequence and approximate

1109
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,200
it with the sum of cosine waves.

1110
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,400
But, you know, well, you could, you can, you can make any cosine wave you want, and you

1111
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,240
can add as many of them together as you want.

1112
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,640
And you know, we're just, we're just approximating here.

1113
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,240
We don't have to get it exactly right.

1114
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,000
I mean, it's just like, you know, even in like a, in a Cartesian plane, like a 2D graph,

1115
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,440
right, like if you have any set of points, you could construct some function that connects them.

1116
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,920
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1117
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:18,480
So that, that the cosine wave thing, the sampling, it shows, it shows examples where

1118
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,440
like, it takes an image, just a small image of just like eight by eight pixels, right?

1119
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,360
And then it does like, like it retains the brightness in each pixel, but then it like,

1120
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,720
you know, it like, it like averages out the color value, just, you know, it reduces it

1121
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,440
down from eight by eight to, you know, two by two, right?

1122
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,920
It combines, you know, sets of four pixels and losing the, losing the color value and

1123
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,120
retaining the brightness value.

1124
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,280
It's like, it's basically the same image.

1125
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,160
Like it looks a little different, but like it, it's, it's basically the same.

1126
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,600
Not in any way that matters, unless you're like printing it out.

1127
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,120
Not in any way that matters.

1128
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,480
Yes, exactly.

1129
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:58,320
Unless you really, unless you need like pixel perfect accuracy, which you don't.

1130
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,400
With any, like, you probably don't, right?

1131
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,520
If it's a photograph, you probably don't.

1132
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,520
Computers, funny.

1133
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,720
I don't know.

1134
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,600
I don't know if you've looked into compression in general at all, but it's kind of fun to

1135
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,240
play with, like, you know, you could, you could write your own code to compress data,

1136
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,800
for example, and do you were, you were doing, you were talking about this a while back.

1137
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,160
Yeah.

1138
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,800
Didn't you say that you wrote like a, I think you said that you tried to just kind of come

1139
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:34,080
up with like a, like a sort of naive, like the most basic algorithm, the most naive, the

1140
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,400
dumbest thing you could do if you wanted to compress data.

1141
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,760
And the first thing to attack, I think, like, if you have a big is redundancy, right?

1142
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,720
Combined redundancy.

1143
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:41,960
Yeah.

1144
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,520
So if you have a bunch of repeated bytes, you know, the same bite again and again and again.

1145
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,480
What if you, you know, you just come up with some mnemonic to replace that with like the

1146
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,240
number of how many of those there were.

1147
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,440
So if you have like a hundred zero bytes next to each other, you know, just have something

1148
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,200
that says, Oh, put a hundred of those in here, right?

1149
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,120
And now you've saved 97 bytes or whatever, you know, because you still got to, you got

1150
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,920
to put in your control sequence, but you don't have to print all those bytes.

1151
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,560
And I did that.

1152
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,600
So I went through and did that.

1153
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,840
I made a program that does it.

1154
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,680
And it was funny because for certain things, it was as good as like, Jesus, which is one

1155
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,680
of the standards for zipping things.

1156
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,480
It was like, it was pretty much as good.

1157
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,160
It was the same.

1158
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,720
What, what, what kind of data were you compressing with it?

1159
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,720
I think, uh, MPEG video was compressing.

1160
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,400
I mean, something, something like video.

1161
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,880
Yeah, you're likely to have, oh gosh, I don't know in what form the data is encoded, but

1162
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,760
I'm imagining like one, you know, like one pixel, you're at, like the data is like, you

1163
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,760
know, what color display on this one pixel.

1164
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,800
Well, see, it's likely to be repeated frame to frame.

1165
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,480
It's just like the JPEG thing.

1166
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:59,200
So an MPEG video, um, not only is it like a bunch of weird math to draw each frame, but

1167
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,880
also they don't draw the whole frame every time.

1168
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,040
Frames will be like just the Delta.

1169
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,520
And every once in a while, there's a key frame where they have like the whole frame.

1170
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,960
Yeah, so that, that's a whole, that's MPEG.

1171
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,280
That's MPEG, MPEG.

1172
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,600
Okay.

1173
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,400
All right.

1174
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,360
That's fucked up.

1175
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,040
But you know, you could, you could expand on that compression idea and do like what zip

1176
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,200
actually does, which I think is, uh, it'll go through the file and it'll look for like

1177
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,440
repeated sequences of, of the same bytes, right?

1178
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,880
Like it'll be like ABCD and it'll find that ABCD and put it into a dictionary and then

1179
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,840
replace it with just like the number of the dictionary lookup, you know, you could build

1180
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,640
this dictionary of all these common repeated sequences and just replace them.

1181
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,440
And that saves you a bunch of data too.

1182
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,800
Hmm.

1183
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:55,760
Sort of a, sort of an extension of the, okay, well, what, we, well, we can, we can, we

1184
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:04,040
can compress redundant data and then we can expand that to be like, okay, well, it doesn't

1185
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,080
just have to be a single letter, one letter at a time in a sequence of them.

1186
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,000
We can expand that to be, you know, a longer sequence that we find multiple times.

1187
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,520
Yeah.

1188
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:14,800
Yeah.

1189
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,920
Instead of just the same one repeated byte, maybe it's like, it's some common sequence.

1190
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,760
I got you.

1191
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,800
Maybe you initialize all your values to one, right?

1192
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:27,480
And so there's a bunch of these, these integers that are taking up four bytes each that are

1193
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,880
actually just like zero, zero, zero, one in memory, you know, and you could replace that

1194
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,680
sequence with one byte instead of four.

1195
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,080
Yeah.

1196
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,440
I mean, I guess if you, I guess you could.

1197
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:50,760
I, hmm, is there like, I'm thinking like, okay, you take any arbitrary data that you,

1198
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,200
you're looking at, you could probably come, you could probably come up with like an

1199
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,240
infinite number of data saving tricks, right?

1200
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1201
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,280
So I guess is it, is it just a question of like, okay, at what point, at what point are

1202
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,280
you going to be like, all right, we've compressed it enough.

1203
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,080
We don't need any more.

1204
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:10,920
Yeah.

1205
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,120
You know, well, right.

1206
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,840
And so that's, that's where lossiness comes in, right?

1207
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:21,080
Like you look at a, you look at an MP3, for example, or, or an MPEG video or a JPEG, right?

1208
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,880
It's like, we need this to be smaller.

1209
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,480
So how do we do it?

1210
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,360
You've got to start introducing loss.

1211
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,640
And then, then it just becomes, when is it, when is it so distorted that it's no longer

1212
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,280
acceptable?

1213
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,400
And that's where you stop.

1214
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,160
Yes.

1215
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,880
And that's a, and that's a, that's a, that's a, I guess that's an, an artistic question

1216
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,360
or that's an aesthetic question or not necessarily.

1217
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:51,040
I guess it might be a technical, this is how, like, how much, I don't know,

1218
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,160
probably depends on the use case or whatever.

1219
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,720
But I mean, if you, if you look at like audio, for example, a wave file, which is not

1220
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:04,520
compressed versus like an MP3 file, even, even a constant bit rate, 320 kilobit per

1221
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,440
second MP3 file is much smaller than a wave file.

1222
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:08,400
Yeah.

1223
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,480
They've just cut out so much data that just does not matter.

1224
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,680
You know, and with most things, it's like, they sound, they sound the same.

1225
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,480
They sound the same.

1226
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,040
You can get that like 10x reduction without losing almost anything.

1227
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,360
Yeah.

1228
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,880
Which is so crazy.

1229
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,560
It is crazy.

1230
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,680
You, like, yeah.

1231
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:32,000
Naively, naively, you would think, I don't know, when, when I still conceive, I

1232
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:39,800
still conceive of like an image file as being a piece of data that tells the computer, you

1233
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,720
know, like what, what color to draw on each pixel.

1234
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:43,880
Yeah.

1235
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,440
It's funny what you said about MP, MP, MPG video, it only draws the Delta or whatever.

1236
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,760
It's like, yeah, it makes sense.

1237
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,880
Still, I'll probably always think of it as like, I don't know, a sequence of images, a

1238
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:03,000
sequence of like, of bitmaps, pixel encoded images.

1239
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,160
Yeah, and actually on the video, that's why sometimes you'll see like a video that gets

1240
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,880
all destroyed, it looks like a mess, and then suddenly it like just pops back and looks

1241
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,480
fine again.

1242
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,800
Like, like it'll, it'll suddenly like stop and then it'll like turn all blocky and then

1243
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,560
like some, some blob of cubes will start like smearing across the.

1244
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,320
Yeah, yeah.

1245
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,480
And it's because it lost the key frame, right?

1246
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,400
It lost the key frame, so now it's building a Delta on something else.

1247
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,240
It just doesn't, it doesn't work.

1248
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,480
I see.

1249
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,320
I see.

1250
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1251
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,200
Hmm.

1252
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,000
I, I, yeah, I guess that explains it.

1253
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,640
I guess that explains why video looks all fucked up sometimes.

1254
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,800
That explains everything.

1255
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,000
It's all, it's all come together.

1256
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,320
Hmm.

1257
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,200
How do we get on this?

1258
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,280
Oh, yeah, I don't remember.

1259
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,600
We're deep in the weeds.

1260
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,640
Oh, we were talking about that.

1261
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,800
We were talking about the commission.

1262
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,680
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1263
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,600
Anyway, talking about datas, data languages in the it's cool.

1264
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,120
Cracksa, learning rightsy on a computer.

1265
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,160
It's nice.

1266
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,320
I think I, I think I retweeted an endless war.

1267
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:17,680
Yeah.

1268
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,560
It had a, it do, it do have that little endless war guy in there.

1269
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,240
I made sure to get that in there.

1270
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,920
That's very, I was looking around.

1271
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,560
I saw that I saw that it was green and I was like, is this an endless war thing?

1272
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,280
Let me, and then I saw him on the screen.

1273
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,720
I was like, hi, there, there he is.

1274
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,080
I mean, it's gotta be, it's gotta be at this point.

1275
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:35,880
There he is.

1276
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:42,240
I feel like the characters become deeply entwined in, in endless war, sort of in

1277
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,080
separate point.

1278
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:51,120
Um, when I was, um, I was trying to trade pins, what I made a few trades.

1279
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,840
The, the podrans, the podrans were pretty, a couple of people wanted the podrans pins.

1280
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,680
One person liked the, uh, endless war night sky pin.

1281
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,360
I traded that for, oh, I got one.

1282
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,680
I got a trade that's like a black and white egg and it's, and the egg is

1283
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:13,920
cracking and a little purple creature is looking out with like a green anime eye.

1284
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,440
And I'm, and I'm like, that's me.

1285
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,520
Yeah.

1286
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,440
That's you, that, that egg, that's about that.

1287
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,200
This egg is, this egg is me.

1288
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,160
Sounds about right.

1289
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,080
It's the smallest, it's the smallest pin that I got, but it's the best one.

1290
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,880
It's my favorite.

1291
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,080
I mean, I got some, I got some Sona pins, but like, you know, whatever.

1292
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,160
I don't know who these people are.

1293
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,520
I mean, if you don't know who they are, it's like, okay, I got their

1294
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,720
Sona, but like, it's just a sparkle dog.

1295
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,720
I don't know what this is.

1296
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,120
Yeah.

1297
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,760
Actually, I got one Sona and I asked them about it and they were like, yeah,

1298
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,920
you know, I'm going to be suiting later.

1299
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,400
And I was like, oh cool, keep my eye out.

1300
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:54,080
And then lo and behold, when it was, you know, unfortunately, I didn't get to

1301
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,960
say anything to them.

1302
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:01,080
I didn't get to tell them at the time, but later on when they did the, um, the

1303
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,280
first suit parade, when the everyone like walked through Boston Common.

1304
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,520
Sure.

1305
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:06,960
Yeah.

1306
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:13,560
Like a few, like 10 or 15 feet in front of us was that, was that dragon, that

1307
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,720
purple and green and teal, uh, dragon was, was very, was right there.

1308
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,400
And I was like, oh, it's from the button, from the button.

1309
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,720
I, I got him.

1310
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,640
I got that guy.

1311
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,240
I know that.

1312
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,080
I got him.

1313
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:27,920
Yeah.

1314
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,680
Uh, and then it started snowing.

1315
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:35,920
It started snowing like as we were walking around and I thought darn, that

1316
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:36,720
can't be good.

1317
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,920
I would say yesterday that was yesterday.

1318
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,280
Yeah.

1319
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:40,920
Yeah.

1320
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,680
There were some crazy squalls here.

1321
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,200
I don't know.

1322
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,600
I don't know what it was like over there.

1323
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,800
When I, I didn't see that much.

1324
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,880
We were walking around the common and it just started to snow a little bit.

1325
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,080
And I was like, okay, let's go inside.

1326
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:58,080
And then five or so, I'm like, okay, I don't want to wait for the dance,

1327
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,440
dance contest I'm leaving.

1328
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,920
And then I got, I, I walked outside, it was fine.

1329
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:07,240
And then I got on the green line and like a couple of stops down the green

1330
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:12,840
line, all of a sudden it, it, it goes from light to dark in no time at all.

1331
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,840
And then all of a sudden it's like a blizzard outside and not like a blizzard,

1332
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,680
but, but suddenly it's wind and it's dark and it's snow.

1333
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:25,040
Like I got on 10 minutes ago, I got on and it was light out and it was no snow.

1334
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,720
And then now it's like it's dark and the, in the, in the street lights, I'm

1335
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,720
seeing snow swirling and I'm like, Oh God, I'm going to have to walk in this.

1336
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,200
But then no, it had stopped.

1337
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,600
It had stopped or we had moved out of it by the time that I got off.

1338
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,240
Yeah, it was the same thing here.

1339
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:44,320
It was like a huge big storm rolls in and like 10, 15 minutes later, it was just gone.

1340
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:50,840
I was, I was lucky that it, that it passed entirely while I was on the tee.

1341
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,000
I didn't actually have to walk through it at all.

1342
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,080
That could have been bad.

1343
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,320
Yeah.

1344
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,800
Lucky, also lucky that I wasn't in like a suit, a fursuit or anything.

1345
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,800
I would hate, imagine if that had happened while they were all walking

1346
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,520
around the common, everyone would have been, it would have been pandemonium.

1347
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,360
Oh yeah, I got it.

1348
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,280
I mean, well, I got to imagine you get that in your fur.

1349
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,280
But yeah, but you don't want moisture in your fur, right?

1350
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,480
It's got to be bad.

1351
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,040
It's got to be bad to get wet.

1352
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,120
Well, I think what'll happen, it'll end up causing it all to get tangled and

1353
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,560
somebody will have to brush the whole suit out and that'll be a nightmare.

1354
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,480
You always got to brush them a little bit.

1355
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,160
But like, you know, if it's, if the whole thing's been wet, it's, it's bad.

1356
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,600
I think, I think so.

1357
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,920
Yeah, I would, I would, I would try to avoid it, I think.

1358
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,960
But I mean, some people put them in like the washing machine.

1359
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:40,640
I don't know.

1360
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,960
I don't know how that goes.

1361
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,560
I guess it depends what you made it out of.

1362
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,400
Yeah.

1363
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,080
Hmm.

1364
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,400
No, I just spray it, just spray it with Axe Body Spray.

1365
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,480
That's what people do.

1366
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,720
They pretty much just usually like isopropyl alcohol.

1367
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,040
They just spray it with and hope for the best.

1368
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,760
Is that real?

1369
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,560
Does that work?

1370
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,120
Yeah.

1371
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:09,520
Yeah, you just spray it and it kind of neutralizes the most offensive of the odors.

1372
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,360
I guess.

1373
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,160
Yeah.

1374
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:16,440
I mean, if this infects, I suppose, so kill, kill whatever's growing on it.

1375
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,280
Hmm.

1376
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,840
Yeah, because you don't want to lose the musk of your, of your husky suit.

1377
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,200
All right.

1378
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,240
I mean, that's half the appeal.

1379
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,480
That's half the appeal.

1380
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,720
If you can't smell it.

1381
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,400
It's like it's not even there.

1382
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:35,960
Hold on.

1383
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,000
And look at this guy.

1384
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,960
I'm trying to remember if I did anything else.

1385
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,720
What else did I do at Anthro-New England?

1386
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,720
Not, not much.

1387
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,120
Didn't really go to like, didn't go to any panels or anything.

1388
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,280
Because, because, because what do I want to do?

1389
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,480
What do I, what do I want a panel for?

1390
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:55,920
Oh, okay.

1391
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,920
I can't look at the schedule anymore.

1392
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,000
All the previous days are gone.

1393
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
They're all delisted.

1394
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,040
Oh, that's very annoying.

1395
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,320
I don't know why.

1396
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,120
I guess she had to get the book.

1397
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,040
Well, I have the book.

1398
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,320
I have the book, but it doesn't have a schedule in it.

1399
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,480
It doesn't have the schedule.

1400
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,600
No, you have to look online for the schedule.

1401
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,800
Because it, because the schedule is like at, at Bronycon, you know, there were so many rooms

1402
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,680
and every room had its own schedule.

1403
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,760
So there was like a whole like grid of like, you know, what room, what time, what's going on.

1404
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,280
Yeah, yeah.

1405
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,760
This is much smaller than that.

1406
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,520
So it's basically just like one or two main rooms that have an event.

1407
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,440
So the schedule is just a list and like at any given hour, it's like, OK, there's like,

1408
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,080
you know, maybe, maybe one or two things happening.

1409
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,160
So it's not that complicated.

1410
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,280
So I don't know why they didn't just print it in the damn book that they give you.

1411
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,640
No, you had to look online for it.

1412
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,400
You know, they probably did something crazy, like printing the book months in advance.

1413
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,960
And it's just they just don't have the data when they did it.

1414
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,400
They don't know what the schedule was.

1415
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:10,600
Oh, you know, that reminds me, speaking of printing a book, I I'm man, I'm thinking.

1416
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,600
The printers that I use for various things, the local printer, it's called Fleming printing.

1417
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,520
I use them for the Blu-ray jackets.

1418
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,000
I use them for mostly for RotoradCon printing those.

1419
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,880
I think they might suck a little bit.

1420
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,640
Or maybe I just because I was very disappointed.

1421
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,560
I asked them because I was, you know, because I want to do a book form of

1422
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,240
slime and punishment and I asked them what would it cost me?

1423
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:45,400
First of all, I'm just I'm just going to I'm just going to bitch about them for a second.

1424
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:50,600
They won't just they this is something they've never they've never been willing to do it.

1425
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:56,120
They won't just like tell me like how to figure out what something costs.

1426
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,600
They they they adamantly will only tell me what something costs.

1427
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,920
If I specifically asked them like how much would exactly one hundred copies

1428
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:12,280
of this exact thing, this many pages, this type of paper, this coloration,

1429
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,720
this type of binding, that's very many.

1430
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:19,000
Yes, and they won't and they won't I've asked like, can you just give me the formula?

1431
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,920
Right. Can you just give me the formula and they won't do it?

1432
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,640
They're like, no, you got to ask.

1433
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,240
So I have to be like, OK, please tell me how much a hundred would cost.

1434
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,880
Please tell me how much two hundred would cost.

1435
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,600
Please tell me how much three hundred costs, how much four hundred and how much

1436
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,520
would five hundred and then she'll send me five quotes.

1437
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,040
And it's like, OK, why are you why are you making this hard on both of us?

1438
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,160
Yeah, like why waste their time?

1439
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:46,720
Yeah, like just just fucking let me figure it out, dude.

1440
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,320
Well, I asked.

1441
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,600
I was asking I was sort of putting my feelers out and I asked them about

1442
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,360
what a slime and punishment would be.

1443
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,280
And I was like, OK, I kind of ballparked how big it would be.

1444
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,720
I kind of ball looks like, OK, it needs to be full photo color.

1445
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,440
It needs to be probably maybe about one hundred and fifty ish pages, something like that.

1446
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,440
And she sends me back a quote.

1447
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,440
I asked for a hundred because that seems like a good like minimum.

1448
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,720
Like I would want to print it like no, no fewer than a hundred.

1449
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,480
Yeah, I feel like you usually sell about that quantity or pretty much anything.

1450
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,600
So I think, yeah, I would think I would expect to sell a hundred.

1451
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,320
I think if I was doing it, probably more, hopefully more.

1452
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:37,880
But but but she quoted the price she quoted me.

1453
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,600
It was going to cost like fifty dollars a book, even even and I and I'm like.

1454
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:51,120
And I I was I was taken aback and I asked her like, OK, this is pretty expensive.

1455
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,880
Can you can you recommend me any ways that we could bring the cost down?

1456
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,000
Like is there like a standard size that would be cheaper that's similar?

1457
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,200
Maybe different papers. I don't know anything you can recommend.

1458
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1459
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,400
And then she sends me a reply that's like, sorry, here.

1460
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,240
Sorry, here's the corrected.

1461
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,480
Here's the guy made a mistake.

1462
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,600
That was not the right price.

1463
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,200
Here's the corrected price.

1464
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,560
And this time it was like it was like twenty nine thirty ish dollars per copy.

1465
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,760
And I and I'm like, OK, better.

1466
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,840
That's still high.

1467
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,760
That's still more than I think it should cost to do this.

1468
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,480
So I just sent the I basically sent the similar.

1469
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,280
I was like, OK, better. But still, can you recommend me any?

1470
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,000
Like, is there a standard size that would be cheaper?

1471
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,280
Is there like what how much would it cost if we reduce the size?

1472
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,400
Like what? And she sends me back is like.

1473
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:44,040
And again, she doesn't she doesn't give me any insight.

1474
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,680
She's just like, here is the quote.

1475
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,400
Here's the quote.

1476
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,880
Here's how much it would cost if we printed it at the, you know, I said,

1477
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,920
like what if we shrank it down to six by nine?

1478
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,280
Like here's how much it would cost for a hundred and six by nine.

1479
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,320
And she just sends me a number.

1480
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,280
And I'm sick of it. I'm sick of this bullshit.

1481
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,000
Yeah, that's terrible.

1482
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,880
Just give me just just give me the I don't want to ask you

1483
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,880
every specific fucking permutation of size and number of copies

1484
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,160
and glossy or unglossy like I won't do it.

1485
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,160
First of all, these prices you're quoting me are shit.

1486
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,520
And second of all, you're being ridiculous.

1487
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,840
Why are you making this so hard?

1488
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,600
Why do you hate me so much?

1489
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,240
And so I go on, I'm googling around for printing.

1490
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,200
So and I found one just the first one I found was called Mixam.

1491
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,080
And I'm typing in the specifications I'm looking for.

1492
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,120
And Mixam is like is like half.

1493
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,160
It's like 18. It's like, uh, 18,

1494
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:47,520
$18 or less, depending on if I change format slightly for per copy.

1495
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,160
And I'm like, OK, I kind of think Fleming is just maybe they just suck.

1496
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,960
Maybe I shouldn't have used them for anything.

1497
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,680
Maybe even printing Road to Radcon with them was a mistake.

1498
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,600
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like they're just like, you know,

1499
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,720
they'll make up whatever number they think I can get away with.

1500
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,920
Like what is it? Oh, he made a mistake.

1501
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,720
We'll cut we'll cut the price in half. What was the mistake?

1502
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,600
You know, she said she said he like entered the wrong.

1503
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,520
You know what? Oh, let me let me find it.

1504
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,520
Let me find exactly what she said.

1505
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,840
Like how do you accidentally like double the quote?

1506
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,440
You know what? Her exact words. Here we go.

1507
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Uh, hi, Ben, I've attached a corrected print estimate for you.

1508
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:30,360
Please accept my apologies as the estimator entered an incorrect number

1509
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,760
in the production formula and didn't catch it before passing the final estimate along to me.

1510
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,760
So there is a formula.

1511
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,840
Yeah, it's like there is a formula.

1512
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,440
Could you forward me the production formula?

1513
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,000
Could you just tell me the fucking formula?

1514
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,680
You know what? Yeah.

1515
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,040
That's that's true.

1516
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,200
And that's just more evidence to what I was already thinking, which is yeah,

1517
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,040
they're just they're just telling me whatever they fucking want to tell me,

1518
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,320
whatever thing they can get away with.

1519
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:05,000
And that hurts me. That hurts me because I have I have used these guys.

1520
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,480
I feel like I had some rapport with this lady.

1521
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,800
I have I have done a bunch of different things with them.

1522
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,320
I've printed a bunch of stuff with them.

1523
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,200
I thought, you know, doesn't that mean something?

1524
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,120
Am I not a valued? Am I not a valued customer?

1525
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,080
I'm, you know, you're a valued, repeated customer, you would think.

1526
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,600
And it's like, listen, you're running a business here.

1527
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,000
You're trying to estimate your costs because you got to make money on this, right?

1528
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,600
It's like, you can't just it's not it's not just a passion project

1529
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,240
where like, you just got to get this printed like you're trying.

1530
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,600
No, you're trying to produce a product that you're trying to produce a product.

1531
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,520
And I'm trying to try the numbers matter and I got to keep the cost low.

1532
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:47,280
And it's like, bro, surely surely you want me.

1533
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:55,120
It's like it's like it's like the fact that they want to conceal information from me.

1534
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,320
It's like, do you not do you not want me to be

1535
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:06,600
if you don't like if you don't want to print like a less robust product,

1536
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:10,320
like if you don't want the price to go down, then like, I don't know,

1537
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:15,080
don't don't offer cheaper production methods, I guess.

1538
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,080
It's like it's like she knows that I could bring the price down,

1539
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,440
but she doesn't want me to know that.

1540
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:26,680
Yeah, I mean, they're definitely they're treating you like an idiot and a customer

1541
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,760
and not like a partner, you know, which is what they they probably shouldn't be treating you like.

1542
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,240
I I wonder if it's like, honestly,

1543
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,280
not I don't know what like their bread and butter is.

1544
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,800
Maybe maybe they don't like me.

1545
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,640
Maybe they're sick of me.

1546
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,800
Maybe I'm like some small time guy whose whose orders are like,

1547
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,280
you know, a couple hundred dollars here, a couple hundred dollars there.

1548
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,880
And I'm and they're just like, oh, why do you even bother with this guy?

1549
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,720
He's not worth the time.

1550
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,280
He's a he's small potatoes.

1551
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,840
He's a pipsqueak, small fry.

1552
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,240
Yeah, you know, even if it's not the case,

1553
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,440
that's definitely the impression they're given, right?

1554
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,440
Yeah, so maybe.

1555
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,760
Honestly, I mean, maybe maybe they don't care about my business

1556
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,080
and I am and they're just sort of like doing it out of formality.

1557
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,000
It's like, well, some guy came in and he wants to print, like, you know,

1558
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,960
four hundred dollars worth of stuff.

1559
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,400
God, I hate when that happened.

1560
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,360
I don't know.

1561
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,960
So I don't think I'm going to not.

1562
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,680
I don't know. I'm going to look in the might look into it.

1563
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,760
I'm probably will probably look into other options

1564
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,360
for anything that I want to do in the future

1565
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:44,800
before I before I use them again.

1566
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,840
I'm a bit I'm just not disenfranchised.

1567
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,840
I'm just I'm disenchanted with them.

1568
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,640
Yeah. What were we talking about?

1569
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:59,280
Oh, yeah, my stupid printer, my stupid printer in the, you know,

1570
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,880
I wonder, damn, I wonder if I got a bad deal.

1571
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,480
Makes me wonder if I got a bad deal on the road to Radcon.

1572
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,440
How much did those cost me?

1573
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,440
Those cost me like.

1574
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,280
Those cost me like.

1575
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,520
Two hundred and fifty bucks

1576
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,640
or something for like.

1577
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,240
Hundred and fifty. No, that's not right.

1578
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,440
No, that's not right.

1579
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,280
Hold on.

1580
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:40,640
No, it was about five hundred dollars for like a hundred and fifty copies.

1581
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,840
Which isn't that bad.

1582
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,880
It's like a few dollars.

1583
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,920
It was like a paperback comic.

1584
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,440
Well, it was.

1585
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,200
Printed text, but like I think functionally it was digital printing,

1586
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,840
so it doesn't really matter if it was text or images.

1587
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:00,320
So, yeah, like a paper, I mean, you know, staple staple bound.

1588
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,960
Which is not not saddle stitched, but like that's fine.

1589
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,000
That seems OK.

1590
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,320
It doesn't it doesn't seem to.

1591
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,200
But maybe I could have gotten.

1592
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,560
I'm trying to think the Vapors was printing.

1593
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:22,440
I mean, the Vapors books were bigger, slightly bigger dimension wise.

1594
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,640
But they were.

1595
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:29,600
And that that was like it was maybe like seventeen hundred dollars

1596
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,040
for an order of like five hundred, but then it was plus shipping.

1597
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,880
I think the shipping was a big deal.

1598
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,040
I think shipping was a big deal.

1599
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:40,320
I decided to order due with Fleming because I could just pick it up in person.

1600
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,240
Yeah, I wouldn't have to pay like a hundred dollars for them to ship me.

1601
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,960
Well, I mean, especially if you order five hundred books, right?

1602
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,720
Like that's yeah.

1603
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,440
Yeah, I'm sure the shipping cost is significant.

1604
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,880
Yeah, it would be it would be maybe hundreds of dollars.

1605
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,520
Well, maybe not hundreds.

1606
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,680
But maybe a hundred dollars.

1607
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,680
Yeah, maybe a hundred dollars.

1608
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,080
Yeah, I don't know.

1609
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,840
Seems pretty seems pretty obvious to me that like something like Mixam

1610
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,640
or I have a few other services here that I have tabs open for.

1611
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:12,440
It seems pretty obvious that if these are the prices they're quoting me,

1612
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,320
I don't think I can I don't think I can go with Fleming for.

1613
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,360
Well, I mean, if you're ready to quit Fleming,

1614
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,840
like why don't you just take the Mixam quote and say, listen,

1615
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,640
I found this other service.

1616
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:27,040
It seems like they can do something pretty equivalent for much less.

1617
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,200
Like, you know, you get in this ballpark.

1618
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,120
You know, that's not a bad idea.

1619
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,680
And it's probably because Mixam, what you're going to have to go get it shipped.

1620
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,880
I will. I will have to get it shipped.

1621
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,360
So, you know, there's there's some cost value there.

1622
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,840
Like even if they quote you like two dollars more per book per book or whatever,

1623
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,960
you know, it might still be worth it to get it done locally.

1624
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,360
I should I should maybe order some samples.

1625
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,400
What I'm going to do is I think I'm going to I'm going to throw together a book,

1626
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,120
a book file, order like a sample copy for maybe a couple different.

1627
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,320
A couple different different services, a single sample copy from Mixam,

1628
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,160
though, is like seventy dollars.

1629
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,400
The curve, the curve, the curve is brutal.

1630
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,880
Yeah, like, I guess it scales well, but at low scale,

1631
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,920
it's like shit, seventy fucking bucks.

1632
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,520
Fleming was only going to charge me fifty for a like a test print.

1633
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,960
But but what's the point of getting a test print done if then like it's

1634
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,480
it's prohibitively expensive to print a full run?

1635
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,840
Yeah, I mean, well, so you like the you like the print quality of Fleming,

1636
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,320
right, like it seems fine.

1637
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:44,200
Well, I haven't printed any color stuff with.

1638
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,600
Well, I guess I did the Blu-ray jackets, which was was fine.

1639
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:51,720
But that might be a different, you know, it's a it's a different product.

1640
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,520
So I don't really know.

1641
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah, it's they seem fine.

1642
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,240
So maybe it's a tough situation.

1643
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,400
Good luck.

1644
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,400
It's a tough situation.

1645
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:09,720
It's it's, you know, you know, give did the Red Man comics with the

1646
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,680
the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter and she had the she had trouble with the green,

1647
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:23,160
right, because I guess I guess printing green is hard or something.

1648
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,520
Oh, it makes sense.

1649
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,440
But so I think I mean, I think there are ways to do it.

1650
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,080
Like, I think you you have to do like like digital.

1651
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,400
I think like digital printing can do it.

1652
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,880
It's it's when you're doing like ink printing like CMYK.

1653
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,480
Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:46,440
That producing that kind of green is is difficult to impossible.

1655
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,720
So, you know, I think I'm going to have to go.

1656
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,680
That I think that you know, because slime and punishment obviously has

1657
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:57,520
some greens in there, so I can't I can't skimp on the greens.

1658
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,800
So I have to.

1659
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,400
Yeah, I'm going to go weird without it.

1660
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:02,400
Yeah.

1661
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,880
So I'm going to I'm going to have to spring for probably like the most

1662
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:10,960
expensive like page coloring methods, which is unfortunate.

1663
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,440
But it's just the nature of the beast.

1664
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,760
So I will I will fucking glossy

1665
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,240
prior to go like glossy pages or whatever.

1666
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,240
I don't know.

1667
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,280
I don't know.

1668
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,080
I would like I would like to charge, I don't know.

1669
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:32,080
I guess I was thinking maybe like 30 bucks or something for like a

1670
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,320
for like a hundred and fifty page, you know,

1671
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:41,360
eight, eight by or eight by eleven, eight by twelve,

1672
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,640
maybe an eight by twelve horizontal print, perfect bound, soft cover book.

1673
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,600
I don't know. That sounds nice.

1674
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,760
That sounds about that was about the point I was thinking.

1675
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,800
So, you know, when she's quoting me, oh, it's going to cost thirty dollars

1676
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,800
to print each copy.

1677
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,560
I'm like, well, it's like I was hoping to.

1678
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,320
Yeah, I'm hoping to sell for thirty dollars.

1679
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,440
That's not going to.

1680
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,560
Why would I?

1681
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,600
I just can't.

1682
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,040
It's simply not going to work.

1683
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,520
It's just it's just it's just not going to do it for me.

1684
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,520
Yeah. Well, you know, they say you got to spend money to make money, right?

1685
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,040
Like, maybe maybe you'll make it up in volume, sell them for thirty one.

1686
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:20,240
They say you got to spend money to make money.

1687
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,280
So the so if you can spend,

1688
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:28,040
if you're spending all of the money that you're making, then

1689
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,320
no, it's like a it's like it's like it's like a car.

1690
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,880
No engine, right?

1691
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,360
It's like the the the pressure and the volume

1692
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,520
that you put the curve on the end.

1693
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,400
You put it in and that's the money and then you squeeze it

1694
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,200
and you create a combustion and that's the profit.

1695
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,600
And then you'd see what I'm, you know, yeah.

1696
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,400
And then and then through a through a process of isothermal compression.

1697
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:03,560
That's there you you produce your margins, your margins

1698
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,600
you create you create demand, a butter and guns.

1699
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,280
Yeah. And so on.

1700
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:17,080
I don't need to explain this fairly obvious analogy.

1701
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,960
Yeah, it's simple, simple economics.

1702
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,200
I'll be right back. Can you hold on?

1703
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,040
You know what? I'm going to pee. I'll be right back.

1704
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,080
Quick five here.

1705
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,640
Yo.

1706
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,240
Mm. Open my bathrobe on.

1707
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,080
Cozy. Cozy.

1708
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,920
Yeah.

1709
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,480
So I think I think we're good.

1710
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,240
I think we got a few topics just about time to start the podcast.

1711
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,720
No, no, you know what?

1712
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,960
Now, these topics suck.

1713
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,560
Now, PZP's canceled this week.

1714
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,680
Canceled, fuck it.

1715
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,920
Yeah. No, thanks.

1716
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,920
Nobody wants to hear this.

1717
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,480
True.

1718
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,520
Yeah, I don't know.

1719
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,920
Not a highly eventful week for me.

1720
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,080
We could start voicemails if you want.

1721
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,280
Well, the only other thing I want to talk about.

1722
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,960
Go on. Your favorite topic, cardio.

1723
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,320
I've been I've been killing it lately.

1724
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,200
It's been great. I picked up.

1725
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,720
I picked up a road bicycle.

1726
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:25,520
It's actually a gravel bike, which is a road bicycle like one to ride on the road.

1727
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,760
Yeah, yeah, like, you know, your typical road bicycles,

1728
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:32,240
like it's got drop handlebars that are like hoop shaped, you know,

1729
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,800
and your skinny little tires so you can go fast.

1730
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,120
Oh, as opposed to like a dirt bicycle.

1731
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,600
Yeah, like a mountain bike or something.

1732
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,320
Mountain bike was the word I was looking for.

1733
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,640
Yeah. Yeah. So I picked I picked up a gravel bike,

1734
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:49,520
which is a road bike, but it's got like slightly mountain bike like tires

1735
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,640
so you can go off road a little bit.

1736
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,400
I always I always a OK,

1737
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:59,200
my my dad had like a street bike, a street bicycle,

1738
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,400
and I had like a dirt bicycle as a kid.

1739
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:08,680
I always I always associated that like big, big skinny wheel drop.

1740
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,680
Yeah, hoop handlebar as just being like a grown up bike.

1741
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,520
And I had, yeah, that's that's what I thought the difference.

1742
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,520
It's the adult thing to do.

1743
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,160
To switch to the drop handlebar.

1744
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,320
And now now that I've grown up, I'm 30 years old,

1745
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:29,440
it was it was time for me to forget flat handlebars and move on to the drops.

1746
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,120
I mean, time to time to lose the tread on those tires.

1747
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,760
You know, what?

1748
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,760
Where are you going with that tread, kid? Come on.

1749
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,240
What what mount what mountain specifically are you by?

1750
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,760
Yeah.

1751
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,840
Gotcha. But man, so I picked I picked it up and I've just been

1752
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,920
I've been riding like a maniac.

1753
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,160
I was out a couple of times on the road, even though it's winter

1754
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,320
and it's cold, done like 25 miles on the road.

1755
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:02,520
I picked up these rollers so you can just ride the bike in place

1756
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,160
on like this, these like very belt rollers.

1757
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,600
You just put it up on a device.

1758
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,000
Yeah, there's not, you know, there's there's a couple of different ways

1759
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,360
you can do it. There's some that like hold the bike up that are just like

1760
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,880
it makes it into a stationary bike.

1761
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,400
But what I got is the crazy person version of that, where it's just

1762
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:26,040
there are just some rollers on the floor that you ride on that you can fall off

1763
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,960
of at any time if you stop moving.

1764
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,200
Naturally. Naturally.

1765
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,800
And it's been great. I've been hitting them hard.

1766
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,120
And I love it. It's the best the best cardio I've been doing.

1767
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,680
I've got a treadmill, too.

1768
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,680
It it kicks the crap out of the treadmill.

1769
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:43,920
I'd absolutely recommend the rollers over the treadmill.

1770
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,120
Hmm.

1771
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,360
I mean, biking is like lower impact than like running on a treadmill.

1772
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,280
It's low impact.

1773
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:55,080
But what's great about the rollers is that you cannot stop pedaling, right?

1774
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,840
Because as soon as you stop pedaling, the wheels stop immediately.

1775
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,920
You don't have any actual momentum and you fall over.

1776
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,560
So it's like if you're on there for 25 months, you're on there pedaling hard

1777
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:08,480
for the whole time, the whole you cannot stop.

1778
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:13,840
Wait. So it's like if you stop, if you like get tired and stop pedaling

1779
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,040
what you just you just collapse, the device just implodes.

1780
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,720
Well, you know, the only reason you stay up on a bicycle, right,

1781
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,080
is the gyroscopic effect of the wheels turning, right?

1782
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:28,880
Yes, like if you think about it, it's it's not moving through space.

1783
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,480
It's that the wheels are turning.

1784
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,800
Is that is that the whole reason?

1785
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,360
Yeah, that's it.

1786
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:38,000
It's the gyroscopic like angular momentum of the wheels.

1787
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,840
Yeah, absolutely.

1788
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,840
And their moment resisting, resisting, changing that axis

1789
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,880
is all that keeps you up, right? That's it.

1790
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:53,840
It's it's not like a it's not about like the fact that there's like two wheels

1791
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,800
at once that is like providing like a like a stable like.

1792
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,560
Well, that keeps you going like fulcrum, right?

1793
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,560
Like that you have the two wheels.

1794
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,160
But the reason that you don't like flop over left to right

1795
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,680
is just that gyroscopic stabilization.

1796
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,680
The wheel the the wheels just don't seem heavy enough.

1797
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:12,800
The wheels just don't seem heavy enough to do that.

1798
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,360
Like you're like your body weighs like your body weighs enough.

1799
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,000
Like if you were just OK, I don't know to my

1800
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,000
like if you can hold a bicycle wheel in your hand and spin it

1801
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:28,680
and you can you can you can you can rotate it in your hand even when it's spinning.

1802
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,520
Like the moment like the moment of inertia of a bicycle wheel is not that.

1803
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,120
Well, you say that.

1804
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:38,120
But have you ever sat in like a computer chair,

1805
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:41,800
a chair that can turn and held a spinning bicycle wheel?

1806
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,120
No, what you'll find.

1807
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:48,720
We did this as a physics experiment when I was in when I was in high school.

1808
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:53,320
Oh, does it does it does it like so if you make your chair turn?

1809
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,520
Yeah, if you hold that wheel straight up and down like it would be on the road

1810
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,560
and somebody spins it really fast.

1811
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,920
If you tip that wheel a little bit, it'll turn the chair that you're sitting in.

1812
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,560
Just just so I never did that.

1813
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,000
It doesn't seem like the connection exists.

1814
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,240
Like it could possibly do that, but it does.

1815
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,160
That is crazy.

1816
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,600
It's very cool to see.

1817
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,240
Science rules.

1818
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:19,240
I love science.

1819
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,160
Oh, Neil, the grass Tyson.

1820
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,320
You can only kiss yourself on the lips in a mirror.

1821
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,520
But anyway, so because of that, right, because you have no momentum,

1822
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:36,640
the wheels stop instantly because you're not, you know, you're not actually rolling.

1823
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:40,120
The bike isn't isn't preserving that through physical space, right?

1824
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,600
Wait, sorry, explain to me again, it's on.

1825
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,160
You put the bike on a on a roller.

1826
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,480
What does that mean?

1827
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,240
So imagine a drum, right, like a cylindrical drum.

1828
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,360
And you're just writing, you're writing on top of that.

1829
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,800
So like you have there's two of them on either side of the back wheel

1830
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,640
and it just sits between them.

1831
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,560
And so when the wheel turns, it's right.

1832
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,120
Oh, OK, OK, and then you have one out in front

1833
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:07,800
that's sitting under your front wheel and it's belt driven from your back wheel.

1834
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,360
So so as you spin those rear rollers, it also spins that front roller.

1835
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,280
Are you are you directly spinning the roller with your pedaling

1836
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:23,160
or is just like the the wheel is turning and it's spinning the tire is touching

1837
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:27,280
the roller and it got so it turns the roller and then that drives the front roller

1838
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,480
which drives your front wheel.

1839
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,520
So you'll come to think of it.

1840
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,280
I think I saw you post a video of you.

1841
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,400
Yeah, I post a little video.

1842
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,720
That's what I'm doing.

1843
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,320
Mm hmm. And yeah.

1844
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,840
So the moment you stop pedaling, the wheels stop turning

1845
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,240
like almost immediately within a second or two.

1846
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,040
And then very straight.

1847
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:46,440
Well, as soon as you lose that stabilization, right, like you got to put your foot down.

1848
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,320
Oh, so it's not like because when you're riding a bike,

1849
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,640
you can just kind of coast sometimes. Exactly.

1850
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:52,560
So that's what I'm saying.

1851
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,120
You get some speed up and you can just coast down a hill

1852
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,000
or just coast on a long stretch.

1853
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,600
I see. Yeah. Yeah.

1854
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,640
You can't you simply cannot.

1855
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,960
You simply cannot do that.

1856
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,280
So it ends up being this crazy cardio workout.

1857
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,880
Oh, I think it's great.

1858
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:07,920
It's really cool.

1859
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,840
I have. Well, I have not been doing cardio, but I have been

1860
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:15,840
counting calories very strictly.

1861
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:19,720
And I think I've lost a little bit of weight and I feel pretty good about that.

1862
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:23,120
I think I could could lose a little bit more, but I think I'm on track.

1863
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,560
So that's that's good.

1864
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:29,640
That's great. That's I mean, and as as we all know,

1865
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,480
as everyone here knows, the only way to lose weight is a calorie deficit

1866
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,320
and anything else is bullshit.

1867
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,880
That's true.

1868
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,560
Oh, but.

1869
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:40,840
Oh, but I got this.

1870
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:45,120
Oh, but I got this device that like puts a like a like a rubber belt around my midriff

1871
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:50,280
and like vibrates my my my my torso flash.

1872
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:55,320
And those definitely

1873
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,840
those will stiffen you right up for sure.

1874
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,160
They they move the fat to a more to a to a better region.

1875
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:07,160
They move the fat into my biceps, where they look like big muscles.

1876
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,120
Actually,

1877
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:16,360
they squeeze, they squeeze the fat upwards into my upper back.

1878
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,360
So it looks like I have big bulging deltoid or

1879
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,360
I have big bulging lats on the sides when I when I flex.

1880
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,080
Which is very cool.

1881
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,040
Very cool.

1882
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:31,080
You get the wings when you lift and you want those wings on stage.

1883
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,080
Yes, you get those 10 out of 10s.

1884
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,520
Oh, wonderful.

1885
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:39,520
Very good. Yeah.

1886
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,080
It's too cold to exercise.

1887
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,520
Yeah, that's why that's why I did it.

1888
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,240
That's why I got the rollers, because I want to be hitting this bike hard

1889
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,480
like all summer.

1890
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:53,920
You know, I want to go on some big like multiple days long, maybe bike rides.

1891
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,280
Do a little do a little bike packing as they call it out there.

1892
01:39:58,520 --> 01:39:59,440
So I'm getting ready.

1893
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,080
I'm amping up.

1894
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:04,040
That's cool. Yeah, that's good.

1895
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,240
You know, I have a new phone.

1896
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,840
This is this is this is some bitch, baby shit.

1897
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,600
But I have a new phone that actually works now and I downloaded Pokemon Go.

1898
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,440
Wow, the last time I lost a bunch of weight,

1899
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:22,360
part of the reason why was because I was I was calorie deficit.

1900
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:27,400
I was keto and I was walking around playing Pokemon Go like every day.

1901
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,560
That was my workout.

1902
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:32,360
And, you know, it was it worked for what I was trying to do.

1903
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:37,360
Yeah, I mean, it does not take very much to like get that that muscle activation,

1904
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,960
you know, literally just walking around for a while is actually huge.

1905
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,640
It actually would otherwise not be moving.

1906
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,680
It's huge.

1907
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:47,920
What? I lost like I lost like 40 pounds in like six months.

1908
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,560
Yeah, I believe us. Yeah.

1909
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,800
Yeah, I should I should do that at the very least.

1910
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:58,960
For sure. No moving at all is is bad.

1911
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:00,560
It was very bad.

1912
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,120
I mean, if I were you, I would definitely be like jogging around the block.

1913
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,640
You got a pretty decent area where you could be jogging.

1914
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,920
Yeah, it could be jogging.

1915
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,320
I could be jogging. I got a little loop.

1916
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,720
That's a little tricky, though, because as soon as you start doing that,

1917
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,240
it's like, well, now you're going to be producing a lot of sweaty laundry.

1918
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,720
And like, if you don't have the right shoes, you're going to hurt your feet

1919
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:25,160
and stuff and ends up being kind of somehow it ends up being expensive.

1920
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,280
It's kind of hard.

1921
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,480
I you're that's true.

1922
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,560
And I I I hate running.

1923
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,760
I've always hated running.

1924
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:39,840
Uh, yeah, I'd rather just only there was some way to exercise

1925
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,960
from the comfort of my own home.

1926
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,360
Man, it's only yeah, I've got I've got this whole great

1927
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,360
regiment that's been working out great for me.

1928
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:54,720
I only do like four body weight strength exercises and I do my you've got those.

1929
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:55,920
You've got those rings.

1930
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,000
You've got those hanging rings.

1931
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,320
I've got the rings and all I do with those.

1932
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:03,000
All I do with them is what they call, I think, an Australian pull up,

1933
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:07,800
which is where Australian is that when like you lean back on your heels?

1934
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,360
Yeah, you lean back in your heels and you can do a pull up

1935
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:13,760
and you adjust the rope length to to adjust the intensity.

1936
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:18,800
And I've just got to set to where I can do like 20 of them to adjust like the angle, right?

1937
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,600
So you're kind of on your heels, lean back and you're sort of pulling yourself

1938
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,160
up and forward. Yeah, exactly.

1939
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1940
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,600
So I do those.

1941
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,640
I'll do body weight squats.

1942
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:32,520
I'll do push ups.

1943
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,480
And then I also do a calf extension on stairs.

1944
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:39,760
And those four things together, combined with like going for a run

1945
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,960
or hitting the rollers on the bike is like crazy, great, full body workout.

1946
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,400
And it doesn't even take that long, which is nice, too.

1947
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:54,280
Well, I have not been lifting for I have not been lifting since New Year's,

1948
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,200
which, oh, God, two months.

1949
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,960
It's almost two months now, but it's a long time.

1950
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,480
Yeah, it's pretty.

1951
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,720
But I'm actually I'm actually for real going to start again soon.

1952
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,280
I swear. I promise.

1953
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,480
I swear, guys, I'm going to start soon.

1954
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,480
Oh, really?

1955
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,680
My games.

1956
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:14,960
Do you know if, you know, if Kazi Munchie are lifting?

1957
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,320
They are they're not.

1958
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,720
They have they have also not been.

1959
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:23,720
But I think I think we're all we're all on board of like,

1960
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,840
let's we've got to stop fucking around.

1961
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,880
Man, no excuse for them because, like, the stuff's there.

1962
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,520
They got it. Yeah.

1963
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,920
Just go downstairs, start lifting.

1964
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,680
What's the problem? You know?

1965
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:36,520
Yeah, true. Calling him out. Calling him out.

1966
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,920
I'm the I'm the cheerleader.

1967
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:44,400
Yeah, I keep the motivation going.

1968
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,720
Without you, without you.

1969
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,320
Keep everyone's spirits high.

1970
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,520
The morale's too low.

1971
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,880
Exactly. Exactly.

1972
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:57,320
That's that's me. I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a hype man.

1973
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,400
You know, I'm a positive influence.

1974
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,680
When you think of Ben St, you think positive attitude, hype.

1975
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,480
Famously.

1976
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,480
Yeah, the two those two things.

1977
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,920
Positive attitude and I.

1978
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,800
Put those on my tombstone.

1979
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,280
Do you what do you think?

1980
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,160
Voigt voicemail?

1981
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:26,040
Can we start up a voicemail?

1982
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:30,600
OK, let me let me check if we've gotten any last minute.

1983
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:33,680
No. All right.

1984
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,760
Let me grab the first one here.

1985
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,800
Where did I put it?

1986
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:45,480
OK, the first one of the day is called

1987
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:54,120
Re folks with bad animation takes from pronouns at she dot her.

1988
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,000
OK, sounds promising.

1989
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,960
People, some bad bad animation takes folks with that animation takes.

1990
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:03,080
There we go. All right.

1991
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:05,040
Three, two, one, go.

1992
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,160
I was listening to episode 300 when you're talking about people

1993
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:10,080
who think lower frame rates inherently look bad.

1994
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,720
And I have a theory as to why throughout its entire history,

1995
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,600
animation is generally been looked down upon by the mainstream as something

1996
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,760
that, well, perhaps good is always of less value and more disposable than live action,

1997
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,880
something for kids or for cookie cutter sitcoms.

1998
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:25,440
Beyond that, the masses don't see animation as a worthy art form in itself.

1999
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,480
It's only valuable in the ways that can create a facsimile of reality.

2000
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,840
In other words, people want to forget they're looking at a drawing as much as possible.

2001
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,360
That's why Disney movies all used full animation, then went to 3D animation,

2002
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,320
and they're now getting remade in live action.

2003
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:40,240
Even though these are all equally valuable mediums, the stigma against

2004
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:44,040
animation means most people see them in a hierarchy with most realistic at the top.

2005
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,320
That's why Spider-Verse looks bad to these people.

2006
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,680
For as well done as it can be, all of its stylistic flourishes are meant to remind

2007
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:52,480
you that you're looking at a bunch of drawings as much as possible.

2008
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,400
It's easy to misdiagnosis issue as people just not knowing enough about animation,

2009
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,280
but that's just a side effect, not the cause.

2010
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,600
You don't need to know the techniques to think Spider-Verse looks incredible.

2011
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,960
But if you're the type of person who isn't interested in the unique artistic

2012
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,720
merit of animation in the first place, you're just naturally not going to know

2013
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:12,320
what you need to talk about when you try to critique it and end up sounding like an idiot.

2014
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,040
Upsounding like an idiot.

2015
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:17,480
So low frame rate draws attention to the artifice.

2016
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,680
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely some truth to that.

2017
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:27,680
If you're there and if you're there to appreciate the skill of that artifice,

2018
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,480
it's like, hell, yeah, but if you're.

2019
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:38,080
My dad, my dad is someone who is just like not interested in animation at all,

2020
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:41,720
except he did think Toy Story was pretty great.

2021
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,120
Like he thought that like, wow, they made a whole movie in a computer.

2022
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,400
That's crazy.

2023
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,400
A whole movie fit in a computer?

2024
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,640
Jesus.

2025
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:54,120
He thought that the 3D of Toy Story was pretty was pretty great.

2026
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,120
But he's not interested in animation.

2027
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:02,400
So I could see my dad being like shaking his head at a low frame rate

2028
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,480
because it would draw attention to the artifice of it.

2029
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,960
Yeah, well, I mean, what's a what's a low frame rate like 12?

2030
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,120
You know, because I'm sure Toy Story was probably on 24, right?

2031
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,280
Like, I doubt it was. Gosh, no idea.

2032
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,680
It was probably 20 frames.

2033
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,400
Well, have you have you seen Spider-Verse?

2034
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,960
I have not seen it, but I know what it I'm really not into that sort of thing.

2035
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,120
But I know what it looks like.

2036
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:29,200
Yeah, yeah, it looks like a bunch of comic book type things

2037
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,480
kind of glued together, different styles.

2038
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:35,640
Yeah, it has it has sort of a sort of a jerky

2039
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,720
sort of a low frame rate kind of like stop.

2040
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,960
Well, it's got it's got sort of a mixed frame rate

2041
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,680
appearance where like different things are are sort of different different

2042
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:47,400
frame rates and you've got the low frame rate action pieces.

2043
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,040
Yeah, you know, which is which school?

2044
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,280
Cool aesthetic choice.

2045
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,720
I think I think I think I think this person is is right.

2046
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,520
Yeah, that probably is that probably is part of it.

2047
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:05,200
OK, next one is called Sorry if I'm mean.

2048
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:07,200
His videos are OK.

2049
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,280
Three, two, one, go.

2050
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,600
So you know how Ben doesn't like Saber Spark

2051
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,040
or at least he doesn't like his voice.

2052
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:18,200
Well, you know, I could listen to a Saber Spark video,

2053
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:22,440
but my friend texting me about the new Lockston video.

2054
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,840
I'm just like, you can listen to Lockston Lockston like that guy's voice.

2055
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,760
If you if you haven't heard him, he makes a Pokemon videos,

2056
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,440
but I give it a listen.

2057
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,720
It's something else. Geez.

2058
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:39,400
OK, I don't know who that is either.

2059
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,960
OK, it's it's it's Lockston and Noggin, right?

2060
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,200
Is the channel you tell me?

2061
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,000
I don't know. I don't know anything about that.

2062
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,240
I'm seeing it on the wiki tubia, though.

2063
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:52,920
I don't know.

2064
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:56,520
I've definitely seen a Lockston and Noggin video before.

2065
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:00,720
OK, wait, this this is Noggin.

2066
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:03,960
Oh, shit, I accidentally clicked on a Noggin when I was looking for a Lockston.

2067
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,560
Stupid fool classic blunder.

2068
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,880
We've all been there. There's Noggin, Noggin.

2069
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,080
Wait.

2070
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:21,080
I'm like, I'm confused.

2071
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:22,120
They all say Noggin.

2072
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,080
Maybe the ones that don't say Noggin.

2073
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,120
Are Lockston.

2074
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:32,560
Um, I think it's all the same guy, though, right?

2075
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,080
I'm looking on wiki tubia here.

2076
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:38,320
It just says Austin Lockwood is better known online as Lockston and Noggin.

2077
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,200
I think it would be.

2078
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,520
Why would he be Lockston and Noggin if it's one guy?

2079
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,640
I think it's just one guy.

2080
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:51,640
Well, I listen to like five seconds of him and he sounds like a you.

2081
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,720
He sounds like a YouTuber.

2082
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:56,680
Yeah, I don't know.

2083
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,840
OK, sure. Yeah, yeah, sure.

2084
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,600
He's annoying. Yeah, annoying.

2085
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,840
But whatever. So is everybody.

2086
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,520
I mean, that guy was very in the lead, though.

2087
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,000
He's saying he likes listening to.

2088
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,960
Saberspark. Saberspark videos.

2089
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,040
I don't know. I don't personally.

2090
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:13,360
I also don't.

2091
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,480
I also don't personally, but that's OK.

2092
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,080
I'm not his audience.

2093
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:18,280
Absolutely.

2094
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:23,240
As as definitionally proven by the fact that I don't watch his videos.

2095
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:29,440
OK, next one is called.

2096
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:36,760
Ben St is a grease puddle on the floor of a fast food.

2097
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,080
OK, there it is. Three, two, one, go.

2098
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,280
If I've done my calculations correctly,

2099
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:52,120
then this will be going on to episode three hundred and two.

2100
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,480
Good so far. Yeah.

2101
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:57,000
Ben St, give and take. Hello.

2102
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,280
You brought up in a conversation about smiling friends,

2103
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,760
how there was a grease puddle.

2104
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:07,520
I am whatever episode.

2105
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:12,560
But you failed to mention because you probably didn't know.

2106
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,720
But Psycho Pebbles, the guy who made that show.

2107
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,880
Psycho Pebbles, not Psycho Pebbles.

2108
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:20,760
Weston Chandler to do the voice of that grease pub.

2109
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:25,080
We did mention that because, Chris, we know why.

2110
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,720
We did mention that.

2111
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,960
Harry Partridge to do an impression of Chris.

2112
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:33,280
And if you watched the episode, Ben St.

2113
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,440
Shut up. You probably, you know, hear that.

2114
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,600
And you'd be like, oh, wow, I appreciate that.

2115
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,640
Yeah, I'm sure that's how you would be.

2116
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:45,240
You would be like, oh, I appreciate that.

2117
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:52,360
Yeah, I'd be I'd be blown away to hear Harry Partridge's voice in a in a cartoon.

2118
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,040
Such an irregular medium for the man.

2119
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

2120
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,840
Dude, we literally talked about that exact thing.

2121
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:08,600
But OK, I'm sure that you did because I actually I listened to the last podcast and I heard that.

2122
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,600
Yeah, exactly.

2123
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,200
What a fool. What a fool.

2124
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,840
Maybe maybe he well, he really he left this five days ago, so he must have left this.

2125
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:21,600
Oh, yeah, maybe he left this before that episode.

2126
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:22,800
So maybe that's explained.

2127
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,640
That's all.

2128
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,120
Yeah.

2129
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,360
Next one is Revelations, the secret to good content.

2130
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,560
Three, two, one, go.

2131
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:38,840
I remembered Vic and Hope and I've been listening to them real good.

2132
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:44,760
It's really good to hear somebody be talking about people that I like to think about,

2133
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,080
I.e. Ben St.

2134
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,320
Did they talk about talking about his gripes?

2135
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,520
It's been saying really good stuff.

2136
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:56,920
I could listen to people complaining about Ben St. for hours.

2137
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,520
What did he say?

2138
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:02,840
That's why I can go back and listen to old episodes of podcasts and just

2139
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,000
not get tired of them.

2140
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:05,880
What did he say?

2141
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,000
Secret. Fuck you.

2142
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,440
Yeah, secret to good content is if it's about people that I know who they are.

2143
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:16,360
I like to hear my friends make fun of my other friends,

2144
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,360
except none of them are my friends.

2145
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,320
Listen, he did not he did not give any context

2146
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:27,000
as to what what Vic and Hope conversation he is talking about.

2147
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,880
So I'm just going to I'm just going to throw that in my mental trash can.

2148
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:32,400
Yeah.

2149
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,640
Unclear fever means like contemporaneous content or or historical.

2150
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:43,680
Yeah. Like he knows if if if if I would be interested

2151
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,120
if Vic if Vic is I doubt this.

2152
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,120
This doesn't seem like something Vic would do.

2153
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:52,520
But if Vic were like bitching about me and making fun of me or whatever

2154
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:55,880
on Vic and Hope like these days, I would be interested to hear it.

2155
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,280
Let me know if that's the case.

2156
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,120
I'm going to assume it's not the case.

2157
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:01,760
Yeah, I'd be surprised because I'd be surprised.

2158
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:03,000
What would he have to say?

2159
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:03,560
Nothing.

2160
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,960
Well, he haven't done anything to him.

2161
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:10,400
He commented on the documentary.

2162
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:15,000
Just to say, like he said, like, oh, damn,

2163
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:17,840
forgot I put like tons of work into this.

2164
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,080
Sorry, I wasted my life on this.

2165
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,080
Yeah. Yeah.

2166
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,920
Yeah, basically.

2167
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:32,160
Next, Shade Shade was a replying to some tweets of mine recently.

2168
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:32,760
I saw that.

2169
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:36,000
So so I have to assume that I'm that I'm cool,

2170
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,160
that I'm square with the Collins Brothers

2171
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:44,120
because if one likes me than the other months, I mean,

2172
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:45,640
I think you're doing fine.

2173
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,080
I think you're doing fine.

2174
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,080
I hope so. I like Vic.

2175
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:53,240
So, you know, yeah, I agree.

2176
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,000
Vic, if you hate me, we know.

2177
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,120
Seems like a nice.

2178
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,560
He seems handsome.

2179
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,680
He seems handsome.

2180
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:02,360
So it's going to be OK.

2181
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,560
Hmm.

2182
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,200
Hmm.

2183
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:10,240
Next, next voicemail is called

2184
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,320
Ben St.

2185
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:15,240
Character Inconsistencies, parentheses, retcons.

2186
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:18,800
Question mark three, two, one, go.

2187
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,160
OK, so in the retcon two documentary commentary track,

2188
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:29,440
the character of Ben St refers to the Digi Cat as a quote, good cat, unquote.

2189
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,960
This is a complete contradiction.

2190
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:37,080
No, earlier views where the character Ben St clearly despises the cat

2191
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:40,840
exemplified in his sonic to one on one

2192
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:44,720
lecture where he demands that the cat be removed from his premises

2193
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,360
with pure malice in his eyes and hate in his demeanor and voice.

2194
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:51,000
I forgot about that. Yeah, he's the Ben St.

2195
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:52,320
I yelled at you.

2196
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,840
Inconsistence.

2197
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,400
Yeah, I forgot.

2198
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,120
I yelled at somebody got fired for that one.

2199
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:04,560
Lala was being Lala was very rarely annoying.

2200
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:08,880
She just happened to want to sit in a very inconvenient spot that day.

2201
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:13,160
It was unusual behavior for her that she she made me.

2202
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,400
She she irritated me on this set.

2203
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:17,800
This was somebody's actual cat.

2204
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,840
Yeah, that was Trixie's cat.

2205
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,120
And her or her parents.

2206
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:26,600
Okay, Lala short for Key Lala after the the boomerang girl from Inuyasha.

2207
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:29,960
That's embarrassing, but OK.

2208
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,520
OK, her cat who would

2209
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:38,960
who once who once caught a flying squirrel out of the air and left it torn in half

2210
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:42,120
at our back door on the porch.

2211
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,480
What a sweetie.

2212
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:46,000
Lala was a Lala was a good cat and she was a good cat.

2213
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:50,200
She was an outdoor cat and she would pretty much just leave you alone

2214
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,600
most of the time.

2215
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:55,120
Well, I think, you know,

2216
01:56:55,120 --> 01:57:00,320
if I were to characterize the Ben take on cats, I don't think you're a fan usually.

2217
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:04,200
I'm OK with them, but like they

2218
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:09,280
know, I like them, but I don't like when they're annoying.

2219
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,840
I just I just don't like when they're annoying.

2220
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,200
Sometimes they can be annoying.

2221
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,960
I guess. So, you know, and there was right.

2222
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,360
She wanted to be in a place where it was inconvenient.

2223
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:20,360
And so, you know, it makes sense. Yeah, yeah.

2224
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,720
So I so I had to so I had to verbally abuse the cat.

2225
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:28,560
I saw in a public display of

2226
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:34,560
Ranker, the next one is called

2227
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:40,360
Ben St sings the PCP theme three to one go.

2228
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:44,560
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2229
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

2230
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
That's right.

2231
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,160
I want to drink.

2232
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:54,240
Come on, I love.

2233
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,760
Come on, I love.

2234
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,720
Come on, and my name is Ben.

2235
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:07,160
Just as I remember it, how do they how do they get this recording of me singing

2236
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:09,600
that in to myself in private?

2237
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:15,560
Yeah, sorry, you had to hear that, everypony.

2238
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,120
Next voicemail is called Bibi three to one go.

2239
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,120
OK, good. Good.

2240
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:34,800
Yep. Next one is called What's up, YouTube three to one go.

2241
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:36,720
What's up, guys?

2242
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,640
Sorry, I haven't made a voicemail in a while.

2243
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:41,440
We're going to get right into it, but don't forget to smash that like button.

2244
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:45,840
Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google, plus, Imgur and Mastodon.

2245
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:50,280
All right. First things first, we're going to respond to the response to this voicemail.

2246
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,600
Go.

2247
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,520
It was a little short, a little short for a YouTube intro.

2248
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:02,360
I met I met someone who used Mastodon

2249
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:06,200
at Anne Annie.

2250
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:10,480
We were talking about Psycholonials in line for registration

2251
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:17,240
and someone behind us in line chimed in about it.

2252
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:23,800
It was I was describing my my argument with Lady Emily and Sarah Zed

2253
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:26,840
on Twitter about Psycholonials.

2254
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,360
Did you see that? By the way, I don't think I did.

2255
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:34,080
OK, I was just because you know who they are.

2256
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:38,520
No. OK, well, Sarah, Sarah Zed is a YouTuber

2257
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:42,960
and Lady Emily is also a YouTuber, but also is Sarah Zed's editor.

2258
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,400
Oh, is Sarah like the the Lindsay Ellis type?

2259
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,520
Sort of. Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

2260
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,840
Yeah, I think I've seen I think I've seen her.

2261
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:57,760
Well, she Lady Emily read Psycholonials and didn't like it.

2262
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:00,560
I kind of replied to say I kind of liked it.

2263
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:04,120
But I also agreed with some of the stuff she said.

2264
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:11,240
And then Sarah Zed chimed in in response to me to say.

2265
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,520
I'm I'm I'm going to paraphrase

2266
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:18,120
because I don't want to go and like read the tweets all verbatim.

2267
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,160
But I really think I'm not being unfair

2268
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,920
when I characterize her complaints about Psycholonials as

2269
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:28,440
the character does bad things, therefore, the story is bad.

2270
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:33,280
She she basically she listed a bunch of things that.

2271
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:36,760
The main character does that are bad

2272
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:40,080
and says that she's not punished for them.

2273
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:43,600
Actually, Ben, if you think about it,

2274
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:47,320
a lot of people died as a result of her careless actions.

2275
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,040
Like like literally, that's what she that's what she said.

2276
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:54,360
She said like the character did bad things and and like

2277
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:58,080
and there's no punishment in the story for her and it's bad.

2278
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:00,800
And I was like, OK, well, those are all

2279
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:04,120
like I'm pretty sure you're meant to know that those things she does are bad.

2280
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,760
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

2281
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:10,160
And she said she said like her answer was like,

2282
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:15,520
well, Hussie's real Andrew Hussie's real life friends

2283
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:18,120
think that cyberbullying is good.

2284
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,600
Therefore, it's it's weird that Hussie wrote a story

2285
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:26,600
about someone who does bad things to people that harass them online.

2286
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:30,640
And I'm like, look, I don't know what to say to that.

2287
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:33,200
I don't know what Hussie's friends think.

2288
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:36,200
I just I read this and I'm like, it's pretty clear

2289
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,200
that what she's doing is bad, actually.

2290
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:41,200
And I didn't need.

2291
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:43,600
Like the fact like the fact that her friend.

2292
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:47,960
OK, Sarah said that the only like the only like consequence

2293
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:52,920
in the story that that Z faces is that it makes her friend Abby sad.

2294
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,120
Yeah. And like, yes, that's true.

2295
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,280
All the only bad, the only thing that affects

2296
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,840
Z does terrible things.

2297
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,120
And the only time she thinks, oh, this is bad

2298
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:09,120
is because after enough bad things, Abby gets sad.

2299
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:11,520
And I don't know.

2300
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:14,840
To me, it's it's like, well, Abby's not good either.

2301
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:16,120
Abby's also bad.

2302
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:19,280
Abby is kind of like a freak for just kind of going along with it.

2303
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,480
Yeah. I mean, the whole the whole story is they're like

2304
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,640
in Florida. You've read it.

2305
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,760
Yeah, I read the whole thing.

2306
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:28,400
And it's like, OK, they're supposed to be kind of unlikable bad people.

2307
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,200
That's the idea. Yeah, they're definitely not.

2308
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:35,240
You're you're definitely not supposed to spoilers like, you know,

2309
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:40,400
see her like send death squads after people that harass her online and be like,

2310
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,160
oh, man, this is like Hussie's wish fulfillment.

2311
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:46,520
Hussie thinks this is good, actually queen.

2312
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:49,120
I'm glad someone's finally saying that we need.

2313
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:52,720
We need death squads.

2314
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,520
So I'll just I don't know.

2315
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:59,480
I mean, and so you see, you see, you see it reflected in Abby, right?

2316
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,360
That that what she is doing is bad.

2317
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,960
That is the punishment. It makes sense.

2318
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,000
It's like, yeah, we don't need her to literally go to jail or something.

2319
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,200
That's so true.

2320
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:09,760
Like Abby, yeah, like, like, what do you want?

2321
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:13,760
Like, like, oh, yeah, she becomes a dictator and starts sending death squads out.

2322
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,840
And then her best friend is like, wow, I hate what's happening here.

2323
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:20,840
And and Z is like, oh, darn, I guess what I did was bad.

2324
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:22,640
It's like, you know, what do you want?

2325
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,080
She sees the consequences of her actions.

2326
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:26,600
She sees the weight of everything.

2327
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:28,920
And it's like, oh, now you're left with the moral choice.

2328
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:32,280
And it's magnified to this like universally large scale.

2329
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,800
But it's the same as any other story.

2330
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:36,400
It's like, oh, I'm going to stop doing the bad thing.

2331
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:41,080
And I'm going to choose love and friendship over over tyranny and power.

2332
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:44,320
And it's like, OK, yeah, that same as every story.

2333
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,960
I don't see I don't see what the specific complaint is.

2334
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:49,200
It's just like, I'll be I'll be honest.

2335
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:55,160
My my read of it is is basically just Sarah's Sarah, Sarah Zed.

2336
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:58,400
And therefore, Emma, Lady Emily, because Sarah Zed thinks whatever

2337
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,680
Emma, whatever Sarah Emily thinks, whatever Sarah.

2338
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,640
Yeah, they just don't like Hussie.

2339
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:06,080
And they read lots of bad and ill intent into the story of

2340
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:08,240
Psycholonials because they think he's bad man.

2341
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:10,160
Yeah. I mean, that's what it sounds like.

2342
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:14,080
I feel like Hussie didn't even have really anything to say with Psycholonial seat.

2343
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:17,480
He had he had the opportunity to say so much more.

2344
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:20,640
It was just he chose not to and it was kind of meaningless.

2345
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:21,880
I totally agree.

2346
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:23,880
I completely I completely agree.

2347
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:28,320
I think if there's anything to criticize, it's it's the lack of of of meaning.

2348
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:32,480
Yeah, really, really, the criticism from my perspective is that it's exactly

2349
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:36,880
what what Sarah Zed is wishing it was, which is a story where someone does bad

2350
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:39,840
things, realizes they were wrong and and and watch it.

2351
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,880
And it's just like, well, it shouldn't have done that.

2352
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,480
Shouldn't have done that.

2353
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:47,440
OK, I'll say there was another thing.

2354
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,840
She sort of just mentioned this in one of her posts.

2355
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:53,880
She said that like she mentioned that like it goes on.

2356
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:58,920
You know, I'll just I'll just read this one, actually, because this this one

2357
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:01,080
I this one is baffling to me.

2358
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:05,000
What's her name? Mary Sue, writer.

2359
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:07,320
Yes.

2360
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,560
I'm going to find the exact one because because I don't want to misquote.

2361
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:14,360
I don't want to I don't want to mischaracterize this.

2362
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:15,760
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

2363
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:20,520
You tell me what you think when you when you hear this.

2364
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,520
OK, there is zero mention of the fact that her group is mostly made up

2365
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:35,600
of white people occupying indigenous land, save for one offhanded comment by her friend.

2366
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:45,320
This is in the middle of a bunch of other statements, but this one stood out to me.

2367
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,000
And not in a good way.

2368
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,760
Yeah, I mean, it's made up of white people.

2369
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:52,440
They're all wearing white clown makeup.

2370
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:54,800
So first of all, I don't know.

2371
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:57,480
How do you know that?

2372
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:00,960
How do you know they're all they're all supposed to be white people?

2373
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:07,440
I'm and second of all, I don't know, Nantucket indigenous land,

2374
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:11,240
like maybe once upon a time.

2375
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:15,600
Yeah, I'm sure that it was like a Wampanoag settlement.

2376
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:17,640
At some point, but it's like.

2377
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:20,560
But like today, it's like it's like white people.

2378
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:22,880
Yeah. And really, I mean, what is the story?

2379
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:26,440
If not a complaint that rich white people are on the island, you know,

2380
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:29,800
that it's a waste of space and a stupid vacation destination.

2381
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:34,360
To today, like that is the story is that it's terrible.

2382
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,560
What we've done to it today.

2383
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:42,760
Today, the ethnic makeup of Nantucket is eighty seven point four percent white non Hispanic,

2384
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,800
three percent black or African American,

2385
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,600
etc, etc, whatever, it's white people.

2386
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:53,640
So like, I don't know, man, like,

2387
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:58,840
Psychologials is definitely not the story of the of the Jew of Z's

2388
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:04,240
Jew of Z's white jubilites coming and colonizing the the indigenous

2389
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,360
Nantucket Island.

2390
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,640
Like that's not what that's not what happens.

2391
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:11,800
Like certainly, certainly that sucks that that happened.

2392
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:16,120
But it's like what what the story is is like looking at the present

2393
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:18,400
condition of Nantucket and why that sucks.

2394
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:21,640
Right. Yeah. And I think that's totally valid.

2395
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:23,920
You don't need to tell the other story to tell this story.

2396
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:27,600
Hmm. What do you mean by the other story?

2397
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:31,920
I mean, you don't have to include like, oh, it's bad that that white people

2398
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,240
have colonized it like it's bad that rich people are there currently.

2399
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:37,680
Like that is currently a problem.

2400
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:38,480
I don't know, man.

2401
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:43,080
That just doesn't even seem germane at all to the story of Psychologials.

2402
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:48,600
That's just just to just seem like a bizarre thing to even bring up

2403
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
in a discussion. Yeah.

2404
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,440
So I guess I got to say, I'm not impressed with Emily and Sarah's

2405
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:57,040
takes on Psychologials.

2406
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,760
What it is is just that it's like, oh, sure.

2407
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:02,000
Sure, he's making this message, but he could have done more.

2408
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,840
And it's like, you could all you could always do more.

2409
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:08,200
You could. Did you see if you read if you read Homestuck?

2410
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,320
No. OK.

2411
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:13,080
Well, you know who Jan Measley is?

2412
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:16,000
No. Sorry. OK.

2413
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:22,640
A guy, a YouTube guy who I'm fond of, he made of he had a patron reward

2414
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,320
thing that he promised.

2415
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:27,800
He promised to make a Homestuck video, and he recently did.

2416
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:31,080
And I watched it and it was OK.

2417
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,000
I was actually a little disappointed in it.

2418
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,560
It wasn't a great video. It was all right.

2419
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:39,520
He points out a bunch of things that suck about Homestuck, and he's totally

2420
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:42,240
right that all of those things suck about Homestuck.

2421
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:45,240
The.

2422
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:51,800
There was there was one he again, he points out some things

2423
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:56,720
that Homestuck doesn't do like it specifically doesn't make a point

2424
02:08:56,720 --> 02:09:03,680
about how like social hierarchies are artificial and arbitrary.

2425
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:08,480
Like it specifically does not make that point because in troll society,

2426
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:13,360
the blood hierarchy is extremely not arbitrary.

2427
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:17,400
And there are extremely obvious like physiological differences

2428
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:21,880
between the cast members, the members of the different cast, right?

2429
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:26,520
So it's like it's it's he makes he says like it's setting.

2430
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:29,800
It's set up almost as though it's going to make a point like that.

2431
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,360
And then it just doesn't.

2432
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:34,360
And like, I agree with what he's saying.

2433
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,560
Like, yeah, it could have made that point.

2434
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:37,560
But also.

2435
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:41,040
I think it's I think it's a little petty to be like.

2436
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:46,600
This like the story bad because it didn't make a point I wanted it to make.

2437
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:50,280
Yeah, yeah, I it's really the same criticism criticism.

2438
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,680
It's like, yeah, it could have done more.

2439
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,520
You could definitely have done more.

2440
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:56,680
But I don't know if they didn't want to do that.

2441
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,000
So I mean, I don't want to I don't want to defend

2442
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,200
Homestuck too hard because it definitely sucks.

2443
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:06,760
A lot of it does.

2444
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:08,600
So but that I don't know that.

2445
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:14,560
Yeah, it's just like a point to something that's not there and be like,

2446
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:15,600
why isn't that there?

2447
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,040
And like, well, I don't know.

2448
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:18,480
Yeah, man. Yeah.

2449
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:20,560
And, you know, yeah, it's tough.

2450
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:22,200
It's tough because maybe it should be.

2451
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:25,160
But like, I don't know, not everything is going to be the perfect

2452
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:28,680
enlightened criticism of of society that you'd want it to be.

2453
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,600
Unfortunately, like, it's just you can't fit it all in to everything.

2454
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,040
Like it's good.

2455
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2456
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:38,640
It's a shame.

2457
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,840
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, Sarah.

2458
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:46,800
Sorry, Emily, you're you're you're going in the trash.

2459
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,400
I was I got I was a little annoyed.

2460
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:54,280
I was I was a little bit annoyed with Sarah and Emily.

2461
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,640
I thought they were being a little bit shitty about it.

2462
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,840
I was trying to be they seemed a little bit mad.

2463
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:03,400
They seemed a little bit annoyed at me for like defending it.

2464
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:06,080
And I got I felt it felt like it was personal to them.

2465
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:08,920
And I didn't really like it.

2466
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:12,720
I didn't come away with a positive feeling about them after that interaction.

2467
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:16,120
Yeah, but that's OK.

2468
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:18,400
That's OK.

2469
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:24,640
Next voicemail is called See you next week.

2470
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:27,200
Three, two, one, go.

2471
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:29,560
Well, that was a pretty cringe take.

2472
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:31,440
But what else could we expect?

2473
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,200
All right, let's get on to the next segment.

2474
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:37,800
We got a voicemail coming in from Ben, Saint and Gibb and take go.

2475
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:47,200
Should the voicemailers make it a lot of assumptions about the cast this week?

2476
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,200
Well, there's well, there's another voicemail called See you next week.

2477
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,320
So maybe I'll just go right into that one.

2478
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:57,400
Three, two, one, go.

2479
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,760
Well, I was not expecting that.

2480
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,640
All right. Well, thanks for showing up, everyone.

2481
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:02,840
We'll see you again next week.

2482
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:06,200
Just smash that like button, subscribe, ring that bell.

2483
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:08,480
Find me on socials, you know, the deal.

2484
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:12,600
Don't little little bit of a swing and a miss with that second one.

2485
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:16,880
Yeah, a little, little unfortunate, unfortunate timing.

2486
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:20,720
You know, we've really got a wealth in the burgeoning genre

2487
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:23,360
of just introductions and outros.

2488
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:27,040
And I hope there's more voicemails

2489
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:29,440
that are just the introduction and outro of videos.

2490
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:36,360
I mean, when you boil down YouTube down to its core, right?

2491
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:39,440
Like that's I mean, that is content, right?

2492
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,720
Like the intro, the outro.

2493
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,000
It's most of it, right?

2494
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,640
You don't really need what's what's sandwiched in the middle.

2495
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:47,200
I mean, I'm here for the bread.

2496
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:48,880
I'm here for just absolutely.

2497
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:51,520
Because I mean, what's I mean, I'm here to fill up on bread.

2498
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:52,600
What is the meat really?

2499
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:54,560
It'll be 10 seconds of interesting value.

2500
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,520
But on the outside of that, we've got all this beautiful set dressing

2501
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:00,040
that, you know, we need to appreciate.

2502
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:06,120
I I couldn't have said it better myself.

2503
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:10,560
All right. Next one is called I make them ponies talk

2504
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:13,360
from horse at pussy.juice.

2505
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:19,000
Three, two, one, go.

2506
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,440
Hey, Rainbow Dash, remember when our good pal

2507
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:24,880
Ben St. defended an alcoholic domestic abuser with his girlfriend's leg?

2508
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,560
Butter shy. Damn right, I do.

2509
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:29,960
That was epically based also like the part where Ben

2510
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:31,720
then went on to call her soul fat.

2511
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:33,600
That was peak sigma behavior.

2512
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:34,600
We stand.

2513
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:46,840
Thanks, ponies.

2514
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:50,920
I'm glad you like my like the stuff that I do in here

2515
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:53,520
on the procrastinator spot.

2516
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:59,640
I love it. I love I love those little I love those little

2517
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:02,320
love those little little candy colored marshmallow horses.

2518
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:04,640
Always good to hear from them.

2519
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:10,760
Next one is called petition to make the opening song

2520
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:14,640
from episode 300 of the new three, two, one, go.

2521
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,160
Well, do it.

2522
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,400
Yeah, fair enough.

2523
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:21,840
Which one was 300, do you remember?

2524
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,000
Was that it was like the the Nate clips all crushed together?

2525
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,080
Is that so it was?

2526
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:30,480
You know what, let me let me find out.

2527
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:34,880
The procrastinators.

2528
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:39,080
Wait, didn't episode three started with.

2529
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:45,400
It started with Nate and like mumke and Jeff, right?

2530
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:46,200
I think so.

2531
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:48,200
I think it was like all that stuff kind of crushed together

2532
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:50,440
and then like layered on top of each other.

2533
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,440
So like a a million Nates all at once, right?

2534
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:56,520
Oh, PCP.

2535
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:02,040
Yeah, but then it like fades into.

2536
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:05,640
I don't know. I don't know if that's in every episode.

2537
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:06,640
No.

2538
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:12,160
You know, and I think if we really look at the psychology of this voicemail,

2539
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:15,680
or I think what they're trying to say in a roundabout way is that they

2540
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:19,160
appreciated the effort and the construction of that introduction song.

2541
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:21,600
And they're just they're just trying to push.

2542
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:25,080
They don't know how to genuinely express that feeling.

2543
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:28,560
So instead, they're saying, oh, make it the one for every podcast.

2544
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:31,240
That's not what they mean. We know that.

2545
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:33,480
They're just showing their love for you.

2546
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:35,240
Well, good.

2547
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,280
Keep on doing it.

2548
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:42,400
Show it at showyourloveatpatrion.com slash the procrastinators.

2549
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,000
Get that commentary track.

2550
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,600
Get the commentary track on that Radcom to documentary, baby.

2551
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:54,520
I actually I I recommend the commentary track a lot.

2552
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:57,480
Very good. Yeah, is it good?

2553
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:01,120
Yeah, I mean, I think me and Gib had a lot to say.

2554
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:04,320
We had a lot of we had a lot of stuff to say about like,

2555
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,680
hey, you know, remember that thing?

2556
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:11,080
What did? Well, let's talk about what that was.

2557
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:14,160
What was actually going on with that stuff?

2558
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:16,640
What did we actually what do we think about that in hindsight?

2559
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:18,440
Yeah, we had a lot.

2560
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:20,720
Yeah, I guess a lot has happened, right?

2561
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:25,680
Like, yeah, the context of everything and and where you've ended up is really.

2562
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:30,400
That's a lot. There's a lot there. There's a lot.

2563
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:33,840
So, yeah, we we filled we filled the whole two hours

2564
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,440
with in Trench and Insights and.

2565
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:40,120
The

2566
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:43,360
illuminating additional context.

2567
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:48,320
Next voicemail is called Steven Girard.

2568
02:16:48,720 --> 02:16:51,880
There it is. Three, two, one, go.

2569
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:58,600
Ben, can you take over or give uploading the podcast to Spotify and Apple

2570
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:01,920
Podcasts because Tom obviously has lost interest

2571
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:05,040
because he keeps forgetting and there's missing episodes.

2572
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:08,560
Yeah, I asked Tom again the other day.

2573
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:10,720
I added him in the server and I got no reply.

2574
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:12,760
I don't know what he's doing.

2575
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:14,880
He hasn't done it for a couple of weeks.

2576
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:17,080
Yeah, I mean, I've seen people complain about it, too.

2577
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:20,640
Like, people are clearly upset that the podcasts are not generally available.

2578
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:25,440
Yeah, and I don't I don't know how to do it.

2579
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:31,560
I don't I've never fucked with Apple Podcasts or Spotify or whatever.

2580
02:17:31,560 --> 02:17:34,240
So I like I would have to learn how to do it.

2581
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:37,480
I guess I'm going to try and keep pestering him

2582
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:40,760
and maybe I'll just catch him on a day where he's like, yeah, sure, I'll do it.

2583
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:44,440
Yeah, I mean, even if you could just like just ask him to write you up some notes.

2584
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:46,560
It's like, I mean, how hard could it be, right?

2585
02:17:46,560 --> 02:17:49,480
It's like, you got to log in somewhere and you got to post it like.

2586
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:54,480
I thought he had I think he had some kind of like web hook that like did it for him.

2587
02:17:55,520 --> 02:18:00,200
Yeah, I mean, probably that's how, you know, like you see people put out

2588
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:05,080
their their album on like 10 platforms and there's some kind of service that does that.

2589
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:10,680
But yeah, I wish he yeah, I haven't heard from him in a while.

2590
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:15,400
Uh, I'm going to I'm going to try and get it sorted out.

2591
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:19,560
Yeah, you know, I was kind of I was hoping he'd be here because I saw he was

2592
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:25,120
I guess now he's trying some stuff on like a Game Boy game maker.

2593
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:27,400
Oh, right.

2594
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:32,200
He I saw he like refurbished a Game Boy or something.

2595
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:37,920
Yeah. At first, I so he's like taking the vertical slice demo that he had done before

2596
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:42,600
and trans transliterating that over to this Game Boy Studio.

2597
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:46,560
And at first I was like, well, that's kind of silly because oh, so it makes

2598
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:49,960
like an imitation of a Game Boy game that you can play on a computer.

2599
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:54,360
But it seems like it actually produces a playable Game Boy ROM.

2600
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:59,680
So I'm assuming his plan is to like make the game there, you know,

2601
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:03,160
make whatever tech demo and then play it physically on his Game Boy,

2602
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:05,440
which sounds pretty cool. Sounds cool to me.

2603
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:11,440
Is he wait, is he doing like Game Boy like game programming?

2604
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:15,840
Is he making no way it's, you know, it's yet another drag and drop editor.

2605
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:22,960
But yeah, it is like it produces a Game Boy game, which is kind of cool, but nifty.

2606
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:26,720
Do what she was do what she was learning to code, though.

2607
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:29,400
Tom, learn to code, please.

2608
02:19:29,800 --> 02:19:34,800
Is he what happened to killing code?

2609
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:38,040
I don't know. Couldn't tell you.

2610
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:39,560
Remember, remember killing code?

2611
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:41,640
Vaguely. Munchy and, Munchy and Tom.

2612
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:44,880
A distant memory of the deep dark past.

2613
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:48,680
A distant memory, man.

2614
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:52,360
Coding is easy. You just look up.

2615
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:53,480
It kind of is.

2616
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:55,920
You just look, you just, you just, you just look up.

2617
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,720
You just fucking Google.

2618
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:59,640
I mean, command you're looking for is.

2619
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:03,160
Once you understand like logic and flow control, right?

2620
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:07,200
Like if and for and stuff, and you understand the syntax,

2621
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,480
you know, various curly brackets or whatever you need.

2622
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:11,680
It's, it's, it's just about learning the syntax.

2623
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:13,000
It's just about learning, you know, that.

2624
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,200
And then you just look up the API, like you look up the functions

2625
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:18,960
you're going to call and how you call them. Yeah. And like, that's it.

2626
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:22,160
Right. That's it. That's it.

2627
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:26,200
It's literally it, you know, like you're using Game Maker or whatever.

2628
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:28,320
It deals with the whatever other bullshit.

2629
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:31,120
It's just like you write your thing and that thing has some code

2630
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:34,480
and it's got some, some variables and some functions, right?

2631
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,800
Like you just use naturally.

2632
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:40,000
That's it. Yeah. You just, they, they, they made them for you.

2633
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:42,800
They made them for you. They laid them out for you to use.

2634
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:44,800
It's just like, here you go.

2635
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:47,800
You just take them, just take them and run with it.

2636
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,600
What could be simpler?

2637
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:55,000
So, yeah, I think I've said before that I found

2638
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:57,920
I found the drag and drop Game Maker stuff to be

2639
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,760
terrible, hated it.

2640
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:05,280
Yeah. Yeah, it's tough because like, you know, I'm sure there are some

2641
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:09,760
drag and drop tools that can get you pretty close to like some finished games.

2642
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:13,880
But realistically, I feel like drag and drop is, is designed to get people

2643
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:17,200
interested in it and not actually designed to complete a project.

2644
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,160
And, you know, it's a fundamental trap.

2645
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:24,120
Right. That's how it was. That's how it was for me.

2646
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:29,800
Hey, speaking of before we move on of Killing Code,

2647
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,240
how is, how is Munchie getting on?

2648
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:35,000
Like, I know he's, he's sort of gone into computer science.

2649
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,320
Is he, is he programming, do you know?

2650
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:42,280
He, I don't really know that much about it,

2651
02:21:42,280 --> 02:21:46,000
but he is, he is doing some like web server stuff.

2652
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:50,280
OK. With school, I think.

2653
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:53,440
I think that's fine to say.

2654
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:56,160
Yeah, he's doing some he's involved.

2655
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:59,960
He's involved with some school server things.

2656
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:02,360
And so he's, he's.

2657
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I couldn't, I couldn't really tell you much more than that.

2658
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:10,240
This is what he mentioned once in a while.

2659
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:14,400
Well, cool. I'm glad I'm glad he's still sticking with it.

2660
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:17,080
He, yeah, he is, he is sticking with it.

2661
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:21,640
He is, he just started another semester, I think.

2662
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:22,960
That was his excuse.

2663
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:25,040
That was his excuse for not lifting for a while.

2664
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:29,480
It was a new semester, a busy school, a school is so hard.

2665
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:31,040
I got to do my sorry.

2666
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:32,640
I can't, sorry, I can't lift.

2667
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:34,320
I got to do my homework.

2668
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:37,160
Oh, I can't, I can't.

2669
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:39,880
I have to write an essay for Mrs.

2670
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:42,440
Terwilliger's history class.

2671
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:44,400
I got to make a book.

2672
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:48,600
Make a book report on the, on the, on the catch you in the Y.

2673
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:52,800
Yeah, as one does in university.

2674
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:56,160
I sure why not?

2675
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,040
Why not? Why not?

2676
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:02,120
OK, next voicemail is called.

2677
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:04,200
Where was it?

2678
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:06,440
It's called Boston with an exclamation point.

2679
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:08,480
Three, two, one, go.

2680
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:09,960
I did it, Ben.

2681
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:12,200
I'm in Boston and I took the green line.

2682
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:15,000
Yay, who lives in the suburbs.

2683
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:17,640
It was freaking cool.

2684
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:19,320
I'm in Boston now.

2685
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:20,480
I'm coming for you, Ben.

2686
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:21,520
Oh, wait.

2687
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:22,960
But.

2688
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:30,000
Sounds like a strapping young lad.

2689
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,160
I'm glad he's found the virtue of public transit.

2690
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:38,000
Take the B line green line.

2691
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:44,080
B line, green line to get to to get to my my neighborhood in Austin, BG.

2692
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:51,320
The old, the old BG, G, G, B, L, G, L, A, B, D, L.

2693
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,640
D, D, L, G.

2694
02:23:55,360 --> 02:23:57,520
What was I talking about?

2695
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:59,840
Next voicemail.

2696
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:07,120
And moving on is is a four letter word used to indicate a valid statement.

2697
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:10,040
Three, two, one.

2698
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:11,120
What?

2699
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,560
Is it just a gunshot?

2700
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:15,160
I don't know what that is.

2701
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:19,120
I think the word they're looking for is true, true.

2702
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:27,200
OK, next voicemail is a image, I think.

2703
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,280
I'll post, I'll post the link.

2704
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:30,880
Oh, how nice.

2705
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:32,480
Lovely.

2706
02:24:32,480 --> 02:24:38,040
This is from there is no you, but you're happy at purplevoid.com.

2707
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:43,600
I guess this is a, this is a redone give with a little happy Kirby eyes.

2708
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,760
Hmm.

2709
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:45,760
Oh, cute.

2710
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:46,960
Very nice.

2711
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,760
Next one is called.

2712
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:54,960
When will they notice three, two, one, go?

2713
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:57,320
Ben, crack, munchy.

2714
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:00,640
When is the YUM Corporation going to advertise endless war?

2715
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:03,600
You literally have three of their main restaurants in your game.

2716
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:09,360
Just imagine slightly Baja Blast in every pizza hut box has a link to the server.

2717
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:13,240
Yeah, I think we got to we got to leverage that YUM brand's connection.

2718
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:18,640
We, I mean, by putting YUM brands in the game

2719
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:22,440
and featuring them so prominently, I think we've become effectively

2720
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:25,200
board member shareholders.

2721
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:30,600
I think that grants us some level of of intellectual property ownership.

2722
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:31,960
I believe so. I agree.

2723
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,800
I believe that's yeah.

2724
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:36,360
I I think that's should that's how it should work.

2725
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:40,200
And I'm going to operate as though it is.

2726
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:45,360
Man, did you you remember when Star Wars

2727
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:48,400
episode one came out a thousand years ago?

2728
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:49,880
Right. Sure.

2729
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:52,840
I must have been fucking a child.

2730
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:55,040
Must have been a child.

2731
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:58,360
Maybe ten, five or ten, somewhere around there, probably closer to five.

2732
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:00,200
I don't know. OK. You're older than me.

2733
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:01,080
I don't know how old you were.

2734
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:03,040
But anyway, right.

2735
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,920
KFC had this great tie in with like these little

2736
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:11,960
like pogs of of Star Wars, like poggers, little paper, little paper things.

2737
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:14,480
And it was this whole this whole thing.

2738
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:15,960
Anyway, we got to do that.

2739
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:18,760
We had to do that, but Slime.

2740
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:19,800
You got to make Pogs.

2741
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:22,040
We got to make Slime Pogs for a KFC.

2742
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:26,040
Why you should be able to play Pogs in the Slime Casino.

2743
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:27,800
I agree. I don't know.

2744
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:29,520
You should know why it's missing.

2745
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:31,880
You should actually someone should actually put Pogs.

2746
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:34,600
I'll tell Stottle to just do that.

2747
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:37,200
Tell Stottle to please add Pogs.

2748
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:40,600
Honestly, it's a perfect fit.

2749
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:42,600
Slime Pog.

2750
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:49,320
We've we've got the Slime Pog emoji and brand tie ins, you know.

2751
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:51,600
And when you're and when you're playing Pogs, right,

2752
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:55,400
you have your your your KFC Pogs beat your Taco Bell Pogs

2753
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:58,240
and your Taco Bell Pogs beat your Pizza Hut Pogs

2754
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:00,440
and your Pizza Hut Pogs beat your KFC Pogs.

2755
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:03,040
You know, it's a whole as a meta.

2756
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,720
You know, there is that KFC near you guys.

2757
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:10,280
What if you weren't engaged in a campaign of, say, targeted harassment,

2758
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:17,400
wearing continually ad stickers, graffiti, posters

2759
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:20,400
to just paint that KFC green?

2760
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:23,720
Hmm, harassing a local business.

2761
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:27,040
What about this? What about this?

2762
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:31,520
Hmm, what about what about harassment, but we target it, right?

2763
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:33,960
We're targeted with it, right?

2764
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:35,840
We don't just do it willy nilly.

2765
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:39,080
Hmm, it's not so much I misspoke.

2766
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:41,400
It's not a targeted harassment. That sounds illegal.

2767
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:47,360
It's more of a focused engagement, focused, focused, negative,

2768
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:52,720
and pointedly negative engagement with an individual with an individual

2769
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:55,000
or group of individuals.

2770
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:59,120
Yet I'm down. I'm on board.

2771
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:02,480
I see no downsides.

2772
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:08,720
Next voicemail is Christian Cartoon fan, not Otaku, Twilight Four.

2773
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:11,320
Three, two, one, go.

2774
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:15,760
After destroying anime forever, I watched an American cartoon, Laurel Orrell.

2775
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:17,600
This show is a masterpiece.

2776
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:21,480
Starts with some edgy jokes about Christians, but pulls a Bojack horseman halfway through.

2777
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:24,960
What show? I think that was Moral Orrell.

2778
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:28,000
Moral Orrell. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Moral Orrell.

2779
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:31,400
Yeah, I wish it. I've heard that's good.

2780
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,000
I think I have seen a little bit of it.

2781
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,040
Harg's a big fan of that one, I think.

2782
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:40,800
I caught I caught it on I caught it on Adult Swim once or a few times.

2783
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:44,000
I guess I didn't really have a strong opinion about it.

2784
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,520
Yeah, it seems fine. I'm not that into it. I'm not that into it.

2785
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:49,800
Sorry. So OK.

2786
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,440
Sorry, Twilight. Sorry, Twilight.

2787
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:53,480
I wish I could say more about your favorite show.

2788
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:55,400
I'm sorry, Twilight.

2789
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:56,680
Sorry, Twilight.

2790
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:59,120
Looks like you're going back to the glue factory.

2791
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:04,760
Next one is an image.

2792
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:09,360
Is this a draw your own graph or is it

2793
02:29:09,360 --> 02:29:14,080
suggesting that we have not let not yet left the cringe plateau?

2794
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:21,200
No, this looks like these are the the axes are labeled.

2795
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:24,960
Oh, you're supposed to draw a curve.

2796
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:26,440
Like how based was every error?

2797
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:28,120
Yeah, yeah, I think it's draw your own.

2798
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:34,040
OK, let me. All right, well, let's let's do this.

2799
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:40,600
Yeah, pop this open in the game.

2800
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:45,200
I'm was it was episode episode 200.

2801
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:47,200
Was that Radcon four?

2802
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:50,560
Or Radcon three?

2803
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:52,480
I think it was a 200 was a Radcon three.

2804
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:54,560
Yeah, it would have to be. It was quite a while ago.

2805
02:29:55,560 --> 02:30:01,720
Sure. Yeah, here's here's my answer, I guess.

2806
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:05,040
I'm going I'm going with it.

2807
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:10,120
It's perfect. Oh, OK, OK.

2808
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:13,480
See, I want to I feel like you had this start in the exact middle

2809
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:18,080
on the left hand side, you know, because the podcast could be neither

2810
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:19,760
based nor cringe at the start.

2811
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:23,080
You just unless you're saying it's cringe to start a podcast,

2812
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:26,440
which I guess I agree with, you're you're thinking, OK,

2813
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:30,440
you're thinking that like how it started is like the baseline.

2814
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:33,720
And like, well, yeah, and then have you have you moved more based

2815
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:34,840
or more cringe from there?

2816
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:37,080
That's I mean, that's how I would try it.

2817
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:38,680
Not that it really matters.

2818
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:41,280
I think this is a pretty good, pretty good representation here.

2819
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:44,000
What's the so what's the giant Valley there?

2820
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:46,600
That's probably the most significant thing.

2821
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:50,560
I was the giant Valley, you know, I probably drew it a little too steep.

2822
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:55,040
I would say the giant Valley, the Valley there is post

2823
02:30:55,040 --> 02:31:00,680
Radcon four when we were just we were just shedding people.

2824
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:05,360
And we kind of didn't know what to do about it.

2825
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:10,360
The it recovers from the Valley after we just decide

2826
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:15,880
after after the tombstone rebrand, we decide like

2827
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:18,080
we're just we're just going to.

2828
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,840
Well, I guess it's the Ben and Gib show.

2829
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:21,360
And sometimes Tom now.

2830
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:23,720
Yeah. And, you know, it's funny.

2831
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:26,040
I kind of did the same thing.

2832
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:28,640
I don't know if my Valley's in the right spot, but that was my thinking.

2833
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:31,120
I was like, OK, here's the big crash is everyone's leaving.

2834
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:33,040
Right. You. OK.

2835
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,360
And then generously I've I've said, oh, it's getting it's getting better.

2836
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:37,680
And then I don't know.

2837
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,960
Now I'm on this one, so it's kind of coming down a little bit.

2838
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:46,320
You you put you put the Valley at Radcon, like at Radcon three.

2839
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,600
Yeah. Right.

2840
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:50,720
Because the episode two hundred is at Radcon three.

2841
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:54,560
Yeah, surely after that, because that's like, you know, I'm not listening.

2842
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:57,040
And then I'm assuming it's getting better while I'm not listening.

2843
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:01,320
And then as soon as you start listening, that's when the worst.

2844
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:07,520
Yeah, OK. All right, I respect it.

2845
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:14,200
I had I gave it I gave it like I gave it wibbly wobbly

2846
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:17,440
is around the episode between hundred and one hundred and one hundred and two.

2847
02:32:17,440 --> 02:32:20,680
Because like, who knows what was going on around then?

2848
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:23,160
I assume some weird shit was happening.

2849
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:25,240
People were joining. People were leaving.

2850
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:30,520
It was a it was a fucked up fucked up situation.

2851
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:35,560
Yeah, I like how at no point up until somewhere post episode 201

2852
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:38,280
was the podcast ever really on the base side of the graph.

2853
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:44,640
I in in in high in hindsight, I genuinely

2854
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:46,760
I genuinely think so.

2855
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:51,880
I genuinely look back at like I genuinely look back at some of the people

2856
02:32:51,880 --> 02:32:55,400
and some of the discussions and shake my head like.

2857
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:59,320
Kind of stupid, kind of dumb.

2858
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:02,080
Like, yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of embarrassing stuff

2859
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:04,360
in the back catalog question.

2860
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,160
No, no doubt, no doubt.

2861
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:10,320
And that's that's recorded in my in my in my curve here.

2862
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,720
Yeah, there you go.

2863
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,200
That that one in it.

2864
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:19,960
But in right in the middle of one hundred and one to one hundred and two

2865
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:23,680
when that one little little blob it spikes up, that was that was Jeff's

2866
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:25,680
Jeff's brief appearance.

2867
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:31,640
A bright spot in the dark, glad to see him back in the in the documentary.

2868
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:34,120
You know, it's good to have more Jeff content.

2869
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,800
More Jeff.

2870
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:37,680
I'm just I'm hungry for Jeff content.

2871
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,800
I don't know where to find it.

2872
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,640
I've been waiting for more jet.

2873
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:42,600
I've my favorite PCP character.

2874
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:45,960
I've been waiting to see him again and he makes his glorious return.

2875
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,480
Yeah. Yeah, it's unfortunate that he hasn't been like producing anything

2876
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:50,760
in the meantime.

2877
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:51,600
He just fell off.

2878
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:53,040
He just fell off the map is low.

2879
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:55,600
He kind of fell off as far as I'm aware.

2880
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:56,200
He low.

2881
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:59,280
He low key kind of fell off and L and ratio.

2882
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:00,800
Yeah.

2883
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Yeah.

2884
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:06,120
I think we might have talked about this last episode,

2885
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:09,160
but I I didn't really talk to him like at all.

2886
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:12,040
Yeah. I mean, what would you say to him?

2887
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:15,560
I think I'm not sure if we talked about this on the

2888
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:18,280
on the commentary or was it last episode?

2889
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:23,160
But yeah, I'm pretty sure he was just there to talk to Digi Bro

2890
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:25,200
because there was they were like, oh, we're YouTubers.

2891
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:26,200
We're anime YouTubers.

2892
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,760
We're here to collaborate.

2893
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:30,480
You definitely did hit on that on the on the podcast.

2894
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:33,520
And I can't really I can't really begrudge him that.

2895
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:34,840
It makes sense.

2896
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:37,680
It makes sense why he would like want to be involved in the PCP

2897
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:39,200
and why he was there.

2898
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:44,520
But yeah, then then very swiftly outgrew the necessity of that connection.

2899
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:46,280
Pretty pretty much.

2900
02:34:46,280 --> 02:34:50,800
And probably the horror of the event was like, all right, I'm a head out.

2901
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:56,200
Whatever, I I mean.

2902
02:34:57,320 --> 02:34:58,880
I remember us having a good time.

2903
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:01,080
I remember him seeming to have a good time.

2904
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:04,800
We all we all got we all got hyped together for for Mad Bull and all that,

2905
02:35:04,800 --> 02:35:06,920
you know, good good times were had.

2906
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:13,320
Cici has posted a OK.

2907
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:17,360
I think I can I think I can guess what

2908
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:20,360
what's going on with this graph here.

2909
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:24,040
Yeah, I think this is a graph of all the time Sims, he was on the podcast.

2910
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:25,240
I think so.

2911
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:28,200
We got we got to get that boy on here more often.

2912
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:29,440
Yeah, for sure.

2913
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:31,760
Well, what a lad.

2914
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:36,160
All right, next next voicemail.

2915
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:37,560
Oh, did I did I skip?

2916
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:39,000
OK, no, I posted this one here.

2917
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:43,600
This one is called GPU versus CPU three, two, one, go.

2918
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:46,120
Hey, is this a quick voicemail?

2919
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:49,680
I want to differentiate between a CPU and a GPU for you real quick.

2920
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:55,320
GPU isn't just a CPU that is dedicated to processing.

2921
02:35:55,560 --> 02:35:57,960
A lot of design goes into the architecture

2922
02:35:57,960 --> 02:36:01,760
to make sure that those processors are able to do the mathematical

2923
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:06,000
operations that we commonly use in graphics processing faster.

2924
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:10,080
So there is a bit of a difference between the two.

2925
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:15,320
The GPU is optimized for those mathematical operations.

2926
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:18,080
CPU is kind of, you know, more general use.

2927
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:22,240
Yeah. And, you know, when when all when all gamers tavern

2928
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,720
was saying they're like fundamentally the same,

2929
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:28,360
that that was a very strange comment to me when he said that.

2930
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:30,880
Really? Like, I feel, you know, really,

2931
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:33,120
the big difference is like your CPU, right?

2932
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:37,600
You've got these like a handful of beefy cores and on your your GPU,

2933
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:43,880
it's like many, many cores that just are are hyper focused on specific things.

2934
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:49,600
You know, and cores like CPU cores, like processing units.

2935
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:54,400
OK, OK, like your your normal desktop CPU will have like four

2936
02:36:54,440 --> 02:36:56,720
or eight, maybe quad 16.

2937
02:36:56,840 --> 02:36:58,800
Yeah, you'll have like you'll have some number like that.

2938
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:01,760
But in a video card, you'll have maybe a hundred or something,

2939
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:04,880
you know, like a big number.

2940
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:07,560
What did you what did you make of?

2941
02:37:07,560 --> 02:37:10,560
Because this was this was about that that that crypto guy,

2942
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:15,480
a crypto voicemailer, said that certain certain cryptos

2943
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,960
are like mined in a GPU.

2944
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:21,040
They're like mined on the GPU instead of the CPU.

2945
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:21,880
Yeah. Yeah.

2946
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:27,120
So so because of the design of some of GPUs,

2947
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,960
because of that design, they're like good at very specific types of hashing

2948
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:34,800
operations, they can do certain instructions that allow them to hash things quickly.

2949
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:38,560
And so, you know, depending on the design of your crypto,

2950
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:41,040
like that could be that could be a faster way to mine it.

2951
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:44,600
And that's why GPU mining is so big because they use these GPUs

2952
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:48,200
that do this very specific type of operation very fast, you know,

2953
02:37:48,200 --> 02:37:50,560
that you just can't you can't do it fast on a CPU.

2954
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:53,320
But there are there are other cryptos

2955
02:37:53,320 --> 02:37:56,240
that like do things that that CPUs do well, you know.

2956
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:59,520
So it's just like however you want to do it.

2957
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:02,720
I mean, all right.

2958
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:05,640
But you know, it's reasonable.

2959
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:08,120
It's all pretty cringe. Don't don't mine crypto.

2960
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:10,880
Don't I don't know I was coming around.

2961
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:13,320
I was coming around on this.

2962
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:17,720
Oh, well, if it's GP, oh, well, if it's GPU base, then I mean.

2963
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:21,280
Oh, well, let's change this change is everything.

2964
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:26,520
Next voicemail is called GPU versus CPU volume two.

2965
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:28,200
Can you believe it?

2966
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:30,440
Three, three, two, one, go.

2967
02:38:32,080 --> 02:38:34,200
And I just realized I should add the context

2968
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:37,320
that the reason that GPUs are loved by bit miners

2969
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:40,760
so specifically is because it turns out a lot of the mathematics

2970
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:44,400
involved with graphics rendering happens to also be really useful for bitcoin mining.

2971
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:45,200
This is what you said.

2972
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:47,160
So, yeah, that's why they're coveted.

2973
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:53,960
And why, you know, CVUs aren't equally as coveted for this specific use space.

2974
02:38:54,480 --> 02:38:58,440
Yeah. I mean, just just the one further bit of clarity.

2975
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:03,240
I think what's going on is like you're trying to guess the result.

2976
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,440
You know, like you have you have you have you have a result.

2977
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:09,680
You're trying to guess the sequence of like cryptographic hashing

2978
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:12,200
that would result in that result.

2979
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:13,880
You know what I mean? Yes. Yes.

2980
02:39:13,880 --> 02:39:17,360
And so the GPU is just optimized to do that specific math

2981
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:21,280
really quickly. And so you can make a lot of guesses versus on a CPU

2982
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,080
where you couldn't make as many guesses as fast.

2983
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:25,040
So it would take like exponentially longer.

2984
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:26,600
Oh, OK.

2985
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:30,200
Because because each different core can be like guessing independently.

2986
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:31,920
Yeah. And there's something like that.

2987
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:34,640
And like down like down to the the hardware level,

2988
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:37,280
the the processing core is just arranged in such a way

2989
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:39,680
that it can do this type of math quickly.

2990
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:42,880
You know, like this mathematical operation, whatever it is.

2991
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:46,160
Sure. I think I think I think I more or less get it.

2992
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:49,560
Next. Oh, wait.

2993
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:51,520
Next voicemail is called.

2994
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:54,600
Read the foundation series.

2995
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:57,160
OK, I'm done. Please don't berate me.

2996
02:39:57,640 --> 02:39:59,440
Three, two, one, go.

2997
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:01,960
Gibbs right here.

2998
02:40:01,960 --> 02:40:03,600
You can't just kill Hitler.

2999
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:04,840
That's not going to work.

3000
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:07,120
What you have to do is print a whole bunch of currency

3001
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:10,440
that's right for the time period and then distribute it in a way

3002
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:15,760
that using psycho history, you can analyze how the society will interact.

3003
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:18,240
And then prevent World War Two.

3004
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:22,800
Like these are large societal movements with lots of people.

3005
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:26,240
OK. Killing one person won't necessarily get rid of that.

3006
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:31,880
Yeah, true, I guess. True.

3007
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:34,640
True. But I don't know.

3008
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:36,560
I mean, if you look in the in the modern era,

3009
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:39,840
like if you if you just prevent Donald Trump from existing,

3010
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:42,320
do we stop the rise of fascism in America?

3011
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:44,440
Probably not. Probably not.

3012
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:48,280
I I do think, OK, I think that probably

3013
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:51,480
fascism would have come into vogue with or without Hitler.

3014
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:55,760
But I mean, the specific ways that like World War Two shook out

3015
02:40:56,120 --> 02:41:02,400
like Hitler was a very idiosyncratic guy and he and he he made decisions, right?

3016
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:06,720
He was he made executive level decisions that had impacts.

3017
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:09,880
It does seem like, you know, replacing with almost anybody

3018
02:41:09,880 --> 02:41:12,240
and the situation would be better, right?

3019
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:15,640
Like the man himself is definitely a net negative.

3020
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:17,400
I mean, I don't know.

3021
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:21,080
I don't know, maybe maybe someone else would have been more competent

3022
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:23,640
at accomplishing similar goals.

3023
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:27,600
OK. I get you.

3024
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:31,440
Maybe you could maybe you could have a someone who's more effective

3025
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:33,560
at doing the same stuff.

3026
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:36,880
Yeah, like maybe somebody else wouldn't have gotten involved in a war

3027
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:40,120
in Russia, for example. Right, right, right.

3028
02:41:40,760 --> 02:41:42,440
So something like that.

3029
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:46,680
You know, it's not it's not like the rest of Western Europe

3030
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:51,120
and America wouldn't tolerate terrible treatment of specific cultural or ethnic

3031
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:54,480
groups, like clearly that's just part of the culture over here.

3032
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:57,600
So maybe you would have gone away with it.

3033
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:04,040
Yeah, this there's a that that that Henry Kissinger book

3034
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:08,920
that I still occasionally read famously famously.

3035
02:42:08,920 --> 02:42:12,120
You crack that book open, crack that book on the toilet, right?

3036
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:16,880
Because I don't know how to read properly, according to Jim or whoever

3037
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:19,040
from from who are these podcasts?

3038
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:24,640
There's a there's a what am I what am I trying to say?

3039
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:29,680
What were we talking about, Hitler?

3040
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:33,240
Well, what point was I going to make?

3041
02:42:33,240 --> 02:42:35,640
I don't know, ethnic cleansing war crimes.

3042
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:38,040
Oh, I don't know.

3043
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:39,680
I don't know where you were going with it.

3044
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:41,640
I don't know. He just he describes.

3045
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:45,440
He describes Hitler, Hitler's like strategy.

3046
02:42:45,440 --> 02:42:52,000
He was very like he was a very like he had a he had a conniving sort of

3047
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:58,320
like he used like cultural guilt in the aftermath of like the Treaty of Versailles

3048
02:42:58,320 --> 02:42:59,560
and like World War One.

3049
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:02,800
He sort of he sort of did this whole shtick where he sort of sort of

3050
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:06,600
pretended to be like an underdog who just wanted, oh, I just want to

3051
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:08,720
I just want to restore Germany.

3052
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:12,760
I just you guys were so mean to us before we just we just want

3053
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:14,760
what everybody else has.

3054
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:18,120
And then as soon and ever and the the international

3055
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:21,680
like the international public opinion was like, oh, give Germany a chance.

3056
02:43:21,680 --> 02:43:23,840
Like, oh, they're just come on.

3057
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:28,520
We've been so haven't suffered enough and then as soon as soon as he got

3058
02:43:28,520 --> 02:43:31,680
as far as he could get with that, he just suddenly like flip the script.

3059
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,320
I was like, OK, we're on the FM. OK, we're going.

3060
02:43:33,320 --> 02:43:35,720
We're going get Poland, get Switzerland, get it, get it, get it, get it.

3061
02:43:35,720 --> 02:43:39,440
And everyone and like immediately public, the world was like, oh, OK.

3062
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,360
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, jeez.

3063
02:43:42,360 --> 02:43:45,360
Oh, boy. Oh, jeez.

3064
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:47,840
Boy is our face red. Yeah.

3065
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:49,280
Yeah.

3066
02:43:51,960 --> 02:43:55,560
But probably other people would have maybe played it similarly.

3067
02:43:57,040 --> 02:44:00,600
Because we can't argue with results next.

3068
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:05,600
But just just on the on the point of their their title,

3069
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:10,200
I've always been interested in maybe reading like the old the old Asimov stuff,

3070
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:12,880
like foundations, the the Asimov series.

3071
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:16,240
Asimov. I've read a few of them.

3072
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:19,640
I've read some of his shorts, but I've never read foundation.

3073
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:21,560
I just wonder if it I wonder if it's still good.

3074
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:23,680
I wonder if it is. Is it a novel?

3075
02:44:23,720 --> 02:44:26,280
I think it's a quite significant series.

3076
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:29,040
Oh. Yeah.

3077
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:33,160
I've read I've read some short stories of Asimovs, and that's that's about it.

3078
02:44:34,880 --> 02:44:38,560
Yeah, I was sort of scared off because it looked like it was a lot to read.

3079
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:42,320
And I'm I am busy little guy.

3080
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:46,880
I think I should get I think I should get more into reading books.

3081
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:48,240
I've said this before.

3082
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:50,160
I think I wish I was more into reading books.

3083
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:52,880
I just don't know what books I want to read.

3084
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:55,520
I would like to be more.

3085
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:59,760
I would like to be more awash in interest in ideas

3086
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:02,760
and people's good ideas from the past.

3087
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:05,920
You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

3088
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:09,200
Yeah, to be ensconced in valuable thoughts.

3089
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:13,960
Someone someone recommended I someone recommended I read Foucault.

3090
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:19,640
And I was like, you know, a lot of people who whose opinions I like online

3091
02:45:20,360 --> 02:45:23,600
reference Foucault, so maybe I should read some Foucault.

3092
02:45:23,720 --> 02:45:24,920
I don't know.

3093
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:30,840
Next voicemail is called.

3094
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:36,560
Rants more like cants three, two, one, go.

3095
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:41,240
You guys were talking about Trixie and the rats and stuff,

3096
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:45,000
and made me remember something on Patreon.

3097
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:50,040
You can limit the number of people who can like subscribe to a tier.

3098
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:52,040
Yeah.

3099
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:54,800
So that means like one or two things.

3100
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:58,120
Either one, Trixie just didn't do that and let ramps pile up.

3101
02:45:58,120 --> 02:46:00,720
Because I remember them being like months behind at times.

3102
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:06,440
Yeah. I mean, why would you expect her to like plan it out and like have a real

3103
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:11,120
put a rational idea of like how much that could be done, which is stupid.

3104
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:15,200
Thinking you can do infinite rants or two.

3105
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:20,640
They put a limit on it and then still couldn't keep up with the limit

3106
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:24,240
that they set for themselves, even with like an entire month to do it.

3107
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:28,360
Yeah, I guarantee that.

3108
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:29,960
And I thought about that.

3109
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:33,840
What it is, is she just thought that rants are easy.

3110
02:46:34,360 --> 02:46:36,160
I can do unlimited number of rants.

3111
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:37,520
I could do a rant so easily.

3112
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:38,120
It doesn't even matter.

3113
02:46:38,120 --> 02:46:38,880
It takes no time.

3114
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:42,720
So there was no limit on the number of rants and then just like she just didn't do them.

3115
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:45,400
For sure.

3116
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:48,080
For sure. Yeah, of course.

3117
02:46:48,360 --> 02:46:49,360
I agree.

3118
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:56,040
There's there's no I cannot imagine her like looking at that option and being like,

3119
02:46:56,760 --> 02:47:02,960
you know, I think I can probably I think there's a there's a limit on how much of this I can do.

3120
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:04,880
And I'm going to set the limit right here.

3121
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:08,440
I'm going to be like, I'm going to moderate this.

3122
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:12,000
It's just just not it would be very out of character.

3123
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:14,000
Yeah, it would be out of character.

3124
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,800
So it's definitely the former.

3125
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:22,160
Next one is called half a wave dash three, two, one, go.

3126
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:24,600
So wave dashing.

3127
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:27,760
There's this great video by a dude called awesome sauce.

3128
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:30,560
A S U M S A U S.

3129
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:34,760
And it's just like a quirk of the game's physics engine.

3130
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:37,360
That was discovered even during development.

3131
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:38,800
Sakura had noticed it.

3132
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:39,480
Yeah.

3133
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:42,960
And mentioned it in like some smash for him back in the day.

3134
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:45,200
And basically nobody.

3135
02:47:45,320 --> 02:47:49,560
I know vaguely that it would just take off and become the way it is.

3136
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:54,160
So Melee is just a big, giant mess of weird jank.

3137
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:57,640
But I guess that's kind of what makes it so fucked up and awesome at the same time.

3138
02:47:57,640 --> 02:47:58,640
Yeah, I know.

3139
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:00,320
I know about Melee.

3140
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:02,800
I know it's it'd be like that.

3141
02:48:04,040 --> 02:48:08,880
Next one is an image, you know, just just just to stop for a second.

3142
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:12,840
I I just hate that nobody will explain what wave dashing is.

3143
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:16,640
All it is, I think, is like you jump and then you dash down into the ground

3144
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:20,080
like while you're in the air, causing you to slide on the ground, right?

3145
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:22,480
And you just keep doing that.

3146
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:24,760
Like why will nobody just say that that's what it is?

3147
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:26,440
It's like a mobility option.

3148
02:48:26,440 --> 02:48:27,360
Yeah. Yeah.

3149
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:31,920
So instead, instead of using your little air glide thing to to move laterally,

3150
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:36,200
you can you can push it down and then you slide and it lets you do it again immediately.

3151
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,960
Like that. So it's a fast way to move.

3152
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:40,320
Yeah. So you can you can do that.

3153
02:48:40,320 --> 02:48:42,440
You do these little hops and you slam into the ground.

3154
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:45,680
It makes a little wave shape and you dash across the ground.

3155
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,520
Like that's a why is nobody saying it?

3156
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:52,840
Why is it like, oh, Sakurai discovered this secret?

3157
02:48:54,880 --> 02:48:56,800
It's like, I don't know.

3158
02:48:56,800 --> 02:48:57,920
It doesn't have to be like that.

3159
02:48:57,920 --> 02:49:00,080
You could just you just say what it is.

3160
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:01,480
Yeah.

3161
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:04,560
There's so much mistresses and built up around it for no reason.

3162
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:06,600
I think. Yeah.

3163
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:07,960
I think you're right.

3164
02:49:07,960 --> 02:49:09,760
Well, now.

3165
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:11,680
I guess I didn't.

3166
02:49:11,720 --> 02:49:14,640
That's not that's not exactly what I was picturing, but sure.

3167
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:16,280
OK.

3168
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:19,480
This this picture is Thai PCP.

3169
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:21,200
Forget this stinking podcast.

3170
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:24,240
The Thai PCP is where it's at.

3171
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:25,840
Is that? It's delicious.

3172
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:28,120
It looks delicious. I think so.

3173
02:49:28,120 --> 02:49:30,360
Is that? Oh, it's like it's like barbecue.

3174
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:31,600
Oh, yeah.

3175
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:33,760
Is that a gun that he's got?

3176
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:35,560
He's got he's got to get he's got to get dinner.

3177
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:38,840
Hmm.

3178
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:41,240
Man, he's on like it's on a cool rug.

3179
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:43,640
He's out there and out there in a wood.

3180
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:45,760
Looks good.

3181
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:48,800
Wait, I watched.

3182
02:49:51,160 --> 02:49:55,000
This like this past week, I actually I watched a bunch of.

3183
02:49:56,600 --> 02:50:00,280
Videos from that guy, you know, Nick, Nick Robinson.

3184
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:03,080
Ever heard?

3185
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:05,240
I knew a guy in high school named Nick Robinson,

3186
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:07,840
but I don't know if it's the same guy, probably not.

3187
02:50:08,560 --> 02:50:11,720
Uh, Nick, Nick Robinson,

3188
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:14,400
he's sort of like a lost media YouTube guy.

3189
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:17,880
He he did, um, he he saved

3190
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:21,360
he saved the the lost McDonald's

3191
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:23,960
training video game on the Nintendo DS.

3192
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:25,960
Thank God. Yeah.

3193
02:50:28,280 --> 02:50:31,440
I watched a video of him.

3194
02:50:32,120 --> 02:50:37,080
OK, he had done one about a sort of famously weird commercial

3195
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:39,880
for a collaboration between Pizza Hut

3196
02:50:39,880 --> 02:50:44,320
and no, no, Domino's Pizza and Hatsune Miku in Japan.

3197
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:47,000
OK, I had seen I had seen that video a long time ago.

3198
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:52,200
And then recently I watched one where he he met the guy who was in that commercial.

3199
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:58,840
The guy who turned out to be he's like he was like the CEO of like

3200
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:00,960
he was like the Japanese.

3201
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:04,280
He was an American guy, but he was the CEO of like Domino's Japan.

3202
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:08,200
And he has a whole here.

3203
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:09,080
Here's here's the video.

3204
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:10,720
I'll just link it.

3205
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:14,800
He interviews him and there turns out there's a whole history of this guy

3206
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:20,080
appearing in like he was in like Chinese and I think Thai or maybe Vietnamese

3207
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:22,240
like pizza commercials.

3208
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:23,880
He was he. Oh, OK.

3209
02:51:23,880 --> 02:51:27,520
He's like the he's the Asian pizza commercial.

3210
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:31,400
Yeah, like he like he used to have a mustache

3211
02:51:31,400 --> 02:51:33,080
and he he says in the interview that like, yeah,

3212
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:34,640
there was a time when I was the sink.

3213
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:37,880
I was like one of like I was like the single most recognized

3214
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:40,480
Westerner like in in Vietnam.

3215
02:51:40,480 --> 02:51:44,000
That's like I couldn't like I couldn't walk down the streets of Vietnam

3216
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:49,360
without people being like, oh, Pizza Hut guy, Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut.

3217
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:50,800
That's so great.

3218
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:52,000
I forget what the slogan was.

3219
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:55,360
They had some they had some some slogan in Vietnamese.

3220
02:51:55,360 --> 02:51:58,480
And he says like, yeah, they would yell that slogan at me on the street.

3221
02:51:59,360 --> 02:52:03,480
I had to shave my mustache because everyone

3222
02:52:03,800 --> 02:52:05,880
so people wouldn't recognize me or something.

3223
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:07,680
Hey, it's good to be king.

3224
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:09,640
It's it's a heart it's a heartwarming.

3225
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:11,320
It was a heartwarming story.

3226
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:13,480
That's really funny. Yeah, it was great.

3227
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:17,600
He he he he he's got a quest to find this guy.

3228
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:20,000
And then the guy's son, the guy's son,

3229
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:23,120
like reaches out through Instagram to be like, oh, yeah, that guy's my dad.

3230
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:26,440

02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:30,400
You want to I can try to like get him to talk to you if you want.

3232
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:33,520

02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:38,560
OK, next voicemail.

3234
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:40,960
I was seeing seeing a food commercial

3235
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:43,200
in an Asian language just reminded me of that.

3236
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:47,120
Next one is called News.

3237
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:49,800
Oh, great. News from Wong Chan.

3238
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:52,960
Yeah, it's only three seconds.

3239
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:55,320
Three, two, one, go.

3240
02:52:55,360 --> 02:52:57,800
Next week. Very big news.

3241
02:52:57,880 --> 02:52:59,400
OK. Oh, next week.

3242
02:52:59,400 --> 02:53:01,240
Coming up, coming up. Can't wait.

3243
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:03,560
Yeah. All right.

3244
02:53:03,560 --> 02:53:07,480
Next one is called Ben finally owns someone.

3245
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:11,200
Listen to find out who.

3246
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:13,520
Listen to find out whom. OK.

3247
02:53:14,840 --> 02:53:16,520
Three, two, one, go.

3248
02:53:16,520 --> 02:53:19,480
I think I see tweets from a stereo every now and then.

3249
02:53:19,560 --> 02:53:21,600
A lot of what I see is just kind of like passive aggressive,

3250
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:24,520
like look at this new really stupid thing.

3251
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:26,560
Maddox is doing what he is.

3252
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:28,040
He's just embarrassing myself.

3253
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:30,200
That is funny, but it does start to be like

3254
02:53:30,440 --> 02:53:33,200
it's sort of been the same story for what, like a year and a half.

3255
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:35,200
I just feel like.

3256
02:53:35,200 --> 02:53:37,280
I like Dick. OK.

3257
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:43,880
These are old. These are old clips as an old clip.

3258
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:48,080
Good to hear everybody on good terms back then.

3259
02:53:48,080 --> 02:53:49,880
The good old days. Damn.

3260
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,920
I mean, and damn, here we are, you know, years later.

3261
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:55,920
And it's still.

3262
02:53:56,240 --> 02:54:00,000
Dick is still Dick is still doing the same stupid shit.

3263
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:02,960
Is he? He's still he's still milking

3264
02:54:03,320 --> 02:54:05,760
every time, anytime Maddox does anything.

3265
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:07,920
He's like, we got to do an episode about it.

3266
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:11,240
I feel like Maddox completely fell off online,

3267
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:14,120
but maybe I'm just I'm just not paying attention when you say.

3268
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:17,720
Well, if you mean like he you mean like he disappeared or like I thought so.

3269
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:19,280
Is he like online?

3270
02:54:19,280 --> 02:54:21,200
Is he he is?

3271
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:25,080
Yeah, he he he makes YouTube videos still, or at least Jesus.

3272
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:28,000
I mean, I might I might be out of date.

3273
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:31,880
I know as of a few like post Dick show,

3274
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:33,480
he was still making YouTube videos.

3275
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:36,160
I think he he streams now.

3276
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:39,280
Like I think I've seen Dick making fun of him,

3277
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:42,840
making fun of his streamer stick before.

3278
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:44,080
OK, yeah, I see.

3279
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:45,720
He posted a video last month.

3280
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:49,320
I took a child development test and the results won't shock you.

3281
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:53,240
He got an A plus and a child got an F in the thumbnail.

3282
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:58,360
Cool, man. I'm glad you developed amazing.

3283
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:01,360
I love astounding results.

3284
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:02,520
All right, good for Maddox.

3285
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:05,480
Glad he's doing whatever he's doing, but actually fuck him.

3286
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:06,880
I hate these guys.

3287
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:08,640
He's he's doing something.

3288
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:10,160
He sure is.

3289
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:14,720
So and hey, he's getting more views than Yig Studio.

3290
02:55:14,800 --> 02:55:17,160
So he's got that going for him.

3291
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:21,440
Something. Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, you know, someone.

3292
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:25,040
Another another another dunk, another slam dunk.

3293
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:28,320
Next. All right.

3294
02:55:28,320 --> 02:55:31,160
Next next voicemail is a YouTube.

3295
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:36,400
Link. OK, saying goodbye.

3296
02:55:36,400 --> 02:55:38,120
What a wonderful world.

3297
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:40,800
Why? Why? It's just a it's a guy playing that one.

3298
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:43,520
Who's that?

3299
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:45,920
I see trees of green.

3300
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:48,320
Yeah, Woody Guthrie.

3301
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:50,760
No, I don't think that's right.

3302
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:52,240
It's not right.

3303
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:54,280
Now, you're thinking of Woody Allen.

3304
02:55:54,280 --> 02:55:55,760
No, I'm thinking of Lou Reed.

3305
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:58,000
That's a Lou Reed song. Is it? Yeah, that's right.

3306
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:59,160
That's correct.

3307
02:55:59,160 --> 02:56:00,840
I was going to say Lou Bega.

3308
02:56:00,840 --> 02:56:04,480
It's not Lou. It's not Lou Bega, for sure.

3309
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:11,160
A little bit of Monica in my life.

3310
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:13,960
OK, terrible, terrible.

3311
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:17,360
Next one is called it's called Fuck Trixie.

3312
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:20,320
Three, two, one, go.

3313
02:56:20,320 --> 02:56:22,280
So I watched the.

3314
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:25,840
Thing, the documentary thing.

3315
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:27,760
Yeah, I haven't listened to the.

3316
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:31,440
Commentary track yet.

3317
02:56:31,440 --> 02:56:33,120
Yeah, it's good.

3318
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,360
Is how bad was the house?

3319
02:56:37,360 --> 02:56:40,840
Like how fucking gross were the house?

3320
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:42,320
This was fine.

3321
02:56:42,320 --> 02:56:44,720
I need to shame.

3322
02:56:46,040 --> 02:56:49,760
Fucking little man, children, in the past, you can see it.

3323
02:56:49,760 --> 02:56:52,920
You can see how it is and, you know, draw your own conclusions from that.

3324
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:56,240
We actually did does mention in the commentary,

3325
02:56:56,240 --> 02:56:59,960
the kitchen did get kind of gross at some point, like people were leaving

3326
02:56:59,960 --> 02:57:05,800
there like like take out, you know, bags and like food containers out.

3327
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:09,200
The kitchen did get kind of dirty and gross for a bit.

3328
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:15,200
Other than that, it was fine. It was a nice house.

3329
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:25,200
Yeah. Next voicemail is called Bob Disgaea for Voice Grail for Bravery.

3330
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:28,200
Three, two, one, go.

3331
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:32,200
This is a controversial thing, but I wanted to be known.

3332
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:37,200
Kyle, I'm a funny man. Better than Cringus Bagus.

3333
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:40,200
Is this the same guy as the last voicemail?

3334
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:46,200
Uh, hard, maybe? Possibly?

3335
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:55,200
I could see the argument. Yeah, I wouldn't take offense if you like Kyle and Funny Man better than Cringus Bagus.

3336
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:59,200
I think that's valid. If each got their charms.

3337
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:03,200
Comes down to what you want out of a voicemail, I guess.

3338
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:08,200
Next voicemail is called 300 Hype, three, two, one, go.

3339
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:13,200
Hello, comrades. Nicola, I congratulate you on 300 episodes.

3340
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:14,200
Thank you.

3341
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:17,200
Nicola, I congratulate you by sending vodka.

3342
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:23,200
However, Nicola, I need credit card number, overdress, and any social and search number.

3343
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:24,200
Oh, sure.

3344
02:58:24,200 --> 02:58:25,200
Thank you, comrades.

3345
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:35,200
Please use my credit card number because I finished churning my American Express blue business cash.

3346
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:42,200
As soon as I get my US Bank business credit, you can have that.

3347
02:58:42,200 --> 02:58:45,200
We can start the process.

3348
02:58:45,200 --> 02:58:49,200
Nicola, if you could just wait one moment for Ben to get the new credit card.

3349
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:52,200
We got to get the maximum churn here.

3350
02:58:52,200 --> 02:58:56,200
Yeah, if I'm not churning, then I'm just leaving money on the table.

3351
02:58:56,200 --> 02:59:00,200
We need those benefits. We need that cash back.

3352
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:04,200
It's money on the table.

3353
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:06,200
And when there's money on the table, you got to grab it.

3354
02:59:06,200 --> 02:59:07,200
You got to grab it.

3355
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:14,200
I mean, if, for example, $16 were to show up in your PayPal, you can't return that.

3356
02:59:14,200 --> 02:59:20,200
You need to hold on to that money.

3357
02:59:20,200 --> 02:59:25,200
That $16 turned out to have come from Bob Disgaea.

3358
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:26,200
Oh, that's funny.

3359
02:59:26,200 --> 02:59:29,200
He gave me permission.

3360
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:31,200
He did send it for a reason.

3361
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:34,200
I forget what the reason was, but it's okay.

3362
02:59:34,200 --> 02:59:37,200
The conditions were met.

3363
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:40,200
Next one is called B.

3364
02:59:40,200 --> 02:59:43,200
Three, two, one, go.

3365
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:49,200
Do you hate Trixie because she changed or because your perspective on her changed?

3366
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:53,200
No, I think, you know, Trixie just fell off.

3367
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:57,200
I think Trixie did fall off.

3368
02:59:57,200 --> 03:00:01,200
I think she's been bad since she switched to anime, tell you the truth.

3369
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:04,200
It was a funny goof in the pony days.

3370
03:00:04,200 --> 03:00:08,200
Not that like the content was good, but it was a funny goof.

3371
03:00:08,200 --> 03:00:09,200
Yeah, I see.

3372
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:15,200
And like the sort of genuine, sincere transition to like analyzing anime is where it just falls apart for me.

3373
03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:16,200
You know what?

3374
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:17,200
I get that.

3375
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:18,200
That makes sense.

3376
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:27,200
I think, I mean, I don't like her because of the way she treated me.

3377
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:30,200
So, I mean, like that's the difference.

3378
03:00:30,200 --> 03:00:33,200
Like her, she always had faults.

3379
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:35,200
I think she, I think she's worse now.

3380
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:44,200
I think she's become worse, but mostly it's just that she changed from being, you know, mostly a friend to being terrible to me personally.

3381
03:00:44,200 --> 03:00:47,200
And that's what it comes down to.

3382
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:50,200
Yeah, I mean, I think that's pretty valid.

3383
03:00:50,200 --> 03:00:51,200
Yeah.

3384
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:56,200
That's what it mainly comes down to for me.

3385
03:00:56,200 --> 03:00:59,200
Next one is Gibbs Pick.

3386
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:01,200
Three, two, one, go.

3387
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:05,200
Hey Gibb and Take, what is your profile picture?

3388
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:06,200
Is it a self portrait?

3389
03:01:06,200 --> 03:01:08,200
Is it a drawing or something else?

3390
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:10,200
Is it just a random person?

3391
03:01:10,200 --> 03:01:11,200
What's the deal?

3392
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:12,200
What is it?

3393
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:14,200
It looks really aesthetically pleasing to my big blue eye, but what is it?

3394
03:01:14,200 --> 03:01:17,200
I need to know please, please fill up now.

3395
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:20,200
I think it's pretty clearly a self portrait.

3396
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:23,200
Which profile picture?

3397
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:30,200
I'm assuming the one on the tombstone, so like the purple and green one, like the one that the guy redrew earlier.

3398
03:01:30,200 --> 03:01:31,200
Oh, okay.

3399
03:01:31,200 --> 03:01:33,200
Yeah, I mean, that would, that would make sense.

3400
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:35,200
What else would it be?

3401
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:39,200
I think that's, yeah, I think it's a self portrait dog.

3402
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:42,200
We got like, how many, how many more we got?

3403
03:01:42,200 --> 03:01:43,200
We got like, we got four more.

3404
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:44,200
Oh, is that all?

3405
03:01:44,200 --> 03:01:45,200
I could do a hundred more.

3406
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:46,200
Let's go.

3407
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:48,200
I'm sick of it.

3408
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:50,200
I'm sick of this garbage.

3409
03:01:50,200 --> 03:01:52,200
Next, next one is called Help.

3410
03:01:52,200 --> 03:01:54,200
Three, two, one, go.

3411
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:58,200
God, I can't stop having dreams about the PCP.

3412
03:01:58,200 --> 03:02:00,200
Oh, poor guy.

3413
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:01,200
Sorry.

3414
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:06,200
I have never.

3415
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:12,200
I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think I've ever had a dream about, about like someone who's like,

3416
03:02:12,200 --> 03:02:16,200
content I watch, I like listen to online.

3417
03:02:16,200 --> 03:02:25,200
Maybe, I could believe that maybe at some point I had a dream that in some form or another featured Gabe and Tycho from Penny Arcade.

3418
03:02:25,200 --> 03:02:31,200
But I don't, I don't remember any like, vivid ones that I was like, I don't know, mate, mate.

3419
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:36,200
I feel like it was anyone, it would probably be those guys, if anyone, but I don't, nothing, nothing could jumps to mind.

3420
03:02:36,200 --> 03:02:41,200
This is slightly unrelated, but is there, is there anything that you do that you feel like makes you dream,

3421
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:43,200
reliably or more often?

3422
03:02:43,200 --> 03:02:45,200
Yes.

3423
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:51,200
Well, well, um, you know, I'm not really on a regular schedule.

3424
03:02:51,200 --> 03:03:06,200
Sometimes my sleep schedule gets fucked up and when I sleep in the day and when it's light, I can, I have, I can have very vivid dreams when I'm doing that.

3425
03:03:06,200 --> 03:03:07,200
Okay.

3426
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:09,200
That makes sense.

3427
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:12,200
You're probably not sleeping as deeply, probably.

3428
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:13,200
It makes sense.

3429
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:14,200
Probably.

3430
03:03:14,200 --> 03:03:19,200
Yeah, sleeping, sleeping during the day or when it's light in the room, it makes me dream vividly.

3431
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:28,200
Kind of, I think kind of the same root thing, but I find if I like drink a can of Monster shortly before bed, if I get a lot of caffeine, I dream more.

3432
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:30,200
I dream more vividly.

3433
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:32,200
Just don't really know.

3434
03:03:32,200 --> 03:03:34,200
It helps me sleep faster, you know.

3435
03:03:34,200 --> 03:03:36,200
I'm all amped up.

3436
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:48,200
I noticed that I, honestly, I drink caffeine willy-nilly and sometimes I don't even, like, I usually try to stop drinking caffeine like a few hours before bed.

3437
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:49,200
Yeah.

3438
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:51,200
Sometimes I don't.

3439
03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:55,200
Sometimes I just, and like, whatever, oops, I drank caffeine, well, I gotta go to bed.

3440
03:03:55,200 --> 03:04:00,200
And usually it doesn't really have a problem for me or affect much.

3441
03:04:00,200 --> 03:04:03,200
Yeah, it does really keep me up, for sure.

3442
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:07,200
But I do notice that I tend to dream more.

3443
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:09,200
I haven't noticed that.

3444
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:21,200
But I could, again, yeah, I could see that, like, interrupting your sleep depth, your REM cycles or whatever, would make sense in my imagination.

3445
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:26,200
So anyway, to the voicemailer, don't drink a monster before bed, sleep at night, if you can.

3446
03:04:26,200 --> 03:04:27,200
Yeah.

3447
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:29,200
Try to keep those dreams away.

3448
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:34,200
Take some melatonin.

3449
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:35,200
Yeah.

3450
03:04:35,200 --> 03:04:36,200
I take melatonin.

3451
03:04:36,200 --> 03:04:38,200
Try chloroform, perhaps.

3452
03:04:38,200 --> 03:04:44,200
No more those pesky PCP dreams.

3453
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:47,200
Anything to stop the horror.

3454
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:51,200
Next one is called Oblivion Fall.

3455
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:54,200
Three, two, one, go.

3456
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:57,200
How do we know his name isn't Oblivion Fall?

3457
03:04:57,200 --> 03:04:58,200
Hmm?

3458
03:04:58,200 --> 03:04:59,200
What?

3459
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:00,200
Okay.

3460
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:01,200
Well, cool.

3461
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:02,200
I don't know.

3462
03:05:02,200 --> 03:05:04,200
That is his name.

3463
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:05,200
What?

3464
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:08,200
I don't understand.

3465
03:05:08,200 --> 03:05:11,200
I mean, like, the season?

3466
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:16,200
What if the fall means the season and not, like, when you go from a high place to a low place?

3467
03:05:16,200 --> 03:05:17,200
Boah!

3468
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:19,200
Oh!

3469
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:22,200
Oh, fuck!

3470
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:28,200
Next, okay, next one is called Slime Times Weekend Update Number Two.

3471
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:30,200
Ooh, looking forward to it.

3472
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:32,200
Yeah, from Prince Isolation.

3473
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:35,200
Three, two, one, go.

3474
03:05:35,200 --> 03:05:37,200
Telling you again, one and all.

3475
03:05:37,200 --> 03:05:41,200
Welcome to the second installment of the Slime Times Weekend Update.

3476
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:47,200
This week was the week of Valentine's Day, and right on cue, I've come to you with some lovey-dovey news.

3477
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:53,200
The stay dead, known as Duckhead, and the killer, Violet, have gotten married at Slimes and Clips.

3478
03:05:53,200 --> 03:06:00,200
In response to the union, rowdy Liam and Killer Dog went on to get divorced in the same location that fine day.

3479
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:05,200
After filing the paperwork, Liam attempted to push Killer Dog off the cliff and into the sea,

3480
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:08,200
but her big bones made her too heavy to even budge.

3481
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:14,200
Liam called her a fat bitch, upon which Killer Dog threw him off the edge, killing him.

3482
03:06:14,200 --> 03:06:19,200
She finally capped off the event by committing suicide, jumping into the slimy abyss herself.

3483
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:24,200
It goes to show that in Neil Milwaukee, love doesn't come without its sharper edges.

3484
03:06:24,200 --> 03:06:29,200
I hope to see you next time, and remember, the Slime Time is the best time.

3485
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:33,200
It's a fine day for a green wedding!

3486
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:35,200
Woo!

3487
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:37,200
That's great. Glad Prince is doing that.

3488
03:06:38,200 --> 03:06:49,200
If I could offer a note, I feel like there was a better pun there about that unfortunate turn for all Killer Dog and Liam, but we'll never know.

3489
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:51,200
A better pun?

3490
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:56,200
I don't know. I mean, going on with the love as its sharper edges or whatever it was.

3491
03:06:56,200 --> 03:07:00,200
I don't know. They're all on these cliffs and stuff. I'm sure there was something else.

3492
03:07:00,200 --> 03:07:03,200
There was something good there.

3493
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:11,200
Love is blind, just like when you fall off a cliff.

3494
03:07:11,200 --> 03:07:16,200
No, they say love is blind, love is deaf, fall off a cliff to your death.

3495
03:07:16,200 --> 03:07:22,200
We'll workshop it.

3496
03:07:23,200 --> 03:07:40,200
Incidentally, Ben St. asked me last week whether or not I am aware that there used to be a genuine paper titled The Slime Times.

3497
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:46,200
I am well aware. However, these days, people no longer really like to read, especially off of paper surfaces.

3498
03:07:46,200 --> 03:07:52,200
And the director of the paper mill committed a grisly suicide and now lives in a suicide estate there.

3499
03:07:52,200 --> 03:08:00,200
So I decided to take over the matter and present these things in a new medium that is sure to be hip and cool. Radio.

3500
03:08:00,200 --> 03:08:03,200
Old time radio.

3501
03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:04,200
Thank you Prince.

3502
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:05,200
Thank you.

3503
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:06,200
Thank you.

3504
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:17,200
I got a, okay, listen to this. I got some slime news. I got some Slime Times news myself. I don't know what to do about this.

3505
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:20,200
I feel like this is fine to talk about.

3506
03:08:20,200 --> 03:08:28,200
Marron Pan sent me, this was two days ago, and I have not responded because I don't really know what to make of it.

3507
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:42,200
Marron Pan sent me a document with a few written statements regarding the arrest of killer Ungin, because apparently Ungin was botting.

3508
03:08:42,200 --> 03:08:44,200
And this was...

3509
03:08:44,200 --> 03:08:48,200
Yeah, I am loosely aware of that situation.

3510
03:08:48,200 --> 03:08:57,200
I sort of didn't really read the details, but I guess people were upset about some botting shenanigans that Ungin was playing and they arrested Ungin.

3511
03:08:57,200 --> 03:09:00,200
Not botting, alting, I think.

3512
03:09:00,200 --> 03:09:02,200
Alting, sorry, yeah.

3513
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:17,200
Yeah, so Ungin had an alt splat cat that was in the rowdies and they think that splat cat was a spy and allowed Ungin to make some big kills and people are real upset about it.

3514
03:09:18,200 --> 03:09:20,200
That's the situation.

3515
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:29,200
I thought it would be fine to just like, okay, while it was funny, we'll ban splat cat, splat cat's gone.

3516
03:09:29,200 --> 03:09:37,200
And Ungin was speared or put in jail for like a week, but the people want more. They want blood.

3517
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:39,200
They want blood.

3518
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:47,200
They're coming to Pontius Pilate. Oh, the flogging. The 39 lashes are not enough.

3519
03:09:47,200 --> 03:09:51,200
To keep you vultures happy, I shall flog him.

3520
03:09:52,200 --> 03:09:58,200
Well, it was funny because initially you have a duty crucify him.

3521
03:09:58,200 --> 03:09:59,200
Initially.

3522
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:01,200
Crucify him, crucify him.

3523
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:05,200
Ungin was jailed for just three days and everyone said, no, that's not nearly enough.

3524
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:09,200
We've jailed fraud for a month for such crimes. It's got to be at least a week.

3525
03:10:09,200 --> 03:10:14,200
They put him in jail for a week and now it's like, not enough. We need more.

3526
03:10:14,200 --> 03:10:23,200
Yeah, Marin sent me a document with some written statements by some victims or by some witnesses to the crime.

3527
03:10:24,200 --> 03:10:31,200
I think he wanted me to like, I don't know, I think he wanted me to like weigh in and like say what I think should happen.

3528
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:38,200
But I kind of feel like, I kind of feel like the people who are more active in the game should be the ones that have an opinion about that.

3529
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:42,200
Like, I don't know. Whatever they feel is appropriate.

3530
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:49,200
Yeah, I kind of agree. I feel like just a week or two in jail was fine, but people are upset. So I don't know.

3531
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:51,200
I don't know how to rectify that.

3532
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:54,200
Community service.

3533
03:10:54,200 --> 03:10:56,200
Yeah.

3534
03:10:56,200 --> 03:10:59,200
Wait, no, we have a, not the channel community service.

3535
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:00,200
Yeah, understood.

3536
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:02,200
Community service hours, right?

3537
03:11:02,200 --> 03:11:03,200
Yeah.

3538
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:09,200
He's got to pick up trash in the coast line.

3539
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:14,200
That was the last voicemail. We're done. Nightmare is over.

3540
03:11:14,200 --> 03:11:17,200
I know I said I could do 100 more, but I was lying. I'm glad it's over.

3541
03:11:17,200 --> 03:11:20,200
I know. That's okay. I know. I know.

3542
03:11:21,200 --> 03:11:24,200
Nobody likes voicemails. We're here out of help.

3543
03:11:26,200 --> 03:11:27,200
A sacred duty.

3544
03:11:35,200 --> 03:11:45,200
Well, any final thoughts on episode 302 of the Procrastinators podcast crack?

3545
03:11:45,200 --> 03:11:49,200
Well, I think we got to wrap it up by doing an intro.

3546
03:11:49,200 --> 03:11:50,200
We never did the intro.

3547
03:11:53,200 --> 03:12:02,200
Wait, before we, before we end with an intro, I want to say thanks for joining me today and preventing the nightmare that would have been another solo, Ben Kass.

3548
03:12:02,200 --> 03:12:03,200
Yeah.

3549
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:06,200
You came in the last minute. Last minute, I was like, please, someone save me.

3550
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:07,200
Anybody.

3551
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:10,200
I'll take anyone. Please don't let this happen.

3552
03:12:10,200 --> 03:12:25,200
I was thrilled. I was thrilled that instead of some refuse, instead of some ragtag ragamuffin, it was my friend crack that wanted to join me.

3553
03:12:25,200 --> 03:12:32,200
Oh, it's been nice. Glad I could hang out. Thanks for putting out the distress beacon.

3554
03:12:32,200 --> 03:12:35,200
It was such distress.

3555
03:12:36,200 --> 03:12:40,200
All right. All right, everyone. What's up?

3556
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:44,200
This has been the Procrastinators podcast slash the like button.

3557
03:12:44,200 --> 03:12:47,200

Leave a comment down below.

3562
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:07,200
What would you leave a voicemail about if you were stupid enough to leave a voicemail?

3563
03:13:07,200 --> 03:13:10,200
Let us know in the comments down below.

3564
03:13:10,200 --> 03:13:12,200
Right. Please, please let us know in the comments.

3565
03:13:12,200 --> 03:13:14,200
Do not actually leave the voicemail.

3566
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:16,200
No, no, please.

3567
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:24,200
It's better for, it's better for engagement if you just type out your stupid voicemail instead of writing it instead of speaking it.

3568
03:13:24,200 --> 03:13:26,200
Yeah. All right.

3569
03:13:26,200 --> 03:13:28,200
That's going to do it.

3570
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:30,200
Good, good, good.

3571
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:32,200
Bye.
