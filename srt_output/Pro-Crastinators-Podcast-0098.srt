1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm supposed to be working right now.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But I'm not working.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm doing nothing.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My dick, I'm drinking.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Myself, I'm sucking.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I am an asshole.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am a stupid.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I got a deadline.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't wanna do it.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We've been expecting your unwashed presence today.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Proud and noble vagrants and rabble-rousers.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It seems as though you've made a mistake.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A wrong turn, perhaps?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Fate remembers not such tribal details

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
as the catalyst for its inauguration.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For the fact rings as loud as ears would allow

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
sans rupture, and you have found yourself

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
in the Procrastinator's podcast.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And here alongside me are internet content creators

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of most twisted and tortured tribe of artistic triumph

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
inconceivable to your noble and prissy class.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, these cultural barbarians stand before you,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and their ceaseless advance will leave you

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
shocked, bruised, battered, and railed against

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
as we talk about that most lascivious of subjects.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Sexual intercourse!

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Today I have with me Digibroider.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, get it in.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We have...

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will assume that was the best guy ever.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's talk about sex, baby.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's talk about you and me.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You guys remember the 90s?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now it's the best guy ever.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
An extremely goofy movie was My Sexual Awakening.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We have to hear...

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Invisible in Cell and mythical MGTOW hypocrite

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
here reporting for duty.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now it's all children of the world

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and Santa Claus has ever wondered,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
what is sex?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, I've gone to the highest power there is.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've committed suicide and I've gone to heaven

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
just to get this one fact for you.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The top definition for sex on UrbanDationary.com is

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
sex is like math.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You add the bed, subtract the clothes,

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
divide the legs, and pray you don't multiply.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I love it.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, let me kick back a cold one.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
As I unwind here, as you see,

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
this is a pretty broad topic that could potentially

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
span the entirety of human reproduction

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and as a human that's a pretty big deal.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But, as what I prepared for today

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is the main crux here of what I want to spread

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
with you warped virtual vermin here.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The question that people have jeered and sneered

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
at my house for and made fun of me

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
for my completely legitimate beliefs.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's cut the chase here as all new listeners

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
will pitifully think as ironic or pretentious,

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
but longtime fans will know are all too real

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and pretentious.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is sex good or is sex bad?

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, I have a question before I answer.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I've heard that when you have sex

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you have to show the girl your penis.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And if that's true, I have to say it must be pretty bad.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Because that just sounds like a sex peepee.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's not okay.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought sex was when the keyblades touch,

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
but I'm not sure about the dual keyblade.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Ben, so if it's when you show a girl your dick,

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
does that mean if there's two boys, then it's fine?

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, yeah, guys can't see penises because they look away.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like, guys reflexively look away from another penis.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Guys can't have sex.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I mean, maybe.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have like a sixth sense dick detector

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that if there's like dick nearby, I can avoid it.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like, if I walk into a bathroom, I'm immediately aware

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
of like how in danger I am of seeing anyone's dick.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's like when you come into a room

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and you can hear that the TV is on, even if there's no volume.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, is that a question?

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You can hear the presence of a visible dick.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, so you have a special dick sense that most guys don't have.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you have more relation to dick.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It allows me to avoid it.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't know that that's uncommon.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I feel like lots of guys are constantly in don't see dick mode.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It sounds like most men who go into the men's restroom

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
know that there are men in there who have penises.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've spent a lot of time in changing rooms

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and I've spent a lot of time looking at men's dicks.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I just want to ask, is it gayer or not gayer

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
to have a specific dick aversion?

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Because I just don't care.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've looked at a lot of dicks, I look at a lot more as my tastes go on.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When I go to the men's room, I specifically try and find trick shots

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and fucking sniper viewpoints where I can see that guy's fucking dick

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
without him realizing that I'm sneaking at him.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
God damn it, look here exactly what I'm afraid of.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm afraid of this and the fucking bathroom.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Digi, it's not my fault your dicks looking like a fucking snack right about now.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not my fault.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You gotta cover that shit up.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yo, wrap that shit like a quiche for me, baby.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want to see that thing covered in smegma.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's what I'm all about.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want you to stick a fucking toothpick for that hors d'oeuvre

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
right through your fucking re-thrift.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to see a waiter walk out with a plate full of those snacks.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just spread them around to the whole high-class crew that we've gathered to sample.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I will admit my flaccid cock looks exactly like one of those fucking little barbecue sausages.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Every time I eat one, I'm like, this is just a dick.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Smothered in barbecue sauce, just smothered.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The ones that you eat out of a can with a fucking toothpick.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know what I'm talking about?

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, they know what that is.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Fucking order in the court.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's make the rounds here.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's get the general statements first.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are your general thoughts on sex, Nate?

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is it all good or is it all bad, Nate?

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's all good or all bad.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He asked me, Ben, shut up.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, my thoughts on sex are it is only acceptable in the missionary position

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
for the sole purpose of reproduction.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
These are my thoughts.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm glad I picked you first.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Did you?

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Did you?

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is sex all good or is it all bad?

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's all good for me, baby.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh!

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Look like a fucking snack from where I'm sitting.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Hippo, is sex all good or is it all bad?

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, it depends on how far we define sex.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No, no, is it all good or is it all bad?

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, because I'm thinking you can make a baby without having sex.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
True.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's like what that guy tried to do in The Silence of the Lambs

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
when he just threw his jizz at that lady as she was walking by his cell.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's like how you do it.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think the way I see it is that making babies is pretty cool

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
because babies are cute, but then sex is like a hassle

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and you don't want to have to do it.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's indirect. It's not the most optimal prime position to have a baby.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The prime position is just, you know, lobbing jizz at random women.

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The worst part about sex is the burned calories that interfere with my gains.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That is the biggest problem with sex, for sure.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's just a lot of red tape you got to go through.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's true. That's true.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Nate, in order to retain that protein, you should do a Nate of your own every time.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, you got to do a Nate right in your own mouth.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No, that's a fucking snack I'd like to eat if you were to fucking say it.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Glug, glug, glug.

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ben, is sex good or is it all bad?

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, my interest is piqued. I'm very curious about the subject.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm very interested in learning more one day.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Perhaps one of the five gentlemen could show me a thing or two.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, but I'm prepared. I'm prepared for it to be bad,

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
but I still kind of want to find out if you know what I'm saying.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm risking the danger someday, but not yet because I'm a little baby boy.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't trust myself as a bad sexual or only attracted things that make me feel bad

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
to things that are consistent, like, consistency, considered bad things, like murder.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm only attracted things such as that.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Necrophilia? All right, all right.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, to ask myself that thing, I have, legendarily, the controversial belief that sex is all bad.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And I have written, here, I posted in the chat,

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
something like, like, 1600 words ran out in my fucking notes.

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Like, I have a fucking lawyer, I have like a prosecution lawyer for fucking sex

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
trial case right before me right now.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay, muchi, I got to ask.

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
To me, I feel as though, when I hear you say sex is all bad,

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just think you are objectively wrong because some people are having good sex right now in the world.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, what is bad about their sex?

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Like, is sex bad for like a higher reason than that it, you know,

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
like, you're not saying that all sex is bad to, like, it's not a bad time,

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but you're saying it's like morally bad, right?

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Maybe muchi's one of these guys who's saying that, like, you know, like,

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
sex can reproduce children and it's immoral to bring children into the world

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because they will suffer to some degree.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think the idea is that sex is not productive.

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Like, it's not productive in a real way.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Like, it might make babies, but that's bad.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, that's what I want to know.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I mean, it's, it's like as literally productive as you can possibly do.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Not, not at all.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It could do anything.

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, I think you're on a purpose that it's intentional for.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want to know, yeah, which is bad?

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is it the recreational aspect that's bad?

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it the productive aspect that's bad?

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What's, yeah, tell us, tell us.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The problems with sex in two words are society and time.

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In one word, pressure.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In a whole fucking bunch of words.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Again, one hundred, sixteen hundred words written down here.

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm ready to fucking like Roman Senator go as hard as fucking Ken Ham

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
as a fucking mother bleeper here.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, well.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Feel what's her screenplay at a moment's notice.

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So, so.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, let's get into it.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Argument one, argument one.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What's, what's wrong?

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Number one, society.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Sex is one of, if not directly, society's main measure of wealth and status.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It is the root.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The starting point.

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What about wealth and status?

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, what about those two?

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, well, those are all.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm a bunch of here.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It is all in pursuit of sex, basically.

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No one, well.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, everyone in the world understands that Bill Gates is the richest man

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and the most successful man in the world.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Jeff Bezos is Jeff Bezos now.

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There is, okay, whatever.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
There's never been a time that Bill Gates has had to be on TV with a hot chick

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
to prove to people that he's the richest and most successful man in the world.

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like, he's never, his wife is just some normal looking lady.

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Like, he's never had to be like, oh, fucking, I'm banging a supermodel.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is the ultimate show of wealth.

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We all know he's the most wealthy because he has the most money.

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, money is by far the biggest show of like fucking status in the world.

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, on a biological level.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And what do you attract when you have money and wealth?

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You attract sex.

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But you don't have to taste it.

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Bill Gates doesn't have to fuck a bunch of random girls just because of that rich.

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I mean, I think people, like, I think people admire if they think that, like, you could have sex.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Like, you don't have to actually do it.

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Exactly.

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But like, if they detect that, like, you couldn't even if you wanted to, then that's bad.

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't think people look up to rich people because they think they get laid all the time

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
because you don't have to be rich to get laid all the time.

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What you have to be rich to do is to fucking own the world.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, you're oversimplifying.

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What does it mean to even owe the world?

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like, if you, okay, the whole point of this is what is the measure of a successful human being?

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And from our origin, biologically speaking, what a successful human being was,

251
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, for guys, let's just say, a successful man was someone who impregnated lots of people

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and passed along his genetic code.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That was success for that person.

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think that's not, like, that is not what we as a society,

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
like, we don't think, oh, the most successful guy is fucking Ron Jeremy

256
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
because he's fucked the most girls.

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, he, subconsciously we do.

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Subconsciously, if people with disabilities are represented, maybe you do.

259
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Would you not say that sex is one of society's main measures of wealth and stash?

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because that's what my sentence was.

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I thought you said it was the most.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's what I heard.

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Sex is one of, if not.

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, well, it's not. It is not. It is just one of.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
One of, okay, sure.

266
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like, let's continue. That was the first sentence I said.

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I would argue that the concepts of sex and death, like, are the root drivers of everything that human beings do.

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Like, money is garbage, money is to have sex.

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
No, I agree that it's the drive of everything we do.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's just not how we measure success.

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like, it's not the number one way that our society measures success.

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, it's like the root thing. It's like saying that, like, yeah.

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We're already in the weeds here.

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We're already getting caught up on minutiae and pedantic fucking semantics here.

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not pedantic. We're already there.

276
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is the meat. This is the real shit.

277
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay, whatever. It's an important issue related to all this.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But, okay, bunch of go on. Go on. What else you got?

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Again, again, I'm making it.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's the starting point of major and vast social contracts.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's the root of a whole...

282
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Most of the shit we do is for sex.

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
To be bad at sex, or to be considered unattractive,

284
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
is synonymous with being undesirable, unwanted,

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and you are literally losing life by not reproducing.

286
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It is the subject of many key debate,

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and it is, like, when it was sought after,

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
concept in all of life as we know it,

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
in all of, like, multi-cellular life,

290
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is to fucking have sex. That's it.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's the lens I'm dealing everything from.

292
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's the starting point from what it is.

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'd like to expand on the thing I said earlier

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
about making babies without sex.

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This is sort of tying into that,

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
in that the need for society, in society,

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
to have had and be having sex all the time,

298
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
at least enough, is, like, a big pressure.

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And if baby-making was entirely, like, scientific,

300
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
you just go to a place, you get a baby,

301
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
like, that would make that less of a problem.

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think...

303
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think babies should come out of the scientist place,

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and sex should be not real.

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Then you could do eugenics without having to be uncomfortable

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to say that you like eugenics.

307
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, here's what I think.

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I think that, like, not the having of sex,

309
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but the ability to have sex is, like, if you wanted it,

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
is, like, an indicator of power,

311
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and, like, the ability to, like,

312
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you know, the ability to, like, do what you want

313
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and, like, not be impeded.

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That is definitely true.

315
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And so, like, yeah, like, I don't know,

316
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
if you see a guy and you're, like,

317
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
oh, man, I bet that guy could get laid,

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that's, like, you know, like, that's one thing

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
that's, like, oh, well, he's got that,

320
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
like, he's powerful in that way.

321
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's, like, oh, this guy's got a lot of money.

322
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, he could afford a lot of stuff.

323
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He's powerful in that other way.

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I mean, there's no need to, like, look at,

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
look at it past the just, like, you know,

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the frat level, just, like, like, don't you agree

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that, like, when you see someone who fucks a lot,

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
that's, like, oh, wow, cool.

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Do you not have that thought in your mind?

330
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you not think, like, wow?

331
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, we all do, I think.

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's what I'm saying here.

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll set a level.

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It has social currency.

335
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sex is social currency.

336
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's true.

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Correct.

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And as such, I think that it is undeserving

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of this, what would I call it,

340
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
this stature, this status in the world.

341
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I do not think it is deserving of this

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
for multiple reasons.

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Number one is that, well, like, the main,

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I guess, appeal of sex outside of making babies,

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
which is not really a main thing, like,

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
culturally, that's not the main thing

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
people have sex for.

348
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Do you guys agree?

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah.

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yeah.

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Mostly.

352
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Wait, I'm sorry.

353
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're saying that it's not, say that again.

354
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm trying to parse what you just said.

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
People have sex because it feels good, right?

356
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes, correct.

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, I think a lot of people have sex

358
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
for those social reasons, because, like,

359
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
having sex makes them cooler guys.

360
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I think, I do.

361
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I do.

362
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I do.

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think that people have sex because they feel

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
an incredible tugging urge to do it at all times.

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah, that's exactly that.

366
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't think people have, I don't think people

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
have sex as a consequence of knowing that it feels good.

368
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like, we know it is supposed to feel good,

369
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
but, like, you want to, like, you know,

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
until you have sex, if you're, you know,

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
like some of us who didn't have sex,

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
that we were well into our 20s and wanted it

373
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
since we were fucking 10, then, like,

374
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you've spent a lot of time just obsessing over it,

375
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
not even knowing that it feels good

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
or how good it does feel or, like,

377
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
what it's going to be like.

378
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's just, like, this insatiable fucking urge

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to have it drives you towards it, you know?

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's ingrained deep into your brain,

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and I would argue we should surgically remove that.

382
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Literally every human generation.

383
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay, here's why you guys are all wrong,

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
especially you, Munchie, and it also gives.

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Every generation of human being that has existed

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
up till now has obviously passed on the trait

387
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
of wanting to have sex because sex is good,

388
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
because that is how the human race has evolved.

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And it is the desire to have sex that,

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and, you know, and the fact that the human race

391
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
is divided into two sexes, male and female,

392
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to promote genetic diversity that has allowed

393
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the mutations that allows, you know,

394
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
like mammals to evolve into apes, into human beings.

395
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Like, it all exists for the very specific purpose

396
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
of genetic mutation,

397
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
so that, or genetic diversity,

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
set the best of the best rise to the top.

399
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And the problem right now is that we are no longer

400
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
living in a Darwinian system,

401
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and now everything is just done, like, pure,

402
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
because humans are, like, so software driven,

403
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
as opposed to hardware driven out,

404
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
like society dictates how we do things like,

405
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
now you just fuck hot guys as opposed to,

406
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you know, like the best fathers, just as, like, one example.

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's completely changed the way this whole thing works,

408
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
but we've still got these archaic things beat into us.

409
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I personally think that we're better off

410
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
in a more Darwinian system than we are now.

411
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't disagree with that.

412
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I wasn't arguing against that at all.

413
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, you were saying that it's wrong.

414
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I actually think we might be getting,

415
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
hold on, I actually think we might be getting

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
better about, like, finding

417
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
better matches for people,

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and this is why, like, online dating

419
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
is taken off so much.

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Sponsored by eHarmony.com.

421
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
None of those have ever worked for me.

422
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
My method was get famous enough for people

423
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
to fucking message you, you know,

424
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
either way, it's still online dating,

425
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and like,

426
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think that

427
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the reason it's so popular is that

428
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
people are dissatisfied with, like,

429
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
finding, like, just whatever's

430
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in their local, like,

431
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I feel like we've expanded

432
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the gene pool

433
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
in a way, where it's like some of us who are born

434
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
on this new generation are not

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
meant to fuck within our town, because we've

436
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
developed a system of beliefs

437
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that only really exists

438
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
in the internet space, you know,

439
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
like, the kind of people that we are,

440
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
especially guys like us who spend

441
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
a lot of time online, like,

442
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
we need to have, like, a mate who understands

443
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
the internet, because, like, the kids

444
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
that we're gonna have are gonna be, like,

445
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
super fucking plugged into that,

446
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and as technology, you know, improves,

447
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm plugged in. Oh, yeah.

448
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm just saying, like, for all we know

449
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
by the time we, like, all our kids are, like,

450
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
10, they might be rolling out, like,

451
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
oh, money microchips in your hands

452
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and shit, and, like, we need to be able to, like,

453
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I need a mate who's up and up on

454
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
technology so that when we have to teach

455
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
our kids about computers, you're not a fucking

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
retard about computers, because that's going to ruin our

457
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
kids' future. Every kid needs to grow up

458
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
learning coding, you know?

459
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
My kid's gonna know coding by the time they're 10.

460
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You know?

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Dude, do you plan on blocking websites

462
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
from your kid?

463
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Um, I mean,

464
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
if he's, like, 5, I should put it on, like,

465
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
an adult mode, you know?

466
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like, most electronic devices have

467
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
some kind of, like, here, hit

468
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
this button and only kid-friendly stuff appears,

469
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
you know? So I'd probably do

470
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
that until I thought they were, like,

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I mean, if they get old enough to figure out

472
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
the internet, there's nothing I can do to stop them.

473
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Like, nothing stopped me

474
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
or any of you, you know, like, once

475
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
we got into the open wide internet,

476
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
we just found everything we wanted to find.

477
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So, um,

478
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
you know, there's no stopping them, but you have to get to a certain

479
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
age before you even have, like, the cognitive capacity

480
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
to do that, you know?

481
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I feel like...

482
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is, again, a topic,

483
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but I feel like there might be

484
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
some duty as

485
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
parents to not let your

486
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
kid be a role-player.

487
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Very personal

488
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
issue for you, I know.

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We can't let another one fall to that.

490
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah, I feel like

491
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
there are some websites that I'm

492
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
torn on, on PossiblyBane,

493
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but we can do an entire

494
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
topic on the child.

495
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
A good idea. Let's do a banned websites episode.

496
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

497
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Websites we won't let our kids use.

498
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
YouTube.com

499
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We'll wait until we are actually dads.

501
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Then we can do some shit like that.

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It'll be fun to do one before being a dad,

503
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
then after being a dad.

504
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, okay, okay.

505
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You just said about how, like,

506
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
like, it's not like

507
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
you're choosing to get

508
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
horny. You never just, like,

509
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
think, okay, like, it's time for me

510
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
to get horny. Bone are happening now.

511
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, sometimes, I mean,

512
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
if I'm bored, then that's literally

513
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
what I do. Well, most people I don't

514
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
think, that's their experience with

515
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
sexuality. It's your

516
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
decision to go look at things that will

517
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
make you horny. You can't turn it on

518
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
without any stimulus.

519
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I mean, I can think about things that'll make me horny, but...

520
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Well, that's you searching

521
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
for it still. Yeah.

522
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The memory archive of the mind.

523
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

524
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That vast mental fortress, they called

525
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
the Digi Cranium. Yes, yes.

526
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Um, uh, fucking, yeah,

527
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
yeah. This is

528
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
a biological cancer

529
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that is forced upon every

530
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
human. And just to

531
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
clarify, the, is sex all

532
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
good, is all sex bad?

533
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Like, obviously, that is a mean point.

534
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
My more nuanced actual

535
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
thesis is that sex is

536
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
placed too highly status wise

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
in culture.

538
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
In culture, you're saying. In culture.

539
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You know, I don't think the problem

540
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
is culture. I think the problem is that

541
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
it's got too, it just has too much

542
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
of a hold over our minds. Like, it's

543
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
just that our minds are, like,

544
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
are geared in such a way that, like, all

545
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
week, it's

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
weird, actually, because humans, their

547
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
reproduction cycle is super fucking slow.

548
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It takes nine whole months to have a baby,

549
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and after you've

550
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
had it, you can't, you would have another one

551
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
for, like, a couple more months. So, like,

552
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the better part of, like, you could basically

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
have one kid a year. And so, it doesn't

554
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
really make sense that the dick gets hard,

555
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
like, eight times a day. Like,

556
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
you're not really meant to be out impregnating

557
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
fucking everyone, because you'll narrow the

558
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
gene pool if, like, one guy is having babies

559
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
with every fucking chick. So, it doesn't

560
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
make sense that we want to have sex

561
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
as often as we do. And then there's

562
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
some people who are like. Well, what did it

563
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
make a drive for, like, you know, early man

564
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
to want to have sex all the time, so it creates

565
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
a better... Yeah, let's talk about what

566
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
makes sense. I keep getting confused

567
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
if we're talking about early man, or if we're talking about, like, now

568
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
for society. No, it made

569
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
sense at a time, but it doesn't make

570
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
sense now, because, like,

571
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
we don't, like, you know,

572
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
women are not scarce the way

573
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
they were back then, probably.

574
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You know, like, you didn't have to,

575
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
like, you didn't need a constant drive

576
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
to be seeking one out, or trying to,

577
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
like, capture and, like, you know,

578
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
fucking

579
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
inseminate one. Like, nowadays

580
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it's like, most people just settle

581
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
down with one woman, and they've got,

582
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
like, she can have as many babies

583
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
with you as you want her to have, you know,

584
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
or as they, as you agree to have together.

585
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
As you agree to have.

586
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I mean, you can probably convince her to have as many

587
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
as you want. Well, maybe.

588
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's real easy to convince a woman to have another baby.

589
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If you, like, act like, if you can, like,

590
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
give her, like, a sob story as to why.

591
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
How many of you are so... I'm convinced to have a baby

592
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
with you.

593
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
None yet, but I know how easy it is.

594
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
How do you know that?

595
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
How do you know that?

596
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Why do you say that? Have you ever...

597
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't get it.

598
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
All you gotta do is be, like,

599
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh, but, like,

600
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Please!

601
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's say you've got eight, and she's, like, nine is too many.

602
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I guess after, like, four at that point

603
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you're just like, why not have more?

604
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And they'd probably be like, yeah, I can't even keep track of them at this point anyway.

605
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But, like, a woman has to go through, like, nine months

606
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
like, that's like, a horrifying ordeal for them.

607
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I mean, at some point you just get used to

608
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
being pregnant most of the time.

609
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What?!

610
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You don't even know what a pregnant person is!

611
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Think about that lady, the 18

612
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and counting lady. Like, that bitch was pregnant

613
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
most of her life. That's one bitch!

614
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's one fucking piece of shit.

615
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
She seemed to be having a great time, though.

616
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You know what I'm saying? I actually have no problem with her

617
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
whatsoever. I'm just memeing.

618
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm also memeing, and I don't remember what the hell

619
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I was actually talking about.

620
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What a wonderful use of everyone's time this has been.

621
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Why is sex bad?

622
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Tell me more.

623
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I keep trying, but did she come in

624
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
with non sequiturs that completely derail

625
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
discussion midway through

626
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
one sentence after one

627
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
sentence?

628
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I was making a point and I just told a joke

629
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and then everybody, like, latched onto the joke

630
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and I expanded on it.

631
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So, I lost track of what I was

632
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
actually saying.

633
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm saying that sex will hijack your mind

634
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
in situations where you will not want this.

635
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You could be in a funeral, you could be in a baby shower,

636
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
you could beat your own funeral

637
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and you would still get a vote.

638
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I think I've got a fundamental problem

639
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
with your arguments here.

640
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I think your point is perfectly valid,

641
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
but here's where I just hit a stopping point.

642
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Like, this is just how...

643
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Starfleet.

644
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Actually, this is kind of the opposite of Starfleet.

645
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's just like, this is just how humans are.

646
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So, what good does it do

647
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to talk about how mad we are

648
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
just how humans are?

649
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We can get rid of it with robot splicing.

650
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
We can splice it right out.

651
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We can splice that shit.

652
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We can download a patch update

653
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and get the DLC for our human consciousness.

654
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I think actually it would help a lot

655
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
if we... I think part of the problem right now

656
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
is everyone's really overstimulated

657
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
in modern society that there is

658
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
such easy access to

659
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
pornography and you can watch...

660
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I definitely think that I grew up

661
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
with way too much

662
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
access to, like, sex.

663
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because, like, I'm fucking...

664
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I feel like I'm horny all the fucking time.

665
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Like, just non-stop. And it's always been this way.

666
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's not just now, like,

667
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I've always just been, like, wanting

668
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to fucking jack my dick all day.

669
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Everybody knew this!

670
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Like, you listen to the pub crawl.

671
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I used to talk about how much I jack off all the time.

672
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I've listened to one episode

673
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
of the pub crawl made.

674
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I thought you... I thought you listened to...

675
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You told me you listened to, like, everything I'd ever done.

676
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, I specifically said besides the pub crawl,

677
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I specifically said that I don't like pub crawl.

678
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I specifically said that I don't like pub crawl.

679
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, pub crawl is great, anyways.

680
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I used to...

681
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I, you know, I just feel like

682
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I've always been over-sexed. It's mostly because

683
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
of overexposure, too.

684
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like, I'm fucking constantly surrounded

685
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
by, like, posters of sexy anime girls

686
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and fucking I'm always on A

687
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and they're always posting porn on A

688
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and they're always... I'm just saying that, like,

689
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
the internet is just constantly inundating

690
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
you with, like, images of sex

691
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and, like, society, if I watch

692
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
TV for long enough, I'm going to see, like, an ad

693
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
with some fucking hot chicken

694
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and I'm going to be like, well, I've got a boner now.

695
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Like, you know...

696
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
DJ, absolutely. I absolutely

697
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
see where you're coming from with this.

698
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But where I immediately hit a brick wall for myself

699
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
is, what can possibly be done?

700
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
What could anyone do?

701
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Why is it me? Shit.

702
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Here is what I think I'm not communicating well.

703
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The point is not to just stew

704
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
on the fact that, like, wow,

705
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
we are like this, isn't it bad?

706
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And we need to abolish sex.

707
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That's what I'm trying to say. I'm saying

708
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
that we place too much emphasis on sex

709
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and I think it will do some good

710
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
to look at the negatives of sex

711
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to kind of knock it down a notch in our minds

712
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
so we can better conquer it.

713
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So, maybe you're talking about how, like,

714
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
right now, like, at college, it's, like, a big

715
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
meme that everyone goes to college and just, like, fucks, like, crazy.

716
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Like, that's, like, a cultural phenomenon.

717
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So you're saying that, like, it might be better

718
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
if we just, we don't emphasize that so much.

719
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Maybe our, maybe our, like, our movies

720
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
stop, stop lionizing, like, these guys

721
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
who just fuck, like, crazy, like, in these

722
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
college movies, like, like, things of that sort.

723
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Exactly. Exactly.

724
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay, okay, I got it.

725
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That it just stops become,

726
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it stops being such a federal fucking issue

727
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
for all things related to sex.

728
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If I can just plant a flag.

729
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If I can just plant a flag, you know.

730
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
If I can plant a flag on it, in my sense,

731
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think nobody will be surprised by this.

732
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But I personally, I have a lot of sex.

733
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I do. I had a large amount of sex

734
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
yesterday and today, and it was great.

735
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But I really am not

736
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
that interested.

737
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You beat me to, like, doing that bit.

738
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Like, I, I thought I was going to be the one, like, obnoxiously

739
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
bragging about having too much sex.

740
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Well, I, I bring it up because it's relevant to my point,

741
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
goddammit, not because I'm just trying to brag.

742
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That's why I thought it would come up.

743
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And everyone's just like, oh, but if I had done it

744
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that way, even if it was for my point,

745
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
everyone would have been like, oh, do you,

746
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
you are the boy, you are the boy

747
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
who cried, I had sex.

748
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I am not that boy.

749
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I am, I am a good boy.

750
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah, you, you're just not.

751
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You fucking sat there, you sat there like the intro

752
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
of that Slipknot song that's like,

753
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I felt the air rise up in me.

754
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You're like, you're like sitting there, like,

755
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
peering from the bushes, waiting for a chance to get to you.

756
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's more like that, it's more like the intro to a song

757
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that's like, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, do you feel that?

758
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, oh shit.

759
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's the next reaction point.

760
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I care about this intellectually.

761
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I care about this topic.

762
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I want you to say what you were going to say.

763
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Okay, what I was going to say was that

764
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
even though I have access to sex right now,

765
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
it's great, I do it a lot,

766
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
it does not provide any practical

767
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
benefit to the things I'm trying to

768
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
accomplish in my life other than kind of

769
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
just satiating my base level human needs.

770
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And for that reason,

771
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I totally understand, like I personally,

772
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I went through a big dry spell for years

773
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
recently and that sucked.

774
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But now, now that I have it, I no longer

775
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
give a shit.

776
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I don't spend any time like, stewing on it.

777
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It is just, I have a checkbox.

778
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I had what was previously an unchecked box

779
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
that is now a checkbox for sex.

780
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It's done. It is handled in my life.

781
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And I can now move on

782
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
to all the other stuff that I want

783
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
to spend my time on and make progress on

784
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
every day. That's how I feel.

785
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And I feel like culture should treat it that way.

786
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It's just something you gotta deal with.

787
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's basic. It's like, it's like, yeah,

788
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
when people, you know, they say

789
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that like sex is only a big deal if you're

790
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
not having any. Because if you're not having any,

791
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
you're gonna start to feel like, you know,

792
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
something's wrong and you're missing something

793
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and oh god, oh god.

794
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And then you get it. And it's like, well,

795
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
it wasn't that big a deal and there are more important

796
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
things, you know, it's just, it's just something

797
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
you gotta deal with. I don't know if I feel that way.

798
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I always felt like, if I could,

799
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
if there was like a hypothetical

800
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
situation where I could have a partner

801
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
for life without worrying about

802
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
the sex aspect,

803
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I probably would.

804
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You mean just like you could not fuck?

805
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
If it wasn't real, okay. No, if it wasn't a

806
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
real thing and I could just like, I could

807
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
marry a person that I like to hang around

808
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
with. Because, you know,

809
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
nice people don't always have the big

810
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
sex parts. And if you don't

811
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
get a person that you like who also

812
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
has the big sex parts, then

813
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm like a bitch with a big old

814
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
vagina. I'm talking people

815
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
who are down to their knees, my dude.

816
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I want a girl with a curl. This is a volleyball.

817
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's what that's about.

818
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I want to beat that thing around like a boxing bag.

819
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm gonna throw it. I'm going to throw it.

820
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm going to throw it.

821
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Alright.

822
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You know those boxing montages?

823
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You know those boxing montages?

824
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Like doing this thing,

825
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
like doing this spiral motion. That's me,

826
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
boy. That's me every time.

827
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I want to chomp down on my girl like a

828
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
French dip. I'm gonna dip that Chinaz

829
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and I'm going to take a huge old

830
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
biker. Real quote. Real quote from a friend

831
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
of my girlfriend. When I go down on

832
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
a girl, I want something to bite on to.

833
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Referring to pubic hair.

834
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Referring to pubic hair.

835
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay, this is real.

836
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Settle down, children.

837
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What I was saying is the...

838
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
What is it?

839
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Get the fuck out.

840
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Get the fuck out.

841
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Get the fuck out.

842
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

843
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

844
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't know what I'm saying.

845
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh, yeah.

846
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Wait, wait, wait.

847
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You were going on about beef curtains, I believe.

848
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You were going on about beef curtains, I believe.

849
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yes.

850
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Sex is like...

851
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
People either have the body they...

852
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Usually, they just get a good sex body

853
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that is sexually attractive.

854
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's either you die or you lose.

855
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And if you marry that person,

856
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
you'll be like a baby boomer.

857
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You'll be every old person ever.

858
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You'll be unhappy and you won't like them.

859
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh.

860
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You're describing me, hippo.

861
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
A person with a great sex body

862
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and a terrible personality that you don't like.

863
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Exactly.

864
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I would kind of...

865
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
If sex bodies weren't part of it,

866
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
or either...

867
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
If you could augment your body really easily,

868
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
but it's expensive.

869
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
If sex wasn't as big a deal,

870
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
you could just worry about getting

871
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
to it with a person that you like

872
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and want to spend time with,

873
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and then marriage makes a lot more sense.

874
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And it's not even a big deal.

875
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I would like to hug and cuddle people.

876
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I just don't care about all the squishy shit.

877
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Well, you can do that now, you know.

878
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You can just not...

879
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I know I can do that now.

880
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's just...

881
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's what the whole discussion is about.

882
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's societal pressure.

883
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I would slightly object to the idea

884
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
that you are, and you have to be that way forever.

885
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because, you know, I'm a big self-improvement guy.

886
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Unless you're born with a cataclysmically tiny dick,

887
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
or, you know...

888
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Cataclysmically.

889
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's the right word for it.

890
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Unless you have some actual physical defect.

891
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
If you're just a sensuality guy.

892
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Under the weight of the tininess.

893
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Of the absence of weight of this dick.

894
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What I mean by that is that I just wish

895
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I didn't feel certain ways about people

896
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
who were attractive or not.

897
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Their personalities.

898
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's not possible because, you know,

899
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
a person is made up of everything about them.

900
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Did you know?

901
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
My whole point is this...

902
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
My one point about this is just that

903
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I understand all the frustration with sex.

904
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It totally makes sense.

905
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But life, I think it's appropriate

906
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that has intense, extremely brutal

907
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
backbreaking struggles that we have to

908
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
overcome if we want to get where we're at.

909
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That means life will be full of suffering.

910
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But when you achieve it,

911
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
there's a better person for it.

912
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That's how I think about life a lot.

913
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's the whole, don't wish for lighter burdens.

914
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Wish for broader shoulders.

915
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I think between hippo and munchy

916
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
we've touched on what I think

917
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
is a solution for how sex can be handled in culture.

918
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Which is simply

919
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
to educate people better

920
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
on what

921
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
sex feels good.

922
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Because I think there's...

923
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You're talking about dating ed classes.

924
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Pres proposed by Christian Western-Chandle.

925
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That sounds dated.

926
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That's his joke.

927
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Not mine.

928
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
What about dating

929
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
ed with two D's, double D?

930
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
My favorite ed in any character.

931
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I thought it was a girl who I had to crush on

932
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
because I thought it was a girl.

933
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Ladies, get off your butts and date him.

934
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Anyway,

935
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I think there needs to be more education

936
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
because basically all we tell kids

937
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
is like, here's how to have safe sex.

938
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Here's the problems with sex.

939
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You don't have to have sex when you're young.

940
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But you're going to...

941
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So instead what we should tell them is like,

942
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
hey, guess what?

943
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If you go to some random party

944
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and get drunk and fuck some random guy

945
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
you're probably gonna regret it in the morning.

946
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
However, if you find someone

947
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
who you really genuinely care about

948
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and is gonna take care of you

949
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
it might actually feel good.

950
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Maybe you should go find sex that's good.

951
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Forgive me for going full anarcho-capitalist here.

952
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It is totally...

953
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's the problem. It's that

954
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
society, at least in America,

955
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
parents have abdicated

956
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the responsibility of raising their kids

957
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
to schools and the state

958
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
in a huge degree.

959
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
In my life, not to shit on my dad,

960
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
but I really felt like there was a lot of things

961
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
about how to be a man that I just never knew

962
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
until I looked into pickup culture

963
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
in my late teens and 20s

964
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and then I learned how to be a man.

965
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The only reason I know anything about sex

966
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
is that I watched so much fucking porn

967
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
and I literally would ask women online

968
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
about their sex lives.

969
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hey, baby, did you order a sausage pizza?

970
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It works every time.

971
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I mean, if you watch fucking...

972
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Try to watch the porn that doesn't feel fake

973
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and then you'll feel like, oh, okay,

974
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
that's what actual sex looks like.

975
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Gang bang, rape, abduction, dungeon.

976
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I literally remember the first time

977
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I ever saw an amateur porn

978
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and was like, oh, real sex looks like that?

979
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Oh. That's totally different

980
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
from what I thought it looked like.

981
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
No, that is good to know.

982
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Not about brassers shit.

983
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I would just find people online that I could talk to

984
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and ask them questions about

985
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
what was it like the first time you had sex?

986
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
What is it like this time?

987
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Just learn about it from asking people

988
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
because no one taught me the right information

989
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that I wanted to know.

990
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Everyone needs an American Pie-style

991
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Kamina older brother guy

992
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
who they can ask what sex feels like

993
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and how to do it.

994
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Everyone needs a guy like that.

995
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm definitely someone who passed that

996
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
kind of information on to

997
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
my...

998
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm going to tell my brother,

999
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
turns out sex is great, you should go

1000
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
trying to have sex with that girl

1001
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
who you might want to have sex with.

1002
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I probably did tell him that

1003
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
after the first time I had sex.

1004
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I was probably like, you got to try this for yourself.

1005
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Shade beat us both

1006
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
through the punch.

1007
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That someone in the family

1008
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
was fucking

1009
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I thought it was cool.

1010
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
If Grace was a guy,

1011
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
well, I don't know.

1012
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Our sister became

1013
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
an independent person

1014
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
before Ben or I either of us did.

1015
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
She just

1016
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
felt like she wanted to be out on her own

1017
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and then became an independent adult.

1018
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't know.

1019
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
My little brother is the same.

1020
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Maybe it's

1021
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
like he has

1022
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
experience because I'm the older brother

1023
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and he just had a head start

1024
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
in his life about

1025
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
what I knew when I knew it.

1026
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Our sister always had more of

1027
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
an adverse reaction to

1028
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
like she didn't like

1029
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
being in our parents...

1030
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
She always resisted more

1031
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
of our parents' control

1032
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and Ben and I weren't happy about it

1033
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
but she had that desire, that urge

1034
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to be free on her own.

1035
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I hated living with our parents.

1036
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But we didn't have the spark to do anything about it.

1037
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Whereas Grace,

1038
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
apparently she was so into

1039
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
getting out of there as fast as she could

1040
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and then she did. But she's way tighter

1041
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
with the parents at least

1042
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
than I am.

1043
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
She hangs out with them

1044
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
which I don't get at all.

1045
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That's how you leave the house.

1046
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That's how you ease your way

1047
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
out so your parents don't question it

1048
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
because they'll just be like

1049
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
if they see enough of you anyway

1050
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I think that's how I got away with

1051
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
being fucking May away

1052
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
because I just kind of showed up out of nowhere

1053
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and after like three weeks

1054
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
moved into a place with her.

1055
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But like her parents are right there

1056
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
like her work was next to like her dad's house

1057
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
so it was like she'd go there all the time

1058
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
for lunch and so it didn't feel like she's gone

1059
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
like she's kidnapped by some internet guy

1060
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
you know?

1061
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That'll ease the transition.

1062
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's a good way to make them not

1063
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
afraid.

1064
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Okay okay okay cease fire

1065
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
give me like five minutes don't interrupt me

1066
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
because here's the main thing I want to

1067
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
get on.

1068
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I can talk all day about how

1069
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
we should

1070
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
sex is not like

1071
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
that pressure but it's like a minimal

1072
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
like fleeting high that you get

1073
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
whatever the fuck. Here's the main thing.

1074
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Here's number two

1075
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
time. Here's my main

1076
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
problem with sex.

1077
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Sex takes up so much fucking

1078
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
time.

1079
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's my biggest problem with sex too.

1080
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Did you just hear

1081
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
my words? Did you just hear

1082
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
me say that I wanted

1083
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you to be quiet for maybe just

1084
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
five minutes while you read

1085
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
my script that I've been writing

1086
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
all night that I could do for

1087
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
this worst podcast?

1088
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Do you not think you can be quiet for five

1089
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
minutes? Here we go.

1090
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Sex takes up it's not radical

1091
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
to say that takes like maybe

1092
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
like a fifth of your life.

1093
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's not hard to talk about the sheer

1094
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
genocidal amount of time

1095
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
you're wasting thinking about sex.

1096
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Can I ask a question?

1097
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Are you talking about sex or like

1098
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
pursuit of sex?

1099
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He'll explain.

1100
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You'll see.

1101
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Just wait.

1102
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I will understand.

1103
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
No! No!

1104
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This is not over!

1105
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
No!

1106
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I

1107
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I

1108
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
on average have masturbated

1109
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
two times a day for the past six months

1110
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
or around 30 minutes each.

1111
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That's an hour every day. Assuming there's

1112
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
three days in a month that is 30 hours

1113
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
each month. That's 120

1114
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
hours in six months. I have

1115
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
wasted a work week of

1116
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
my life in the past six months

1117
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
obtaining the basic uninspired

1118
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
bland boiler plate

1119
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
cheap flaccid unremarkable thrills

1120
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
that I've had a million times before.

1121
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That's not even talking about the real thing

1122
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
which is way longer than 30 minutes.

1123
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And that's not even talking about

1124
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the immeasurably holocaustic

1125
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
years we spend

1126
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
attracting people to have sex with.

1127
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The hours we spend playing on make-up

1128
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
by an uncomfortable clothes practicing our pickup skills.

1129
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Nate, Nate, how much time do you

1130
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
spend in Japan practicing your womancraft?

1131
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Confidence increasing our life skills and this is

1132
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
not true.

1133
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I call woman mancy.

1134
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woman mancy.

1135
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
This is not like the whole shit thing.

1136
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm just saying.

1137
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You have spent thousands of hours of your life

1138
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
dedicated to pursuing sex.

1139
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Is that inaccurate to say?

1140
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Well, that is

1141
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
fairly accurate and the only thing I would say

1142
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
is that I think that these skills are related

1143
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
to lots of other valuable things that I discovered

1144
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
in pursuit. But okay, but that is true.

1145
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah, I just said

1146
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't think I spent like any time in my life

1147
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
at all pursuing sex.

1148
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
What about

1149
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
masturbating? That counts, doesn't it?

1150
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, that counts.

1151
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You know what I spent thousands of hours

1152
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
doing? Playing team

1153
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Fortress 2. I play

1154
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that game and get the most powerful

1155
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
direct dopamine stimuli

1156
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
in the moment and I can constantly

1157
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
reflect fondly on this genius level design

1158
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and art style. Not only

1159
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
that, but the fondest memory I have

1160
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
are playing that game with my friends forging

1161
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
unbreakable alliances.

1162
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That's a problem of sex, is that you

1163
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
spend your time wasting away

1164
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
literally end metaphorically

1165
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
twiddling your clit, waiting to have

1166
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
sex, or hours you could be playing

1167
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
learning the skill doing your work. You are not trying to tell me that team Fortress 2

1168
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
is better than sex.

1169
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I literally am, I literally am.

1170
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I literally am saying that. There's no

1171
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
video game I enjoy as much as I like having sex.

1172
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I will put that down.

1173
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
There's no, I can't think of

1174
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
anything I'd rather be doing.

1175
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Believe me, I'm not saying this

1176
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
slightly. I have had the conversation

1177
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
in my head while having sex

1178
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
is this actually better than Dark Souls?

1179
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And the answer is yes.

1180
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And I've read three different

1181
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
tests. The skill

1182
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
lore is so low for sex. It's incredible.

1183
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The skill ceiling is incredibly high.

1184
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That is a real thing.

1185
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Okay, the problem

1186
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
with sex is the same problem with Mario Odyssey.

1187
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
All the rewards are the same

1188
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
level. You get a moon for everything.

1189
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You never get any higher rewards

1190
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
than just a moon. It gets boring

1191
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
after a while.

1192
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That's literally true.

1193
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Make it out like sex is just

1194
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
go until you come and then you're done.

1195
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You can do other things.

1196
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It doesn't have to be about achieving the same

1197
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
you don't have to just be trying to

1198
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
get that same reward.

1199
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
There's only so much you can get.

1200
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Keep trying, man. Keep finding new ways.

1201
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
What do you tell me there's some sort of secret

1202
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
alternate nuts?

1203
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
There's a secret alternative come.

1204
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I feel like it's knowing.

1205
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh my god.

1206
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I want the butt.

1207
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Where am I going to get my butt?

1208
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
How do I cheat that?

1209
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Tell me how.

1210
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm stimulating my butt a lot.

1211
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You just hold the podcast. I've been stimulating

1212
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
my butt and I've yet to butt come.

1213
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Please help me. Please teach me.

1214
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
There's a lot of ways that you can come

1215
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
emotionally.

1216
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
What about my butt?

1217
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
What are you talking about?

1218
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What are you talking about?

1219
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We're talking about ultimate nuts, Ben.

1220
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Keep the fuck up.

1221
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I don't even know what a nut is.

1222
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I feel like

1223
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
what Digi might be getting at

1224
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
is knowing that someone

1225
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
truly cares about you

1226
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
is good.

1227
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Let's not nut.

1228
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I assume.

1229
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The intimacy involved with sex

1230
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
can lead to

1231
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
emotions that rush through your brain

1232
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
other than just the one that you feel

1233
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
when you come.

1234
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
You can get these different reactions.

1235
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Your brain can spike with chemicals

1236
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
from the intimacy

1237
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
of it rather than actually

1238
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
from your dick coming out.

1239
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Digi.

1240
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I understand

1241
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
what you're saying.

1242
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I know that

1243
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
feeling.

1244
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The thing about that is that much like

1245
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
the physicality

1246
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
of sex and coming.

1247
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That is fleeting.

1248
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Have sex and then just pop out

1249
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
and wait a few moments.

1250
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Instantaneously, all the pleasure you have

1251
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
is gone.

1252
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It is only directly when you're doing the thing

1253
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and when you come for like 5 seconds

1254
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
afterward that there is anything to do with it.

1255
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
What I consider

1256
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
when I reflect

1257
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
on sex

1258
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I do not see

1259
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
a morass of the same sex being had all the time.

1260
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I think about different

1261
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
outfits that were being worn

1262
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
or what positions were used

1263
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
or what furniture was involved

1264
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
or

1265
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
what bodily fluids were spewed.

1266
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What threats were made

1267
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
to induce it.

1268
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Did you?

1269
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Whereas you see different positions

1270
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
and different outfits

1271
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I see different time stamp

1272
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
numbers.

1273
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I see different amount of

1274
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
numbers that have been consumed.

1275
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That is what I see.

1276
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I just look at that stuff as an aesthetic experience.

1277
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The same reason

1278
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
when I watch anime movies for instance

1279
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I don't watch anime movies

1280
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
because of the incredible

1281
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
richness of thematic depth

1282
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and narrative. I would read books for that

1283
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
if that was my main thing.

1284
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I like the aesthetics of anime and so

1285
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
there is always going to be the aesthetic

1286
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
experience of it is just enjoyable for me

1287
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
to see this thing.

1288
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's like a movie you really love

1289
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and it just looks great

1290
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and you're like fuck every image of this looks amazing

1291
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and I feel that way about sex.

1292
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I wanted to have all these different aesthetic experiences

1293
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and this time

1294
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
we're wearing fucking schoolgirl outfits

1295
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and pretending to be lesbians.

1296
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Oh god.

1297
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yeah exactly.

1298
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That's like an aesthetic experience though.

1299
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm actually

1300
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
sympathetic to what you're saying here.

1301
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That hasn't happened by the way yet.

1302
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I don't believe it.

1303
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I hadn't thought of it until this time

1304
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
but it was beautiful.

1305
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Again, I do not think that sex

1306
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
is all bad or all good.

1307
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I agree that

1308
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I am not above the biology

1309
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
of myself. I am not above

1310
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
wanting to have sex and then

1311
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
feeling good during

1312
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
when sex is presently currently

1313
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
happening right now.

1314
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I'm not above that. That feels good

1315
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and when you lift your loved one

1316
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
it feels even better.

1317
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm just saying that sex takes up

1318
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
way more time than I get out of it.

1319
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It does not even

1320
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
remotely as good

1321
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
for the amount of time

1322
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
investment I get from playing Team Fortress 2

1323
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
rather than having sex.

1324
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The amount of joy to hours I spend

1325
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
is holocaustic.

1326
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Here's one

1327
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
point I would make to the contrary of this

1328
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
and I normally wouldn't make an argument like this

1329
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
but I do think it applies in this case

1330
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
honestly the best thing about sex for me

1331
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
is making the other person

1332
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
feel good. That is what I get out of it.

1333
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I get to experience them

1334
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
enjoying it.

1335
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I completely agree.

1336
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I don't disagree with that.

1337
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
There's a lot of good that comes from

1338
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
that. The sex act

1339
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
is only one aspect.

1340
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Then there's the appreciation

1341
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
that you get from the person and the bond

1342
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
that you form doing this extremely

1343
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
intimate act that you can't share with anybody else

1344
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
like a little private joke between the two of you

1345
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
because sex is a joke. We all know this.

1346
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
On that level

1347
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
that's not really a tangible thing

1348
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
but it's kind of an indirect

1349
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
tangible benefit.

1350
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You're working on building your relationship

1351
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
to some degree.

1352
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Obviously all these points are kind of

1353
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
retreaded from famous

1354
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Listen Buddy Episode 1. Since Listen Buddy Episode 1

1355
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I have had sex

1356
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
and I have spent many more hours of my life

1357
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
ruminating thinking about since then

1358
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
and I've come up with way more

1359
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
nuanced approaches but because we're in this

1360
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
hellfire podcast

1361
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I have to condense all my real points

1362
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
and condense mimetic

1363
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
rage totem pole beliefs

1364
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
that I have to spread out before it interrupts me

1365
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
mid-sentence

1366
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
like every single thing I say.

1367
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm trying to help you

1368
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
because I agree with you

1369
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
that sex takes too much time.

1370
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I think that is the biggest problem

1371
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I have with it is simply that

1372
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I mean it's not to say that I'd rather

1373
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
be doing anything else. It's just that

1374
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
the amount of time makes it feel

1375
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
like I'm not spending enough time on other things.

1376
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I literally have cut out podcasts

1377
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
from my life entirely.

1378
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I just don't have time to fuck as much as I do

1379
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and also listen to podcasts.

1380
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You can just fuck while you're doing podcasts.

1381
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's not while you're listening

1382
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
while you're recording.

1383
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's like talking about

1384
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
some libertarian politics

1385
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
or something while you're trying to fuck.

1386
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I'd rather just put on some trap music, you know?

1387
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Because I'm fucking a trap.

1388
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Do you have sex

1389
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
with trap music in the background?

1390
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Dude, Denzel Curry is like

1391
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
my main fuck music.

1392
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm gonna

1393
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
come out. I'm gonna out myself.

1394
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's possibly a weirdo. I don't know how weird this is

1395
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
but I do not like music.

1396
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I do not put on music for sex.

1397
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I find it distracting.

1398
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I can't go my life without music

1399
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
so I have to have it.

1400
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
That's not true.

1401
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I feel like a lot of people do.

1402
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I've never really been into it.

1403
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Just not if I'm in the office.

1404
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Ben, I honestly

1405
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
haven't experimented with listening enough

1406
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
to music to know whether I find it weird or not

1407
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
but I generally just don't even think to bother doing it.

1408
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah, that's what it is.

1409
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
When I think about putting it on, I'm like,

1410
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
wouldn't that be distracting?

1411
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Well, here's the thing.

1412
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I was throwing up.

1413
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh, I put on Big Crit the other day.

1414
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I grew up

1415
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
always wanted.

1416
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I had so many songs that I had listed as

1417
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
these are my sex songs.

1418
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I have a playlist of sexy songs.

1419
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I had songs that I've had in mind

1420
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
since I first heard them when I was 14

1421
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
that I'm like, I want to fuck to this song.

1422
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
So immediately

1423
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
the first time that I had sex

1424
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
with May, I was like, put together this playlist

1425
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
before we even started.

1426
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I need to hear these songs.

1427
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
What's one song on there? I'm curious.

1428
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Come On Over Turned Me On by Mark Lannigan

1429
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and Isabelle Campbell was the first

1430
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
thing on my list.

1431
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Prom Night by Anna Monoguchi was on there.

1432
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

1433
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
That one's more of a make out song though

1434
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
than a fucking song, honestly.

1435
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
There are two things

1436
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
that I've wanted to do when I've gotten

1437
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
a girlfriend.

1438
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I feel it coming by

1439
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
that's a great one.

1440
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Fucking Christ, there have been

1441
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
two things I've wanted to do when I get a girlfriend.

1442
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
One of them did you that mean you have Bond Over.

1443
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Number one, play Kirby's Epic Yarn.

1444
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Co-op.

1445
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Because of Game Grumps.

1446
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Number two...

1447
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Is that when John and Aaron cemented their love?

1448
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Danny and Aaron?

1449
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Same, same.

1450
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And the second one

1451
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
was from Raising Gazorpazorp

1452
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
from Rick and Morty

1453
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
when Morty rushes down and drinks an entire

1454
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
carton of orange juice after coming.

1455
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I've always wanted to do those two things.

1456
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Doesn't he really? That's amazing.

1457
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

1458
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And I can see you doing that too.

1459
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And then you run right back up

1460
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and the noise begins again.

1461
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Exactly, exactly.

1462
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I've not achieved, but I'll keep you

1463
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
posted.

1464
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I feel bad, I feel bad.

1465
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
All those people in the comments.

1466
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Just please post a single tweet with a single orange

1467
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
in the body of the tweet.

1468
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
We'll know.

1469
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm sorry to all of those people

1470
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
who have broken the pack.

1471
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm still on your side.

1472
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
In fact, this just strengthens my case.

1473
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
This just makes me more a champion of the people.

1474
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You have to dab on the dark arts

1475
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
to know how to defeat them.

1476
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You have to understand your enemy before you can take them down.

1477
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Just think about it that way.

1478
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I haven't turned.

1479
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I haven't flipped my heel upside down

1480
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and slipped my banana heel.

1481
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
No, it's true.

1482
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
When I think about this argument

1483
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
the way you're presenting it,

1484
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
if there was a magical switch before me

1485
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
that would just turn off my need

1486
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
for sex.

1487
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
At this point in my life, I would absolutely do it.

1488
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And I would just be like, now I can just be productive

1489
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
all the time, nothing to worry about.

1490
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Can you turn it on again?

1491
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Well, I don't know.

1492
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
If I could turn it off and on, I would keep it off

1493
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
most of the time.

1494
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
This is a need for sex, not the capacity for sex.

1495
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
This is a need for sex, not the capacity.

1496
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Okay, then yeah.

1497
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Honestly, it would have implications for my life.

1498
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I don't think it would change.

1499
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
If I only turned off the need and not the capacity

1500
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I don't know if it would change enough.

1501
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Well, see, that's interesting.

1502
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Because most of the sex I have is because

1503
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I don't want to do anything else.

1504
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
We live in a fucking frozen

1505
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
nightmare world where there's nowhere to go.

1506
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So most of what we do is stay inside.

1507
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
My life is like this.

1508
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I want every fucking second

1509
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I can have to work on my

1510
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
extremely backed up catalog of

1511
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
projects that I have in the pipe.

1512
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So for me, a single second

1513
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I can spend more on that.

1514
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's how I feel.

1515
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I feel as though I wish I didn't have

1516
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
to spend as much time on that as I do.

1517
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I already am spending so much time

1518
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
working and trying to get through all these projects

1519
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
and I wish that my projects were like

1520
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
one of them had enough impact

1521
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
that I didn't have to do them

1522
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
all the fucking time.

1523
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But that's the world we're in.

1524
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Digi, do you think your life's going to

1525
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
change at all when you're in a not

1526
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
nightmare snow hellscape?

1527
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Do you think that's going to change anything?

1528
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Or do you think you're cemented in this?

1529
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
We were going out a lot more

1530
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
before winter started.

1531
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's just a matter of

1532
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
our house is a little out of the way

1533
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
and

1534
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
it snows almost constantly throughout the winter

1535
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
so we have to dig out the car

1536
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
out from under the snow every time you want to

1537
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
so it's like

1538
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
even taking a five minute drive to

1539
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
McDonald's is a chilling effect.

1540
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Exactly.

1541
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I got the emotional nut

1542
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
when I made the joke.

1543
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It only just like three days ago

1544
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
finally stopped being snow every day

1545
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and now it's kind of getting normal

1546
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and we've gone out more

1547
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
but it's just like

1548
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
there's lots of things I like doing

1549
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
but there's only so many that you can do

1550
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
in the same day.

1551
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Gone out to eat, gone shopping

1552
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
or something, like done something outside

1553
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
that's fun, maybe gone for a walk

1554
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
or something, you know

1555
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
and then you get online, you do all your social media

1556
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
shit, you checked Twitter, you checked your comments

1557
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
you've caught up on whatever YouTube videos

1558
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
are out, alright now it's time to work

1559
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
alright I've worked to the exhaustion capacity

1560
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
of my brain

1561
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
so where do I fill in the other like

1562
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
four hours that are there in the day

1563
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
that normally I would just sit there

1564
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and listen to podcasts.

1565
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I don't want to fill that time with more work

1566
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
because I don't think I work well

1567
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
when I'm like forcing myself

1568
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I tend to

1569
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
follow the flow of whatever I'm inspired

1570
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
to work on at the moment

1571
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and if I'm not inspired to work on anything at the moment

1572
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I can't work

1573
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't get writer's block

1574
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I just do

1575
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
go between

1576
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
if I don't feel like

1577
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
writing any anime videos

1578
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'll make a song

1579
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
or vice versa

1580
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Hey, I think Gib was going to say something

1581
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Yeah, okay, yeah

1582
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Here's my

1583
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
sex music

1584
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I got to try that

1585
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
actually

1586
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Do it immediately

1587
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Will you think of Sansa? Will you think of

1588
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Riska?

1589
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I'm disappointed

1590
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,860
Disappointing in what's happened here today. I was bragging my stuff. I was smirking. I was smiling ear to shining ear

1591
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,480
I was thinking about how I was going. This was gonna be my magnum opus

1592
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,300
Everyone's gonna remember my performance here on this procrastinator's podcast episode, but but I floundered

1593
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:12,760
I've just repeat what I've said in an attempt to to spit out my ideals in a completely un-nuanced

1594
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:19,320
Unpragmatic fucking retarded way and now people will just remember me as the guy who just is repeating listen buddy topics

1595
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,920
Even though and though I have thousands of words here

1596
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,440
They they they were completely squandered and wasted and to go back and read them again would just be trained old

1597
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,760
Again in this topic. So I'm disappointed and I'm upset. I think your main point. I I

1598
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:39,440
Completely agree with I wish sex took up less time and I think that really is the ultimate point

1599
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,980
You're trying to make here. That's that's a utilitarian point and I completely agree with it. I also have that exact same desire. I

1600
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,800
Don't know

1601
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,440
I

1602
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,680
Turns out that when you're not when you're like arguing like and the people have like an actual defense lined up that they've been

1603
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,680
Considering ever since here

1604
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,280
You are you would be fucking banned from ever serving in a town council or any degree of

1605
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:15,260
Citizenship you would be fucking exiled for your display here on this podcast for ruining my stone cold

1606
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,260
defense

1607
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,460
Do we want to bring up migtails at all

1608
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,840
I kind of do what is it what is a migtail?

1609
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,660
Dictionary can help a modern-day hero, but let's find out

1610
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:55,240
Let's find out do you remember when me you and they got mad each other or me you and being a match other rad con too

1611
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,060
But migtails, absolutely. We had a big argument. What video was that and that was in the

1612
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,880
It was in a blue glow. Yeah, it's on it's on a blue glow some way

1613
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:12,220
Here's the okay. Here's the definition of migtail top definition on her dictionary men going their own way

1614
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:19,260
Migtail is a statement of self ownership where the modern man preserves and protects his own sovereignty. Okay, this guy's obviously a migtail

1615
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:26,700
It is the manifestation of one word. No. Oh my god. I'm getting inspired now eject

1616
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:34,820
Preconceptions and cultural definitions of what a man in quotations is looking to no one else for social cues

1617
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,580
Refusing to bow serve and kneel for the opportunity to be the dream is like

1618
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:48,140
According to his own best interest in a world, which would rather he didn't guys parents

1619
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,740
Are you gonna get married and buy a house and start a family guy answers? No?

1620
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,340
This is me I am the proudest migtail who's ever lived

1621
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:05,980
Guy guy writing this nobody said you have to have a girlfriend. Okay, this guy

1622
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:09,420
You know, he's drunk the Kool-Aid in a big way. That's fine

1623
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:17,540
Okay, here. I'll break this down super easy migtails see the very real challenge that is presented in society

1624
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:23,660
That is like a pressure to get a girlfriend and like judges you if you don't get one and they're just like this system is unfair

1625
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:28,180
I like don't like it. I think it's not helpful. I choose to not engage in it

1626
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:33,940
And then they just like sidestep it which which honestly morally there is no problem with that morally that that's completely

1627
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:39,180
Unobjectionable people are allowed to do whatever they want. Yeah, but practically. I don't get why it's yeah

1628
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:45,040
It's it's a weird label because it just gives people something to laugh at when they look at you

1629
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:51,940
Now they're not laughing at the fact that you don't have sex. It's now that they're laughing at the fact that you're a crazy man

1630
01:02:54,940 --> 01:03:00,420
I don't think someone's deciding not to have sex is completely crazy to be militant about it

1631
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:06,020
Like a lot of actually do a lot of migtails are into kind of like the pump and dump mentality

1632
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:08,740
We're the like they'll fuck women like they there's still many want to have sex

1633
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:13,500
But like they don't want to shackle themselves with like a wife or you know a girlfriend or whatever get out of town

1634
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,780
I mean I again, I don't think being identitarian about it makes is like a healthy thing to do

1635
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:36,020
But like there is definitely a real like a migtail is kind of like a feminist like they recognize

1636
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:41,420
Some injustices in the world or what they perceive to be injustices and they choose to like specifically

1637
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,640
Oppose those and like reject these certain things and this is just the label to indicate that in this case

1638
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:51,460
These people are rejecting like society's pressure to like get a girlfriend and possibly have sex

1639
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,580
just like you know, maybe they'll just want to be you know jack off all the time or whatever some some certainly do that and

1640
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,660
It makes sense, but I just don't think it's productive

1641
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,840
This is a very much a mentality of you know the opposite of what I say, you know

1642
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:10,060
These person want lighter burdens as opposed to broader shoulders without a doubt. That's definitely what this means

1643
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:16,700
They're like we were we reject this challenge of society and think it is unfair, which it is which it is not like a morally

1644
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:23,140
Justifiable position for people to put on you because you have no obligation to marry or reproduce morally speaking

1645
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,980
There is absolutely none, but in a practical sense there is an impetus to do so

1646
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:32,540
Which is why I certainly can't agree with this well because if you don't reproduce

1647
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,640
Yeah, because we want more humans. We want more people to do stuff and like

1648
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,340
What if you're retarded?

1649
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:45,580
Well, but I mean just a perfect utilitarian position to say ah my genes are bad

1650
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:49,500
I'm not gonna reproduce that but if your genes are fine, then you should and

1651
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:56,220
Definitely retarded so no okay reproducing is about more than just genes if you

1652
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:01,900
Like even if you have fucking leukemia if you reproduce and you have a kid who also has leukemia

1653
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,900
But you are just a badass like

1654
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:10,460
Entrepreneurial motherfucker who like achieve so much you will instill those values in your kid to some degree and like that will be a

1655
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:17,060
Better person than some like welfare, baby, you know like I don't know piece of shit asshole who just was like my life's somebody help me

1656
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:21,340
You know so like there there's values outside of just genetics well that you can improve

1657
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:26,900
I feel like like if if say if you want from a practical

1658
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,900
practical

1659
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:34,420
Perspective you want the people who are good at adding to society to reproduce

1660
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:38,140
So that they will instill values in the children

1661
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:43,980
Surely the people who are too weak to step up to the challenge don't we don't need them anyway? I

1662
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:50,740
Hear what you're saying on that print the only way I even sort of disagree is just like I just don't think that like the

1663
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:57,300
Getting the mig town message is actually a helpful thing because there's gonna be some people on the fence probably who could have gone

1664
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,060
One way or another and then like maybe if this wasn't a movement

1665
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:03,820
They would have gone the other way and then like yeah at themselves and risen to the challenge, you know

1666
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:09,380
But I would also say that the opposite is like some people who don't who have like terrible

1667
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,940
They they reproduced

1668
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:17,720
Despite their flaws as character as like members of society that add to it

1669
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:23,080
Like yeah, they just happen to be in a place where sex is easy to get because everyone's easy or whatever

1670
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:30,520
Like like white trash play. Well, I just don't think that the MGTOW like identity or movement is actually the best for the people in it

1671
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:35,080
I think what is best for them is to adopt an attitude where like self-improvement

1672
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,920
They accept that that's their responsibility to obtain

1673
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:44,240
Happiness and what they want in their life and then to work towards it as opposed to just like you know saying like oh society's fucked

1674
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,600
I choose not to engage in it because like they're the ones who are gonna suffer ultimately for doing that. So

1675
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah, I think it is

1676
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:57,960
Irresponsible to just simply want more babies. I think we want more babies who have good parents

1677
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,440
If we had the same amount of humans, but just all of them were smart

1678
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:08,400
That would be that would be way better than just having like like, you know, 25% more population

1679
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,580
But we can't actually control that though. I mean, I'd certainly like to

1680
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:22,760
If we're yeah, there's definitely ways to improve that if we focus more of our efforts on making people better instead of just having

1681
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:28,000
There be more people but you know like like like you know again not promoting just having babies

1682
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,840
Okay, but you don't have to only do one of those things

1683
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,440
It's not like one comes to the exclusion of the other and and on another level like practically speaking

1684
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,560
Economies need growth in the population to grow

1685
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,080
So like there is just an intrinsic good for an economy when there is population growth

1686
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,600
You know, obviously to a saturation point, but that varies from place to place

1687
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:53,360
You know America is nowhere near as crowded as India Japan like in the cities etc. Etc. There's plenty of room to grow

1688
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,880
Population like economies need this sort of stuff, but God, I don't fucking care about this. Let's talk about something else

1689
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
This is this is

1690
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,960
I was interested in just talking about migtails in the context of like people who

1691
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:13,440
Like there's the sexual it's the same stuff. We were talking about before like there is a sexual impetus on men like to go out and conquer and

1692
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,360
You know like get sex because then they'll be thought of as cool guys and migtails like reject that and I

1693
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,640
Morally speaking make sense what they say. I cannot refuse house. We're about having sex

1694
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:31,080
But not all of them. There's there's there's subdivisions within the Migtail move. It's a fractured a fractured

1695
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,080
Sad

1696
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,080
divided

1697
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,480
Why would you call yourself a migtail if you're not the one of the crazy ones?

1698
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,920
Like it's like calling yourself a brony if you just watch the show people are going to assume you're a pedophile as well

1699
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,400
Because it's fun to label. I mean, that's my argument about literally all labels like

1700
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,440
Like why would like that's right? Like there's a lot of people who want to try to like reclaim labels

1701
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,480
I think that's the problem is like the reclamation like people who

1702
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,840
You know insist on calling themselves like like oh

1703
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,560
I am a feminist because I'm I'm in favor of like, you know women having equal rights

1704
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,880
And it's like well most people when they hear that word don't think that's what you're about

1705
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,800
You know so like you might as well like move on to a new term, you know

1706
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,120
Like that's how I feel about like pretty much any label is eventually it's gonna get diluted

1707
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:22,400
And it's gonna seem like the the most extreme part of it is like what people associate with it, you know

1708
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,840
Yeah, I think

1709
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:29,920
Identitarianism of any type is the largest problem in humanity. I think it is the root cause of so many issues

1710
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,280
I'm a big

1711
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,360
By the way, well just well

1712
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,820
Shout out. Yes. Here's a song that my girlfriend likes to sing

1713
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,720
Welcome to my life as a female make towel. Welcome to my life. Yeah, thank you. I was laughing about it

1714
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:55,160
But it was really funny. I like it. It's good though my female make towel life

1715
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,720
Okay

1716
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,920
And so I had

1717
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,440
Inseminate it into that's right. I had to impregnate this podcast

1718
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:16,040
The core make towel belief again is something that like like I I I do believe that it is not I again as I've been saying

1719
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:23,080
I don't think I don't think society should pressure people into thinking that sex is just inherently like like as as you know

1720
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:29,600
Important as we now think of it, you know, I think it's perfectly fine to not want to participate in it

1721
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,400
But you know, I'll be like like obviously, you know

1722
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,800
They have like a somewhat reasonable idea if you take the most mundane aspects of it

1723
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,340
But you know, they're they're militant. They're warriors. They're SJW is in their own, right? And that is

1724
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,160
You know in a sense in a sense

1725
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,960
Yeah, I sense in a sex. I have zoned out. I

1726
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,480
Think we're pretty much at the tail end here. Are there any final points to make? Yeah

1727
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,760
Here are my testimonials for what I've said earlier today. Here's testimonials for what I've said

1728
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,400
I'm on team munchie Ben St

1729
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:08,960
I got to say munchies argument were a lot more convincing even though I've previously enjoyed sex in the past

1730
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,560
I'm starting to reconsider its merits. Wait, wait, who's saying this?

1731
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:17,600
Whose words are these high sex campaign? Did you Ben St said this? Wait, I did not say it's you

1732
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
To me again

1733
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,520
My name is about me then Ben you said I'm on this is on the the the

1734
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:33,560
Collins I'm listening play episode one. I'm on team. Oh, then Digi bro says I gotta say munchies arguments were a lot more convincing

1735
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,880
Even though I've previously enjoyed sex in the past. I'm starting to reconsider its merits

1736
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,560
They consider joining munchies anti-sex campaign. Okay for what it's as you can see in that video

1737
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,960
I'm tainted by recent insatiable lust for them dawn

1738
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,960
Fibrom high heel penis

1739
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:53,120
Drubbings your opinions have been laid bare if you were to go back on them now

1740
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,920
You will be changing your mind and your credibility would be shot down instantaneously

1741
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,120
Oh

1742
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,120
Damn

1743
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,680
Bro is so known for having consistent

1744
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,600
Because he's totally not known for being a flip flopper on literally everything

1745
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,720
Yeah, but the problem is that he talks with so much authority and that's a big problem

1746
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,720
I

1747
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:24,120
Will delete yourself from real life so so so you so you heard it from Digi bro sex is all bad you heard you heard it here

1748
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,760
Yeah, there it is. We've settled the question all bad

1749
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,880
You got my vote have a stronger argument in that podcast

1750
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:36,680
Which is why why I said about a hashtag assassinate President Trump so that his son munchie J

1751
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,040
Trump can rise to the throne and

1752
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,160
And hence outlaw

1753
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:48,160
Sex that's what I want. It's the only way we can make this happen. That's the only avenue available to us at this moment

1754
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,480
That was a problem for me

1755
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,240
Yeah, we need to upturn that apple cart and really go back to basics of you know

1756
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,040
enslaving you know

1757
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,080
Everyone that's what I want

1758
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,240
I

1759
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,960
Hope you still like us everyone. I hope you still enjoy us. I hope you still enjoy our company

1760
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,920
I hope you haven't left. I hope you haven't thought that we've gone downhill and they've been jacking their little baby dicks this whole fucking time

1761
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,960
This has been a dream come true for that. Yeah, this podcast has been great

1762
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:26,760
Well, there you go. Are we are we reading comments? It's time for comments. It's time

1763
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,320
The the moment has come

1764
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:33,000
Okay, here we go at Lobotnist. Oh, wait, you know, this is a great question

1765
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,160
Is there a death? Oh, right at Lobotnist

1766
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:42,120
Is there a death pool for the IRL Radcon 3 arena and how did you bet explain that pool?

1767
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:50,000
What is this man's talking about a dead death pool is when so so at fucking Radcon 3 funded happening

1768
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,160
There will be the the fucking Radcon 3 arena IRL where we shoot each other with real

1769
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,680
real

1770
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:04,720
Deadly nerf bullets do we fire arms and and there has been no betting pool, but there should be stakes

1771
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,040
He's right. There should be stakes to this event. Yeah, absolutely add some sort of you know

1772
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,200
Loser doesn't get to eat the steak dinner

1773
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,240
Stakes

1774
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
The dinner has to make dinner

1775
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:23,280
The losers to make dinner for the rest of the people but there's but everyone's a loser

1776
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,120
All the losers have to make the most decadent dinner for the one winner

1777
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,480
How about like at the dinner like like like how about everyone eats?

1778
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:38,040
But like the winner like it arranged in order of like winner like the winner gets the most sumptuous banquet and the loser

1779
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,360
Yeah, and we're like arranged at the table from like winner to loser. Yeah, I don't know

1780
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,760
I think there should be some kind of hierarchy based on

1781
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:51,520
On how to perform all just instantly like conclusion. Yes, they like the reward will be dinner related

1782
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,920
Instantly I like it. I think it's a good

1783
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,800
Like how about like um, I don't know maybe like they're become like for one day

1784
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,720
There's like a chain of command or something and like like everyone has to like

1785
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:13,520
Let's get let's get real sexy with it and be like the losers. The losers have to do whatever the winner

1786
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,320
Emotional

1787
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,480
Oh

1788
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,320
Yeah, you just have to just shower me with compliments. You just have to shower me everyone gathers in the circle

1789
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:30,720
It just jacks off their emotions onto my face. I want that. That's when I win. That's what I'm going to ask

1790
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:36,560
Or maybe I don't know we could we could bet something like we could bet something not money

1791
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,560
I want the loser to suffer and die

1792
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,360
What about betting our

1793
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,960
Subscriber

1794
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,240
Everyone puts up everyone bets subscribers

1795
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:58,600
Yeah, we've all got 10k I think or like around there and then we trans like we transfer them to the winner like based on some mysterious

1796
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,040
Process we have yet to

1797
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,480
That'd be great by the way, everybody just in case you hadn't noticed

1798
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:13,360
I don't know if I said this before did we talk before about how fucking the we are max reviving t-bap

1799
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,160
It fucking happened did that that get brought up last episode? No, because we didn't know no

1800
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:24,720
But I got some related questions I can ask such as thalamus dred from our patreon

1801
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:31,320
Exclusive discord group asking how do you feel about the Kickstarter doing as incredibly as it did even reaching there you go

1802
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,320
You never thought I would make

1803
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:38,120
It's unbelievable. That was literally a joke. It was literally a joke

1804
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,880
$9,001 to max revive t-bap, but we thanks for the money guys

1805
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:49,960
And we will use it how to make rad con as dope as fucking possible how I feel about it doing as incredibly as it did is that I

1806
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:56,520
Probably fucked up really bad by not reading any of the discussion that happened around rad con 3 at all

1807
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,920
Or what any of the stretch goals were and so therefore I did not at any point raise my voice and say hey

1808
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,560
Let's make a stretch goal so that we just get paid

1809
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,040
To do this like I'm like a stretch goal of like

1810
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:15,000
$5,000 higher than what we need to make it possible and then that's the money that just goes to us

1811
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,640
As a matter of fact that already is kind of in the thing like it's in the thing that yeah

1812
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,360
Whatever money is just left over after the thing. It just gets given to us

1813
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,080
I am gonna spend it on rad con as much as possible

1814
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:35,640
Because yeah, yeah, I made the mistake of only saying and it would cost me a hundred dollars because I was travel cost

1815
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,480
But because I decided I want to stay in a hotel instead

1816
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,720
I will definitely be operating at a gigantic loss for rad con 3 if I had known that it was gonna make so much money

1817
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,720
I would have just asked for more money to go

1818
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:50,320
I would have been like oh I cost three hundred dollars down here or however

1819
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,840
No, we have actually given you money for a hotel outside of rad con

1820
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:59,040
I would have just told you that my travel cost was three hundred dollars and line and okay

1821
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:04,480
Or like three hundred dollars for it to be worth it for me to come like well there you go

1822
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,960
You know there you go, but I'm glad we can have you on board. I'm glad

1823
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,440
You're a credit to the force

1824
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,040
Okay, what else is going on?

1825
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:21,000
No, that's bad what at Doombox 2 asks. What's the most underrated thing?

1826
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,120
What's the most underrated thing?

1827
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:30,360
Sex the the core of the earth under

1828
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,360
Homestuck

1829
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Homestuck, yeah

1830
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:41,160
I mean it's highly rated, but not nearly enough. It's definitely underrated compared to the cultural like force that it is

1831
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,920
Like I think that's true. It should be recognized as being one of the greats

1832
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,080
You know like the fans the fans love it, but nobody else. Yeah

1833
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:56,920
Nobody who has like anybody who hasn't read Homestuck and is not a big fan thinks it is like literally they just be on their

1834
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:02,720
Comprehension like that's really gonna watch our machine will we use right into it fucking check out arm retrieval

1835
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,080
I'm retrieval con 3 was funded by the way guys. I'm sure the con 3 is definitely gonna happen

1836
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:12,360
That's right, and Steve are gonna be there fucking dope as hell check out our retrieval

1837
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,600
Incredible, okay. I got another question for y'all. This is from a horse power

1838
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:23,080
He asks what's the biggest project you ever wanted to make but don't have the know-how yet or time?

1839
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,200
Mmm the know-how or time and not the money or resources

1840
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,240
Yeah, like you literally you don't know how to make this thing and that's why you haven't made it a

1841
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,080
Musical I would like to make a musical that is what I know on the stage on the stage. Yep

1842
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,220
That's it for me. It's an ARG. I

1843
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,520
Is that gonna be the revival of Tbap? That's what yeah Tbap IRL is gonna be. I

1844
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,640
I

1845
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:56,840
Want to keep doing small Japanese Juggalo ARG so I can grind my skills to make an actually good real

1846
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,760
That's a good idea. I want to make an actual real marble hornets

1847
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,880
The only problem is like the one problem that I have with trying to do a marble hornet

1848
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,480
Is that eventually like you know one day I will have the patreon and okay?

1849
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,760
Here's my problem with marble hornets. I can't fucking wait hold on

1850
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,560
Okay, but I can't like just be like here's my new series guys. It's my horror ARG

1851
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,920
I can't get an ounce that it is an ARG. Yeah, that doesn't work

1852
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,080
So it's you know

1853
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:28,680
How am I going to let people know that I'm not doing nothing and let them know of my new content?

1854
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:33,120
You gotta wait for that like you need that frog fractions word-of-mouth. It's the only way

1855
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:39,200
It's the only way dude. What if what if this was like a like a secret hint and it's already out. Oh

1856
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,600
Oh

1857
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Yeah, by the way my

1858
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:48,720
No, I was gonna say I've also tried to launch ARGs a bunch of times or like tried to work on them

1859
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:54,280
But it is like daunting to make it like big enough to be like noteworthy, you know

1860
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:59,440
Yeah, especially because you're risking nobody giving a shit, right exactly like when I was working on one

1861
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,360
Like what was it two years ago when I was trying like really trying to launch this ARG

1862
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,000
And I made a whole ton of footage for it for all these different videos and stuff

1863
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,240
And then I was just like the amount of time it will take to complete this like for a chance that no one

1864
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:18,680
Finishes this like no one sees all this footage. It's just like I can't take that risk, you know

1865
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,920
Did you you you helped create the Japanese juggle ARG the most successful ARG of all time?

1866
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,920
Something to be celebrated for it there. I

1867
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,720
I want to learn like you need to know how in the time to actually produce a good rock album

1868
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:42,280
That isn't just a bunch of me fucking around with guitars and not knowing and or caring how to record properly

1869
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:46,360
Mm-hmm, like I want to do it right. I want to actually have like songs

1870
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,480
That's what I want hippo think about it

1871
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:55,480
You have two unique skills and no other PCP PCP people do you have 2d?

1872
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:01,520
Animation skills and you have music skills that those are two unique. Oh, I guess did you actually never mind never mind

1873
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:07,080
I mean, he is a reviewer. He's not an animator. Yeah, okay, that's true

1874
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:16,400
For Ben what about you? I think maybe like the ultimate magnum opus and I have no plans for this at the point

1875
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,560
This is just off the top of my head

1876
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,560
but some kind of like some kind of like big like

1877
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,200
comprehensive like

1878
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:29,640
Volume or tome kind of like like House of Leaves or something but like, you know, obviously there'd be illustrations

1879
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:36,020
So I'm thinking something like Jimmy Corrigan the smartest kid on earth that has like, you know, a big like a big like

1880
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:42,440
Dance like, you know world and characters and history. That's all kind of like, you know, just all all in one big

1881
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,140
Volume that might be something

1882
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:52,200
Someday thinking about my answer to this the problem is that like it's the biggest problem you've ever wanted to make

1883
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,840
So that would just be some video game

1884
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,480
I wanted to make as a kid because obviously that's like I think video games like the biggest

1885
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:05,040
projects that are like in modern media probably yeah, but like as for

1886
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:13,000
Currently like biggest project I want to make but don't have to know how yet would just be any masterpiece

1887
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:18,040
Like I just want to know that I've made a masterpiece that people recognize as a masterpiece

1888
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,960
And I just don't think I am good enough to do that yet, you know

1889
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:27,680
But what would that masterpiece look like? I don't know like it could be a YouTube video

1890
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:34,600
Yeah, it could be I don't know like what by what means I have it in me to create something that would be like recognized

1891
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,560
The way like infinite jest is recognized, you know, like well

1892
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:44,760
What what well digi your dream is a farce piece you already made a masterpiece measurement man on modal

1893
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,040
On a tangent about infinite jest for a second, okay

1894
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,040
Something okay, this is not like a new observation, but it's something that I've like come to terms with okay

1895
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:59,200
Well, like when I first was introduced to infinite jest it was like oh

1896
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:05,880
It's this big complicated work and everyone's like in awe of its like sheer size and scope and I was like whoa neat and

1897
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,480
I mean the more I've thought about it

1898
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,480
It took me like two years to read and I was like, okay, that was pretty neat

1899
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,560
I get it but the more I've thought about it the more I think that really the reason it's famous is not

1900
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,840
Because of what it is. I mean what it is is noteworthy and people probably would have taken note

1901
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:26,000
But I really think that it's just because of the reputation the DFW had and like I think the fact

1902
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:32,720
That he made it and the people knew him and that this was coming from him was probably was like a really big part of

1903
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:39,160
Where it's like the recognition for it came from it's hard to I mean anything that fucking out there like you have to be known

1904
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:44,040
You know like James Joyce's Ulysses would not be famous if James Joyce hadn't already been famous, you know

1905
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:51,400
Yeah, which is it that's like it's it that's like I guess that's true of everything that like things get notorious like based on like

1906
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:59,240
You know like the notoriety of their creator and that's just like an inherent thing like people are attached to be the names and identities and stuff, but

1907
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,840
Is your is your point kind of that the book is a little bit less deserving of all the discussion in praise

1908
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,000
I think there's a lot of legitimate

1909
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:14,440
Criticism you could have with a book like the book is really like sure like it's known for its size and scope and those are undeniable

1910
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:20,800
But like it's pretty fucking meandering a lot of the time and like messy and sloppy and paced really weird

1911
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,480
Which is I guess is kind of inevitable with something that size

1912
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,280
But like you know those are real problems

1913
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:31,120
I think you could I think you could reasonably argue that it isn't the masterpiece that everyone says I don't know if I

1914
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,200
Necessarily don't think that it is but I think there's an argument against it

1915
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,560
To go on a tangent from your tangent the only thing that's made me want to read

1916
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:45,920
Infant jest is is knowing that the author killed himself

1917
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:51,200
It made me think like wow, he's not like a pussy like he's actually killed

1918
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:01,200
He's like he like says he's like much or something and I didn't like whatever like author is say like oh

1919
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,440
I'm depressed and they're believing but like he actually killed himself. He was actually depressed like wow

1920
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,040
You gotta look into the Japanese author Mishima

1921
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,760
I don't remember his first name

1922
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:17,880
But he was a guy who like wrote about like the aesthetic beauty of like the human body and everything

1923
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,080
He was like a big workout dude big like body improvement guy

1924
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:26,000
But he was also radically anti-government and like he literally this is just an author

1925
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,400
But he like like led an attack on like a military base

1926
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:36,120
Like killed a bunch of people and like made demands that like they like shut down the government

1927
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,600
And of course they didn't so he committed seppuku and

1928
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,820
Chop his head off. This isn't like the 60s. Holy shit. Yeah

1929
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:49,220
It's it's crazy when like people like people like go on to do real things

1930
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,840
Yeah

1931
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,480
Doing like they're these are just people that write stuff they write fiction like there was um

1932
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:05,680
There's a one-hit wonderland about a beds are burning by some Australian band and like it turns out that it's like a political

1933
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:11,880
It was like a very politically motivated band and like now that guy is like part of the Australian like parliament or some shit

1934
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:17,800
And he's like people underestimate like how much like I think there is a lot of people who do music and stuff like that

1935
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,640
Who might actually have more insight into what's going on?

1936
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:25,760
And that's why they're doing art is that they're trying to let people in on like they're trying to fucking woke you

1937
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,880
You know with you know what this is actually great. I'm glad we get on to this cuz like okay

1938
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,720
Here's a problem. I have with guys like like fucking a nerd writer

1939
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,800
Nerd writer will spend his whole life writing about how much you should feel like oh this thing is so special

1940
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:40,440
It's so important

1941
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:45,360
But like what the fuck is he gonna actually do to like achieve any of this shit?

1942
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:51,160
He's talking about like I feel a pain every day that I am not a scientist or an engineer

1943
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:55,840
Currently working to like make better rockets to get human beings into space it

1944
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:02,840
It consumes me that I am like just a guy talking about anime and like I talk about the themes that like so I'm no better

1945
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,760
I'm no better than this guy, but like with him because he's so popular

1946
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,200
It's just he's just like giving people these emotions to like feel a certain way and to me

1947
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:15,200
It's really cheap and but my core message behind everything I do is improve yourself

1948
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,440
Fucking lift weights eat healthy be a better man

1949
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:24,840
You know or women whatever and achieve something with your life and all I think about is is what I'm doing right now

1950
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,120
Actually making the world a better place

1951
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:33,720
Probably not and that really fucks me up and then you know, so like I'm thinking about like am I really?

1952
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:41,600
Passing along the message. I actually really sincerely care about passing on to people about self-improvement and you know

1953
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,520
whatever like I get out of stories like ghosts in the shell and

1954
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:51,880
A gurren login like important themes. I think I want people to really hear I want them to actually think about what the fuck

1955
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,400
I'm talking about

1956
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:58,120
You know, I mean I mean I care I care that I'm not doing that pisses me off

1957
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,800
I feel similarly, but I I look at my um

1958
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,000
Cuz I constantly get messages from people that are like, you know

1959
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,520
Oh, you were an inspiration for me to do whatever and like sometimes it's something. I'm like cool

1960
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,440
I'm glad you were inspired to do that sometimes

1961
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:18,040
I'm like maybe you shouldn't be inspired to make a YouTube channel if you're you know not gonna be dedicated to it and do a good job

1962
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,880
He's probably my mortgage my house to be just like you exactly

1963
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,680
If you do if you something like that, I'm like no be careful, you know

1964
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:33,320
But like because I do inspire people and a lot of people have just told me things like you know

1965
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:38,880
Your videos help me get through the day or like I don't want to kill myself anymore because your podcast came out

1966
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,320
I'm like sick so to me. I'm like, okay

1967
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,560
I'm clearly doing a service for humanity in that sense

1968
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:48,480
But then I can also go into my watch time like my total watch time and it's like

1969
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,600
100 years of human life or exactly

1970
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,560
Exactly, and I'm just like, okay

1971
01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:00,480
Well, have I have I inspired enough people to like make up for how many have died just watching

1972
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,760
Claimed an entire human life in a half. I've claimed like six. Hold on. I gotta go look at the actual number

1973
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,800
It was something like please pull that number up

1974
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,640
It was several human lives with the best comments

1975
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:17,640
I get occasionally I'll get like tweets or whatever about people saying like dude you videos inspired me

1976
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:22,880
I have lost like a hundred pounds because I took responsibility for my life. I have where I just got a message like that the other day

1977
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:29,400
That like what a fucking hero that guy is and I am so happy that I actually made a fucking difference in the world

1978
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:33,680
It actually meant something the shit that I say that is what actually matters

1979
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,680
The people about making people feel good a little bit. That's fine. All I care about is actual results

1980
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,240
Okay, they're being achieved by the shit. Yeah, what do you got? What's your number?

1981
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:45,080
My total watch time for the Digi bro channel is 618 years

1982
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:52,820
There you go. That's like six or seven lives. Maybe more depend. Yeah, I mean if we're the 75

1983
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,880
What what's the current fucking like life? I don't know

1984
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:02,020
That's like eight to nine ten lives. Whatever's ten lives. I think it's like high 70s seventy

1985
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,840
74 are we doing another question?

1986
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:10,360
Well, wait what I want to say was like the most important thing is it gives sometimes says this give has made videos about this very point

1987
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,040
And I think it is so true

1988
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,460
It's that like inspiration is fleeting

1989
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:21,240
Inspiration is fleeting all that matters to me is that the people act on inspiration and actually start to make changes in their life

1990
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:25,520
And do something if people watch my fucking galco video and like you're like a hot slut

1991
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,800
Who's like, why is everyone so mean to me? Why is everyone, you know, like why can't people just appreciate that?

1992
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:35,240
I'm a nice girl and then they watch my video and they're like yay someone like the hot girls can be nice like okay

1993
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,880
Great, but how are you gonna change your life?

1994
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,600
How are you gonna be a better person as a result of this?

1995
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:44,320
That's what matters, but Gib here is completely right in his videos where he says like this is such a fleeting thing

1996
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:48,960
You'll watch this video you'll forget about it like 99% of people it won't make any fucking difference in the world

1997
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,120
And I feel like nerd writer shit captain Christian shit and and me and me

1998
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:58,080
Well, that's that's like most of what it is disposable like positive feelings

1999
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,240
But like guys like Elon Musk like Elon Musk founds SpaceX is like, okay, let's make rockets

2000
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,240
I want to hire people to make rockets. Oh

2001
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:11,360
No one exists in the world qualified to make the rockets. I want to like advance the human race

2002
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,120
Okay, luckily I personally am willing to work to understand this

2003
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:20,960
So he becomes the own lead engineer for SpaceX because no one in the world was good enough

2004
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:25,760
So he did it and now we just had the Falcon Heavy launch that executed

2005
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:32,320
fucking like land like upright landings of rockets that will allow the cost of like

2006
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:37,160
Flight of space travel to go down by like 50% which means 50% more launches

2007
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:43,240
Which means we're that much closer to colonizing like the moon actually having civilizations on Mars like actual real

2008
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:50,480
Tangible benefits. That's what fucking matters in this world not this bullshit emotional shitty stuff that I do on YouTube

2009
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,600
But how did the dark night rises make you feel?

2010
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,600
Shit composition

2011
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,800
All that stuff all that stuff is Huey's law

2012
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,520
Which is good because it baits people in to actually like listen to your message

2013
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,320
But if that message isn't good or isn't there then you've wasted everyone's time I could not shit

2014
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,120
I don't think it's true at all. I think a lot. I know we disagree here

2015
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:20,120
I think a lot of the point of aesthetics and of art in general is not just about like inspiring you to do better

2016
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,120
But helping you to understand yourself

2017
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:27,280
I think there's a lot of people because of the fact that no one educates us that well on like

2018
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,360
Psychology or understanding our place in the world or like what the hell's going on because both our teachers and parents don't really understand that shit

2019
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,840
Like we need art in order to show us like what the hell's going on in my mind

2020
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,080
Like why do I feel this way? Are there other people who feel this way?

2021
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:47,640
Do other people obviously like Gern Lagan was like a clarifying vision of like something important to me

2022
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:52,040
So okay, and I think when you can package that in this in an aesthetic that like okay

2023
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:55,680
Gern Lagan is the same story that's been told a thousand fucking times. It's a hero's

2024
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,680
Narrative but like it's in an aesthetic that resonates with the specific type of person that is the two of us

2025
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:05,040
You know like yeah guys who currently are in like their late 20s

2026
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:12,020
Who were probably in their late teens when the show came out and it had like a massive impact because it's like this is the

2027
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:19,660
Bombastic over-the-top epic thing like style and hyper masculine style that was big in the late 2000s fucking it came out like a year after

2028
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:23,980
300 you know like this is what we wanted was like sloganeering

2029
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:28,660
bare-chested like dudes fucking punching each other and

2030
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:34,200
Yeah, so it was like the perfect fucking snacks what we want. Yeah, yeah

2031
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,260
Exactly, so that was okay

2032
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:41,620
Like the perfect delivery of this timeless message that everyone needs to hear in order to grow up

2033
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:47,740
But like for us, this is the aesthetic that mattered the one that resonated with us because we're from that generation, you know

2034
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:51,540
Yeah, okay, okay. I'm totally happy to like

2035
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:57,220
Let's give everyone whatever aesthetic they personally need to become a better person

2036
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:02,540
Whatever the delivery package needs to be for people to understand the message. I am all for

2037
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:06,340
Figuring out what it is and exploring it and I think to your point

2038
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:09,740
You're saying that like I mean we don't exactly we can't like identify this shit

2039
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:14,020
Which is why we need people to go out there and make art so that people will feel that there's lots of stuff

2040
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:18,700
They can resonate with and they can seek it out and enjoy it. Um, yeah, okay. That's a pretty reasonable point

2041
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:22,040
I don't know. Sometimes I feel like art is just a big fucking scam

2042
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:27,220
Sometimes I feel like I actually do anything and it's all just uh, you know

2043
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:32,060
It's all just crap that makes you feel good in the moment and people are just being tricked into thinking it's important

2044
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,860
What do you guys think about that? I see a break with you

2045
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:41,100
But like it's it's all a matter of like how do we quantify it like how I can't fucking there's no stat sheet

2046
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:46,540
That tells me like how many people I've inspired like, you know, I don't have the analytics for that, you know

2047
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:51,340
I don't have the net good on the world analytics. It's in some way

2048
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:58,540
Somebody making a living off of art. Mm-hmm is worth it for at least the people who know the artists and our friends with them

2049
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:02,100
Yeah, and then that improves the making of art

2050
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:06,380
I think it's like I mean at the very least I'm stimulating the economy in a way

2051
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:11,380
I wouldn't be if I wasn't doing anything, you know, yeah, that's true only if only if you're putting it back

2052
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,220
I

2053
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,940
Agree with you so much in the fact that it is just appeal

2054
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:22,940
It is just that you are appealing to people and they like what you have made. There's no inherent

2055
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:28,940
You know responsibility for art to inspire to do any real work real world things

2056
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:32,140
That is not intrinsic to art is that that is well

2057
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:35,340
I would I would never say that artists have to do that

2058
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:41,340
I would never say that but I would think like the most valuable art or perhaps even the only art that is actually valuable

2059
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,340
Does do that. I guess would be my point

2060
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:50,020
Well sure, I would you I would just say the where I where I disagree with you Ben is that I don't think it's just in the moment

2061
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:55,700
I think if you make good art people will remember for a long time and as I've said before in the sex part of this

2062
01:36:56,100 --> 01:37:02,900
I think uh fleeting highs are the most despicable highs and if it can just last a long time then I think that's more valuable

2063
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:08,180
Here's here's my problem. I think that generally okay art can inspire people

2064
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:13,780
But I feel like in general what it mainly inspires people to do is to make more art

2065
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:18,260
Which if if it's just like a big self self inflicting loop a big like

2066
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:24,500
You know a self perpetuating cycle of art inspiring more art, but the art itself is not really getting us anywhere

2067
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:30,340
I mean you can say that but like literally every scientist talks about how they were inspired by star trek

2068
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:36,900
That's a reasonable point everybody. That's a reasonable point. I think there are some all the art that's out there is inspiring people to become

2069
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:41,860
That's true, but like we gotta throw enough darts at the wall until somebody's thing sticks like that

2070
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:47,460
How many sci-fi franchises existed before star trek like was the one that made everybody fucking want to do that?

2071
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:54,820
Unpopular opinion when I hear like someone like I don't know fucking Neil deGrasse Tyson be like

2072
01:37:54,900 --> 01:38:00,020
Yeah, I was I love flash gordon so much as a kid that I went into physics and space and astronomy

2073
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:07,780
I roll my eyes so fucking hard. What why because it's fake shit because that's like fake fictional shit and like

2074
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:10,420
Real science is boring

2075
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:16,100
I don't know. I just I don't quite get the like how can like how like like okay like flash gordon

2076
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:22,100
Maybe make space look really cool, but then you grow up and you'll be just studying real space and it's not like flash gordon

2077
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:28,260
I don't know how that I don't know how that could possibly inspire like a real lifelong interest and fascination enough to sustain like

2078
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:33,620
A real career. I feel like you don't have to maintain the problem. We had the interest in it already

2079
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:36,100
Like maybe they probably would have been inclined to do that

2080
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:41,540
Anyway, and flash gordon just happened to be the thing I like at that moment got them to take notice of it

2081
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,820
I don't know if I agree with that. Hold on. I gotta

2082
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:46,180
Okay, sure

2083
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:51,700
Just like I'm thinking about because um my friend ghost lightning got into tennis because he watched prince of tennis

2084
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:56,420
Like that show like watching it marathoning it with his wife made them want to get into tennis

2085
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:59,940
The thing is that once they got into tennis and they started watching real tennis

2086
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,100
They quickly realized that that show is like utterly nonsense. Like it's ridiculous

2087
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:08,180
But they ended up loving real tennis and it

2088
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:13,060
What actually happened is they just thought that prince of tennis was dog shit, but they love the sport

2089
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:19,460
Like now they just watch fucking baby steps and like and real actual tennis matches and like have fun with it

2090
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:22,820
So like it's not that flash gordon was a good representation of science

2091
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,660
It's that once they started doing science

2092
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:27,780
They realized it was great and there's so many people who have the opposite

2093
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:33,780
Like there's so many people who try to get into something because they liked this show and then they realize it's not like that

2094
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:38,660
Like there was a huge boom and people trying to get into crime scene investigations after csi got popular

2095
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:42,020
But like once you actually start up that course load it is not easy

2096
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:47,620
Dude, did you hear did you see there's like a uh, there's a fucking uh, I think was the canadian government

2097
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:54,260
Like posted a notice saying please stop applying for uh, like uh crime scene investigation degrees

2098
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:59,460
We have too many people like you can't get a job. Please stop like the shows are just too popular

2099
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,700
How okay, okay, let's let's take it fucking for granted that like

2100
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:06,580
A show or something can inspire

2101
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:12,260
By the way hippo really has to be given like can be credited as like the reason why someone gets into some

2102
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:16,020
Important practical field like science or engineering. Let's just accept that as true

2103
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,620
um

2104
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:19,460
How okay, even if that's happening

2105
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:26,580
How do we know that the number of those cases aren't far outnumbered by people who like maybe would have gone into a real field

2106
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:33,540
But instead spent their life just fucking around on the internet just spent spent their life drawing some art and maybe entertaining some people

2107
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:41,860
That's what I worry about thing. I I think we're being really fucking narrow-minded and what we view as I don't know the word just positive

2108
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:48,740
Be okay. I'm somewhat being a devil's advocate right now by the way being alive is good and enjoying

2109
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,220
Breathing and being good. Yeah

2110
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:53,620
No, no incorrect

2111
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,300
I

2112
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:00,260
Of culture and

2113
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:04,420
Having a heart and a soul and a dick and a brain

2114
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,060
Okay, and enjoying

2115
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:16,660
Living and talking to your fellow humans and feeling emotion and conversing muchy. This is all bullshit. I don't care about at all

2116
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:24,500
No, no, I totally agree like I do think that just like enjoyment itself is like sufficient end in and of itself or a thing to be important

2117
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,700
I agree

2118
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:33,700
What literally what is the point of advancing human civilization if human civilization is just boring and nothing

2119
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:37,460
Okay, I'm exaggerating a little bit. There's there's a distinction here

2120
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:42,500
I do actually think there was an inherent good in human life and human like happiness and pleasure

2121
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:47,860
I I I do believe that um, but I would say that there is I here's where I would

2122
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:51,220
When rarely one of the rare times I would use the word objective

2123
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:58,820
I would think it is objectively better if there is more happy like more people and more enjoyment and more happiness

2124
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:06,100
And I like I think the way to get there is to constantly be progressing from lifetime to lifetime, you know generation to generation

2125
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:11,860
To be working towards expanding the circle of how much happiness, you know, uh knowledge and pleasure

2126
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:14,980
There is the world, you know, obviously every life should have not too much pleasure

2127
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:18,740
I I don't understand how you think that that like like the like

2128
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:24,020
Well, here much it's real simple here. Okay. Okay. Go. Okay. It's very simple

2129
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:26,420
If you have one person just living a life

2130
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,620
You know, normal level of happiness normal level of sadness

2131
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:33,460
They live their life and they die as opposed to two people

2132
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:38,180
Both have a normal level of happiness generally pretty happy lives. They both live and they both die

2133
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:43,220
Which of those is objectively a better universe like where has more good happened? I have a

2134
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:50,500
I don't agree with more people being happy is better. I'm saying, where do you think the happiness comes from?

2135
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,820
Where do you think this happiness is?

2136
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:57,060
It does it does come from the subjective experience of being alive. That is true. That is true

2137
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:02,340
It comes from culture. It comes from being in a society and being in a civilization

2138
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:09,780
Like like the point of progressing civilization is that there is more civilization and culture and humans

2139
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,140
But here's what I don't like

2140
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:16,420
I I would not be satisfied with the idea of like we keep the exact same number of human beings that are alive

2141
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,100
Right now on the planet earth and we just like stay right here and everyone's like happy

2142
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:24,740
I don't know where this idea. I don't know who you're responding to with this. I don't know

2143
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:30,420
I think what Nate is trying to say is that if all we do is worry about art

2144
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:36,660
Then everyone just becomes an artist. We're not worried about expanding the civilization going out to space and all that

2145
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:41,220
This is not this is not is is sex all good or is sex all bad?

2146
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:46,900
This is not do we only focus on culture or do we only focus on I just don't think there's any disagreement here

2147
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:51,700
And I don't know why you're taking the attitude like we do disagree like what is your issue with what I have said

2148
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:58,180
Not not with what you have said. I I I just thought that we were being like like Ben was talking about how like, you know

2149
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:03,140
Oh, that's all fucking scam like like sure like I don't think we need to be discussing

2150
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:09,460
Whether whether art has any like intrinsic like objective value here. Is that not a fair discussion to have?

2151
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:14,420
But I just think it's it's it's it's narrow-minded. It's it's not

2152
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,900
There's no sounds like it sounds like you're just taking a position in that discussion

2153
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:27,540
Which is fine, which is having the discussion. Well, okay. I'm I'm okay sure that this is my opinion then in this discussion

2154
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:33,140
This is what I'm presenting. Okay. Is that I think is I think that art is important and I think that it doesn't have

2155
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:35,780
objective

2156
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:39,300
Value do we want to answer another question? Yeah, let's go to another one

2157
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,860
All right, let's do it. Um

2158
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:45,940
Much has been disproved. He has been proved incorrect. So let's move on. I'm ready to move on

2159
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:49,220
This is a question. I I'm gonna choose to interpret a certain way

2160
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:54,660
The guy said the guy's name is lord legend of the galactic heroes sucks space dandy wins

2161
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,900
That's okay

2162
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:03,460
His question is what would your real life theme be and I've chosen to interpret this as in your theme like

2163
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:08,340
As if you were a work of art. What is your theme? I think he means musical theme, but okay

2164
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:16,500
Like the motif of your life. Yeah, yeah, what is what is your theme?

2165
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:20,180
How much I can fuck how many sluts I can fuck

2166
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,540
Uh, that is a that's a great question

2167
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:29,140
The theme uh, the theme of my life would definitely be utilitarian progress. I know it's boring

2168
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,700
I know it's obvious, but that's like what it is. So, you know, fuck you

2169
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:37,940
Mine is some masculinity. I don't know whatever. Did you say did you say toxic masculinity? No, I said some themes

2170
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:46,900
Oh, that's what it is. That's what it is. All right. All right. Hey. Hey is talk is toxic masculinity real

2171
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:52,900
Let's talk. Okay. Toxic masculinity is just the idea that masculinity is inherently like bad. It is inherently

2172
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:55,460
No, no, I don't think that that's not

2173
01:45:55,460 --> 01:46:00,740
masculinity is when someone is being toxic in a way that is related to their masculinity. I think

2174
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:06,420
Yeah, uh, uh, I don't know. Well, okay. Let's see what urban dictionary. Let me just read the urban dictionary real quick

2175
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:08,980
Why did we why are we talking about this?

2176
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:18,020
Toxic masculinity a social term that describes narrow rep repressive type of ideas about the male gender role that defines

2177
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:24,500
Masculinity as exaggerated masculine traits like being violent unemotional sexually aggressive and so forth

2178
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:30,740
Also suggests that men who act too emotional maybe aren't violent enough or don't do all these what the fuck is this?

2179
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:33,700
I don't understand this definition. This is terrible. Yeah, this is not helping me

2180
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:35,540
um

2181
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:39,940
Well, the theme of my life would probably be like, um, yeah trying to be understood

2182
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:45,940
Like a desperation for like like a mutual understanding or something like that

2183
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:52,100
Okay, the theme of my life would probably be like, I don't know, um

2184
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,260
Freedom independence, I guess, you know living

2185
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:01,060
Just living on my own terms. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds about right

2186
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:04,260
Which is great by the way

2187
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:06,100
I would say

2188
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:07,700
irony

2189
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,700
Retrospection

2190
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:11,700
Fun

2191
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:18,340
I feel like you're I mean, you're like the most sincere person I know so how is irony a theme of your life

2192
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:23,380
He's pretty ironic too though. He's like post ironic though. Yeah, that's kind of true

2193
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:30,980
Because the way that I express my my inner emotions is presenting them not as

2194
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,620
You know the nuanced or or the most, you know

2195
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:40,740
Gently put things in the world. I progress them to to an insane degree and make them appear foolish

2196
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:42,820
Even though they they are how I feel

2197
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:45,460
I don't know if I call it

2198
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,180
I do want to express my sincere thoughts sincerely

2199
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:53,460
By the way, I thought your theme was performance

2200
01:47:54,580 --> 01:48:02,180
Performance works too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's also good. I would probably I would probably say irony performance fun

2201
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:05,060
I just want to

2202
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:08,020
Do everything that I do I feel like I left that thread hanging

2203
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:11,940
I just looked up the definition of toxic masculinity on wikipedia, which which is much clear

2204
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:12,900
It's much clear

2205
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:19,540
It's just the concept of toxic toxic masculinity used in psychology to describe a certain traditional male norms of behavior

2206
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:24,420
In the united states and europe that are associated with harm to society and men themselves. So okay much clear

2207
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,500
It's just saying some aspects of

2208
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:30,100
Socially conceived masculinity masculinity is just the bad kinds

2209
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:35,780
Yeah, but like who defines bad and good. Well, I mean, yeah, that's the kicker like you like I guess it would be up to the

2210
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:37,780
Individuals like what is and is not toxic

2211
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:41,540
And I I guess I'd say there's a problem in here

2212
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:44,100
I don't know like masculinity is another form of

2213
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:48,820
Identitarianism to like define yourself as like masculine. So I guess that's kind of I don't know

2214
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:52,900
I don't really see a lot of value in doing that either, but whatever. It's just good to run your shit

2215
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:56,100
We only got one more good question left. Okay. I found

2216
01:48:56,660 --> 01:48:58,660
Your boy Liam asks

2217
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,380
Good remedies for the worst days

2218
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:05,140
With a good question mark at the end. Good pussy, my dude

2219
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,900
I like to draw

2220
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:11,540
Drawing is good. Oh, I would literally say exercise

2221
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:16,500
I would literally say exercise and here's why first of all exercise has a actual physiological

2222
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,740
Positive stimulus once you're done with it

2223
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:22,980
You just feel good and then also if your day is shit you probably feel like oh no

2224
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:27,940
I fucked up everything everything's going bad to to obtain mastery over something in your life

2225
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:32,260
Like to exercise and feel like I did it like I have control over this. I am good

2226
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:37,700
It just makes you feel like better about your life. I was gonna say I was like for kind of the same reasons

2227
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:40,260
I was gonna say just accomplishing something like yeah

2228
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,420
For one you have to have a goal like you have to have something you're working towards

2229
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:49,300
Like making making some progress even a little bit of progress on it like before better something

2230
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:53,620
Will make you feel like your day wasn't completely wasted. That's so true. That is so true

2231
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:58,500
Nate on exercise and in one specific thing that I don't do a lot

2232
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:05,060
But I should do because every time I do it. I absolutely love it. I love jelking. You talk about jelking my dude. Oh, yeah

2233
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:17,140
Okay, oh my god. Oh my god the secret we have we have to do the jelk cast next week, but I'll just

2234
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:19,860
It's just

2235
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:24,180
Dwarf as hard as you can grasp your order of as hard as you can

2236
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,380
Yes, and pull pull for the fucking life of your stuff

2237
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:33,300
Okay, it is literally where you you do like little pulls on your dick as an as an exercise to like tear it a little bit

2238
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,620
So that it gets bigger. It doesn't actually to make your dick

2239
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,820
That's what it is. It's what it is

2240
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:45,140
I gotta say, I mean no it gets results

2241
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:51,140
Oh boy, what was I saying? I'm saying

2242
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,100
A good jelk my dude

2243
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:59,060
That I fucking that that happened to me earlier today that has changed my life

2244
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:04,100
I'm just gonna do this every day now. Okay, there's an app like you can get on your phone called brain.fm

2245
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:07,460
And it's some like like weird. I think real science, but it might be pseudoscience

2246
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:14,340
They have tracks of music that that they claim like changes, you know, they put your brain in a mood

2247
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:17,940
So you can have your brain focused you can have your brain go to sleep you can have your brain relax

2248
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,420
So put your brain in different moods

2249
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:25,060
So I put on the focus track on brain.fm and I went for a walk

2250
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:29,780
I swear to god, this has enhanced my by perception 10 fold

2251
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:36,100
I was aware of everything that fucking moved. I was inside of the fucking earth and I was feeling every single

2252
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:40,820
Vibration and nuance on the fucking earth's field. I was one with all of god's children

2253
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:44,980
I was walking from just from like my house to my local 7-Eleven

2254
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:51,220
And I had this fucking music on and I was aware of every like change of the light or any like homeless person out of the corner

2255
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:51,940
Of my eye

2256
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:58,020
I I was more alert than I ever been in my entire fucking life. It fucked me up and it was insane

2257
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:01,460
I highly recommend everyone. I also got this awesome energy

2258
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:08,020
And it was the best fucking drink I've ever had in my life pipeline punches. Good. I definitely would like to try doing that

2259
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,740
Yeah, dude, we can do it together at rag-con

2260
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:16,580
All of you have great. Those are all great remedies. Mine is simply a change up game

2261
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:19,860
Like just change things change something about what you're doing

2262
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,780
It could be any of the things that you guys just said

2263
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:27,700
But like generally if I find myself like going down a dark path in my mind

2264
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:34,020
The best way out is to just do something totally different from what I'm doing like listen to for me

2265
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,900
If I don't have access to good pussy like Nate said

2266
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:38,020
Um

2267
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:44,340
Podcasts are like a great out. I would just like if I felt funky or like I was just pissed off at the internet

2268
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:49,060
I would just listen to the dick show and play a video game and it's like I don't have to think

2269
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,580
I don't have to be myself

2270
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,540
I could just listen to the dick show and just listen to him talking

2271
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:58,020
I don't have to think about my problems and I can just play a video game and be somebody else for a little while

2272
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:03,700
You know and like forget about whatever was going on with me, you know, or I guess put on some better music

2273
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:05,060
That's like more

2274
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:08,180
You know like like much he said with that I don't have that program

2275
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:14,740
But like when I feel bad sometimes I'll just like throw on onamonaguchi and try to get something done because like it'll just give you energy

2276
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:18,820
Accomplishing something is definitely I think the the best like long-term solution

2277
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:21,460
Like that's a that's a good feeling that you'll feel like into the future

2278
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:25,540
But if I just want to know that you're having the worst days that you can't accomplish anything

2279
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:31,700
That's probably probably true. I but the best like just my most pleasurable thing I do in my life

2280
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:33,940
Is to sit back put on a movie I love

2281
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:37,860
I I usually the godfather movies are like my go-to ones for this and I'm playing

2282
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:42,020
Then I'm also playing a video game while I'm like watching slash listening to a movie

2283
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:48,100
I love that I've seen a thousand times. Nate. Are you there to say you just want to play video games every night every day

2284
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:50,100
I just want to play video games

2285
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:54,420
Are you aware of the uh, kasey nice that godfather screen saver thing that he's got?

2286
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:58,260
I am and I love it and I love it. I think it's super cool for the audience who doesn't know

2287
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:03,860
Kasey nice that it's a monitor that just at all times is playing a constant loop of godfather 1 and 2

2288
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:07,380
I've said it before. Oh, not godfather 3. I was actually gonna ask about that

2289
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:13,460
If you felt the same about I actually love godfather 3 almost as much as the other ones and people who share godfather 3 are fucking idiots

2290
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:15,860
um, but uh

2291
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:19,300
Uh, whatever. I don't fuck what I was gonna say, but gibbs back gibb

2292
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:24,980
What do you do when your day ain't going right and you want it to feel good if you want to fix a shitty day

2293
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,940
Uh a shitty day

2294
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:31,620
um, I usually just try to

2295
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:35,620
Create something and distract myself with work

2296
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:40,740
But if if work and what I've been trying to make is the the problem

2297
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:45,060
Then I usually curl up into a ball and cry

2298
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:47,940
Does that help?

2299
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:49,940
No, it doesn't

2300
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:54,580
I go through I go through yeah, I go through many crises

2301
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:01,700
I like to rapidly cycle through mental crises. It really helps me, you know work out the case

2302
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:06,180
I I always end up at the point where I was like wait nobody cares about my problems

2303
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:11,140
Maybe I should shut up and then I do and then it's great. If you get bored of one crisis. You can just switch to another

2304
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:15,620
Yeah, that's true when you're feeling down like this. Why don't you talk to your friends?

2305
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:18,580
Why don't you talk to your friends about that? Why don't you just come on?

2306
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:20,580
What is going on over?

2307
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,220
Gay

2308
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:27,860
I really want a procrastinator animated of like of when ben said you just switch from one crisis to another of someone like

2309
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:31,380
In an arcade switching between two different time crisis machines because it's all

2310
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:36,340
You know, uh, oh that'd be good when I'm feeling down

2311
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:41,380
It it just feels like I don't like to bother friends with that

2312
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:46,180
Especially since I have done it multiple times before and I will probably do it multiple times in the future

2313
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:50,820
It is it's an important and it always ends in in in the same way that I realized that

2314
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,940
Nobody needs to hear this. I just need to move on

2315
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:59,300
It's a real thing that we got to recognize about like the people around us like we our friends will tell us

2316
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:03,540
Oh, you can come to me with anything you can tell me blah blah blah like I'm always here for you

2317
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:09,220
But nobody actually wants to hear about how sad you are over and over again. Nobody wants that

2318
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:15,780
I recognize that and you know if someone comes to me and just is complaining and like if most of my experience of

2319
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:20,660
A certain person is that they're just sad and complaining like I will not enjoy hanging out with them

2320
01:56:20,740 --> 01:56:25,060
It'll just be like well, it's like I mean if they're your friend if they're if they're your friend

2321
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:27,940
They'll do it for you. They'll listen to you if you need an ear

2322
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:32,340
But if like but if you're like doing it all the time and you're like really

2323
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:37,620
You know taking up a lot of their time with like some sad shit. Yeah, like why would they continue?

2324
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,140
What do they get out of it?

2325
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:44,820
I think well here's the thing with it is like if you're a good friend you'll listen to your friend

2326
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,540
And and help them through whatever they're going through

2327
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:51,300
But if that friend the person who is going through things is a good friend

2328
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:54,100
They will realize that they don't they shouldn't

2329
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:59,700
They they need to fix themselves before they just lay it on someone. I mean, it's ultimately. Yes

2330
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:02,020
Ultimately, it is your responsibility to fix your own shit

2331
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:06,580
But like of course like I would if any of you guys came to me like as a one-time thing

2332
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:10,500
Just just as an example and just said like dude. I'm just really sad about this. Of course. I'd be happy to listen

2333
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:13,620
Everybody needs a sympathetic ear from time to time

2334
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:19,460
I got a story to ask because like one of my old friends like he was that guy who would like come and you know

2335
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:21,620
and cry about his life all the time and

2336
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:26,420
Like everybody in my group of friends is like smart and good at giving advice

2337
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:30,580
And this guy's probably the dumbest guy I know out of out of the people who hang out their friends

2338
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:34,020
So like he's constantly whining and people are constantly trying to give him advice

2339
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:38,740
And he just wouldn't fucking follow anybody's advice and he'd come to you crying the next day and you're like, dude

2340
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:42,100
I already told you what to do. That's the thing. Like if you're not gonna do it. Fuck you

2341
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:47,860
I will also say though

2342
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:51,460
I will say that usually

2343
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:55,700
It when it comes to advice like I get advice and it's usually advice that I agree with

2344
01:57:56,020 --> 01:58:01,860
Yes, it's not knowing what to do. That's the problem. It's never knowing what to do. It's just doing it

2345
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:06,900
Also on the perspective of advice is kind of masturbatory or like a waste of time

2346
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:10,660
That's definitely give or ask for advice and plus like at least if you know what you're doing

2347
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:15,060
If you if you like I mean anyone who comes to me and like asks for my help about anything

2348
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:20,500
I will like immediately pull out the fucking spreadsheet and attempt to immediately solve the issue

2349
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:24,100
And I don't give a fuck what your excuses are. I will identify the blockages

2350
01:58:24,340 --> 01:58:27,940
I will figure out ways to circumvent them like anyone who comes to me with a problem

2351
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:30,500
And I care enough about you. We will solve it then and there

2352
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,260
We will identify the ways to do it

2353
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:36,500
But a lot of people don't actually want that a lot of people just want a sympathetic ear

2354
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:41,860
And I am the wrong guy for that. So that's what you're looking for. That's not me. That is not me. So

2355
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,740
Yeah, you know just that

2356
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:47,300
You should go to who you want like if you just want somebody

2357
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:51,220
Honestly, like like like women do this more like my girlfriend is definitely like this

2358
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:55,220
She just wants me to like listen to her sad day whenever she tells me about like problems

2359
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:58,420
I'm just like a break it out the spreadsheet. Let's fix it right now identify the problems

2360
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:03,140
It's been identified the solutions, but like sheet. What are you using a spreadsheet to help with in this scenario?

2361
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:09,700
Well, uh spreadsheets are okay making lists is essentially laying out the facts. Okay. Yeah, that's what I mean, but I literally use spreadsheets

2362
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:15,620
Okay, I didn't yeah, I'm literally talking about spreadsheets like spreadsheet guys

2363
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:20,660
My job has awakened me to how spreadsheets are the only thing that matter in this world

2364
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:28,580
They are the only thing that matters at all a human experience is subjective fucking excel spreadsheets are are absolute

2365
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:33,300
Exactly what you're talking about because when I when I'm trying to give advice

2366
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:37,940
There's usually either a list or like a graph of some kind involved. Like yeah

2367
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:42,420
There's a lot of me making graphs with my hands when I'm trying to explain what somebody should do

2368
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:48,500
There's there's not a single gray or rush of doping that that rushes for through my loins

2369
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:51,860
Rather than when I open up a new google doc

2370
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,180
That is the height of my fucking day

2371
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,620
Also, just just to close this off. I I don't

2372
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:00,580
Disagree with any of what she said I

2373
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:07,060
I feel like like I I I'm down to you know talk whenever I I will just say I

2374
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:12,180
Try and make it a real point to not make it I want to hear about everyone's you know

2375
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:17,940
Sad days, but I want to make it known that I'm not letting them become complacent or just like I don't know

2376
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:21,540
I don't know how to say this correctly, but I don't want to know that like it's a

2377
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:29,140
I'm just kind of like you will listen to them all day, but you would rather they not think that you're not trying to help them

2378
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,860
like you know

2379
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:33,860
I just mean that I don't want them to be

2380
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:39,380
Two's I want them to I want them to have a fire into their ass to fix their problem

2381
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:44,180
I don't want them to just think that I like it's not that I you don't want to placate them. You don't want to placate them

2382
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:49,060
It just left the language. Yeah, exactly perfect. It's like I'll listen to you at all times

2383
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:51,620
But you're not allowed to know that like you know

2384
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:57,780
It's I'll listen to everyone all the time, but I want to help them first and foremost

2385
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:01,940
And I don't want to always just be like, oh, I'm sorry pat pat there there

2386
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:05,300
I want to give them advice and I want them to fix what is happening

2387
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:08,180
I don't want to just I don't want to just be the guy you know

2388
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:13,060
I I am my life has come to a certain point where I've only got so much time

2389
02:01:13,460 --> 02:01:17,940
And like people who want to come to me with their problems like if I care about you I'll listen but listen buddy

2390
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:23,700
I'm budgeting you 20 minutes of my time to fix your fucking problem or to like listen to you complain about it

2391
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:25,940
That's what you got use it how you want

2392
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:30,180
But then I'm out of here because I got shit to do and I'm not gonna just sit here all day and you know

2393
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:32,580
Listen to your complaints and maybe that makes me a bad person

2394
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:38,660
I call it like being a productive person who who optimizes his usage of his time because I have so little to spare

2395
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:42,420
Uh, it's just you know, that's how my life is now and that's how I'm gonna be

2396
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,700
I think I'm the same as you need. I'm just more lenient with the times

2397
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:49,300
I think I think I mean we want we want to get it to be done

2398
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:50,900
Not not to like shit on you or anything

2399
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:55,380
It's just like I probably have like just less time to spare because I've got a full-time job and youtube stuff

2400
02:01:55,460 --> 02:02:01,540
So like that's forced me to be very stringent with how I use my time. So, you know, just saying just saying

2401
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:06,900
I think we're over the two-hour mark here. That was good though. Man. I really enjoyed that. Oh, you know what?

2402
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,020
Questions

2403
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:10,020
Yeah

2404
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:12,020
I don't want to give the questioners too much credit

2405
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:19,540
Can I close this out everybody with an important message on on sex and relationships and everything from my hero matpat

2406
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:23,700
All right, matpat's got the words of wisdoms. We need to go by so just forget everything

2407
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:27,540
We just said only listen to these words. Okay, here we go real quote

2409
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:36,100
Whenever I see people lined up outside a club on friday night

2410
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:41,060
I just think look at these poor people who don't know video games exist

2411
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:44,900
That really just that's how I feel about sex. That is how I that's some that's the

2412
02:02:57,380 --> 02:03:01,140
All right, thank you matpat that was our special guest for the day matpat

2422
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:50,900
I think we might just be able to bring it back. I think I might just be able to suck my own cock
