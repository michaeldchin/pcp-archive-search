00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,500
I'd like to direct this question to Messrs. Lennon and McCartney in a recent article, Time Magazine put down pop music, and they referred to Day Tripper as being about a prostitute, and Norwegian Wood about as being about a lesbian.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:26,500
No, I just wanted to know what your intent was when you wrote it, and what your feeling is about the Time Magazine criticism of the music that is being written today.

3
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
We were just trying to write songs about prostitutes and lesbians, that's it.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I want you, my friend listening to this podcast, to go to stcomics.com and read my stupid new chapter.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's out now.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh is it up already? You put it there?

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It is there right now.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Awesome.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,500
Stcomics.com, it'll bring you right to the beginning of chapter two.

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Read it, read it, read it, read it, read it, give me money on Patreon.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Did you put a chapter select?

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Did you put a chapter select?

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Patreon, Patreon.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright, enough me memes.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, I put a chapter select.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Cool.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We also have with us the best guy ever, Nate Bestman.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Hello, I'm the best guy ever, go to YouTube, watch best guy ever.

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I've got a new video, it's finally almost done.

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
It'll be here before you know it.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Okay, let's move on.

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
No it won't.

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Next up we have the DeVoo.

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Hi, I have produced the visuals for the Astroscore Sucks series.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
That is completely random.

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
I have no idea what context you have, listener.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
You can give them context.

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Go watch the DeVoo's channel, he makes good videos.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,000
And he's making a new video soon.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Right now, yeah.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Probably by the time this podcast comes out.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And last but not least, we have the Hippocrite.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The Hippopotamus, the Crippolophonophagus, the Subrubium.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There we go, I did it.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I did it again, but it was worse.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Fuck you, Ben.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, that one was great.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Alright, today we only lost six minutes of recording.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We didn't even get a point yet.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's just get to it.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,500
We are here today to talk about a topic I came up with and nobody else understands.

42
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
So I have to explain it.

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
It's authorial intent.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,500
And basically, what it means, what it does, how we should interpret it.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Now to explain it, authorial intent is...

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Arthorial intent?

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
What's that mean, Digi?

48
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Authorial intent.

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Basically means artist intent.

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,500
And it's sort of like how I would explain it is, if I was writing a book and I thought

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,000
that I was writing it to have a very specific meaning, then that meaning is my authorial intent.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know, whatever I intended for you to get out of the book, that's authorial intent.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, if you read it and you get something else out of it, then that is, you know, the not-authorial intent.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now in recent years, well not in recent years, this is a very old idea, probably 60, 70 years old.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,500
But recently in the internet, in internet criticism and, you know, I guess I'd say not unprofessional,

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,500
but like, you know, normal people writing reviews and shit.

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Amateurs.

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Amateur, that's the word I was looking for.

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Though it's not all technically amateur.

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,500
But anyway, on the internet, the idea of death of the author has really picked up over the last few years.

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,000
It's become a very popular method of critique, right?

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,500
The idea of the death of the author, which I believe was proposed by Descartes, someone like that?

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Jacques Derrida.

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I don't know if that's how you pronounce his name.

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Derrida, the guy who's impossible to read because none of his shit makes any sense.

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:06,500
But he proposed the idea of the death of the author and the idea was that authorial intent doesn't necessarily matter.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Like, whatever you interpret out of the work is its own work in your head, in a way.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like, if I read a book and I construct a meaning of it in my mind,

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
then that meaning is not necessarily less valid to talk about and criticize than the actual author's intent.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now, I like death of the author conceptually because I think it can lead to great stuff,

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
you know, writing about your own experience with the work can be cool.

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,500
But I also think we have a danger of people not giving a fuck about authorial intent anymore

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
and thinking that authors are fucking idiots.

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I think that's the world we live in now.

75
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
It is.

76
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I guess.

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I don't know.

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
It always seems like that's part of the picture.

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,500
You know, if you're looking to get into something, you should at least, you know, find out what they were going for

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
and then you can make your conclusions from there.

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
And if you don't know, then I guess you don't know.

82
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,000
I kind of like the idea of being able to just make your own conclusions regardless.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like, if you just don't care what the author thinks, I think there's space for that to exist.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like, if you get something out of a work, it doesn't really matter if the author meant for it to be there.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
You know, for you, it was there.

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Yeah, I totally agree.

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,000
But here's where this podcast is coming from, alright?

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Specifically, this is to address a comment that I get a lot on my videos and I'm sure you guys have all gotten to,

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
which is that you are thinking more deeply about the show than the guy who made it.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, I've heard people say things like that.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I get this all the time.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll get, like, like on my Ava videos or something, you know, I'll point out, like, the way that a shot is constructed

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and they'll be like, there's no way they put that much thought into it, you know.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, I, um, I agree that that kind of flippancy about it is wrong-headed.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But I don't think that, like, I think in a way, in a sort of roundabout way, I agree.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Because when you take a work and you analyze, like, oh, this shot was composed this way to emphasize such and such,

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and you know, the color composition here represents this.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It isn't like, it isn't like that all these detailed notes and conclusions you draw,

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
like they were all mapped out ahead of time and deliberately put there by the author.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But, but that doesn't mean, that also doesn't mean that those things weren't the authors.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That is debatable.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
In the case of Ava.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, you know, some authors do, like, do do that.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But, but sometimes a way a shot is framed, an artist can just kind of subconsciously arrange things in a way that feels right to them,

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but that accomplishes a number of goals.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think that a lot, you know, just kind of come out of it.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In a lot of cases, including Digi Bro's analysis of the Ava shot composition,

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the collective thought that was put into that shot by all the people involved in production and writing obviously outstrips any individual analyst.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
However, obviously an analyst or reviewer or critic or whatever has the advantage of being able to look at the completed work after it's already been all put together.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's, if people who aren't creative probably can't understand that when you start creating something,

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
you have no idea what it's going to be by the time you're done with it.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So you can't necessarily think about things retroactively.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And so as a result, there is a huge advantage to a reviewer who can already look at everything and how it all plays together already.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, I guess.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I still think, I think there's a lot of people.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think there's a lot of like authors or creatives who like really do just think about everything, you know.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There are.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I mean, like...

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They may not necessarily be able to like tell you because the way they communicate is through their art anyway.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So they wouldn't be able to tell you why they did what they did,

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but they'd be able to put it in because they knew it was the right thing to do.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, like if a shot emphasizes a character's, I don't know, despair or something,

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
they weren't necessarily thinking like,

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
now to emphasize the character's despair, you know, I will crop his eyes here and I will color it like this.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They just like drew the shot that looked right to them and it emphasized the despair.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And you can retroactively point out the ways in which it emphasizes that despair.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think like, I mean, I could definitely see, especially on the level of like a comic artist where it's more sort of intuitive like that.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Like one guy, you know, making a thing, but like when it comes to like a show or a production or a film,

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and there's like multiple people approaching the angle of every shot, you know,

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
every single scene is like sort of not necessarily designed by committee,

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but there's people have to talk about it to each other, you know,

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
like my brother, Victor, who's a, you know, an aspiring film director.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I guess I should just say he is a film director.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He just hasn't made any like, you know, professional films.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He's like, you know, a Hollywood.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, he's still trying to get into grad school, but um, that shit.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He's a, you know, he's told me before, like when he was working with this guy,

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
who's like an assistant director or like a, like his lead camera guy for a couple of shorts they were doing,

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
like this guy had so little ability to understand the nuance and Victor's writing,

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
like he had written the script and showed it to this guy and the guy just didn't get any of it.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Like all of it was over his head.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Victor had to explain to him like exactly why every shot would be filmed the way it was,

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
why every line was written the way it was, what it all meant,

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
what each thing was trying to express,

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
just so this guy would be on the same page as him when filming his movie, you know, or acting in it.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
In this particular case, he was acting in the, in the script, uh, Ye Olde Kitten's Paw.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If any of you have seen that one, it was on, it's on the Modal Soul Productions channel,

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and the guy who was the lead actor in that, like...

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's the guy with the, at the bar, and then he goes to the beach.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, I have seen that, and I thought it was a cool script that was completely hamstrung by the acting.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It was, and that guy, the guy who was the lead actor, is the one I'm talking about.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He had no comprehension of what the script meant.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Like Victor had to carefully explain to him why the character would say these things,

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
what they were thinking, what the message is, like why this scene, why is it presented this way, you know.

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So in other words, Victor had thought about all that, and I don't know that he necessarily had, like,

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
like you said, it became more analytical and retrospect, where, like, he wrote it emotionally,

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
like, what made sense to him, but then when he had to, like, teach the actor what it meant,

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
he had to then analyze it and explain it to him, you know.

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But I don't think that, that means he didn't put thought into it.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He, you know, he just understood those things intrinsically and was able to write already knowing what would be,

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
what would communicate that, you know.

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know what, that reminds me of something I was doing, in fact, just, in fact, right now, actually,

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and yesterday, where I've written something into a script and now I'm editing it in,

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and I find that upon reviewing the script that I have read,

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
there's actually a few more questions that I have to answer in order to make the shot convey,

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
you know, the sort of baseline idea that I was trying to get to.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I have to do this research and kind of figure out my own point and then put it in there.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And my whole point is here, like, there's a lot of thought that's going into all of this shit, you know.

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, you know, one of your old videos, did you, bro, you talk about, I don't know why I keep saying all those syllables each time.

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, I know.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know, it's kind of warm today.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm getting kind of...

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's hot in the mother.

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When your oldest videos, you talk about authorial intent and you say, you know,

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
a lot of people, if they watch something and it sucks, they usually will accuse it of having been made thoughtlessly.

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Like, the people who did it just weren't putting that much thought into it,

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
but what's more likely to be accurate is that a whole bunch of stupid thoughts were put into it.

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
For an easy example of this, you can watch Bird Demek or Cool Cat Saves the Kids,

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
people who clearly thought about everything that went into those films.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Man, I'm sick of the room not getting mentioned in these things. The room's the best.

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Everyone needs to give it respect.

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sick of the room being mentioned. That one's kind of an older, infamously bad movie.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We're talking about the modern age.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Bird Demek's pretty old.

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, yeah, in all the cases, like, yeah, those are just filmmakers who are incompetent

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and they don't know how to...

191
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's not that they didn't think about what they were doing.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, like you said, stupid thoughts.

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They don't know the technique, they don't know the craft,

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
they don't know anything about what will resonate with other people.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So, the movie probably made sense to them, but they just failed at communicating it to others.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But that doesn't mean that they didn't try, that it didn't add up in their own heads.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, for example, the guy who made Cool Cat actually changed the movie some

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
because of the critical response I think most of the time.

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right, that pretty much proves it.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That it actually resonated with him on a couple of points.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He was like, oh, that's a good point, yeah.

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I just think it's like ridiculous to me to think that anyone other than the author

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
would be thinking harder about something than the fucking author.

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, if something is like...

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I mean, if something was like a completely corporate, cynical, you know...

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That means even more thought's been put into it.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Not creative thought.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, I don't think people are judging it on the same basis as like,

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
okay, we got like in Jack and Jill, a lot of thought was put into that product placement.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That shit was like almost on another level.

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, that's what I mean.

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Like Jack and Jill, everything that's in the movie, they knew what they were doing.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They just didn't do good work.

214
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They deliberately did not do good work.

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They decided to make something lazy, you know.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But that doesn't mean that they understand it less than you do by watching it.

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Like, if you watch that movie and you analyze all the product placement

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and you say this movie was clearly made with this intention,

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
it probably was made with that intention, you know.

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay, well here's a question, because we are...

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I believe we're tending to count the collective thought of the creative and production teams behind something.

222
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So should we also square that against the collective thought of the fan base?

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because I was scrambling to come up with an example of something that the fans have thought about more than the creators.

224
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sonic Adventure 2.

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Maybe?

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sure.

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Sonic in general, I guess?

228
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, that one especially.

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That particular one especially.

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I feel like maybe the amount of additional narrative that people have added themselves into.

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Right.

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But it's one thing to interpret things from the story.

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's another to write fan fiction about it.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I just don't know what you're referring to.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think there's a level where it becomes just death of the author thinking, right?

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like, maybe, I don't know how much the fans understand that they're doing it.

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But when you get to that point where it's obviously not what the author intended,

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
then that's where you're invoking death of the author and making your own story, you know?

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah.

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And of course, part of this debate, I guess what I'm trying to do here is not so much to say that there's a definite line between the two,

241
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and some people are right and some people are wrong.

242
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I just want to sort of push it back.

243
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I feel like people have reached a point of assuming,

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
because of death of the author and because of analysis and stuff,

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that people are starting to think that authors don't think as much as they do about shit.

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Where I think that the majority of stuff that people get out of work is almost always intentional,

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and then there's that smaller amount of stuff we put into it,

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the headcanons and the reading too deep shit.

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Right.

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And then there's the thing that the Beginner's Guide game it commentates on is,

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
don't try to comment on the author because you're going to be wrong.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Right.

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And then Aaron's Signal made that video about it,

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
made that video explaining it,

255
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and it was a game about not explaining things,

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and he has this faux existential crisis at the end that I thought was amusing.

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't think that was a faux existential crisis.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think that was a real existential crisis.

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It was scripted, but he tried to make it seem like it wasn't.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And to me, it was amusing and made me feel very smugly superior,

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
because personally, I've never felt like this was a...

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's never something that I've had to reconcile.

263
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's never something that I felt was a problem.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
For me, I always...

265
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
For me, whenever I...

266
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If I think something about the intention of an author,

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
it's only because I'm very, very confident in it based on everything I know,

268
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and I don't think that I'm going to be wrong,

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and I don't say things that are like stretches.

270
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So for me, it's not an issue.

271
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Pretty much everybody, if you talk about Ava and Galeon,

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
everyone always brings up how Hideo Kiana was depressed,

273
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and he was interested in psychology and all that,

274
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
but no one got that because they just watched Ava and assumed that about him.

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's like, that's what he said.

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He said, I was depressed.

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I made this show about being depressed, you know?

278
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And so it's like, okay, we got that.

279
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And it's cool, because that kind of authorial intent can inform your enjoyment of a show,

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
where there's a lot of people who like Ava even more because they know that.

281
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They're like, now that I understand what he was trying to communicate,

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I can resonate with it that much more.

283
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So when it comes to reviewers and analysts and the fans of said reviewers and analysts,

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I guess they have the question of,

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
well, how much are you supposed to talk about the author,

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and how much are you supposed to talk about your own interpretation?

287
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, I'll tell you what.

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
My standard is I talk about whichever one is the most interesting.

289
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There are some videos I've done where...

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Sometimes I'll play a game or watch a thing,

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and my opinion of it is really boring.

292
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Even if I liked it or I hated it, I just think my opinion is boring.

293
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And if I made a video out of it, I would barely talk about my opinion.

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And then sometimes I think that where it came from was not that interesting to me,

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
or vice versa, or both.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And so, like for example, there was an indie game that came out in late 2015

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that was very popular that I'm not going to name because we bring it up in every episode of the show.

298
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Thank you. Thank you, Dubu. I really appreciate that.

299
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And that game comes from such a similar...

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I feel like it comes from a pretty similar place as me,

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
because there's a lot of things in it that remind me of a couple of games that I made

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
that aren't very good at all, but there are certain elements of that particular game

303
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
that are so similar in such a specific way to games that I made,

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and I only made a few that made me think,

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
wow, this is a work where my opinion and the opinion of the author are like equally interesting.

306
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You know, I have made a couple of videos where I deliberately went like way out of the realm

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
of what the show seemed to be intended to talk about,

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
but I always sort of... I don't know. I don't know how well I signposted it.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I think I did because I made them kind of funny,

310
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but I have the video No Kome and Nihilism,

311
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
which is where I way over read into a harem show

312
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
in a way that is obviously not intentional, but it was funny.

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh, right. I remember that one. That came through.

314
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I couldn't really tell that at first because I didn't know anything about the show.

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I could tell based on the title and the appearance of the show that that was the case.

316
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And then with the Food, Sex, and Life in Kofuku Graffiti episode,

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
that one as well, where the show is just about cute girls eating food,

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and I tried to take it to this philosophical place of like,

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
eating food is sexy because it reminds us of life and childbirth or something.

320
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It was clearly meant to be like an almost irreverent analysis.

321
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
For me, if there's some trashy or fun-loving, just regular run-of-the-mill comedy action thing,

322
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
that isn't deep, but it inspires deep thoughts in me,

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the feeling of watching that is exactly, I mean, like, not that different from

324
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
if it really was some big high-brow artsy thing.

325
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If it makes me think really advanced things, then it feels the same way to me,

326
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
whether or not it tries to be.

327
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's just a matter of like...

328
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I just forget. If something makes me think philosophically,

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I just consider it to be a philosophical deep show.

330
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, like, I mean, and I'm not saying it's not because of that,

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
but like, it's definitely a difference where like, with those shows,

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I in no way think the author intended the things that I was saying about the shows,

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
but like, you know, there's so many other shows that I talk about where I totally do,

334
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and like, and those two videos were so out there and far-fetched that I don't think anyone would,

335
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
like, assume that I thought that the author meant that.

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I mean, someone told me you're reading too deep into this.

337
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'd be like, yeah, that's the joke.

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Your authorial intent was that the other person's authorial intent was not being addressed correctly.

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Your authorial intent was their authorial intent.

340
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I like stuff.

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's my favorite.

342
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I stepped on a frog. I hope it wasn't an ancestor.

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay, some people don't seem to understand.

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Donatello should be the PCP mascot. No, go on, sorry.

345
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Some people don't seem to understand that you can talk about a work and analyze a work

346
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and bring up the themes of a work without necessarily attributing those things to authorial intent.

347
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Sometimes anything you say about a show or a thing, people will hear as you're saying that, you know,

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
this is what the author intended. It isn't.

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What is even the point of making that distinction?

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't get, like, if you point out what the author...

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Well, if you say something's a theme of a show, someone might counter with, oh, that's dumb.

352
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Obviously the author didn't mean for that to be there, which is not fair.

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, the authors don't always, you know, mean for things to happen, so who cares about the author?

354
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But at the same time, like, if you're talking about just the show or just the author...

355
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If I got X out of a show and someone says, but the author didn't intend that,

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I mean, that's an invalid point.

357
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You know, I think a lot of viewers or listeners of this podcast may be wondering,

358
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
like, where are we coming from on this? Why is this a topic of concern for us?

359
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Because did you want it to.

360
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I want to say what I think the concern is, is that we put a lot of effort into stating our opinions

361
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
or our thoughts or our interpretations into an entertaining product,

362
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and we are, I think we're pretty well trained, we've pretty well conditioned ourselves

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to not say our opinion of something unless it's going to be interesting or funny,

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
whereas most commenters just want to say their opinions and don't want to put in the effort,

365
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and so they'll just either hide behind authorial intent or hide behind the death of the author

366
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
as a cheap, quick tool to just categorically back up whatever they want to say

367
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and make something funny or interesting about it.

368
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah, and to use either one of those as a categorical defense is wrong,

369
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
because both of those are just, like, you know, accepting authorial intent as valid

370
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and totally throwing it out as a valid interpretation of the work

371
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
are just two different ways of looking at a thing.

372
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You can't say, oh, this wasn't intended by the author, therefore it's worthless.

373
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You also can't say, oh, you know, it doesn't matter what the author intended

374
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
because it's not interested in it.

375
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
There's just two fucking opinions.

376
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
On a similar note, DeVoo, did you see that legendary thread that I got into on the Reddit

377
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
arguing about the game that shall not be named on your video about it?

378
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh yeah, well, yeah, talk about that.

379
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That guy had such specific ideas about what the game should have been

380
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and he had very specific ideas about how you should have presented your ideas.

381
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And it finally got to the point.

382
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He finally made a response that I just, I read it and I understood what he was saying,

383
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but every single thing that he said was just so wrong that I had no retort for any of it.

384
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I finally was just like, I think everything you just said is wrong,

385
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and that's all I have to say.

386
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And he was like, okay, good day, sir.

387
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You hit argument bedrock, that's a good shit.

388
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, we hit argument bedrock at that point.

389
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's kind of pulling us back to our reviewer rules episode where we talk about people

390
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
who have their rules about what you need to talk about.

391
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
In regards to that discussion.

392
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This guy was very specifically, you should have said this,

393
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
you needed to say that and because you didn't, your video was bad.

394
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
On a small level, I always hate when I get a comment like, I don't know,

395
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
when you talk about a game, if you were to make a video about, like, a...

396
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And then you're like, wait, you didn't say get dope?

397
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What, don't dude?

398
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
No.

399
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Why are you not supposed to talk about that?

400
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We've all been trying to say the game that is not named.

401
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I had no idea.

402
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Wow.

403
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Just censor that, just censor that.

404
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Whoever's adding the censor that.

405
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, put a censor break.

406
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Davoo might actually censor that.

407
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I think he might, because I think he's...

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'd like to talk about, like, the idea that if an author, like, say,

409
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Hitataki Miyazaki, or whatever his name is, the Dark Souls guy,

410
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the Dark Souls Demon Souls guy.

411
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hero Hito Nagasaki.

412
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
He did good games, all of them.

413
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And, like, he's got, like, a track record of, like, him being a director

414
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and good games coming from it.

415
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And it's...

416
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
If you could...

417
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I mean, it feels like it's easier to say, yeah, that's what he intended

418
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
when you're, like, analyzing his next game.

419
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Because...

420
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Well, that's the thing.

421
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Like, when I start doing, like, my stuff where I really lean hard on, like,

422
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
this is what they intended for this shot to be,

423
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
it's usually because I'm, like, pretty confident that that creator knows their shit.

424
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You know?

425
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Like, someone like Miyazaki, you don't just make three games that are all perfect on accident.

426
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You know?

427
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Like, he clearly knows what the fuck he's doing.

428
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He clearly, every element of the game, it's a...

429
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
As Mr. Beetson called it, the Gesamtkunswerk,

430
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
where everything about it is perfect and it all plays into each other perfectly.

431
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The rest of you remembered that word.

432
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think it's a case...

433
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I think it's a case of he just had very specific ideas about what the game should be.

434
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah.

435
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And they ended up being good ideas that people really resonated with people.

436
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And then he, you know, doggedly stuck to them

437
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and that philosophy through all of his games, which is what made them good.

438
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I just...

439
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I certainly think that, like, like, yeah, maybe he didn't, like, know

440
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
that this was gonna be something everyone would think was the best idea ever.

441
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But he definitely knew what he was doing.

442
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You know, it's fair to say that if something goes well,

443
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
it's probably because he decided that that was, like, that was his intent for it to happen.

444
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I mean, there's definitely plenty of stuff where the author completely did everything intentionally

445
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and thought they were making something great and no one liked it.

446
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Like, that's definitely a thing that happens.

447
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But it's still, the author understood, like, they did what they wanted to do, you know?

448
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's just harder to say definitively when they've only done, like, one or two things.

449
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Right.

450
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Like, sometimes you can look at a work and you can say that this was not what they intended

451
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and it got fucked up somewhere, right?

452
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Like, for instance, when Max Landis was the screenwriter, Max Landis,

453
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
was interviewed by Red Letter Media and he was talking about how, you know,

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
once he sells off a script and once they go and make it,

455
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
it can be changed so fundamentally that it basically doesn't, like...

456
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Like, it's not even his work anymore, you know?

457
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Like, he was saying that all the nuance of the script can become so different in the film version

458
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
that it's basically a different product.

459
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And so, like, to him, the film is no longer, like, written by Max Landis by the time it's made.

460
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The script was written by Max Landis.

461
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The film is just its own thing that, you know, that exists with or without him.

462
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So, I definitely think that if you tried to watch Max Landis' films and then be like,

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
this is what his authorial intent is, then it would be lost somewhere, you know?

464
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Because it's not necessarily coming out to be what he wanted it to be.

465
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Whereas, you know, other cases where it's, like, if someone drew a comic

466
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and they seem to be very confident in their comic that everything in it is exactly what they intended,

467
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and then you read it and you're like, this is shit,

468
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
it just means that their authorial intent was stupid, you know?

469
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah. When it comes to independence.

470
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's me. My authorial intent.

471
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Are you saying my authorial intent was stupid, Digi?

472
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
No, I like those.

473
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's because you didn't like my shit.

474
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll kill you.

475
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah, I know.

476
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It was good comic. Don't worry about it.

477
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

478
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Like, I'm sure it's, like, I read the first page of the Vapors Chapter 2

479
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and Vincent takes the book Infinite Jest,

480
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
and he's so sure that having this particular book is going to make him, like, a king,

481
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
you know, that people are going to worship him.

482
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah, people admire his wisdom.

483
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Obviously, you chose Infinite Jest because it's the perfect book for that, you know?

484
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
What the hell is that?

485
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Is that guy trying to talk and failing?

486
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
No, it was just, sorry, I made a noise. Ignore it.

487
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So yes, Digi, I guess my, I guess my authorial intent did shine through in that one.

488
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Right.

489
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Because that's exactly what I meant it to be.

490
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I looked at it and I thought, oh my god, it's Infinite Jest, a giant book that I have,

491
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
for years, thought the title sounded so cool that I've wanted to read it.

492
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And I'm pretty sure I got the audiobook because I accidentally had an audible subscription

493
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
for, like, a year and didn't know I was paying for it.

494
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So I used all the points I'd built up to buy, like, a fuckload of books,

495
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and I still haven't listened to it.

496
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So, like, that particular book, I was like, I completely understood why that one,

497
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
why Infinite Jest, you know?

498
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's got, like, an air of mystery around it, right?

499
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

500
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's kind of got, like, a little aura, sort of.

501
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Well, it's got the title alone, like, makes it sound like it's about the whole fucking universe,

502
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
you know?

503
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

504
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Infinite Jest.

505
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's, like, ironic and meta at the same time as everything else, you know?

506
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Like, it's got that...it's infinite, but it's a joke.

507
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Like, all of infinity is a joke, you know?

508
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I know, man.

509
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And you're totally right that I chose it very deliberately based on, you know...

510
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And that's the next part of this I wanted to get into.

511
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Like, part of the incentive to do this podcast was that I wanted us to talk about how the reason we understand

512
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
that creators put a lot of thought into their shit is because we're all creators

513
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and we put a lot of thought into our shit.

514
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah, me, but yeah.

515
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Well, except Gib, obviously.

516
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Like, I can't imagine...

517
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I mean, it depends on the...

518
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Look, alright.

519
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Like, I can't imagine putting something in something that I make without...

520
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I mean, you gotta at least think about it a little bit.

521
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Here's the...

522
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It bothers me that you've got to draw it all.

523
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, the comic especially.

524
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
There's this meme that was going around.

525
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I wouldn't even...I don't know if it's a meme, per se,

526
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
but it's something that, like, people were posting all over the Internet

527
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
where it's a...what your English teacher told you is the drapes are blue

528
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because they represent the character's depression

529
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and what the author meant was the drapes are fucking blue.

530
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
This is an image that got posted everywhere.

531
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
People took it as like a, yeah, fuck my English teacher.

532
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Fuck intellectualism.

533
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Reading is just dumb, you know?

534
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And I'm sitting here like...

535
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And of course...

536
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If I was an author and I was writing a scene where I was gonna mention the drapes

537
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and I wanted to mention what color they were,

538
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
then the first thought going through my head is,

539
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
what color will convey the tone of this scene?

540
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
If it's a sad scene, I would say the fucking drapes were blue.

541
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Or if they were yellow, I would say that the yellow of the drapes contrasts with...

542
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Like, he was driven mad by how the yellow drapes didn't reflect his fucking sad mood.

543
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
More commonly, you could be like...

544
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You could mention that, like, it's raining and someone's died.

545
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like, that's a more common thing.

546
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yeah.

547
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And that's also a thing that English teachers tell you to think about.

548
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let me explain this from a practical perspective.

549
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Let's say I'm making that scene and let me say I'm doing it in a comic.

550
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And so I drew the drapes and I click on the fill bucket tool

551
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and I'm gonna select a color.

552
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
In the time that it will take for me to drag my mouse over to the color selector,

553
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I will probably be able to come to the very obvious conclusion that blue will be the saddest color.

554
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's not even, like, hard from a, like, a schematic standpoint.

555
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And that's why it's possible.

556
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Because you have to realize, like...

557
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
When I was scrambling to come up with an example of where fans thought about it harder than the authors,

558
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I thought, hmm, the Beatles? Like, no.

559
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
They, you know, they spent, like, a year making each of their albums for an entire decade.

560
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
There's no way anyone could top that.

561
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Because they have so much time.

562
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's their job.

563
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
If you have a job and you make hamburgers and you think about how many hamburgers you make,

564
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
every one of those hamburgers represents a thought or a consideration

565
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
or an intent in a creative work that a full-time artist has.

566
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So just understand, it's not an impractical thing to do,

567
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
it's to think about everything you put in.

568
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah, and it's not, like, if you're an artist or creative, this stuff, like, it instantly makes sense to you.

569
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Like, the example that I wanted to bring up the most when I was planning this podcast,

570
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
because it's such a weird, specific thing that didn't need to be done, but I did it,

571
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
was when I made that drunken rant about the life of Pablo, the new Kanye West album.

572
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And it's just, like, for all intents and purposes, I got up in front of a camera, drunk as shit,

573
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and just rambled into it about my opinions on this album.

574
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But what I did before I started filming was I have a backdrop where I have, like,

575
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
a bunch of vinyl albums and a bunch of art books.

576
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And I took down one of my anime art books and I put up a vinyl album of Rat King's So It Goes.

577
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And the reason for that is that I wanted to have one really great rap album in the background

578
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
so that if anyone questioned my credentials of reviewing rap, I would have proof that I like rap music.

579
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You should have also put a black friend in the frame so they could know that you're also, you know,

580
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
it's appropriate for you to be judging them.

581
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Well, fuck those people. I actually did get a couple of, like, don't review black music comments,

582
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and I banned them.

583
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Ah, jeez. Well, that's just Kanye's meme now, so...

584
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But, you know, and I had people who pointed out the Rat King album.

585
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
They're like, oh man, sick Rat King album back there, you know, because, like...

586
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So it worked, yeah.

587
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah, like, I don't know that that made them, like, take my opinion more seriously per se,

588
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
but it was just like, I wanted it to be somewhere back there.

589
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Because I looked at my collection and I said, well, what I see from where I'm sitting is, like,

590
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
a pop album, a rock album, and an R&B album. None of this is going to make people think,

591
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
like, people might just say, oh, you don't like rap music.

592
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So I'm like, alright, I'll put in the black fucking rap album of last year.

593
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Well, here's a thought.

594
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You definitely put the Rat King album there deliberately.

595
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yes.

596
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
But to the viewer, it's open to interpretation what you meant by that, you know, like,

597
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
something might say, oh, he's here to show that he does have good taste in rap,

598
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
but someone else maybe might think that you're trying to draw, like, a comparison

599
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
between Pablo and Rat King and try to say, oh, this is also an overrated album.

600
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You know, like...

601
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Why would I own it if it was an overrated album?

602
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't know.

603
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Why would I own it on vinyl if it was an overrated album?

604
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm just saying...

605
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I get what you mean.

606
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah, there are multiple...

607
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You can interpret a thing different ways, like the blue drapes thing,

608
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
like maybe it's meant to convey depression,

609
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
or maybe it ties into some other aspect of the character, the blueness,

610
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
or maybe it's just a throwaway detail that isn't meant to convey anything.

611
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The solution, yeah.

612
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It is included deliberately, but, like, it isn't always clear cut.

613
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Right.

614
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The deliberation of this problem is interviews.

615
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Get interviewers.

616
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah.

617
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This is a side note.

618
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Here's a rule for interviewers.

619
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Before you interview someone, watch all the other interviews that that person has done,

620
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and write a list of all the questions that have already been asked to them,

621
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
especially the ones that have been asked 50,000 times,

622
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and don't ask any of those.

623
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And if you can't come up with any new questions, don't do the interview.

624
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Just a completely unrelated thing.

625
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But good interviews are how you can dig into creative intent,

626
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
which is why I think that if...

627
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, an interviewer serves a more insidious purpose of just giving exposure

628
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and not giving you shit about finding out anything more than we already know.

629
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah, I know, but we're talking about the morals here.

630
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
In fairness, like, most...

631
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I mean, I won't say most, but, like, a large percentage of creatives

632
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
want their stuff to be interpreted by the viewer,

633
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and they don't like explaining it.

634
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Right.

635
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And so if they don't want to...

636
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I am 100% like that.

637
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah.

638
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I feel that way 100%.

639
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I wish I could be like that, but I can't.

640
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Like, I will absolutely explain why I did that.

641
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I do not try.

642
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
If someone wanted to do a seven-hour interview with me

643
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
to explain everything I've ever made, I absolutely would.

644
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I have.

645
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I feel.

646
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah.

647
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
See, I don't want to.

648
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't want to, because...

649
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I took a 44-hour interview.

650
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
If you do that, and you sit down and you explain every single thing that you thought,

651
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
there is absolutely no room for anyone to interpret otherwise.

652
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But that's not untrue.

653
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Because that means that people have...

654
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Everyone has to make the decision of whether or not they want to...

655
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They agree with you.

656
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, they want to take the author seriously.

657
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That's true.

658
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I do think...

659
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Because, like, authors...

660
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
What authors are afraid of when they don't, like, say that stuff

661
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
is that they're afraid that people will latch onto everything they say

662
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
and not want to interpret it differently.

663
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Because so many...

664
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
A lot of people do value authorial intent.

665
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's, like, the most valuable thing.

666
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Which is, paradoxically, why they get mad at you

667
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
for supposedly over-analyzing something.

668
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Because they want to believe in authorial intent as, like...

669
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
As what matters.

670
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But if what you say was the author's intent, like,

671
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
is more advanced than what they had already thought,

672
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
then it's a disconnect.

673
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's like, oh, God, I'm thinking about it wrong.

674
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I didn't understand it as well as I should have.

675
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Well, I think both are fun.

676
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I think people understanding exactly why I did something

677
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and getting the same thing out of it is cool.

678
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And people getting something out of it that I couldn't have thought of is cool.

679
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I like both.

680
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Right.

681
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
There's definitely been plenty of times where people have, like,

682
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
interpreted something really weird out of my work,

683
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and I've been like, that's cool, man.

684
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You know?

685
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I mean, even just all the people who take my videos as, like,

686
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
motivational speaking or something.

687
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Like, so many people who are like, my...

688
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I got through depression because of your videos,

689
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and I'm like, I didn't intend that, but okay, you know?

690
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You know, tons of shit like that, you know?

691
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And...

692
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But my point is just simply that with the whole life of Pablo thing,

693
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
that, like, that was something that I threw together in five minutes,

694
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but I did think about it and put it in there,

695
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and that's how easy it is, you know?

696
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And, like, even mistakes in my work, I know what they all are.

697
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You know, every time someone corrects me on something in a video,

698
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it's like, I know.

699
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I edited it.

700
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I looked at it.

701
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I stared at it.

702
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
All right?

703
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I heard it, you know?

704
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Well, you've had things that you, you know, should...

705
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I mean, you don't always know every single thing, right?

706
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You've been corrected in the past.

707
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Does that mean nobody should ever correct you, you know?

708
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Uh, yes, because I don't want...

709
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Like, I don't get what they think they're...

710
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Like, I can't change it.

711
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's out already, you know?

712
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Well, so what?

713
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So, like, I mean, the comments are a part of the...

714
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
a part of the universe of this video.

715
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's a criticism, you know?

716
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It exists to, you know, correct mistakes and shit.

717
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Only if I don't block those comments.

718
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
There's a lot, by the way, listeners who haven't heard any...

719
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
haven't heard of us before.

720
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There's a lot more nuance to Digi's opinions on blocking comments here

721
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
that he's not explaining.

722
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So don't call him a hypocrite.

723
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There's more to it than that.

724
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I think currently...

725
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think currently it's, uh, it's overly optimistic to assume anyone watching

726
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
hasn't seen most of our content, but maybe one day.

727
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Maybe one day.

728
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh, I don't know.

729
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think that's...

730
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Well, maybe they're just new and they're not familiar yet.

731
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, sure.

732
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Sure.

733
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Just watch my video on closing comments over on Digi Bro after Dark.

734
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, very...

735
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I went in deep about it.

736
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But, uh, yeah, no.

737
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Like, it's...

738
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
There are some times where people will correct, like, my pronunciation of something

739
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and I did not know that I had pronounced it wrong.

740
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Dude, you mispronounce words all the time.

741
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Yeah, and a lot of the time I do it on purpose and knowingly.

742
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Like, like...

743
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Why?

744
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because I don't like the other pronunciation.

745
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Like, I like...

746
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You should be correct.

747
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It's just how I say it.

748
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm not interested in your head canon of how words should be pronounced, you know?

749
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But my...

750
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
My point is like...

751
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
We have a shared language here.

752
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We're trying to run a society and you're...

753
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You're...

754
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You're violating the whole operation with your...

755
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
With your go-in row.

756
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You're going off-road.

757
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Dude, there's so many words that I've just made up and invented for my videos

758
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
or found whole new uses for.

759
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's like...

760
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You know what it's like?

761
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's like I have...

762
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
When I was a kid, I listened to the Fuli Kuli soundtrack all the time.

763
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It was like my favorite thing to listen to.

764
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And as a result, I...

765
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Since I didn't speak Japanese at all,

766
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I made up all these lyrics.

767
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Now, if I...

768
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Go.

769
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If I make a lyric video to Fuli...

770
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
To like...

771
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
To like Little Busters or whatever,

772
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and I write down all my head canon lyrics,

773
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
is it wrong for people to correct me?

774
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Because I...

775
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That's what I...

776
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's my version of the song.

777
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Saying a word differently is not different.

778
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's not the same as changing the word.

779
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Like, I don't think anybody would be confused if...

780
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Did you...

781
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Did you say niche or niche?

782
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

783
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
There's nothing else that sounds like niche.

784
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
There's nothing that hits you in the head and you're like,

785
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh, something's wrong here.

786
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What's going on here?

787
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And you should lock that feeling deep down inside,

788
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
because no one fucking cares.

789
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Look, if I left a comment every time I was bothered

790
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
by the way someone pronounced something,

791
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I would never stop leaving comments.

792
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Every video I've ever seen has a pronunciation

793
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
that bothers me in it.

794
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You know?

795
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Like, no one knows how to pronounce Japanese shit.

796
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No one knows how to pronounce other shit.

797
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'll comment on your weird pronunciation,

798
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
so I guess we're at an impasse here.

799
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I don't know.

800
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
There are lots of bad pronunciations in the vapors.

801
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That was a joke, because that's impossible,

802
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
because it's not audio.

803
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Everything I say is, I'm actually American,

804
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
but I just pronounce everything wrong.

805
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You just think that's how it's pronounced.

806
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
That's what gets to me the most,

807
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
is that everyone has different dialects.

808
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So like, to say that I can't pronounce a word a certain way

809
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
is like, I don't get where the disconnect comes from.

810
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Like, just because no one else pronounces it that way

811
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
doesn't mean that it's not a dialect

812
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
that is specific to me.

813
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I can actually agree with that.

814
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
There's no really wrong way to say anything.

815
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And I think the fact that people get upset about pronunciations...

816
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Then you just get into the fundamental point of language itself.

817
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Well, I think what this is, why people get bothered

818
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
about pronunciations plays into the very first episode

819
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
of Hello Internet, which was called

820
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Being Wrong on the Internet.

821
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
How many times do people correct your pronunciation

822
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
and how angry are they about correcting your pronunciation

823
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
if you pronounce it on a podcast or a Let's Play?

824
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Is it less intense?

825
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I would say it's less intense,

826
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
but it is still very much there.

827
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But it is less intense, and I think that's because

828
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
in a proper video, people expect you to have this level

829
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
of professionalism and objectivity,

830
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
not just objectivity of opinions.

831
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Even people who understand subjective opinions

832
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
still think there's like objective standards

833
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
you have to play into, which is, I think,

834
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
another category of this whole author intent thing.

835
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Davoo, what was the name of that video?

836
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Being Wrong on the Internet.

837
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It was the first episode of the Hello Internet podcast.

838
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I just came to say Hello Internet.

839
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Alright, kill yourself.

840
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's the funniest thing I've ever thought of in my entire life.

841
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Right. Good one.

842
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah, I nailed it, okay.

843
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I was getting nailed for, in my latest video,

844
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I said Nodame Cantabile,

845
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I guess it's pronounced canta bide,

846
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
which is like a fucking Italian word.

847
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
All these people are shitting on me for it,

848
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and I'm like, why would you expect me to be able

849
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to pronounce a fucking Italian word?

850
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
When have I ever suggested that I know any Italian at all?

851
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You know, like, I just...

852
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
To me, when I hear...

853
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
There are some things that humans are expected to do,

854
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
you know, outside of what anime reviewers...

855
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
This has always stuck out with me in my mind, right?

856
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
There was this one time that I watched,

857
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
like, one of the first anime video reviews I saw

858
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
was this British guy talking about Hajime no Ippo, right?

859
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And the way he kept pronouncing it was Hajime no Ippo.

860
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And, like, the first time...

861
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Did he watch the show? They say the name over and over.

862
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, but he's like, as soon as I heard it,

863
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I was like, well, he's British.

864
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Words sound different when they come out of his mouth.

865
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And the funny thing is, even though at first I was like,

866
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
oh, God, but then over time,

867
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
that's now how I pronounce it more often than not.

868
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I now love saying Hajime no Ippo.

869
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Like, it's hilarious to me.

870
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Dude, we need the Hippo to do a review of the Ippo.

871
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yeah.

872
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Get on that. Get on that.

873
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And, like, I knew what he was talking about.

874
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I knew what the show was.

875
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Like, he probably, on some level, is aware

876
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
that he probably doesn't know how to pronounce it

877
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
because it's a fucking Japanese name, you know, like...

878
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The reason I say Kantabile in my video

879
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
is that I learned that show in 2007

880
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
when I was 16.

881
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So I didn't think at all about the pronunciation.

882
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And I've just been saying it that way for nine years.

883
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And there was a moment when I started editing the video,

884
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
like, once I had the audio figured out

885
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and I started laying in clips, I went,

886
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
oh, my God, I probably pronounced this wrong.

887
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Like, Kantabile can't be a word, you know?

888
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But then I went, eh, everyone knows what I'm talking about.

889
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It doesn't fucking matter.

890
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And I finished editing the video, you know?

891
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And then I've got people who were like commenting,

892
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm almost vomited when I heard Kantabile.

893
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
That makes sense. That's appropriate, thematically.

894
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I don't think that's what they bile.

895
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I think we've gone pretty far afield.

896
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I think we've gone pretty far afield

897
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
with the topic of authorials.

898
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah, well, guess what? Conunciation is too funny.

899
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So we're going to keep talking about it.

900
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
People may have realized there's a trend in Digi's videos

901
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
whenever he talks about a particular character

902
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
from Hunter Hunter, he always goes,

903
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Kidua! I can't even do it correctly.

904
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Kidua.

905
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Because in the first video I did, I said,

906
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Kidua, and people fucking...

907
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
There was hundreds of comments

908
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
pissed off at me for the way I pronounced Kidua.

909
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That's obviously the right way to do it

910
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
because everything else sounds gay and stupid.

911
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yes, it's Kidua.

912
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Kidua.

913
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Kidua.

914
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So there's a couple of videos where you just talk

915
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and that's one of the few concessions I've made

916
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
just because there were so many comments about it

917
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
that I couldn't...

918
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I was like, I don't want to live through this again.

919
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Like, I'm going to change...

920
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's not how I would ever pronounce it in my everyday life.

921
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
If I was talking about the show to anyone,

922
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'd say Kidua because that sounds right

923
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
or Kidua.

924
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Like, it might have been how I said it, but like...

925
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Kidua.

926
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's got to be that way in the video.

927
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And no one complains when I say it that way.

928
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So Kidua.

929
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Completely changes the entire tone of my voice.

930
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Like, you're listening to me speak in a normal American accent

931
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
and then suddenly, oh yeah, and in Hunter Hunter,

932
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Kidua has this great character arc.

933
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It sounds fucking stupid.

934
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
And the most intense example was the pronunciation

935
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
of Shinseiki Evangelion.

936
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yes.

937
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Which was very intentional.

938
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Because you go Evangelion

939
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and I go Evangelion because I hear you talk about it

940
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
more than anyone else.

941
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yes.

942
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
When Demo says Evangelion, I'm like, okay, fine.

943
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And people can go Evangelion or Uvangelion

944
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
or Oyvangelion, whatever.

945
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But people got mad that your first syllable was different.

946
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And so you wanted to highlight the fact that

947
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
the Japanese title is not even the same words.

948
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
No, it's Shinseiki Evangelion.

949
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So this goes into people having these false ideas

950
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
that there's like these objective standards of pronunciation

951
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that you're supposed to hold up to,

952
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
which brings us to this...

953
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I just wanted to say one pronunciation thing

954
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
that I kind of might be amusing.

955
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I never watched Dragon Ball Z as a kid,

956
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
but I did read the manga of Dragon Ball.

957
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Did you call it Dragon Balls?

958
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No.

959
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Is that what you're saying?

960
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
No, but the...

961
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I pronounce kamehameha, like kamehameha,

962
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
because that's how it's written.

963
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Sure, sure.

964
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Instead of the kamehame, and I always think

965
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
kamehameha is stupid.

966
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But it's correct.

967
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I read Sasuke as Sasuke for the longest time.

968
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Really? Sasuke is a really cool soccer of the beautiful.

969
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Naruto!

970
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I thought it was Sasuke.

971
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Oh man, that's even worse.

972
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Sasuke.

973
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, so you're saying that you read it before you saw the show?

974
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I just saw it.

975
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I'm surprised.

976
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I read it in 2003.

977
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I read it before the show existed.

978
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But yeah, anyway, Davoo,

979
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
what were you going to use that to branch back into...

980
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Stupid Reddit moderator guy

981
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
who disrespected Jesse...

982
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Oh shit.

983
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Endless Jesse's professionalism.

984
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
His AMV, yeah.

985
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
He's not...

986
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It's a shame he's not on this podcast right now,

987
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
because the reason he's not...

988
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
The intention he has for not being on this podcast

989
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
is he's asleep, so...

990
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah.

991
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You know.

992
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So let me explain this conflict very quickly.

993
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
There's this Reddit...

994
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Jesse made an AMV of Ava and Gelyon

995
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and posted it on the Ava subreddit.

996
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And the moderator there, like,

997
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
jumped down Jesse's throat for the fact that

998
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
he had changed the aspect ratio of the video.

999
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And this guy was like,

1000
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I was only able to last 10 seconds,

1001
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and I just wanted to throw up because your aspect...

1002
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
A lot of people talking about throwing up lately

1003
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
in response to shitty videos.

1004
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
He was like,

1005
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I just wanted to throw up because you changed the aspect ratio,

1006
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and any prof...

1007
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
He literally said any professional AMV competition

1008
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
would have thrown this out immediately.

1009
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
He just said any reputable AMV contest.

1010
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Yeah.

1011
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Which is the weirdest thing to say,

1012
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
because it's not an AMV contest submission.

1013
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It's some video some guy made on YouTube for fun.

1014
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah, and later on...

1015
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
He's using this other standard.

1016
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Later on, this guy was like,

1017
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
you know, in the professional world,

1018
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
you have to do professional correct things.

1019
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You have to do X, you have to do Y.

1020
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And if you do it wrong, you'll get fired.

1021
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And I pointed out, look, if...

1022
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Fired from YouTube.

1023
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

1024
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
If this guy were working for a company,

1025
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and they told you to not stretch the aspect ratio,

1026
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
he wouldn't, right?

1027
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Right.

1028
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And I told him.

1029
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah.

1030
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
This guy...

1031
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
No, you don't understand.

1032
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This guy wouldn't...

1033
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
This guy would be laughed out of any professional AMV contest

1034
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
that he tried to submit to.

1035
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Meanwhile...

1036
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Man, I want to make a shit-com now called Fired from YouTube,

1037
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
starring Jesse Wood over the giant Eva AMV debacle.

1038
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Guy, I really like how you accidentally said that as shit-com.

1039
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
What?

1040
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Did I?

1041
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Ho-ho!

1042
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That was on my authorial intent all along.

1043
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yeah, there we go.

1044
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I choose to ascribe that to the work that you just made,

1045
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
that meaning.

1046
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah.

1047
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So, like, I told this guy, look, Jesse,

1048
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
this guy is a professional YouTuber, you realize?

1049
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
He puts thought into what he's doing.

1050
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
He's not like an amateur.

1051
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You know, I think the only kind of shit-com Jesse would like to be in

1052
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
is a shit-com, but sorry.

1053
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah.

1054
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And I can understand why these people on our Eva

1055
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
didn't understand that Jesse is like an actual YouTuber.

1056
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The kind of person who must hang out on our Eva

1057
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
has got to be the most insufferable...

1058
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Moderate our Eva.

1059
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Right, the moderator holds the shit.

1060
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And according to his tag on the site,

1061
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
he's also a moderator of avageeks.org.

1062
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yeah, I looked into this guy a little bit.

1063
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So this guy's like a lifer.

1064
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
This guy spends a lot of time.

1065
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And he will not accept the skewing of the aspect ratio

1066
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
of his precious work.

1067
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Right, because what I really wanted to rip into this guy for,

1068
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
not that it's his work,

1069
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
not that I didn't get around to it,

1070
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
but this guy spends so much time being moderators of websites.

1071
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
How much time does he have being in this so-called

1072
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
professional world here, you know?

1073
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Probably not.

1074
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I mean, has he done any?

1075
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
What's his standard?

1076
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't know.

1077
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Yeah, I feel like any one of us have accomplished

1078
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
way more artistically than this guy.

1079
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And so I was trying to phrase that to him

1080
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
in a really soft way by being like,

1081
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
you know, you're more of a technical person.

1082
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You're not much of an aesthetics person.

1083
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You have to understand that aesthetics are also important.

1084
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
He's like, no, these are objective facts.

1085
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Like he said the word objective over and over again.

1086
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And Jesse clarified so many times,

1087
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
like dude, this is not an objective thing.

1088
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Like you can have your standard,

1089
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
but like obviously there are times

1090
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
when change of the aspect ratio

1091
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
might be a better way to go.

1092
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
All of us think of the stretching as better.

1093
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And I said, you realize this guy is a professional YouTuber

1094
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
to which this moderator said, and I quote,

1095
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
no, no, he's not.

1096
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Not by a long shot.

1097
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
All of those pauses were different sentences.

1098
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
See, he's making the word perfect.

1099
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
He's using some other definition or something.

1100
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Well, he literally did not understand

1101
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that Jesse is literally a fucking professional YouTuber.

1102
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah, because then he went into his Patreon

1103
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and was like, well, you're not making that much money.

1104
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And I pointed out, yes he is.

1105
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
This guy doesn't even do his stats right.

1106
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
He looked at Jesse's Patreon and saw the amount that he makes.

1107
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And then he looked at my Japanese Animes

1108
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and assumed that was the only channel.

1109
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So he was like 11 videos over the course of the year.

1110
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
That means you only made like $3,000.

1111
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And Jesse's like, huh.

1112
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
He has no idea what he's dealing with here.

1113
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
How about you quit it with the financial analysis?

1114
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Anyway, the point is, authorial intent,

1115
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Jesse wanted the stretch aspect ratio.

1116
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It was on purpose.

1117
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It wasn't because he didn't understand

1118
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
what was aesthetically appropriate.

1119
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
He fucking wanted that look.

1120
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And I think, personally, it looks better that way.

1121
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah.

1122
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I had no idea it was stretched.

1123
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I thought it was possible.

1124
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I hadn't even noticed either yet.

1125
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And this guy is like the worst example

1126
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
of when this philosophy goes awry.

1127
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Because this guy just insistently said,

1128
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
these are objective true standards

1129
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
based on my experience.

1130
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You don't have experience.

1131
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Making YouTube videos doesn't count.

1132
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Running AMV contests counts.

1133
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Not that he had won any, of course.

1134
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I mean, if he did, he should have brought it up.

1135
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
He specifically said that if he won some,

1136
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
that would be pretentious.

1137
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But just saying he was part of them isn't pretentious.

1138
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah, this guy's logic.

1139
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Look, this guy has a profession.

1140
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
No, that would give you fucking a reasonable reason

1141
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
to be saying the things you're saying.

1142
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Whatever, whatever.

1143
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
All right, let's get this up to another topic here.

1144
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I have to have a little bit of payoff to this story.

1145
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Just one sentence.

1146
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Okay.

1147
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I eventually basically indirectly called this guy a smug asshole

1148
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
because on the internet, you're allowed to be a smug asshole,

1149
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
but you're not allowed to call people a smug asshole.

1150
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So he banned me from R.A.V.A. for 30 days.

1151
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And then later on, I emailed him, I PMed him saying,

1152
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
you represent the worst ideas that I absolutely oppose.

1153
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Like your ideas are terrible.

1154
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah.

1155
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And so he permabanned me from R.A.V.A.

1156
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And so then I, in a genius move,

1157
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
permabanned him from R.The Procrastinators.

1158
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And he's on just a blast.

1159
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Got mutually assured destruction.

1160
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yes, just the way when we become super famous

1161
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and he'll want to get in on the huge TPC sensation,

1162
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
he won't be allowed and he'll wish that that day

1163
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
he had taken a different course of action.

1164
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It's like being banished from Athens, you know?

1165
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
There's no worse fate.

1166
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
There's nothing worse.

1167
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
All right.

1168
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Let me move into another thing.

1169
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So I've been saying all this shit about how authors

1170
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
totally intend to put all this stuff there.

1171
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And now I'm going to backpedal a little

1172
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and say that authorship, like the genius of it

1173
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
is not just having amazing ideas,

1174
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
but also being able to recognize when great shit

1175
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
just falls into your lap.

1176
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Sure.

1177
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Because like an amazing amount of my editing

1178
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
is serendipitous.

1179
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Like I just throw a clip into the editor

1180
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
and I'll happen to notice that there's like one scene

1181
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
that just happens to match up with what I'm saying

1182
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and then I base everything around that.

1183
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Like for instance, I did all these AMV compilations recently

1184
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and each one I would just like set up all the clips

1185
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
from the person and then I'd try to find a song

1186
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
that vaguely had the same tone as those clips

1187
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and then I'd put it in and then like there'd be little moments

1188
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
where the animation just so happens

1189
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
to coincide exactly with the music

1190
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and then I just time everything around that.

1191
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So like all the clips are just laid in in chronological order.

1192
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
There's no like advanced editing.

1193
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It just so happens that I was able to find songs

1194
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
that perfectly timed with certain moments.

1195
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So like it looks way more thoughtful than it really was

1196
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
just because I was able to recognize small,

1197
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
you know, match cuts and stuff like that.

1198
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So like, yeah, I think a big part of creativity

1199
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
is not just being a genius,

1200
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
but recognizing accidental genius

1201
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
and being able to tailor it to fit what you're doing.

1202
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It's a hard-knock life being a genius.

1203
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Didn't what you just said

1204
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
conflict with what you were saying before,

1205
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
you said before that it's basically impossible

1206
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
that a viewer can think more about a work

1207
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
than the creator did,

1208
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
but from what you just said, it seems like sometimes

1209
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
a creator can just kind of do something haphazardly

1210
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and just sort of have it work out, you know?

1211
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Well, he did say it was contradictory.

1212
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yeah, I think it's not necessarily that it's

1213
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
contradictory per se.

1214
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's just not a rule.

1215
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I think that as an author,

1216
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
your ability to recognize those things

1217
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and then make them work

1218
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
is also part of what is the skill set, you know?

1219
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Like the lines between intentional genius

1220
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
and just realizing something that's okay.

1221
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
The lines between coming up with a good idea

1222
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and realizing a good idea just fell into your lap,

1223
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
those lines are very blurred.

1224
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And by the way, you can't ignore that during

1225
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
the whole editing process,

1226
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
like there's tons of tiny adjustments being made,

1227
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
like you have the opportunity to remove

1228
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
or add something at any time.

1229
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So by the mere virtue that something is there,

1230
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
especially when you're doing something like editing,

1231
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
you decided not to remove it.

1232
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah, that is intent right there.

1233
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Well, I mean, you could have missed something.

1234
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
No, it's possible.

1235
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You could make mistakes or miss something in the editing process.

1236
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Or include something, you know,

1237
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
that other people see that you didn't so share.

1238
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Like, you know, I'm sure we've all heard the Bob Ross quote,

1239
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
like there are no mistakes, just happy accidents,

1240
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
where, you know, he'd fuck up a painting.

1241
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Which I absolutely do not agree with when it comes to editing,

1242
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
but okay.

1243
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Well, he would fuck up a painting

1244
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
and then he'd just turn it into a different painting.

1245
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Right, right.

1246
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I mean, obviously if you have,

1247
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
if you've already written a script

1248
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and you're trying to make a video

1249
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
that is an exact interpretation of that script

1250
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and you somehow fuck it up,

1251
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
then you're gonna probably just have to redo it,

1252
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
you know, but like, you can, a lot of the times,

1253
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
transform something into something else

1254
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
by way of, you know, the serendipitous nature of it,

1255
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
where you just kind of, you spilled,

1256
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
like Jesse Wood with his fucking man-child marsh.

1257
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It was just like his floor exploded,

1258
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
so he made a video out of it, you know.

1259
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Like, it's not that he creatively intended,

1260
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
hey, I'm gonna fill my room with water

1261
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and then fucking take all my toys and throw them in it.

1262
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It was like, the ground is capsized

1263
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
and shit water has come out.

1264
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I happen to have a bunch of pirate themed toys.

1265
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Let's film a pirate adventure, you know.

1266
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
And of course there's also plenty of skill involved

1267
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
in his comedic timing and being able to come up.

1268
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
He was able to know exactly,

1269
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
probably able to know how funny things

1270
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
are gonna look on the camera,

1271
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
how things are gonna look, you know,

1272
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
when it's all edited, he's able to prepare for that.

1273
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
The best endless Jess example is his fuck updates video,

1274
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
which was just him turning on the camera,

1275
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
pointing at his computer,

1276
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and then letting out an emotional reaction

1277
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
he was having at that exact moment.

1278
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And anyone could have done something like that

1279
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
if they had a camera on hand.

1280
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
But what people don't realize is any regular person,

1281
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
it wouldn't have been nearly as funny

1282
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
because he's trained himself to be able to do

1283
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
that kind of thing really well.

1284
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And as a result of people not realizing

1285
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
the level of skill involved in that,

1286
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
the bajillions of people have posted it on Facebook

1287
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and removed his channel name at the end

1288
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
because they just don't think it's art.

1289
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Because they just think it was an accident.

1290
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
One of the biggest reasons I watch all of Jesse's content,

1291
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
even when it's like Beer Quest,

1292
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
where he's just reviewing beer,

1293
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
is that he's so amazing at some random shit happening

1294
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and he turns it into part of the joke.

1295
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
In the latest Beer Quest episodes,

1296
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
there's parts where he'll just start spinning a beer

1297
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and then he just drops it and it breaks.

1298
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And then he doesn't ever just like,

1299
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
oh, I fucked up, I need to redo the video.

1300
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It's always like immediately, oh my god!

1301
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Now I've ruined Christmas!

1302
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
He turns it into a hilarious joke immediately

1303
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and the video just becomes a different work of art

1304
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
than what it was originally going to be,

1305
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
but he recognized it and transforms it into the new thing.

1306
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So yeah, he's fucking great at that.

1307
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And for me, that doesn't happen as much on camera and stuff

1308
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
because I'm not nearly as good at that kind of shit,

1309
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
but I do that a lot in the editing bay.

1310
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Almost all my editing is like,

1311
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I threw a clip-in, found a moment that kind of matched,

1312
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
and then based it around that and it just happens to work out.

1313
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So I guess, like, authorial intent,

1314
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
it could be like, you notice when stuff is good,

1315
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
when it just seems to happen, or you plan it,

1316
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
but nothing really matters until you make it public,

1317
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
until you present it.

1318
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Everything is just the process.

1319
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So I'm going back to Evangelion, which is, once again,

1320
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
a show that used its...

1321
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
like, it totally did art from adversity in a brilliant way

1322
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
because the first half of the show is very clearly

1323
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
everything they planned it to be.

1324
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
The first half is gorgeously animated,

1325
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
every shot is very well-considered,

1326
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
all the facial expressions, all the shot compositions,

1327
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
all of it's very clearly trying to communicate certain emotions.

1328
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And then the second half of the show is like,

1329
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
they completely ran out of money, the budget went off schedule,

1330
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
they had to change the script because of, like,

1331
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
sarin gas attacks and shit, all this bad stuff happened.

1332
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And so they went, alright, we can no longer do

1333
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
what we were doing before, what can we do now?

1334
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And so they created something that, while, like,

1335
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
you may or may not find it to be on the same level of quality

1336
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
as what they were doing before,

1337
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
but they very clearly created an artistic work

1338
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
with what they had, like, they made something

1339
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
that was so different and out there,

1340
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
that it's actually one of the most memorable things about the show.

1341
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah, and you know what, it does a bunch of different things

1342
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
in its production that probably would be not approved of

1343
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
by the professional industry.

1344
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
It's a good thing Neon Genesis' Ava Ngellion

1345
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
was not posted on our Ava, or else that moderator would have said,

1346
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
why is he holding, why is Shinji with the robot

1347
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
holding that guy, and why is it a still frame for eight whole seconds?

1348
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
There's no animation. That would be rejected.

1349
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1350
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Davoo has no chill! Davoo has no chill!

1351
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Why is Shinji just a pencil sketch flying across the screen?

1352
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
They didn't finish animating it.

1353
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
That wouldn't be accepted at any animation contest.

1354
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Holy shit.

1355
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Man, I was giving you shit, Davoo, for, like,

1356
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
obsessing over the sky and paying off.

1357
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Holy shit, it was so worth it.

1358
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So worth it.

1359
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
All right, I don't think I can add to that,

1360
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
and we are about an hour in, so...

1361
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That's a great place to add cap.

1362
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Any closing thoughts?

1363
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I think we've got a lot done today,

1364
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
like we do every day.

1365
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
But what are we going to do tonight, Ben?

1366
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I am going to give a shout out,

1367
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
because I said this in the intro before that we lost

1368
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
because of my fuck up,

1369
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
but I want to say thanks for Reverse Spectrum.

1370
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
You said you really like how I plug my Patreon

1371
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and you gave me Bastion.

1372
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I really appreciate both of those things.

1373
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I really love that your plugging yourself has become a staple.

1374
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Yeah, I got rewarded not for the thing I'm plugging,

1375
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
but for plugging.

1376
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's what he's a fan of.

1377
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
The plug was not the one that they wanted,

1378
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
but it was the one that they needed.

1379
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah.

1380
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah.

1381
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
All right, everybody.

1382
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
See you next week.

1383
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Bye.

1384
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Everyone say goodbye.

1385
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Bye.

1386
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Say goodbye.

1387
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And go and read my fucking thing at

1388
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
stcomics.com, or I'll kill you.

1389
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Yeah, intentionally.

1390
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Yeah.

1391
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
