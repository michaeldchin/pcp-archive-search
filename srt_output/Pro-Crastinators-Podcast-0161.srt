1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
What's up today guys? I'm not going to prolong this endeavor anymore because I'm trapped in

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,200
my father's wine cellar and listen it smells like wine down here which you would think would

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,520
be nice but after about 10 years it starts getting a little bit freaky. So I'm calling

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,520
for help. Is that Hippocrit on the other line? Hello, what is the nature of your emergency

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
or whatever? I'm trapped inside a wine cellar but I can record one more podcast before my

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,920
father comes in with a belt. What podcast should we record? Let's record a PCP. Okay, great.

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,240
Alright, we're going to pick people like a football coach in high school. I picked Tom

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,480
to be on the PCP. Oh fuck, I'm here on the final episode of the PCP. I'm so fucking stoked

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:06,080
to watch Munchy get destroyed. No, I picked Mage for the PCP. As tradition I get picked

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:14,440
last. Oh, it's true. It's funny because it's true. It's apt though. It's totally apt. Hey

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:22,720
by the way guys, wait, hold on. Head count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5 equals none. Wait a second,

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,520
guys. Ground quick and beat with our feet. Open up, fall into a chasm. A chasm full of

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,960
beauty. There's no, or been here. There's no need or been here. Oh, you know what that

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
means? You know what that means? Tom, what does that mean? Tom, what does that mean?

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,120
Tom, what does that mean? It means there's going to be no bullshit politics on this episode

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:49,320
of the PCP. It's literally impossible. Guys, I'm going to be real with you right now. Every

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,760
single day we record the PCP, I think myself, what topics can I bring up? There are like

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,440
one or two or three topics I think to bring up and I think myself, nah, the PCP sucks.

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,000
It's going to be political shit. I'm going to save this for RFCK. But there's no chance

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,860
of that. This PCP has no chance of being bad. I'm breaking it out. I'm breaking out the

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
good topics.

22
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Oh, okay, okay.

23
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
All right, all right. Finally, a good discussion.

24
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,980
I have one thing to say before you get into the good topics though. As of you listening

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:25,180
to this audience member, Balejap Finale is out and is on the APSAdventures.site. Go watch

26
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,720
it, go read it. Balejap is done. I did it. It's not out for the members of the PCP to

27
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,660
watch and listen to and react to right now. Unfortunately, I was hoping to get it done

28
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:43,860
by now. But you will be able to see it. So links on the screen and in the description

29
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,380
to my thing, my big thing.

30
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,780
Yeah, his big dick that is whipping around on the internet.

31
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,780
Yeah, okay, hippo. That's like really cool though. You know, you're like, oh, jail, paper,

32
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
automation.

33
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,540
Can we please talk about the thing that was released on my channel that is not viewable

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,000
by the PCP members, but will be the time that the viewers are listening. And that's the

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,280
first episode of the Teen CP. Yes, that's right. The Teen CP. It's actually happened.

36
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,040
It was a nine man podcast that was recorded. It will be released on my channel. And truly,

37
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,960
it was sublime. If you lie, if you were a fan of the Charismat character that is the

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Teen CP from these voicemail series, then you will just fucking just quiver and quake

39
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,620
and your asshole will break by the time you listen to that fucking podcast. So look forward

40
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,780
to that. And I look forward to that. I mean, look forward in the past backwards because

41
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,580
you can click on the link in the description right now. Go click on jail, babe. And like,

42
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,180
you know, cry because it's, you know, jail, babe. And then click on the Teen CP and cry

43
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,100
because it's on the heart of the Teen CP. You keep saying jail, babe. It's bail, jaype.

44
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,180
It's a jaype. I say, I say jail, babe, every single fucking time, literally like in text

45
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,120
and in conversation. Is it like a mistake? Is it a mistake or is it just like, oh, well,

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:12,440
you know, no. I'm on every man. Okay, guys, here's what's happening right now. As Tom

47
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,920
said before the podcast, but you guys didn't hear because you don't have long enough ears.

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,520
I am in Boston, Massachusetts right now. Boston, Massachusetts. Do do knock on wood. There

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,420
I did it. What was supposed to happen? Don't know. Anyway, I'm here right now. And I'm

50
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,700
in the vicinity of Tom in like a 25 square meter. So we're going to meet the hell up.

51
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,340
And I've already meeting up with Ben. Tom wasn't there because he's in a wheelchair.

52
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,020
He's wheelchair bound. We're going to get like an actual wheelchair for you and then

53
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,500
push you around the time. It's going to happen. Dude, I can't wait. I'll just be the brand

54
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,900
of the PCP. I'll do nothing, but I'll be king by the end. It's going to happen yesterday.

55
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,440
Like a week ago, by the time the viewers are hearing this, I was with Ben and Kazi and

56
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,960
every time we like saw someone that was incapacitated in any way, like they were stumbling or like

57
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,960
they were in a wheelchair. We cropped to the ground laughing up fucking awesome.

58
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,560
As you should. No. Well, no, we pointed and said that's Tom and then dropped the four

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:21,600
lines. But there's so many. This trip to Boston is a truly sentimental one because this is

60
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:30,060
the last time I will ever be in this city as a tourist. This is the last time I will

61
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,260
ever not live here. I don't know if I said this on the PCP. I'm sure I did, but I probably

62
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,900
just got in and got right out and then like, you know, I went to the building, planted the

63
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,660
bomb and then just ran away as fast as I could, you know, as you do. But yeah, I'm in college,

64
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,340
fully enrolled, fully put down everything that I need to, not even like a maybe like,

65
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
you know, like, oh, you know, probably going to happen. Like, no, really going to happen.

66
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,280
So you got accepted.

67
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,000
A guy, dude, I got accepted. I put down my down payment. I have my room. I have my room

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
assignments. I have fucking everything.

69
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
That's fucking legendary, dude. Congrats.

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,360
I know what it what is. Oh, I guess, September is probably when you start.

71
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Of course. So I'm here for another week and then I'm going to be leaving. And then the next

72
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,260
time I set foot in these fair aisles, I shall be a resident. I shall be a legal resident.

73
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,380
Do you know what you should definitely do is at college in your class, you should get as many

74
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,420
people to join RFCK as possible.

75
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,980
Oh, dude. Okay.

76
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,300
And then and then like when you do like a live RFCK, RFCK, like, calm, you'll have like a

77
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,860
hundred thousands of people will be already in Boston to do it.

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,880
Oh, okay, no doubt.

79
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,120
There are going. Oh, no, God.

80
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,320
Oh, no, we were off to such a good.

81
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,960
All right, guys, you don't pack it at the good topics are coming back into the bag.

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,200
Sorry, guys, I'm going to have to leave now.

83
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,240
No, no.

84
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,680
Oh, he's he's he's he's deaf in himself.

85
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Ben St. Ben St. came into the call.

86
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,400
And by the way, I believe in Paul, please play the sound that plays when you meet

87
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:19,220
and or if not, every no time, but anyway, just to finish that, I don't even know what the

88
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,020
fuck I was talking about.

89
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,140
But in college schemes, schemes to get people on to play in this war in college.

90
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,340
I really thought about it.

91
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:32,860
I am going to it basically completely shift my life around in a pretty major way and sort

92
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,100
of like fully dedicate myself to college or at least at the very least, that's the plan

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
currently. Of course.

94
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,640
And yeah, and I am going to go as hog while that's possibly came doing curricular and

95
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,960
extracurricular activities and try and do clubs and all that sort of stuff like that.

96
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,040
Get the most bang for my buck.

97
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,120
And part of that, I assume there will be some sort of, you know, video game development club.

98
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,160
If there's not, I'll literally just make one of my own because, you know, fucking are you joking

99
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,480
me? Fucking art college is not going to be able to make video games.

100
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
Yeah, yeah. Disgusting, unacceptable.

101
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,220
Yes, fucking moron.

102
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,220
Ben was talking here, but wasn't recording his audio yet because he's a moron.

103
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,220
But that's usually because my microphone sucks.

104
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,220
And also I hate you.

105
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,220
There he goes.

106
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Just just kick him.

107
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
Somebody kick him.

108
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
Just get him out of here.

109
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,220
But by the way, I really hope that he wasn't recording thinking that we hadn't started

110
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,200
the show yet. And now, now no one will be able to understand why we laughed.

111
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I really hope that was the case.

112
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
By the way, audience, um, love you.

113
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay.

114
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Anyway, back to what we were saying, uh, I am going to shill endless war so, so, so fucking

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,200
hard in whatever game development or even just to anyone that I fucking know, I'll

116
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
swear an endless war t-shirt that has a link to the discord on it.

117
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
But rest assured, I'm going to be shilling.

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
You're going to be the most powerful person in college because everyone else is going

119
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
to be like, uh, yeah.

120
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I just came from my parent's house.

121
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm ready to, to learn the ways of like anatomy and drawing and stuff.

122
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
And you'd be like, I'm already a seasoned game designer.

123
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I have a video game.

124
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I have a huge audience.

125
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I make tons of money.

126
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Yeah.

127
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I'm like teaching you guys.

128
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm teaching the classes now.

129
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Dude.

130
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Okay.

131
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
There is.

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Okay.

133
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
When you got accepted to college, they, there was an email sent to you saying directing

134
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,200
you to the Facebook group of the college being like, Hey, come on and mingle with some

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
of the new bingles.

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
And then I thought, well, I'm a bingle.

137
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Might as well mingle.

138
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
And then I mosey dawned over and then I pose on Beauvard.

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,200
And I got into the, uh, Facebook and it was really uncomfortable and strange to actually

140
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
post on, on Facebook.

141
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Brush assured the other zoomers there thought so as well.

142
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,200
And so they made a discord group and I entered a discord, a discord group for all of the

143
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,200
freshmen that are attending and also know what discord is, I guess.

144
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,200
And it was a really interesting experience to be able to, you know, like, like, like actually

145
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
like have like prolonged conversations with people from the school.

146
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Cause obviously I'm no stranger to the school.

147
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
I've been there on multiple occasions, been all over the campus.

148
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
No, no, a lot about it.

149
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,200
And been to one or two social functions in there, you know, not major things, but I've

150
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
been to some, uh, some fucking hangout sessions with some of the people there.

151
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
And, uh, they were nice.

152
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,200
And one of the reasons I wanted to attend was that I thought that I could gel well with

153
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
the people there.

154
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,200
But I had not had, you know, prolonged conversations in a, in a, in a, in a discord like chat experience.

155
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,200
And so I was able to, the first time after receiving that blink, click that link, I said

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
to myself and then did so.

157
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Uh, and entering the chat was, I think my first experience would be it was, was something

158
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,200
to the effect of like, wow, I like these people will be so fun to lead.

159
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,200
You know, like it was like, it was like walking into like a orphanage, thinking myself like,

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,200
wow, I'll be like the best like executor of commands that anyone could possibly be ever

161
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
where it's like, they were all nice people, but you could tell they were all a little

162
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
bit insecure.

163
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
So I know that I'm going to be able to use that to my advantage and get them to do like,

164
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
not like, you know, like evil things for me, but we're going to be able to like make like

165
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
cities.

166
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Like we shall make like, in Minecraft.

167
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Yeah.

168
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
In Minecraft.

169
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
We're going to be able to fucking achieve any goals with me at their helm.

170
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Me as their benevolent dictator overlord.

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I will be able to lead the, uh, are you going to go in like, like first day in the pizza

172
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
jumpsuit?

173
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Yeah.

174
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Why not?

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
I think that's, that's, that's a good way to establish dominance.

176
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
You know?

177
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh, for sure.

178
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Dude, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to wear the pizza jumpsuit because fucking, you know,

179
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Yeah.

180
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
YOLO, bro.

181
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
YOLO.

182
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,200
It's, I, I, in, in the, in the initial Facebook group, there was, it was customary to make

183
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,700
a post like saying like, Hey guys, it's me, you know, check out me, Teehee.

184
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
And then I did so as well.

185
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,040
And all the photos that I sent to word, they were all from anime expo.

186
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,200
And there was me and my pizza, uh, my pizza onesie nearly next to a, uh, power box that

187
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
had picture of an aunt on it doing a peace sign.

188
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Then it was me with Digi and Nate doing the Neko Neko, uh, like, like anime pause with

189
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
all the cat girl maids and those were the images.

190
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I saw that image recently.

191
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
The one closest to you looks very disturbed.

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Uh, that's going to be the entirety of my college.

193
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
How long do you think it's going to be for somebody who's going to be like, Oh my God,

194
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Monchi, you know Digi, bro.

195
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Um, I think it's due.

196
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Uh, my Kazi goes to the school I'm going to and she by proxy already gets people to

197
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
be in like, you know, someone who knows Digi bro.

198
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
So, uh, it's going to be.

199
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,200
She's like, yeah, I know myself, you fucking idiot.

200
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I've met Digi bro.

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Oh yeah.

202
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I forgot about that.

203
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Worlds, worlds colliding.

204
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Did you, were you recording last time?

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Of course not.

206
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Of course not.

207
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Of course not.

208
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,200
You know what Ben?

209
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
You know what Ben?

210
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Fuck you.

211
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
No, no, no.

212
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Don't you start up this here.

213
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
No.

214
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Then I have the power to kick you.

215
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Oh, she does.

216
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
She's the she's the dude.

217
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Do that and look like the biggest piece of shit.

218
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Go right ahead.

219
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I could.

220
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
I know.

221
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I could.

222
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I could.

223
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Damn, please.

224
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Above us all.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
What are we taught?

226
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
What are we talking about?

227
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
What are we?

228
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What have I missed so far?

229
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
We're talking about college.

230
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
We're talking.

231
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
We're talking about.

232
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
We're talking about how it's been.

233
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
You and Ben aren't here.

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
So now we are free to do as we please.

235
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Me and Nate, you know, just confuse me and Nate.

236
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
No, you said you and Ben.

237
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
You said you and Ben, yeah, obliterated.

238
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Same for Tex and logic.

239
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Um college sucks.

240
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah.

241
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, we know.

242
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Yeah, yeah, we know. But, right, new topic, video games.

243
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Video games suck.

244
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:16,200
This is a video game-related topic. I've been working tirelessly, like, for weeks, for months on Balejape.

245
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,200
I am, like, so close, as in, like, it will be out by the time you're... I mean, I already said that already.

246
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,200
And I've got, like, a few panels left, and it will probably be out by the end of today, even.

247
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:36,200
But I have been so fucking... I want to play a video game so hard.

248
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Every day, I'm, like, I'm looking at my DS, even. I'm looking at my 3DS. I'm looking at my consoles.

249
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I even bought a Nintendo 64 on a whim, just so I could have another game console.

250
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I could look at it and be like, hey, that's old.

251
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,200
So you can be, like, one of those video game review men on YouTube with a wall of consoles.

252
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah, I could, I could, like, be like that.

253
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
And I look at my video games on the shelf and I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

254
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:12,200
It hurts so much not being able, like, not even Minecraft, not even, like, anything. I've just been working.

255
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
I've gone insane.

256
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
That's good. That's good work.

257
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:24,200
But I want to say that during my time animating and drawing for so long, playing games is a good escape.

258
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,200
You can't, you can't just give up sleep because you'll just burn yourself out. That's stupid.

259
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
You can't give up entertainment entirely.

260
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
No.

261
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,200
So I have sort of quit, like, failed the YouTube challenge that I started in the beginning of the year.

262
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Where now I am, like, on my off-screen, off-monitor, watching videos basically all the time because I'm always basically drawing.

263
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,200
So it's like, I failed, you know, it sucks. I got, like, about three months into that.

264
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,200
And then I just sort of gave up because it was, yeah.

265
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,200
I mean, if you're just, if you're just listening to them off-tab while you're working, does that really count?

266
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Well, it definitely still counts.

267
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:19,200
It definitely still counts. It's just sort of like, it was, it was easier for me to, to rationalize it when I was animating because so much of that is, like,

268
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,200
you can just sort of, like, tune out the, the thing. It just needs some sort of sound.

269
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Wait.

270
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I listened to music for a while.

271
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,200
But wasn't the whole point of doing it in the first place to prevent you from procrastinating and not doing, like, productive things with your time?

272
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,200
It, that was the point. And, and, and that's why I sort of was okay with quitting it. I might pick it up again later.

273
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Well, that's what I was going to say. Is it's not necessarily bad if you actually are working while you're doing it.

274
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:55,200
The trap for me is that I'll say, I'll start watching a video and work while I have it on. And then that's not what happens.

275
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Yeah, but that's the thing. So sometimes it does, it does distract me. And I've noticed this and I'm like, yeah, this is, this is,

276
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:09,200
it's not as bad as it used to be, but it's still distracting. It's still here. And I'm still letting myself be distracted on occasion.

277
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Are you distracted in like, you just start listening to the audio and not doing the work, or do you just tab over and start watching the video?

278
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Well, I've been watching a lot of like T90, like streams of Age of Empires 2 competitive scene stuff.

279
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:30,200
So like, every so often, he goes, oh my God, the quick wall or whatever he says, like the terminology.

280
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,200
And I'm like, whoa, I want to see that thing. And I click over and look at it. You'd be like, yeah, yeah, that was, that was very exciting.

281
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
And then I go back to work. But like, um...

282
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Is this video game lust different than normal?

283
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Different than normal lust?

284
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I don't know what it is. I think, I think I'm just in like a nostalgic feeling.

285
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Like a lot of things are just reminding me of like, oh yeah, I want to play that game.

286
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I think it's because like during Hippocrite, every time I was thinking, oh, I should play that game from my childhood,

287
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,200
for the reason of like making a video about it and you know, getting views and subscribers and money and stuff.

288
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:22,200
And so the prospect of playing a game would be to sit down, play it properly, take notes, do all the, you know, record the footage.

289
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:31,200
It will be a big hassle. And I did that for a while and I ended up like not caring about video games by the end of like when I stopped doing the Hippocrite stuff.

290
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:39,200
But now that I, that's never like, is not a thing anymore. I just, I can feel the lust of gaming again.

291
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I think that's what it is.

292
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:50,200
You know, that kind of rolls into something that I've experienced the last couple of days because I've been playing nothing but like Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne.

293
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I've been marathoning all of them back to back, put like 200, 300 hours into those games over the past couple of weeks.

294
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:08,200
And just yesterday, I think it came in, I ordered the Analog Mega SG, which is like a HD version of a Sega Genesis.

295
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:18,200
They like remade it. So it's not emulation. It's like real hardware that like re-engineered all the hardware and made it so it outputs to 1080p so it can work with HD TVs and like not be shit.

296
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,200
So I got that because I wanted to start playing Sega again because I'm making a Sega game essentially.

297
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Exactly.

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
That's the one.

299
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
That's the very same.

300
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
That's the one. The only Sega. The only one that ever existed. The rest don't, aren't real.

301
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,200
So I wanted to get into those games again to kind of like get me inspired and like be like okay this is how these games kind of work.

302
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
This is what the visuals look like. This is like some gameplay mechanics I could learn from.

303
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,200
And it was interesting because I played like Bloodborne especially because that's my favorite one I've played so far.

304
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,200
And I just did nothing else. Like I just got up, played Bloodborne, went to bed and like for like a week. It was bad.

305
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,200
But with Sega games they're like so much simpler that like I'll just play them for like a half an hour.

306
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,200
I'm like I'm good because like they're not immersive and like soul consuming.

307
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,200
They're just like simple little games that like you can't get sucked into.

308
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,200
And it's interesting that way. So I'm like playing Sega. I'll just play it for like 20 minutes.

309
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm like I'm good. I got my inspiration. I can go back and do work now.

310
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Back in the day the games were built around the idea of you die a lot and therefore in order to see more you can pay money in the arcade and stuff.

311
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,200
And so they brought that to home consoles with that design philosophy.

312
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,200
But now a lot of it is how can we keep you staying here and you know just repeating the same tasks every day over and over again.

313
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,200
With like daily quests and mobile games or that sort of keeps you coming back rather than putting a quarter in the thing.

314
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I want to quickly say. Do you guys like this whole topic reminded me of back when I had my very first Xbox.

315
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Like I only had one Xbox but it was like the first Xbox.

316
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,200
And on one of the games it had like previews of other games and you could play them for free the demos.

317
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:09,200
And it was kind of like such a weird thing because it was only like that was the only time I actually had like a game that had other games on it.

318
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
That you can sort of play a little bit as demos that that's like was that a thing.

319
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Was that like a thing. I think there were like demos like demos on console like on your console.

320
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh like some some early Xbox games did do that.

321
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Like there you buy a lot of first party Microsoft titles.

322
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I think that they have options to play like demos of other games they had published because they were trying to get people into like the Xbox ecosystem.

323
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I don't think PlayStation really did that much.

324
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,200
PlayStation had the official PlayStation magazine and every month that came with a demo disk.

325
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
So that's just like kind of a big game.

326
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Is that PMX 2 or PSM 2 or whatever it was called.

327
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Oh god.

328
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,200
PMS 2 bigger, faster, bloodier.

329
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
The reckoning.

330
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I know in America it was OPM the official PlayStation magazine.

331
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
OPM you know they're addictive.

332
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Yeah it was very addictive because that's where I first played Shinobi my favorite PS2 game.

333
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I think that I'm broken.

334
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:20,200
For some reason I don't even think it's tied to like productivity or you know maturing or anything to that effect.

335
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:33,200
But I've just lost all will to play video games and it makes me feel kind of weird because it's not as though I don't want to play video games in the sense that I don't like them.

336
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
It's just that I have no like.

337
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
You're broken get a factor of reset.

338
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,200
You should try to enter the gungeon if you like nuclear thrown.

339
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
No that's not it.

340
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Well I'm just saying that I'm saying that because I feel that way sometimes but then other times I will like.

341
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Yeah everyone I'll stumble across a game and that'll engage me for a while and I'll play a lot of it.

342
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,200
So I'm just saying like you know I think you and I have kind of similar taste in some games.

343
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
We do.

344
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
So like that's.

345
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Sometimes.

346
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah.

347
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,200
I mean I know I feel like this is this is something that I mean has happened to me probably will happen to you.

348
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,200
You're going through it right now is where like you used to like you know have so much free time as a younger person.

349
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
You can play a game for an entire day.

350
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I used to play World of Warcraft a lot during the summer.

351
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Just all the time and I would get so much XPs.

352
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,200
What a true unembarrassment of XPs.

353
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Yeah.

354
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:40,200
But like after you know after I started having responsibilities and school wasn't a chore it was like a choice.

355
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I was doing things because I wanted to learn or wanted to get better at things.

356
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:56,200
I had realized that there were certain things that I just want to work towards and the time for gaming was like a couple hours every so often and then it just sort of became like you know less and less.

357
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Now most of the time where I play games is only when I really feel like it and that's not every day.

358
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I mean right now it is but like yeah like I used to go every day playing at least one game at a certain amount of time and now I can go a week without like picking up a thing.

359
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:21,200
My media consumption has really just been twisted in terrible ways where it's not that I don't think video games are worth my time.

360
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:31,200
It's just that I've really been funneled into YouTube right where it's right there on my desktop so so close within reach.

361
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,200
I always have tabs open on a Firefox and working Google Drive or something.

362
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Just click that little plus type.

363
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Click that little bell to get notifications every time I upload a new video.

364
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Get notifications and you're fucking every five seconds you're going in.

365
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,200
You're a fucking fool and like comment and subscribe.

366
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Share this video with all your friends.

367
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Share it on social media and video games and movies and all that sort of stuff that I want to watch.

368
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:08,200
But it's just even just locating movies online even if I have to torrent or you can even go to some free illegal screen site.

369
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,200
It's so much easier to do YouTube which is really a problem and I've limited my YouTube usage.

370
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Funnily enough while you're getting off the YouTube challenge I'm tying it not to the point where you did where it was like you know no YouTube ever because I realized that that just would like I wouldn't be able to do that so why even.

371
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Munchy the way you were describing feeling about video games is a way that I felt for a long time about movies like I have.

372
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I feel like movies ever since I was born I barely ever watched movies I have no I have no desire to like seek out movies to watch I hardly even know how I would do it.

373
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:54,200
And I feel that way in spite of the fact that logically I know that there is a Netflix subscription like directly down the stairs from where I'm sitting right now that I have free access to.

374
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
But I'm just like why would I ever do that.

375
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
What's the what's my motivation.

376
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,200
I think I did watch Fury Road a couple weeks ago which was pretty great but I'm like OK I watched a movie for the first time in like 20 years.

377
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,200
I think that's good for another 20.

378
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:18,200
I know that I would like to recommend them before and then I know that you know or you know whatever I watch a YouTube video as soon as I thought wow that would be good.

379
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,200
And I think just in like just in concept watching art as an artist is pretty valuable to broaden your artistic.

380
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
It is.

381
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,200
You know Mary Weather messaged me to give me his hot take on the whole pro Jared thing the other day.

382
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:42,200
And he like sort of after we talked about that he was he recommended me a manga and I was like man I should I should you know you know I don't know you know maybe I'll check out this man.

383
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,200
But in particular I should just I should read more manga as you get back into reading manga.

384
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I should consume more media that isn't dudes on YouTube talking about other media because like what the what the fuck is that.

385
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
We should we should continue watching that anime.

386
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
We should mage I've been waiting to say this.

387
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

388
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I think I think I when you see the thing about kicking me I took it as sincere and I'm pretty sure it was a joke.

389
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:14,200
The thing is I did I like directly rolled out of bed and like hit and like turned on discord to get in here and I don't think I was thinking properly.

390
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I responded inappropriate.

391
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,200
OK I've been waiting to say that for like 20 minutes.

392
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
I appreciate it but it's it's fine.

393
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I thought you were just doing the meme that we did on the quick quick draw.

394
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Yeah.

395
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
The quick draw screen.

396
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,200
No the quick subscribe to quick draw everybody.

397
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
No I was just legitimately grouchy because I just woke up.

398
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Can I say that real quick just in the middle here.

399
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,200
People are like where's the draw cast but like if you liked the draw cast then you would fucking.

400
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Oh sure.

401
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Fucking yeah yeah the draw cast has mutated and and split off like a like a tumor like a brain tumor exploding out of ones.

402
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Out of ones head cavity.

403
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,200
You know like they like to do like like like a numeral to.

404
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Yeah like a to like a T. O. O. M. E. R.

405
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Split off into its own organism and is now the channel known as quick draw and there's what like four of them out now.

406
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Yeah.

407
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Hell yeah like that fucking link.

408
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
It's good.

409
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,200
I think all of us are in Tom hasn't appeared on episode yet but you can.

410
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,200
No yeah no definitely.

411
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
He isn't.

412
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
He doesn't do fucking 2D art.

413
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
He's too good.

414
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Hey guys.

415
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Me.

416
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
My name's Tom.

417
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Okay.

418
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Now I don't know how viable this is but what if Tom just did like a 3D model in the time that the rest of us were doing a 2D.

419
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Like like a super low that would show us like a super low poly obviously like I'm sure it would be really hard.

420
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Tom question is how do you do you think it was like how viable do you think is the idea of creating a 3D model.

421
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Of a thing in like 15 minutes.

422
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Is that even possible.

423
00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:00,200
It would depend on what you're drawing like a human character probably not because you have to like model it then you have to rig it then you have to texture it.

424
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,200
What what if we were like what okay hypothetical what if it was like.

425
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Okay last episode of the quick draw we revisited the idea from the draw cast of limited color palette and it was great.

426
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
My palette was the best.

427
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,200
What if we were what if we were like hey.

428
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Hey here's a color palette make any model you want and use this color palette for it in 15 minutes.

429
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Now I don't know anything about 3D modeling so I haven't yeah.

430
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,200
I mean at least for me it would not be enough time like I can draw I can still do drawing and be on quick.

431
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:42,200
I know I know I know I'm just thinking like what what if like what if some fucking weirdo like Tom were to come in here and in blender or whatever and do some some out there nonsense.

432
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Just blend something together.

433
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,200
We have fruit is the topic though but so been so I'm sorry but you're gonna have to leave now you've been voted out.

434
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Yeah well.

435
00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:00,200
No I'm gonna I'm gonna reply I'm gonna I'm gonna reply as though you're sincere but this time I'm gonna be sad instead of mad.

436
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:07,200
You know and on the topic of broadening horizons and seeing yes please lots of different types of art.

437
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:16,200
I've also been feeling like YouTube is like generally just sort of sludge just sort of like grimy sludge that's you know it smells.

438
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Well it's like it's like that it's like that you wouldn't want to live there but we all do.

439
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,200
It's like that debut video about how YouTube is the stomach acid.

440
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Some yeah stomach.

441
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Yeah.

442
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Good.

443
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Good.

444
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Davoo is good.

445
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Classic.

446
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
I agree.

447
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
I've been I've been having the same.

448
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Where's the last couple days and like I've been thinking more and more about like really wanting to make that website.

449
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,200
I keep talking about where it's like it's like a YouTube but you can only everyone can only upload one video a week and that's it.

450
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
I hear.

451
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
There was this one.

452
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
I want to do that.

453
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I want that to be a real site.

454
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:02,200
There was this one thing that I watched a Digi video and in the background I think it was a let's argue and there was a bunch of like a manga volume.

455
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Like really small low low resolution in the backgrounds floating past him.

456
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I saw one that was like how hang on.

457
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I think that girl looks pretty cute.

458
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Pause.

459
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,200
You know cut that image out.

460
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Search by image.

461
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I went on a journey to try and find this manga because you know I don't read that many manga.

462
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,200
I read One Piece and Bleach and Naruto are both over.

463
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Dragon Ball Z is not really a thing.

464
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,200
One Piece is the only manga I see.

465
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,200
So I was like if this is good then this will be a really funny way to have found it.

466
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
So I searched by image.

467
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I found the cover.

468
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
It's kind of obscure.

469
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I forgot the name of it honestly because it turns out the girl was cute and the guy is a good artist but the manga was shit.

470
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
It was boring and stupid.

471
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
What was the premise?

472
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,200
I just liked that journey of like discovering something just because it's sort of like difficult to do.

473
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Like rather than getting a recommendation from someone just like hmm.

474
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Yeah you just like you found it yourself essentially.

475
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
You're like this looks interesting.

476
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
No one told me it was interesting.

477
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
I want to know the premise now.

478
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:22,200
It was there was a girl who had like someone she loved fell from a tree and this guy was like I'm going to cut down this tree.

479
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,200
And she was like huh don't do that fuck you.

480
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,200
And then it's like a romance between those two characters.

481
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Wait between between her and the guy who wants to cut down the tree.

482
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
It was a boy.

483
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
It was a young boy who's like fuck this tree.

484
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
I hate this tree.

485
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,200
And you know it's obviously going to be like a romance between the two of them.

486
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,200
But then some weird like angel magical stuff came up and it was just sort of like that's not really cool.

487
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
That's kind of lame.

488
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
That's sort of like bad writing.

489
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
That's like zero out of ten.

490
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
What is gamathrone.

491
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,200
And she doesn't want to cut down the tree because someone she loved fell out of it and died I presume.

492
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Well it was someone fell and broke their legs and couldn't walk.

493
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,200
But if the tree wasn't there they would have fallen to their death sort of thing.

494
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
I don't remember.

495
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
I don't remember it very closely.

496
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
I was just sort of skimming it was like this.

497
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I mean it was very obscure that the scan lations I saw were like so low resolution.

498
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
It was very hard to see a lot of detail.

499
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:35,200
You know when like a manga is like it's online and it's so like grainy that it's certain lines are like cut out because of the low resolution like thin lines are sort of like dots.

500
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
The old days.

501
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
The struggle.

502
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Yeah.

503
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,200
So it was but the girl was a good girl.

504
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
It just I like that design.

505
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,200
I really do feel like it's been a disservice to me like as a person.

506
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:58,200
I feel like I'm not as edified as I should be because I am so like cut off from media traditional media.

507
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
I guess I would call even though that's not really true.

508
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,200
I just mean like non regurgitated non stomach acid media which is the bulk of what I listen to.

509
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,200
But I am fixing that and I would notice what they say conquered it in any way.

510
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:23,200
But you know when you start a new thing and you can feel in the bowels of your bowels that you know that this is a good idea and like you know stick with this and good things will happen.

511
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
I made a big change in my life.

512
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,200
I've downloaded an application.

513
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:41,200
I want to just say to everyone in this group and in the audience something that you need to hear because we've all heard free will doesn't exist.

514
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
So here's the true red pill.

515
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Self control doesn't exist.

516
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,200
It doesn't matter if you want to do something and if you say to yourself I'm going to make a change in my life.

517
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm just I'm just going to you know I'm just going to go to the gym and then you stop thinking about it.

518
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
That you nothing will ever be accomplished.

519
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,200
If you think to yourself I'm just going to rely on my self control.

520
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Self control doesn't exist.

521
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
You are an animal.

522
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
You're a beast.

523
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,200
You need a harness to able to be able to control your rage if left to your own devices.

524
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:25,200
No matter what I don't care if you're the fucking president you will turn into a carnivorous beast if left to your own devices.

525
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:37,200
You need to create a cage that is just comfortable enough around you to not you know you know chafe but just tied up to not allow you to be the depraved monster that you know that you are.

526
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,200
So instead of just you know being like guys you know what this is all cool and well.

527
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm going to stop watching YouTube and I'm going to get you know in on some more traditional meat.

528
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
I'm going to play some games.

529
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I'm going to watch some movies that will not happen because why would I I haven't changed anything about my life.

530
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,200
I've not changed the system under which I operate and if the system isn't changed.

531
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,200
Why would I expect a different outcome when I execute the program that is my life change that fucking code and what code am I changing.

532
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I've downloaded a program called cold turkey and it's an app blocker that literally forbids me from opening YouTube and will not allow me to.

533
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I hear you all clicking to fucking go Google.

534
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,200
It will not allow me to watch YouTube videos or various other things such as discord.

535
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,200
I have scheduled blocks under which like from like sleeping time literally it locks me out of my computer.

536
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,200
This is hardcore shit I'm dealing with right now.

537
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,200
I've seen that I was looking for similar things because I wanted to block discord for the first like 19 hours of the day.

538
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,200
So that I only jump on at the end to just like talk when I'm tired with friends and stuff.

539
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:55,200
But that fucking turkey thing you got to pay for it and as soon as money was involved.

540
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
I was like oh shit.

541
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,200
You recommended me another like timer app.

542
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
God what was it called.

543
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
The thing about like tracking how yeah.

544
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Toggle.

545
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
You don't have to pay for that.

546
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Yeah you fucking do.

547
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I went to the website and it wasn't free.

548
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
No you don't.

549
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
The mobile app is free right now.

550
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,200
That's the one that's like you can like put in how much time you spend on things right.

551
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Yeah.

552
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Yeah.

553
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm using it for free.

554
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
You're just a freak.

555
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
You're a freak.

556
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
I'm not.

557
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
No I'm normal.

558
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
I'm normal.

559
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
No.

560
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
You're a freak.

561
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
There's one thing about toggle.

562
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Like section here.

563
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
I'm sure you can get a pro version.

564
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Yeah you can get a premium thing.

565
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Like enterprise is custom pricing premium and starter.

566
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
None of them are free.

567
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
I don't fucking understand.

568
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Maybe it's only free on the mobile app.

569
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
No I have it on desktop.

570
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
You're used to freak dude.

571
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Playing simple.

572
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,200
It knows it knows it and it won't let you download it.

573
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Yeah.

574
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
All right.

575
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
I guess I wouldn't either if I were toggle.

576
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
One thing about toggle.

577
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
I tried.

578
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I got daily own toggle the day you mentioned those.

579
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Yes.

580
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I was pretty good like 22 23 days in a row.

581
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I remember 55 days dude.

582
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,200
So you know I've been doing that that prompts me at the when I turn on my phone like how

583
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
was your day.

584
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
It's like oh yeah.

585
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
It was good.

586
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,200
It's been good most days sometimes it's rare.

587
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
But toggle.

588
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,200
I tried for like a week and then I stopped using it because a lot of the time you know

589
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,480
you press a button it starts a timer you press the button again and that is like a chunk

590
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,400
of time that you have logged while you're doing something.

591
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,400
So when I would draw I would press the button draw and then when I feel like a needed breaker

592
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,520
press the button again and then at the end of the day I can see how many hours I'm spending

593
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,880
on certain things.

594
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
That's good.

595
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,480
It's just when I get distracted by certain things it's I don't remember because I'm being

596
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,760
distracted I don't remember to press the button and then the data started to become

597
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,480
all over the place like hours of hours of like oh I wasn't animating for those extra

598
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
hours.

599
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I think I was doing something else.

600
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Ah shit.

601
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Ah shit.

602
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
I said.

603
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,200
And then I just sort of fell out of using it because it's it's it's too it's it's sort

604
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,960
of I can't really get gleaned too much from it.

605
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,240
The only thing that it's good for really is the idea that there is a timing thing going

606
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,040
on during work so that you're less likely to be distracted sort of like having a boss

607
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,480
over you like tapping his wrist like you better get this certain amount of hours in like

608
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,680
the only the only real benefit is the side benefit the main benefit doesn't work.

609
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
I get it.

610
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,000
I disagree and I think that the problem that you're putting forward is actually a feature

611
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,560
and one thing that I quite like about it I think there's so many minor transition costs

612
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,320
when you do what I do draw for a little bit make a few lines go back to YouTube click

613
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,840
on YouTube video watch for a couple seconds then go back to drawing the switching back

614
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,960
and forth between those apps obviously the clicking time is nothing but your brain just

615
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,120
focusing in on the drawing like oh fuck what was it doing our coding like oh fuck where

616
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:11,240
was I what was I doing milliseconds right but those add up and I think that just I mean

617
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,560
they are distractions YouTube videos and you know whatever podcast anything else that could

618
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,660
theoretically be in that position is a distraction and therefore detrimental to you being as

619
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,560
productive as you possibly could be.

620
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:30,080
So yeah you're right the data will be skewed so don't do it unhealthy behavior it's try

621
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:35,520
it's an active disincentive to do something that is bad and that I don't think is a good

622
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,200
thing so my click on that timer I think myself okay I know what I have to do I'm going to

623
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,720
work for whatever in many hours that I think is appropriate and I won't do anything else

624
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,160
because one thing that goes hand in hand with the cold turkey thing which is a you know I

625
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,640
can schedule out blocks is that I have clear working times and I have clear you know leisure

626
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,000
times and so I think myself okay I'm gonna be working for this long I'm gonna you know

627
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,800
start a timer I'm going to work and I'm not gonna be distracted because I know I will have

628
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,720
time to goof off soon so why be distracted now just get my work done I do it I clock

629
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,840
out and it's fucking primo dude it's fucking projudo wrap that shit in mozzarella and

630
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:27,080
eat that literally delicious it's fucking basil straight up straight up basil bro straight

631
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,320
up basil on a t-shirt cook on spain hey it's funny cuz like cuz like you know most people

632
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,440
like go to work and have a real job and it does that automatically you have work time

633
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,560
and relax time but we have to like do that ourselves I I don't know guys like for me

634
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,560
I have to have something in the background to work I can't work without the noise so hold on

635
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:55,240
yeah there are podcasts and music I think are well worth my time this isn't like a time to close

636
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,920
myself off in a cave like you know I have to be fully dedicated my work no brainpower can be

637
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,320
allocated there are many podcasts which are not two dudes talking about fucking nothing that I think

638
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:13,120
are extremely beneficial to my being to my core that I think honorically edify me and I think

639
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,920
it's important and fun for me listen to and there are tons of audiobooks I can listen to and just

640
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,120
tons and tons of music how often do I listen to music fucking never besides when I'm working how much

641
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:32,200
do I love music quite a bit so it really it's not that I'm I'm trying it's it's again it's I'm

642
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:38,400
making a cage for myself that is not chafe it merely restrains myself and makes me more disciplined

643
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,240
okay it's fantastic for me that's not what I was saying okay okay I'm just saying like I need the

644
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,960
noise to work like I can what I do is I find a playlist of something I don't particularly care

645
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,760
about but just interested just enough to sort of like tune in every now and then but it's not

646
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,520
something important or worthy that I have to pay attention properly for instance I've been so you

647
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,120
guys know though the people who like read out reddit posts and stuff like yeah yeah our whoosh or

648
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:17,800
our slash that happened so I I just find one of them and they upload like daily I go to play all

649
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,560
the videos and I just like have that playlist going in the background and I don't have to switch

650
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,120
between the videos is just constant noise and I don't particularly need to like I just I take in a

651
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,680
little bit just enough to get the context and and I'm drawing and I'm focusing on my drawing for the

652
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,880
most part I just I get I get just enough of that noise to keep me going and from getting irritated

653
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,360
because I get irritated when there's no noise and I can't focus on my work and then I just end up

654
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:50,960
browsing for forever trying to find something to listen to because I just cannot work on other days

655
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,000
if I if I find like find that like a really good song that's like really catchy or something like

656
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,320
that and I just put that song on loop for fucking five hours that one song on loop and while I'm

657
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,840
drawing because it just gives me that inspiration to draw and keep going and I just I have to and

658
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,440
like if I if I switch to a different song it changes the mood because you know different songs

659
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,240
different moods different feelings behind it but I need that one specific song so I have that song

660
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:27,320
on loop and that's how I work and I cannot work without the noise yeah I you know I think I feel

661
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,800
like if there's like a podcast that is truly edifying like super important and you really love

662
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,880
listening to it that would be way more of a distraction than something like a game grumps

663
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,080
playlist that you've heard like eight times already yeah exactly like something to know to dull the

664
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,240
brain like what was that thing that Japanese thing the bamboo that goes up and down with the

665
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:55,600
water feature oh yeah like the sound of running water is supposed to be calming and it's just

666
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:03,040
supposed to create like noise I think it's calming because it's just sort of you know a background

667
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:11,040
stuff like noise to to fill in so that you're not like noticing small sounds and thinking about what

668
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,840
they could be or you're not noticing your own bodily movement sounds it's just sort of like your

669
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,280
ears get to turn off while this noise plays well so you can focus more on the things that you're

670
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,240
looking at I don't disagree that white noise is valuable nor do I think that people shouldn't use

671
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,880
it and mage if you feel like you are not distracted by YouTube videos well that's fine I do that and

672
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,480
that's why I'm working to solve yeah yeah it has to be certain kind of content because if it's

673
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,680
something I'm generally interested in and want to listen to yeah I'm gonna get distracted by you

674
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:51,640
because I want to focus on that but if it's something I can just sort of like it's not important

675
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,240
it's kind of like trash but at the same time I'm vaguely interested it's just like ha ha it's a

676
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,840
funny sort of story but it's not mandatory for me to listen to it's not something important then I

677
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:08,720
can just have it in the background and not really see my brain works really weird where that there

678
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,680
are certain tasks I can do with background noise like if I'm drawing I'll usually have music or

679
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,080
something on in the background just to kind of keep part of my brain occupied while I'm doing this

680
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:26,040
but if I'm reading anything if I'm writing anything or if I'm or if anytime something gets really

681
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,480
difficult like if I'm doing like coding stuff for my game whatever and like I've run into a problem

682
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,120
all that has to immediately be turned off I need a hundred percent of my brain on this topic yeah

683
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,200
can't if I'm absorb any of it if I'm writing dialogue or sketching and coming up with poses I

684
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,560
can't listen to anything if I'm inking I can listen to something because it's a little more

685
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:55,000
mindless if I'm if I'm yeah if I am editing a video or something that requires more a lot more

686
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,480
focus I probably have to turn it on especially if I'm editing a video you have to listen to audio

687
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,640
them but yeah I need to turn that shit off but let's talk about let's talk about Twitter

688
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:16,080
hippo okay hippo I see here's my ego I see this red man comic I got into some internet drama

689
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,840
recently I said some guy was dumb I didn't need to say it but I said it anyway I guess I'm the

690
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:30,720
dumb one is this about me weeks ago I have like a stockpile of red man oh I say it's not okay I

691
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:42,840
read that I was ready to fight no I wouldn't I don't necessarily think you getting into Twitter

692
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:48,960
arguments is a bad thing I think it's kind of funny yeah and you clearly enjoy some of it yeah I do

693
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,800
but it you know I say generally arguing is exhausting and you get a little tired after a

694
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,640
while I mean like with the Mahler thing the other day like I got a little tired of answering to

695
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,840
like these fucking randos but I felt like obligated to explain myself when I thought they said

696
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,200
something that was like oh I can actually see how you might have a misinterpret I don't know

697
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,840
they're all mostly just fucking dumb idiots who were just like Mahler's smart and you're stupid

698
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,640
for you're not agreeing with him why do you think he's wrong haha you're the one who just thinks

699
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,760
he's wrong with no explanation like ah god damn it so that was terrible I don't know people

700
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,920
been criticizing me people say they hate my tweets they hate my Twitter people on follow me

701
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,800
because because I have opinions and because I don't just post something sarcastic with like a I

702
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,960
don't know a fucking shitty photo edit because that's what people want on Twitter I guess I don't

703
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,200
like that I like getting mad at people when they're stupid and I'm not gonna apologize for that

704
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:52,400
constructive conversation to be fair say what Tom Twitter can be difficult to have like a

705
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,840
constructive conversation yeah if there were no I could have made a much better explanation of

706
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:04,240
what my point was if well no one would read it to it longer I could have made a much more clear

707
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:10,640
explanation of what I was arguing about if yeah without the character limit but I mean you know

708
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,680
that's just the nature of it I think the I think the character limit is one aspect of it I feel

709
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,520
like a lot of it is just um reading everything in order is impossible like I heard that you were

710
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,000
having a thing with Mahler and I know what Mahler is so I was like oh I wonder if this is interesting

711
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,360
I couldn't follow any of it I tried like click through and through to understand what so wait who's

712
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:37,840
who's the where where does it go yeah to understand what I was talking about you would have had to

713
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:43,760
kind of follow the like the thread of the of the of his conversation with Lindsay Ellis like back a

714
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,520
couple posts to like see what he had been saying it's like that that's the sort of stuff that causes

715
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:56,320
people to come into half of one aspect of the conversation yeah see something out of context

716
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:03,120
essentially and react to it on its own and then it's like a like a high like a like a Richard

717
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:10,160
hive of scum and villainy and misinterpretations and like you know just people easily getting angry

718
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:18,480
at stuff um which is why it seems like a stupid place to do it but I don't know that's why you should

719
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:25,760
it's surprising me to shitpost it's it's surprising to me how little twitter not being my life at

720
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,320
hall has affected me I would think since I use it so often that I would there would be like a big

721
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,720
like gaping twitter a hole in my heart but it's been pretty quickly eaten up by youtube and just

722
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:43,040
work in general or just other things and so I haven't been on twitter in like probably literal months

723
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:50,080
literally I only have the quick draw twitter as my set login for every device because I use it so

724
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,600
little it's the only thing that I need to use it for and so I have no idea what this debate is like

725
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:02,320
who mawler is and what is even happening in it uh but I know that I don't want to know there's just

726
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,520
a well I'm gonna I'm just I'm gonna educate you anyway mawler is just a fucking intellectual

727
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,680
jackass that's all you need to know that's oh I hate you know he's an anti intellectual he made

728
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,600
he made like a like a eight part I don't remember the number of parts but like uh it totalled like

729
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:27,680
19 hours uh video series deconstructing hbomber guy's defense of dark souls 2 in excruciating

730
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:35,120
detail and I watched that because it was like he has a pretty good voice he talks in depth about

731
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:41,120
everything so it's like well he talks in he talks in depth in the sense that he like he specifically

732
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,560
points out every tiny thing that's why he makes like four hour long videos criticizing two hour

733
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,000
long movies yeah it's it's essentially like a reaction video but he reacts to every sentence

734
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,280
and every word I know that guy I'm yeah yeah oh my god every every single guy on youtube yeah

735
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:04,480
that that's the guy no wait hold on actually I just okay I I know who mawler is not by name but

736
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:12,160
because my friend showed me him a couple weeks ago and and and he said it like like he put on

737
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:18,960
mawler on his fucking ps4 on the tv and he said just watch a little bit of this and and and uh and

738
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,520
tell me what uh what the k like like what this is so I put on for like two minutes and I couldn't

739
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,240
like understand like what the point was yeah and then I clicked for me but there is no point

740
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:39,360
he's recapping the movie see frame by frame yeah yeah isn't that what like my little pony

741
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:45,520
people used to do I mean yeah the reaction community whatever whatever you would call it

742
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:52,480
like the idea of taking a video it's I think it's spawned like a near around the brony fandom

743
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,840
but the idea of like reacting to a video by usually youtube video by just like pausing what

744
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,800
they were saying saying well that's stupid continuing the video and then pausing against like

745
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,920
huh well that's also stupid you're pretty stupid huh and they would do that and get like into big

746
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,880
dramas disputes and it's just it's really good for drama it's really good for views yeah and people

747
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,280
started doing it about movies and games and all sorts of really just cranks that algorithm

748
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:23,360
um I mean I don't even necessarily hate it all the time because it's not it's not like everybody

749
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,160
who does that is immediately wrong about what this is that in and of itself very is not like

750
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,480
offensively it sounds like the everything wrong with uh sort of series that people are a little

751
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:39,200
bit yeah a little bit like that basically it's it's it's everything wrong with someone said this on

752
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:45,040
twitter and I agree it's like Mahler is basically everything wrong with if instead of each sin taking

753
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:51,200
like five seconds he talked about each one for like 12 minutes uh and there's no ding and there's no

754
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:58,480
ding oh but the dings though oh god I love that dings are so funny how how will how will I know

755
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:08,640
there is a mistake roll credits roll credits um god awful awful do you guys we we all hate

756
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,880
cinema sins right that's not a hot take right okay oh no that's not a hot take at all there's like

757
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,920
there's a whole community around videos about why cinema sins is not good and they're all I love

758
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,160
those videos I love that I watched a few um yeah there's there's one in particular by the guy who

759
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,440
does the everything wrong with everything wrong with well yeah he was his his one his breakdown

760
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,640
is really good um well so I don't know the thing I don't like about Mahler is like that he makes

761
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,880
those videos that's kind of dumb but the really bad thing is I mean you guys know that he claims

762
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,480
that his his criticism is objective like he said he literally says that and he says that everyone

763
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,480
else's is unobjective subjective and he thinks that the way to be objective in your criticism

764
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,400
is just to not read any subtext into anything and only point out objectively true things like plot

765
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:04,400
holes yeah this is a little strange the thing is though I don't I don't I don't know what quote

766
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,560
that like that information comes from he said it a bunch of times I swear well I mean I don't yeah

767
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:19,040
I mean sure I'm sure he has it's just sort of like there's a lot of a lot of uh yeah what would you

768
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:25,600
call it anger I guess about like um certain internet people for being having stupid ideas about stuff

769
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,560
yeah um it it just comes from a place of like lack of charity I can't think of charity

770
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,200
what like maybe he's you know he said that right yeah pretty dumb multiple times in multiple

771
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,160
contexts okay I'm not saying he didn't say that I'm not saying he doesn't believe it okay I'm just saying

772
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:51,200
why is that even a bad thing he's just a guy doing a stuff what hold on why is it a bad thing I mean

773
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:59,600
like hundreds of thousands of people watch his videos and agree with them but how is that so bad

774
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:08,560
because he's wrong do you know no not to me a lot of people can be wrong without even knowing it

775
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,960
all right here's my hot take here's my searing hot take uh people can be wrong some of the time and

776
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,480
write some of the time and people can be right some of the time and wrong some of the time when

777
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:26,080
people are wrong is it not is it not acceptable I'm not defending him I I just I'm just using that as

778
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:33,520
a branching of point for that that hot take because I feel like yeah it's you say one wrong thing and

779
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,600
then everything else you said is but it's not but it's not just someone said a wrong thing it's

780
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:46,640
someone says someone repeatedly says a wrong thing and hundreds of thousand people say yeah I think

781
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:53,840
that too is that not a problem I mean depends on what they're talking about is it just movies and

782
00:56:53,840 --> 00:57:02,560
stuff uh basically yeah I mean it's it has a potential to be like if they're taking his word

783
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:08,720
as gospel so if he starts saying something more malicious uh like kill all the cats in the world

784
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,840
and it was like yeah fuck yeah you know then that's the problem I mean yeah yeah objective objectively

785
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:19,840
you know cats are bad we have to destroy cats oh you know objectively that's true and objectively

786
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:27,360
I agree no stop you know that that would be bad but it's like I think this movie sucks and everyone's

787
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:33,120
like yeah that movie sucks just like that's not good it's not it's not just that a movie sucks it's

788
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:40,240
a whole way of thinking that is like bizarre and and and like just misguided yeah I mean like you're

789
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,600
free to argue with these people if you think they're wrong that's you know that's what he does yeah

790
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,440
yeah you're so I'm not I'm not against uh you arguing with the people it's just like it's a

791
00:57:51,440 --> 00:58:00,560
more matter of who cares when I see someone who when I see people that just have like bad logic

792
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:05,680
and are just arguing it's I'm sorry it happened unlike a totally like what happened fucked up

793
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:13,760
logical basis I want I want to be like hey let me point out why this is bad what well there's

794
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,600
just some like movie guy right the thing is the thing is as long as you're bitching about movies I

795
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,760
don't really care I mean he doesn't he doesn't really get into politics I mean I'm pretty sure

796
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,280
he's sympathetic to like the whole like anti SJW thing but that's not I mean in some of his reviews

797
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,480
like in the in the Captain Marvel it kind of I don't know you can kind of feel it in the way he

798
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,880
talks about certain things but he's not like explicitly being like no let me take this bit

799
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,520
to talk about why Trump isn't as bad as everyone says he is he's not doing like that or anything

800
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:48,800
uh I all right I feel like the general idea that a certain you know large people a large

801
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:58,960
number of people are thinking in a damaging way is it's sort of I don't know I think I'd rather

802
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,320
like look at it from like an observational perspective rather than thinking oh no these this

803
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:10,480
guy is um you know making all these people think this different way I feel like it's

804
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,400
all these people resonate with this way of thinking yeah and I just like I wonder why that

805
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,280
like I don't think this guy is contributing to anything in particular I feel like a lot of people

806
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,600
maybe watch cinema sins and then they think I'm gonna grow up and now I'm 12 and now I will

807
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:31,200
watch maula because it's the same thing but a little more edgy I guess I have no opinion on

808
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:37,200
this topic specifically as defined just now but I have something that's very adjacent to it I don't

809
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:44,160
want to switch off just yet respectful but but I will say that I don't know what I was gonna say

810
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,320
never mind fuck you okay take that out take take take what I just said don't take it out

811
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,920
don't take anything out leave it all in reverb it echo echo it and reverb it like munchies

812
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,800
and making a grandiose speech the rule like oh wow I have like to try and put music in the

813
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:05,680
background I like I like I like having an editor he he he can do all the things we can be like hey

814
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:12,800
hey hey hey editor hello did you say did you guys see maybe you didn't on twitter

815
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:19,440
oblivion falls uh video of him asking asking rebel taxi wears the podcast yes it was fucking

816
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,360
great yeah I didn't watch all of it because I assumed the crowd wouldn't get it and it would

817
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:28,480
be very awkward yeah I mean well that's kind of the point like of course they're not gonna know

818
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,720
what he's talking about and I'm like are they just having fun with the memeing or or like

819
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,200
where the pcp fans because there were a lot of people who seem to have yeah laughed there there

820
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,240
were there were a surprising number of people who's acted as though they like knew the context

821
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,560
yeah I was I was that was the part of a surprised about I thought you just kind of

822
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,480
get was gonna get weird stairs sitting back down but there were some people like high five and I'm

823
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,320
like yeah dude that's what I that's what I would have assumed too but no there were people that

824
01:00:54,320 --> 01:01:01,360
were like yeah where is the podcast bro uh if if you were at that thing and you heard oblivion

825
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:08,720
falls say that comment below and say yes I'm both a rebel taxi congo and a pcp fan it's at uh

826
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:15,760
momo con I think how do you justify being both at the same time where's the loyal oblivion fall was

827
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,800
on um I'm not sure what the panel was but I was talking to him last night and he said he was on uh

828
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,440
he was on some panel at I assume momo con I'm pretty that's the one that's going on right now

829
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,480
right and uh I know yeah he's I remember what I was gonna say I was gonna say that you I don't

830
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,240
think there's anything wrong with like fighting for what you believe in the sense that you know

831
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,880
Ben you want to debate about you know this guy being wrong I agree with you yeah it's pretty

832
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:46,000
shit point pretty shit brain and you should probably take it to the toilet yeah but uh aside

833
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,160
from that which is fucking boring and who cares the real shit is uh what you said the beginning

834
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:58,720
hippo of people are just like really fucking like down like no charity there's no like you know

835
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:06,640
you fucking you you someone says something kind of wrong fucking obliterated gone forever now and

836
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,480
the problem is that now like what like what do you mean like oh kids these days people these days

837
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,560
are so ready I know I mean after making a bad after making a mistake it seems like when when

838
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:25,840
people make a bad point they become a bad person and I think it should like we should focus on

839
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:31,200
talking about ideas not people like if you have a bad idea shit on the bad idea all you want well

840
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,000
but don't hold the person you said I would I would have demonize everything I would have I would

841
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,280
have done that I'm just talking in like a general okay but let me just use my example is I would

842
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:48,960
have done that except that the people who jumped in to uh disagree with me didn't at least for a

843
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,480
while until I pointed it out like they weren't jumping in to be like here's why I think Molly's

844
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:59,280
argument was a good one or here's why I think this idea is a good one it was like they were jumping

845
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,960
in to be like look at this idiot who disagrees with Mahler and that was like end of thought I mean

846
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:10,720
you're always going to have fucking yeah like that you know that's just I'm sure we have sheeple

847
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:16,160
who would do that too it's just it's inevitable maybe I do it's it's the essentially a smug enemy

848
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,120
face they posted I don't even know if it comes from like someone literally responded was basically

849
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:27,440
just a pepe and like basically nothing else and I was like uh I love point taken

850
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,200
me and you've been we're talking about this sort of yesterday talking about like winning debates

851
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,840
I feel like that sort of like no charity stems from that sort of thing where it's like you want to

852
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:44,000
be right right you know you want to show that you are smart and deserving of an apple uh and so you

853
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:50,720
own it up are trying to be like dude so wait you're saying this like that's pretty unrealistic

854
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,520
and then and then and then and then they go ding roll credits and uh you get zinged on

855
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:02,240
fucking twitter and uh so you want to retaliate and say that they are a monster or a retard well

856
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,200
I feel like an apple can I get an apple please yeah I don't yeah yeah yeah hot hot take I don't

857
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,960
particularly like apples they're okay some of them are okay an apple and some some some are better

858
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,400
than others but in general apples are a pretty mediocre tear they're like a sea tear fruit like

859
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,080
secret tip for whenever you get into that situation if you ever say something that people have an

860
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,880
issue with and someone responds like angrily trying to like catch you in a gotcha moment you just have

861
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,240
to lean into it like because the the way that I tend to do these things and it seems to work like

862
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,040
90 of the time if someone like comes at you and is trying to be like trying to catch you in a loop

863
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:46,240
just respond very uh uh like genuinely like someone's like man that's fucking retarded you're an

864
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,800
idiot blah blah I'd be like okay uh how so like tell me and I'll just like you just start like a

865
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,280
normal friendly conversation like they're here like they're here to fight and you respond with like

866
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:01,040
well let's talk about it yeah and that 90 of the time it just turns into a normal discussion at

867
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,600
that point yeah because they're being listened to not challenged and then you can come to a

868
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,600
mutual understanding and then it just totally avoids the whole problem and if they're there to

869
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:14,400
argue in bad faith like they'll lose steam because like suddenly they can't do what they what they

870
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:21,120
wanted to do yeah I was a big fan of of digi's um everyone I forget what it was called did you

871
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:27,200
bro verse everybody digi bro versus everybody because it it sort of shone a light on that sort of

872
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,640
you know comment that people would leave they'd say hey fuck you you suck and then when he's like

873
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:41,040
well why do I suck and they're like well you know uh they just they wouldn't have anything really

874
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:47,360
specific they maybe would have like one thing like you said um you said this thing and like uh

875
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:53,200
and they would just look stupid and it was great I've actually had like a few a few comments I don't

876
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,560
remember who has PCP comments or just my on my videos like when people like said something mean

877
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,680
about me and I responded and they like immediately took it back and I'm like it's okay it's just I

878
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,200
think people sometimes forget that there's another person behind the screen and it's like so so they

879
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:15,760
just a lot yeah and so you just have to remind them sometimes it's it's not like hey I'm here

880
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:21,840
it's not like um anyone is like better than anyone else with regards to this because I feel

881
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,840
a little angry at certain faceless commenters when they make me upset and I like I don't respond

882
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:33,520
but I'm seething yeah but really they're just a person like if I knew them if I could see them

883
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,440
my way of doing I would like to be I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt

884
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,280
most of the time is what I think yeah my way of doing online discourse usually boils down to

885
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,520
when I have to respond to the way I just mentioned and then if I'm like on the other side like if I

886
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:52,320
feel like I want to like score a point on somebody instead of like going in very aggressively I try

887
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,760
and just like genuinely ask a question and give them an opportunity to restate the answer because

888
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,080
like when I make an assumption like that what I try and do is be like okay what they're saying to me

889
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:08,400
sounds retarded so instead of going in and being like you're retarded I'm like I want to give them

890
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,440
another chance to restate it to be like like basically asking for clarification because maybe

891
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,080
I like to try and assume I'm interpreting it wrong so I'll give yeah I try and like comment

892
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,000
sometimes or like respond to a tweet be like and give them a chance to rephrase it to make

893
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,320
sure I'm understanding it correctly and then try and usually ask a question from that to kind of

894
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:33,680
get to the nitty gritty of whatever the issue is I don't know I just I'm always more interested in

895
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,160
having a legitimate conversation even with people who blatantly disagree with me because I think

896
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:44,320
that's just not just more valuable but you'll get to a better answer I mean yeah it's it's very

897
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:49,680
gratifying when somebody who was giving you shit and then you actually do that because I don't

898
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,760
often do it sometimes I mean I don't get that much shit because I don't do that much stuff but

899
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,080
when it has happened and I do approach them like asking why and get the clarification it makes me

900
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,960
feel better to know that they don't actually they're not actually out to get me that much it was just

901
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,360
a little thing it's like well you know what that's just a fundamental disagreement you push back

902
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,680
you're both gonna leave mad but if you actually kind of like engage in a conversation you can

903
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,080
leave satisfied and that's way better for both parties

904
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,120
if only you could do things fucking swell and things fucking rosy cheeks and

905
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,120
again I feel like the idea of winning a debate is so

906
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:35,280
vile and disgusting well I feel like it's almost like a perversion of the idea the platonic ideal

907
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:41,280
of a debate explanation point debate obviously it's fun to put on your fucking war paint and you

908
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:47,040
know go out with your fellow labels to attack some other shithead labels and make them feel bad for

909
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:53,120
being labels and and then you know you can retire and it'll be a fun time for everyone involved

910
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:59,200
except your ruining culture and also I hate you and you're just breeding with just a truly like

911
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:05,440
fucking there's nothing in the world I hate more than just fucking circle jerking tribalism

912
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:10,720
where it's you know you go into a debate for the sole purpose of of going and like chuckling

913
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,680
into your friends being like man fuck this guy dude I'm gonna fucking tag on my twitter and say

914
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,440
something mean dude well in this well all right in this uh in this attention economy that we got

915
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,520
gone right like the purpose of the debate like from a practicals perspective you're right the

916
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:32,400
platonic ideal of a debate is that two people enter with opposing of views and and logic to

917
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:38,480
back it up and they argue their points one person leaves and they argue their points and in the end

918
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,760
we like we reveal the truth right we all we all like collectively arrive at truth through like

919
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:48,400
arguing different points but but the but the practical not even truth but just you know agree

920
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:53,280
over and saying to both of the arguments and maybe you could decide but but but the practical

921
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:58,400
reality is that the reason people are engaging in debates in platforms like youtube and politics

922
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:05,360
and stuff is not for that reason it's because doing so gets you attention and brings attention to

923
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:11,760
your viewpoint and generally speaking you're not going to convince anyone of well like you're not

924
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,840
going to convince anyone of your point if they already disagree with you well you're here you're

925
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,880
here to introduce people that maybe don't know haven't heard your side of the debate you're here to

926
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:26,400
like let them hear it for the first time this is why it's like you know you put up a you put up a

927
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,600
oh like evolution versus creationism right oh teach the controversy let's have a debate

928
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,320
your no no that's a bad example it's not a bad example but better example flat earth you put up

929
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,400
like like here's why i think the earth is flat here's why i think the earth is round you put

930
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,680
them both up there and they debate the winner in this scenario is the flat earth there because

931
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,560
if people are debating this idea as though it's like two sides of the same coin it's platforming

932
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,120
the idea as though it's like on equal footing with the round earth's idea and now like even

933
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:59,440
though 90 percent of people 99 percent of people are gonna hear them be like well this guy's obviously

934
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,840
crazy there's gonna be a few people who maybe have never heard the idea before maybe they're like oh

935
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,320
this is interesting maybe they're convinced by some of his logic maybe they get on board that's

936
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:13,920
that's that's what it's for it's to reach that new audience you disagree well wait wait hold on

937
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,320
what do you disagree with exactly i'm just i literally don't know i just i just i i still

938
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:28,720
think like even stupid ideas should be debated because like we don't know what's stupid like like

939
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:34,480
in this situation yeah like flat earth sounds pretty stupid and i i really don't think they're right

940
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:40,160
but like who gets to decide what's stupid and what's wrong okay okay let me let me take like an

941
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:45,920
individualist look at this hypothetical scenario you are say you're a guy you're a scientist maybe

942
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,520
you're like a famous scientist or something or you're a little bit famous you're a little bit

943
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,200
known you're respected you have the opportunity someone is like hey i believe that the earth is flat

944
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:01,440
let me debate you in like a broad sense i guess it would be wrong like to say like this guy is not

945
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,080
allowed to say that like the earth is flat he is allowed to say the earth is flat but if i'm this

946
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:11,520
scientist and some guy challenges me to the bit this debate i would net i would never say yeah

947
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,880
let's have this debate because i don't want to dignify that position with respect it's not worth

948
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,680
and it honestly makes me look it makes me look bad to engage with that idea

949
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,840
thing though here's the the other side of that coin because like ben your your point of saying like

950
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:34,080
by giving this these certain topics a platform that legitimizes them the flip side of that is that

951
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:39,360
if you're someone in a position of authority who should be easily able to dismiss a ridiculous

952
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:44,400
claim like this and you refuse to do so on the grounds that you don't want to give it a platform

953
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,520
you're also giving everybody who might be on the fence about it like well the scientists can't

954
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,600
defend it maybe that just makes them look more legitimate like they don't have a way to defend

955
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:59,440
it so so like both of them like no matter what happens you're gonna lose ground to stupid people

956
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,840
because they're just stupid people everywhere i don't think i don't think that's necessarily true

957
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:11,120
in every case i think when it comes to certain topics where like the person is easily reachable

958
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:15,600
and it would be like if they don't respond it's pretty obvious that they are deliberately

959
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:22,880
not responding then there's that aspect of it but if it's like you know you don't uh some scientist

960
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:30,800
has a paper written and you know a youtube commenter says hey scientist like you or like a twitter guy

961
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,320
it's like uh debate me like him ignoring that twitter user isn't necessarily going to give

962
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:42,960
that guy a lot of clout but if he writes a paper and he asks the guy to you know or peer review it

963
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,800
or like to to you know think about what this says read it please and then he still dismisses it on

964
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,000
the face of what's on the title then it's different then it's like you're you're you're deliberately

965
01:13:54,720 --> 01:14:00,160
halting this potential thing and that's bad and that's seen as bad i wanted to say like like you

966
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:05,920
don't have to debate absolutely everyone who comes your way with a stupid idea it's it's not your

967
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,360
job so to speak to do that however like if you are trying to be an authority about

968
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:19,040
certain knowledge you should be able to also defend your position against legit like rivals you know

969
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:25,360
lately the people so people would understand your position as well because like not like you're not

970
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,280
born with the knowledge of science and that the earth is round you learn it from other people

971
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,800
and if some people are a bit skeptical about it i think it's like if you're a scientist who

972
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:40,480
you know believes and wants people to believe it you should be able to at least make a video in

973
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:46,800
responses like be like hey this is why earth is round this is the science behind it you know

974
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,720
well this reminds me of like people like evolution or a creationist being like science class should

975
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:57,040
teach the controversy right like like they're like oh well they're not gonna they're not gonna

976
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:03,120
teach they're teaching evolution in schools that's terrible okay how about this teach that some people

977
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:09,840
believe in evolution other people believe in creation and the answer yeah and the answer to

978
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:15,200
that is no because one of those is science and should be taught in science class and the other

979
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:20,640
isn't the other is yeah like the yeah the difference is because one can be scientifically

980
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:29,040
observed whereas the other not so i am on the side that can't be observed scientifically so i don't

981
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,640
know if you're if you're the scientist and someone's coming you and trying to argue the earth is flat

982
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:40,000
but like they're i mean their arguments are not i mean they might be like sort of dressed up in a

983
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,520
scientific way but like i don't know i wouldn't i wouldn't do it unless someone had like maybe

984
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:52,240
someone had like a really compelling argument that like was convincing people was like pretty like

985
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,720
scientific if someone's just got like a bunch of pseudoscientific nonsense that they're going

986
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:01,680
around arguing and i don't know i don't think it's worth debating it like if there's nothing to if

987
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:06,000
there's nothing to debate i guess what i'm saying is there needs to be some like meat to the argument

988
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,480
to make it like worth you know having the debate in the first place and i just don't think there is

989
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:18,480
any meat to like a flatter if this is a argument something sort of like pick on someone your own

990
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:26,400
size uh like the debate means more if the disparity between the people debating is very large you

991
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:35,120
know uh you know fucking i don't know Neil deGrasse Tyson arguing with uh me uh with munchie wears

992
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:42,160
tiny hats like two youtubers with very different subcats like um that would be like whoa you know

993
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:48,240
like you obviously the the the lesser viewed party would get a lot of views you know in whatever

994
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:53,600
context that is not not necessarily on social media could be just clout or like on the news or

995
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:58,640
whatever it is it's basically just if you're the smaller guy you'll get more you know so like i agree

996
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:07,440
with with ben on that that you shouldn't necessarily give people anybody um you know uh a platform

997
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:13,760
just to share to share the platform with you if you're so much bigger but if there's a guy who is

998
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:20,880
like um become on the level of a Neil deGrasse Tyson in in so much that he has uh a lot of people

999
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:26,320
backing him and he's kind of you know he can't ignore that then a debate is warranted and i think

1000
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:31,520
you should like i don't know it when the when the sizes are about the same size it's fair enough

1001
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,960
you should recognize that if you've got an audience if you've got an audience and you agree to a debate

1002
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,640
with someone of an opposing viewpoint like you should basically do that with the understanding

1003
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:47,200
that like no matter what happens you're doing them a big favor even even if you like quote

1004
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,680
unquote win the debate you've done them a huge favor just by having it in the first place and do

1005
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:59,040
and do you want to do that i think i think it's just choose your battles wisely sort of a sure sure

1006
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:08,720
sure yeah any good advice talk about a very nice topic colors okay let's talk about colors let's

1007
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:13,840
talk about sonic colors hold on hold on i just want to quickly because before the podcast started

1008
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,160
and you weren't there i wanted to say i wanted to rant a little bit about colors okay yesterday

1009
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:24,000
when i went to bed around uh who knows when i i i had this thought just like what's up with people

1010
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:31,680
having favorite colors says the person who is devoted you know i i think i know what you mean

1011
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:37,520
but go on yeah it's just it's just so odd i mean i can understand sort of like people having a

1012
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:43,200
favorite flavor or something like that because it's a it's a way to sort of um it's kind of beneficial

1013
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:48,560
to you especially like if you if you can tell if the food is properly cooked and whatnot or whatever

1014
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:54,640
or like if you'd need a little bit of salt and you like taste is different but like um then like

1015
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:00,080
you see colors and like there's like no reason to like one color over the other but people do

1016
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:06,960
and for me personally just owning something in purple like gives like a plus 20 points to happiness

1017
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,880
as opposed to as opposed to owning something exactly the same but not purple and i don't

1018
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:20,720
understand why but i i would argue that that is the same as flavor and taste um because it's i mean

1019
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:26,240
you know aside from like the i love the taste of raw meat that will kill me like that's bad

1020
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:32,960
but like you know people have lots of favorite flavors you don't just eat one thing and i feel like

1021
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,920
you know your colors can you know you have a multiple favorite colors

1022
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:45,120
looking at the same color your whole life will get tiring i think uh even for you purple things

1023
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,960
give you happiness because a lot of things are not purple and you see them all the time

1024
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,480
and and it makes it a special thing to have a purple thing unless your room is entirely purple

1025
01:19:54,480 --> 01:20:00,480
which would be funny if if is the case in my mind it is slowly increasing the amount of purple in

1026
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:07,840
in my room and my life uh oh i recently ordered like like two little um what do you call it like

1027
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,040
no no devies no covers no cheats uh what's what's the blankets there we go that's the word uh two

1028
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,840
blankets because like it was like literally five a.m and i thought like we need we need like a blanket

1029
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:23,040
to like throw over our a sofa because the the one just like literally has holes in it that we currently

1030
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,320
have so i ordered two one for myself and one for the sofa but what both of them were kind of too

1031
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,720
small for the sofa and now i'm stuck with two purple blankets and i'm really happy because

1032
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,960
they're both of them are so soft um i think i i talked about one of them in the last podcast

1033
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:43,440
yes yes i still have it i'm so happy and it's like i wouldn't be as happy if it wasn't purple i think

1034
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,440
i would still be happy because it's soft and comfortable but like it's also purple and with

1035
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:55,840
butterflies and i like butterflies and i'm just so happy i i i would be right unlikely that this could

1036
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:03,200
be uh explored scientifically but do you think that if you had like contact lenses in that made

1037
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:07,840
everything purple forever uh that you would eventually get bored of seeing purple no

1038
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:16,160
are you sure i am i am i am certain that's my final answer be sure but i don't know i haven't

1039
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:20,720
been tired like purple i've had the obsession with purple like started started small but i have

1040
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:26,720
this obsession with purple since i was 14 or so so it's been over a decade since i started liking

1041
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:32,640
purple the and and it's the amount of me liking purple has only increased over time so i feel like

1042
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:38,560
it's gonna grow until it consumes me so do you think it's part of an identity thing like the

1043
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:45,600
fact that people know you're the purple person is like adding to it uh i don't know and i didn't start

1044
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,480
exactly as purple honestly if you think about it because the original version of mage was

1045
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:56,000
mostly black and white was only slightly purple eyes and she slowly grew purple over time

1046
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:03,520
and now she everything is turning purple uh no i i don't know no it's just it just makes me happy

1047
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:10,240
it's just a nice color uh speaking about you should listen to deep purple about colors i don't like

1048
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:16,160
though like i have a i have a small personal grudge against the color green like it's not in

1049
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:20,960
in its own fault it's a good color but the thing is like i was born in may and it's like the color

1050
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,800
of may is green like oh what's your what's your lucky color why is the color of may green i because

1051
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:33,680
like i i don't know someone decided and it's like wait hold on i don't know if that's true well look

1052
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:38,960
up like birthstone alithuanian thing no no like uh if you look up birthstones they're color green

1053
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:44,480
like what was your lucky color is like may if you burn me it's green the birthstone of may is emerald

1054
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:52,960
that's true yeah you know my birthstone is diamond best one april bam obliterated oh fun uh i've got

1055
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:58,880
moonstone pearl and alexandrite oh why do you have several all my favorite steven universe characters

1056
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,080
moonstone is fucking sick pearls are like really good in dark cloud uh gem for weapon

1057
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:12,080
enhancement and alexandrite is a fucking steven universe i'm sorry why do some why do

1058
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:18,480
some ones get several ones why why is may stuck with green i'm so i'm so unhappy it's probably just

1059
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:23,040
because people got confused and couldn't remember what the real one was or what the old one was and

1060
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:28,080
they made up a new one and then people mixed up the two mage are you green is that what you're

1061
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:36,080
saying right now no you're not green i'm not green i i i i think green hashtag free green mage

1062
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:40,400
in in a like like like there was some kind of dimensional swap took place where like

1063
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:45,360
our world's mage was green but like an alternate reality mage was purple and like some kind of

1064
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,520
she fell through the the the green line the escalator yes she fell down she fell under the

1065
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:54,320
under the escalator into the green light and swapped with her purple alternate self or something

1066
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:02,480
okay i'm i'm on like birthstone color bernadette this this this is a lot of fucking colors i'm

1067
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:07,440
i'm trying to find june color right but it's got black blue brown clear green pink purple

1068
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:12,400
red and white okay one of these one of these has to be no but what may has like aqua black

1069
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:17,360
blue brown clear green so it's like that there's a lot that i got i gotta figure this out i gotta

1070
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:23,920
figure out what my color is colors for april yellow red and colorless colorless

1071
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,440
all right how cool is that isn't your fucking because because of diamond that's so cool that's

1072
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,560
my favorite i love that experience of what the worst and best color is here's some literally

1073
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:41,040
objective colorless that's why i draw in black and white april april babies yeah all the trades

1074
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:45,680
also doesn't connect lines when when drawing yeah that's also an april thing i think i see

1075
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,640
that here on wikipedia yellow red and green i'm not looking christmas here is the objective

1076
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:55,280
worst color everyone should agree with me here yellow because that's gotta be fucking

1077
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:00,320
bright and saturated look good you ever seen a fucking dull yellow is just dull yellow is

1078
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:06,320
not even yellow anymore it's just brown i mean all right i can just say that you say that but

1079
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:13,200
i think the reason yellow is so bad is because computer monitors cannot show really yellow

1080
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:19,520
what and to darken a yellow is impossible to make look good like if you have yellow paint

1081
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,320
oh there's so many lovely things that can happen that what do you but on a computer monitor like

1082
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,480
if you if you go to like to photoshop you can't get a good yellow what are you what are you talking

1083
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:35,120
about dude there's a v source video this yellow thumbnail says this is not yellow and is it because

1084
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:41,920
your display displays in red and green red red blue green yeah i know i i don't it wasn't it

1085
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,560
wasn't just i don't understand that it was interesting it's still you like it looks yellow

1086
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,360
it doesn't not look yellow i don't know yeah but if you look at certain things in

1087
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:58,960
realality realality they are more colorful no it does i see in a yellow flower and i'm like

1088
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,320
a sniff sniff it looks the same on a green i don't care i don't see that yellow looks bad

1089
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,680
i'm just saying that it's not as versatile as other colors yeah that's true yeah but you're

1090
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:11,920
saying you're saying that from the perspective of a digital artist who draws i am i am saying that

1091
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,720
because i'm me hippo did you forget ring ring knock knock well i think the problem here is just

1092
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:21,120
that yellow is a more narrowly defined like maybe in another culture there wouldn't be a word for

1093
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,360
brown and yellow would encompass even dark yellow which includes brown all of you are insane you know

1094
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,920
shut up lock you all you know you know that like i mean you know that like other cultures don't have

1095
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,280
the same color words like no i know that's not what i'm saying yellow doesn't equal brown you can get

1096
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:44,160
dark like like gross ass yellow that doesn't brown no hold on opening up manga studio right now

1097
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:49,840
i will obliterate you with facts and logic right now you're saying you're literally what are you

1098
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,960
talking about okay i'm literally you're literally this is this is literally the second yellow controversy

1099
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,080
in the pc i'm drawing i'm drawing a big swatch of yellow right here right now and then i'm putting

1100
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,480
and i'm putting would be such a peaceful topic and i'm putting it down not i'm putting the the

1101
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,320
darkness i'm sliding the down the darkness that are halfway and i'm drawing and it's like an

1102
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,240
olive green that's why we can't have nice things it's like olive color it's no longer yellow

1103
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:20,800
okay uh i have a question okay correct me if i'm wrong but like in japanese didn't like the

1104
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:27,200
color blue and green used to have like the same word for it i'm not sure but maybe what's what's

1105
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:32,960
japan okay i have heard i've heard that uh the ancient greeks did not have a word for blue

1106
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:39,760
which is why that uh in the odyssey homer describes the sky as being like burnished bronze

1107
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:46,000
because there is no word for blue for him to use to describe it and people didn't use to have purple

1108
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,840
either so that's why a lot of flowers are called like use the word blue in their titles despite

1109
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:59,280
being purple i'm angry like violets are blue yes lel literally violet

1110
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,360
yeah i'm looking i'm looking at yellow i have like a perfectly saturated yellow here and i like if i

1111
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:12,080
slide the slider down even a little bit it very quickly turns into like an what i would describe

1112
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:19,840
as more like a puse or olive color it's it's still just looks to me as though it is a dark yellow

1113
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:28,320
description wrong it's definitely wrong wrong yeah wrong no you know what you know but i think

1114
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,080
you like to be a bad person because you just said i love to be like a bad person i love being a bad

1115
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:37,280
man to my friend hey by the way guys i don't know if you guys know this but like episodes don't have

1125
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,920
it being attributed to me that's all i nobody does that though myself because we're talking about this

1130
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:59,040
raiding campaigns in like the bombed out wasteland of lithuania and like like like you know plundering

1131
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,200
you know plundering uh like ancient ruins and stuff and like beating people with baseball

1132
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:07,520
bats you were reading like teen girl magazines that were telling you about your birthstone how

1133
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:12,560
to incorporate it into your wardrobe to be fair i only read one magazine it was like it wasn't

1134
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:18,320
even a magazine it was like the the the way the wings no no not the wings the witch the witch comics

1135
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,680
the only reason i brought the yellow thing is because i wanted everyone to be like ha ha yeah

1136
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:25,600
me too much yeah i also know the difficulties of picking correct shades of yellow this is

1137
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:34,800
the worst topic ever i want to kill myself uh it's blue i'm blue god so i'm gonna start out like

1138
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,560

1139
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:47,680
like maybe a half of these are even slightly good so uh we're going to we're going to start with uh

1140
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:53,440
my personal favorite and i feel like one that uh sums up the sort of general quality here

1141
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,440
and then navigate over to our slave real quick whip them real quick yep yeah here we go make sure

1152
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,240
here i just wanted to leave a message for all those commenters out there cutting themselves

1153
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:10,320
because the pcp doesn't read their comments uh just use me instead at least one of them is

1154
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:16,160
gonna have to listen to you and you know voicemails are to be honest just the cooler way to go right

1155
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,920
you really want to be a part of a youtube comment section no yeah i agree we provided you we provided

1156
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,440
you that we don't use that we don't know who's that that's my roommate pcp comment section

1157
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,920
i'm really sorry man i didn't think you heard that it is his roommate the pcp comment

1158
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:42,160

1159
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:50,080
of a okay there's no reason to bring my mother into this and what the slur is really the could you

1160
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,560
really spell him right see see comment this goes on for like an hour so i'm gonna disconnect right

1161
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,680
here but uh in case you fucking that hosts are too unruly and you literally couldn't understand

1162
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,640
uh this this is the pcp voicemail he called in but his roommate the pcp youtube comments uh came

1163
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:09,360
in started typing in a came that he was speaking it seems like comment section is a real asshole

1164
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,840
but fortunately we've given you an out so you don't have to you don't have to be like him you've

1165
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:18,640
got the speak pipe right at your disposal link in the description i we did the meme that we

1166
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:24,560
don't read the comments came from uh because i do it's not really a meme it's just sort of like

1167
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:31,040
an implicated you know implicitly people don't assume that the youtube creators are human beings

1168
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:35,280
that we were saying that we thought the comments were bad because the people assumed we didn't read

1169
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:40,000
them even though we do we've talked for the last like two episodes about how contrary to popular

1170
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,800
belief we actually do most of us do read the comments here's the thing we read the comments but

1171
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:51,360
none of them are good enough to warrant responses yeah i respond if one if one makes me mad enough

1172
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:57,520
i respond so uh that's how you get how you trick me uh that now we're gonna see like a hundred like

1173
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:03,440
hey ben hey ben fuck yeah and i'll and i'll spend an entire day responding to all of them if you

1174
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:09,920
address me specifically i'll probably respond i don't just mean refer to me like like say my name

1175
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,360
in the comment i mean like if you're speaking to me i will speak back most of the time speaking you

1176
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:19,760
shall be spoken to here's also another one that i'm gonna cut off prematurely uh actually you know

1177
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:25,120

1219
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,520

1220
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:32,960
type hctps colon slash discord.gg slash lowercase n lowercase t uppercase s uppercase r uppercase

1221
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:39,360
x lowercase e lowercase x type nr quick quick quick quick and let's rowdy thrash thrash thrash thrash

1222
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:45,760
thrash thrash no no okay all right he do that except at the end it's not a lowercase k it's

1223
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:52,240
not a lowercase x is lowercase k so do that but typical rowdy this is a typical rowdy just

1224
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:58,080
why the fuck haven't you guys bought a fucking url yet for this thing what do you notice the discord

1225
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:06,080
invite don't worry yeah don't worry about you can buy a url that just reconnects to any url you

1226
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:12,240
have rfck.com's bought by some fucking chinese company no no no you get rfck.slime you could

1227
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:16,800
probably do that no there's no slime check wait is there there's a link there's a link to the discord

1228
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:23,360
on the slimecorp website right yes okay well just go you go to slimecorp.net yeah go to slimecorp.net

1229
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:31,280
and you can uh you can find your way there all right here's the last one hi it's terezi pyro

1230
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:39,680
so i was hanging out with discord yeah and my discord baby risco wants to get bottom surgery

1231
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:46,480
he really wanted me to ask this the dating bottom surgery give you a second virginity

1232
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:55,440
what's up with that okay so so in case you're not trans aware like how i was i was trans unaware

1233
01:39:55,440 --> 01:40:01,040
bottom surgery is is you know when you change your genital to the other one so oh i thought it was

1234
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:05,600
just like getting a bigger butt yeah i thought that too that's that's ryan agents first as well

1235
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,760
okay okay so the question is the answer is clearly yes yeah yeah you think you think so yeah i agree

1236
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,760
i agree i well i'm gonna disagree with a caveat i don't think that changing okay if you have a dick

1237
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,960
and you're and you've fucked with your dick and you're not a virgin and you get even you change

1238
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:29,520
your dick into a vagina and then it's like oh am i now a virgin again no but what i think is that

1239
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:35,360
what i think has happened is that you have previously lost your dick virginity but you

1240
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:41,520
have a new virginity to lose oh yeah you have you have you have a different it's a you've

1241
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:45,840
lost you've still lost your old virginity you've still lost that but you there is a separate

1242
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:51,040
virginity that you may that you lose independently plus virginity yeah well well like it's like

1243
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,360
erica moan said on strip search like you have multiple virginities like you can lose your

1244
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,920
butt virginity that's a separate thing you're you're you're very various different kinds of

1245
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:05,520
virginities ah so many what a cornucopia you can collect them all your sneeze virginity yeah the

1246
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,560
first the first time you do a big sneeze that's you're losing your sneeze virginity and big sneeze

1247
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:17,760
and so on and so on in that order uh i really i thought that you know we were when we were talking

1248
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:24,240
about this um we were talking about how i terezi and what is the terezi risk i don't know it doesn't

1249
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:32,800
matter it really sucks for you that risk is trans though no it doesn't um well she'll have a vagina

1250
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:38,160
soon changes nothing so it's fine um the the uh man i think nate would probably have more to say

1251
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:42,320
about this i think he would probably argue and play devil's advocate in response to this question

1252
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:52,480
nate would probably say oh i hate old people do me too uh damn okay well this this episode

some sort of privileged access to the content right so it's like well i'll just until the

1313
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:04,240
comics done i'll just put them on patreon only which is like i mean before that it's not like i

1314
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:08,320
was releasing them one at a time i just wasn't releasing them anywhere until i had the whole

1315
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:14,880
thing done and released it all at once um but i don't know you were saying that like i should

1316
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,000
just fucking release them one at a time and maybe yeah there there's so many people that like want

1317
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,720
to be ben saint fans but just have no concept that you are actually doing work as far as like a

1318
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:30,080
lot of people concerned you are doing nothing as far as a lot of people are concerned yeah i

1319
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:35,040
feel like this exact conversation already i think i think so too this exact conversation yeah i'm

1320
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,760
pretty sure i'm sure you brought this up okay whatever i mean my i mean my hope is that like

1321
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:44,480
when it all comes out at once people will be like oh he was working on something this whole time my

1322
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:50,400
preconceptions have been shattered i'm gonna go to patreon.com slash ben saint and show my appreciation

1323
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:56,400
before but ben didn't agree with me so he has to agree with me this time i'm just i think that time

1324
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,640
and this time i'm just equivocating because i don't know what's real and i don't know what's

1325
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:05,040
true and i don't know what the right thing to do is everyone press one of ben should just release

1326
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:09,680
his fucking comics normally well like a normal person yeah okay well everyone's gonna say yes

1327
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:15,120
normally as in like one chapter per week no no like you know he releases pages like he's done

1328
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:19,200
with them and they on his website or maybe like it's like you know you get them like a day before

1329
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:27,440
as a patron or something you know what i think i think that is generally a bad idea with the format

1330
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:38,080
of ben's comics because uh certain things read better when they're all in one chapter you know one

1331
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:43,840
page that may not have dialogue on it like the last one it just like i mean i don't know how it feels

1332
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,960
for the patrons who who get to see it yeah um as it comes out the same problem little bit by little

1333
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:56,800
bit but i don't know whether that would really it like is it worth people thinking that ben does work

1334
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:03,440
to have them have like a kind of worse experience reading it it's not a worse experience because

1335
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:08,640
they're able to get it sooner and be able to have it more in their mind it's definitely not

1336
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:13,200
optimal as reading it in the backlog it's definitely a worse experience to read something

1337
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:18,080
one page at a time that's a continuous this is why this is this is why i did it in the first place

1338
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,640
and didn't and just and didn't release one at a time and waited until it was all done i've run to

1339
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:28,560
this problem myself because i'm working on this on the game right now and like i have i there's

1340
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,400
nothing to release now that the game's out and have to work on an entire fucking video game like

1341
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,560
am i gonna release every level at a time like over the course of like a year and that's completely

1342
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:41,520
different i mean you could you could do that i could but let me finish yeah because i've had

1343
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,200
this problem like even when i was doing comics like three years ago i was having a problem

1344
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:49,600
like i've tried wanted to release big things because like it was a story and told a story and

1345
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:54,880
like the the answer unfortunately is just make more shit yeah the way that's that's always the

1346
01:49:54,880 --> 01:50:00,240
real answer the way to do it would be work on the big vapor's comics and then like every like one or

1347
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:03,920
two weeks release like a four-pan a little like gangstrip with the characters to get people to

1348
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,920
care about the characters for the big release i've been thinking about that running two comics

1349
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,600
like that's really the way to do it and it just you know it just takes more work but like you

1350
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:15,680
just kind of have to nut up and make it happen i've been thinking about that like what if i did

1351
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:21,280
not exactly like the red man thing but what if i just did like sort of like a like a like not much

1352
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,320
like in the way of new drawing just like the static character just like a little bit of like

1353
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:30,800
dialogue just like a little like dialogue short comic snippet thing um get my i don't know writing

1354
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,600
juices flowing a little bit uh or something you do like a sprite comic with the vapor so you just

1355
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:43,040
have sprites you can like reuse all the time um boy yeah and just like wait wait what if i put them

1356
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:47,200
just do garfield but with what if i put them right like i have like an isometric view of

1357
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:51,360
like their room and i made little like little like sprites of them and i just move them around the

1358
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:56,400
room right it's it's and i made homestuck and i just what if i made homestuck that's kind of

1359
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:01,120
that's kind of cool it is cool i think i gotta go very soon but i just want to say
