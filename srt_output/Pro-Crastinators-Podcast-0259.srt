00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, we did it. Yeah, we did it. Welcome to episode whatever of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We got me, Ben Saint, you got Gibbontake, and we got Chrono, aka Gamers Tavern, back from the grave.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A man walks into a bar and says, hello, my name is Jose, and the bartender says, if you're Jose, where's hose B?

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We are convened. We are convened once again for a great council. The great council has been called to stand in judgment over the masses. And our verdict is, fuck them.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is you suck. So thanks for listening, audience.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, fuck.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Me or?

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, no, I mean, yes, but not, no, I mean.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes, I mean, in general to all, I equally share my contempt among the masses.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Absolutely. Absolutely. I just realized, since we've got a guest, I have to download all of the voicemails.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, my God, there's so many voicemails.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry for ruining everything.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, it's so bad. Oh, you, you, well, I mean, the voice, the voice mailers ruined everything, but you are like the, you are really just like salt in the wound right now.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Salt tastes pretty good.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, I better, I better start downloading. This will take me all episode just to get all these freaking voicemails ready.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It will take you all episode and it will completely cripple your ability to pay attention to the conversation, thus ruining the episode.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Absolutely. That's, that's what I hope for every time I get on here is something to please cripple my ability to pay attention to the conversation.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I guess I should have notified me in advance and did all of this in advance.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I should have done that, but I really wanted to sleep until 3pm.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Ben, just last minute thought, I just get gamers to heaven and so here is.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's exactly what I did.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I had a dream.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Get ready for this. This is going to be a great story. This is the, this is the original, the original Ben St. Dream corner.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I had a dream that I went deaf and I was walking around.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It was in my, what? I was at my, my old, old like college girlfriend's house for some reason and I was walking around and I went deaf and I was like, oh no, I can't hear.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh no, I can't hear.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait, it'll come back.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I remember what I was doing. I was, I was hosing off a dirty trampoline and suddenly I went deaf and I, in her, in her backyard and I was like,

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That is pretty random.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I was like, okay, okay, it'll come back. It'll come back and it wouldn't come back and I was, and I'm walking around the house just thinking it's going to come back any second now.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's going to come back any second now.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's like, you feel like you got water and you're, and you're like, I'm just, it's just a, it'll just, it'll just like clear up the water will come out of my ear and then I'll be able to hear again.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I mean, you ever have like, you ever have like, I don't know, like you stand up too fast and you get lightheaded and your hearing goes away for a second, but then it comes back.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Or something like that.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, it's like the blood's leaving your head too quickly if you move. Yeah, yeah, I know that.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, yeah, so I thought like, I'm, maybe I just like strained myself in some way and I'm momentarily deaf and my hearing will come back, but it wasn't coming back.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And I, and I would kind of like tap on my ear and I'd be like, I could kind of hear it and like, I would like yell and I can kind of hear it from inside my throat, but I'm like, I'm almost mostly deaf and it's like not coming back.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And then I woke up and I realized and I'm like, and I said something.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm like, huh?

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I could hear myself and I'm like, few.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not deaf.

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I only imagined the deafness.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But I realized that the reason why I was having that dream was because my, wait, hold on, my favorite YouTube video, 10 hours, gentle rain sounds on window, calm rain, black screen rain for sleep, comma study.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
My rain sounds for sleeping video had ended.

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And so I had gone from hearing a loud white noise to hearing nothing and it made me think I was deaf in the dream.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's really cool that the outside, because I don't know how dreams work, but it's interesting to think an outside stimulus could influence what you start dreaming about.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sure.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because because in the dream, I was, I was hearing this white noise and then all of a sudden I was hearing nothing and I guess my brain interpreted that as like, I cannot hear anymore.

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I cannot hear anything.

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And you didn't, you didn't go from hearing white noise to hearing black noise.

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What is, what does that mean?

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't, I didn't think that was true.

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You ever hear of, you ever hear of a brown note?

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The one that makes you shit?

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah.

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The magical, the magical frequency that makes you shit.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I've never listened to it, but I assume it sounds like a tuba.

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's great.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I recommend it.

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My, you should put on my favorite YouTube video, 10 hours, gentle brown note for shitting.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You know.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You'll really, you'll really shit off more than you can poo.

66
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That would be great to put on when you have constipation.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I was going to say constipation, brown note.

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm going to try that.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've been, that's been suffering from that.

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And I've been, if it works, if it works, it would be really funny that I have to listen to that.

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If it were, if it works, it would be really funny.

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If it, I mean, if it were real, it would have all kinds of important medical applications.

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There's all kinds of reasons.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You could like, you wouldn't have to go like not eat for, you know, 10, 24 hours before surgery.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They could just play you the brown note before they put you under and then you would shit it all out.

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And you wouldn't have to worry about having food in your intestines.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I, I gotta know.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I mean, it'd be so.

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't know if it works.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I could, I could Google does it work and then get an answer, but I'd rather just listen to it.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I believe it is, I believe it is apocryphal.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I believe it is a cryptid.

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, not a cryptid.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't know what the word is.

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What do you do currency?

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's, it's a fiction.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's, it's, it's pure fiction.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like an arbor and legend.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Like, like the guy, like, like, number one in that, in that, that TV series where they would tell you fantasy stories.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And then tell you, and then tell you whether they were real.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And then at the end he goes, it's fiction.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We made it up.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, yeah.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's a.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Urban legend is probably the word I was looking for a wives, a wives tale, a tall tale, a piece of a piece of modern mythology.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They should have a superhero whose power is that he can produce the legendary brown note.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
His name could be brown note.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And he plays, and he makes everyone poop their pants in this audience.

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And he plays the tuba.

102
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He does it with it.

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He has a giant tuba and he only through with the tuba can he produce it.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And if he gets, if the bad guy knocks the tuba out of his hands, he's like, no, I can't make him shit anymore.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How will I get out of this jam?

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He's like pinned to the ground and he's like sees the tuba slide across the room.

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He grasps for it.

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He's grabbing, but he can't quite reach it.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And he gets it.

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And everyone shits themselves.

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is, this is pretty relevant to my brand considering my logo is brown on brown.

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why'd you do that?

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What were you thinking?

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you, what are you crazy?

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I always thought it was like Minecraft a little bit, a little bit of Minecraft or just some video game dirt.

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I never really thought much.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Some video game dirt.

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The logo represents the quality of the work.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
To me, I always thought it means that it was like made of wood.

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know.

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a wooden sign.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's like, it's like an old game, old timey video game, PC game tavern.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You go in there and they've got like a tavern one might say.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's right.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, it's a gamer with gamers in it, placing Minecraft dirt and pooping and shitting.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, exactly.

129
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When I think of a gamer's tavern, I think of D&D.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like that's the kind of gamers I imagine in a tavern.

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, most likely.

132
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Different, different, different genre.

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

134
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, I don't know.

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What's everyone, what's been going on?

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well, hi.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
For everybody.

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I have, I've been cooking.

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've been doing some cooking, learning to make new things.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No fucking way.

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No fucking way.

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Pretty useful ice skill.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm in my new place and I've only got this one hot plate.

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have to figure out how to cook everything that I want to eat.

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wait, you don't have like a stove?

146
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Nope.

147
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Just a hot plate, just an electric hot plate you plug into the wall.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What?

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You should buy one of those tiny ovens.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Did you say oven?

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think you said oven.

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I didn't say oven.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I'm shocked, I'm shocked because I saw your place and it's like a nice place

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and I'm like flabbergasted that it doesn't have a stove.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, it has like a kitchen countertop area, but it's like almost entirely like the sink

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and the drying area for the washing up.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is like a tiny little bit.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's a tiny little bit to the side where there's plugs.

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can plug in like a kettle or a coffee machine or a toaster.

160
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is insanity.

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is a European thing, I swear to God.

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I just have space for the hot plate.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No, it's not a European thing.

164
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's not really meant to be a lived in apartment thing, I think.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Like the apartment upstairs has a whole oven and stove thing.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is just sort of like a...

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So it's supposed to all be one apartment, but it's been split and you didn't get the kitchen.

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, but like I can do so much because I've learned.

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I get it.

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No, I get it.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Much that I already knew this, but I never really thought about it,

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that all cooking requires is hot metal.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And if you can heat up metal and you have ingredients, you can make anything.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's true.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I've talked about this.

176
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When I lived in Poland after they fired me for being a terrible, terrible teacher,

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and I had to downgrade from the company provided loft apartment overlooking the city

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to the room downstairs, semi-shared with the 90-year-old woman

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
in a dark corridor with the bathroom where you had to pump your own hot water.

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I also...

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And the heating system that was just like a giant stone column

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that would warm up during the day.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I had also had no stove and no oven and I had nothing but a hot plate.

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I would go down to the local Biedronka supermarket and I would buy sausages

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and then I would fry a little sausage pieces on my tiny little hot plate.

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I would cook eggs on it and things.

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You know all the usual shit you do.

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sounds like the life.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It was, you know what?

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Fifteen's laddies a day.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
For 15's laddies a day, it was totally the life.

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's all I have to say about that.

193
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I know a guy who...

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I've lived the hot plate life.

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I've lived the hot plate life is what I'm saying.

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You've lived the hot life.

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I mean yes.

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Also, also true.

199
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What were you saying?

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Krono, you were saying you knew a guy.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Was I saying?

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No, that's what I wanted to say.

203
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You lived the hot life.

204
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No, you were saying you knew a guy.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh yeah, I know a guy who lived in Poland for a while.

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Poland!

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Poland!

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He has an oven in Poland.

209
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm cruel.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm cruel by nature.

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And I also, the same guy went to, he lived in Ukraine for a while as well.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And did he have, did he live the hot plate life?

215
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Probably.

216
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Funny thing about Poland, paper, okay, what's the word?

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Toilet paper, brown.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Like a paper band.

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you've wiped clean?

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know.

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I was thinking the same thing.

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, it's not dark enough.

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's not that shade of brown.

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's brown like a brown paper towel.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like a beige.

226
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's brown like a brown paper bag, yeah.

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know, it's just not, it's just not, you know, it's a little rough.

228
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's just not right and it's just a little rough and it's just, I would say it's not optimal.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But you know, they're all communists over there.

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They just don't have, they don't have the means.

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They don't have the means for white paper towel, white toilet paper.

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They can't afford it.

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's just what happens.

234
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What a shit show.

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What a filthy continent.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, I've been cooking and I made fucking puttanesca pasta sauce.

237
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I made spaghetti bolognese.

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I made chili con carne.

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Puttanesca.

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Puttanesca, yes.

241
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like the Kremlin.

242
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
No, it is Italian.

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Communist.

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I told you.

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I told you they're all communists.

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, America just wants to put it in his place.

248
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Puttin it is, it's puttin it, it's puttin it.

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Wait, is it like a fish, is it like a fish sauce?

250
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It has anchovies in it.

251
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So, yes.

252
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There's anchovies and olives and, you know, tomatoes.

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, that's real, that was a really good one.

256
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Savory.

257
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I love that one.

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That was like, excellent.

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You know, I've been like, what's happening?

260
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
My dad saying, hey, how do you like cook this?

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And he just tells me because he's a cook guy.

262
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He's a chef man.

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What's that?

264
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What's happening, my dad?

265
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, what's happening, my dad?

266
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The only thing I say to him is like, hey, how do you cook like chili?

267
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And he's like, okay, here's how I do it.

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's funny, but I can't talk because I got my parents on Discord so that they can actually

269
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
like contact me.

270
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, my dad, as far as I know, my dad is not on it and my mom, I just, because they

271
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
were, because I saw them recently and they were like, Ben, you never answer your phone.

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How do we fucking contact you?

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And my dad was like, Ben, I want you to give me your, I want you to give me your roommates

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
like phone numbers so that I can call them if I can't contact you.

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I'm like, oh no.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh no, that means that like they're going to get mad at me if I don't answer my phone

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
for my dad because my dad will be bugging them and that'll suck.

278
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So I was like, okay, here's what I'm going to do.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't look at my phone.

280
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I use this app called Discord and I told my mom where to get it and she got it.

281
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And now she occasionally sends me Discord messages like, Ben, you forgot to renew your

282
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
auto payments for your phone bill.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We want $30 a month for your phone bill.

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm like, yes.

285
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're saying you made a horrible mistake.

286
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I, you know what?

287
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's fine.

288
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You should never mix places of work and home or whatever.

289
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I feel like Discord is like, it's useful to have a WhatsApp for family and like normie culture.

290
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So I can talk to people there and they don't need to see whatever weird profile picture I have.

291
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And they don't need to know anything about what I'm doing on this side of the tracks.

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's not that bad.

293
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's not like she's in my servers or anything.

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's only a matter of time, Ben.

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's only a matter of time.

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I usually contact my family on a Facebook Messenger.

297
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I used to use Facebook.

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
My roommates all used to communicate through Facebook Messenger and it was a big, we had a big push to migrate to

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Discord and I've been a lot happier since then because I would never look at Facebook Messenger ever.

300
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Well, I only use Facebook Messenger for family now.

301
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't use it for outside of family stuff.

302
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Well, I mean, that's how I was.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We had like a phone chat.

304
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Like we have like a group chat on the phone.

305
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And it was like, on the one hand, like, yeah, it's nice to keep it separate.

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But then on the other hand, it's like, because it is separate and it's in a place that I never look.

307
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I never see it and it might as well not exist.

308
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And I miss everything that goes on in it.

309
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I mean, I get notifications.

310
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I literally do not even pick up my phone and look at it.

311
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I do not even do that.

312
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's your problem.

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I mean, it's awesome.

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I know.

315
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's my problem.

316
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Discord is the solution.

317
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Honestly, I think I need a new phone.

318
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I think the reason I stopped looking at it is because my phone is crappy and it's laggy and it's really old.

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And planned obsolescence.

320
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And I just, if I had one that like worked better, maybe I, maybe this wouldn't have been such a problem.

321
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I can't even play Pokemon Go anymore because it's so fucking grindy.

322
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It takes like 30 seconds to do anything.

323
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Like grindy as in like a grind, you can hear the wheels grinding against each other in the machine.

324
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No, grindy as in, no, grindy as in you got to catch 40 catapes to turn them into a butterfree.

325
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh my God, you got to catch 300.

326
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's always been my bed.

327
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You got to catch 300 sproinks to turn them into one grumpy.

328
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I need that grumpy.

329
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It sounds like an RPG to me.

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I need my grumpy dudes.

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's what I mean.

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You can't haven't played, haven't played Pokemon Go all pandemic.

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And it's not even because of the pandemic.

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's because my phone sucks.

335
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You better use some of that cryptocurrency savings to buy yourself a new phone.

336
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I sold on my crypto.

337
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Chrono, I sold it all right before it started going up again.

338
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, oh, oh, it's down.

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It is down right now.

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I was going to say you should buy some now.

341
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ah, fuck you.

342
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's not actually that far down.

343
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's still down to like the biggest peak.

344
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Maybe a little bit lower.

345
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wait, this is, this is incredible.

346
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh my God.

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Actually, the Bitcoin went down a lot.

348
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You should buy some right now.

349
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Wow, just today.

350
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Honestly, yeah, this might be a time to buy.

351
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Just today in the course of like, in like a second.

352
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Wow, it went down from like five.

353
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It dropped like 10.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It dropped like 10% in like 10 minutes.

355
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It was a huge drop.

356
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I kind of bought a little bit too early.

357
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I bought it when it was like 58,

358
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
but it dropped way lower than that.

359
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You, you, you, you bought after it dipped somewhat,

360
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
but not all the way.

361
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It kept going down.

362
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I see, I see.

363
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
God, it went all the way down for a second there.

364
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It was all the way down back to 50 or almost.

365
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
People are saying it's not done growing yet though,

366
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but oh wow, that's.

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I would say right now you better buy it before it goes back up.

368
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Maybe.

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's going back up right now.

370
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
If you look at the hourly like time frame.

371
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah.

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But if you look at the month time frame,

373
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
it's like, I don't know,

374
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
it does look like it's just going down right now.

375
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Who knows?

376
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think it will go back up.

377
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I mean, it's going up.

378
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's going up again, but it's not like,

379
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
it's creep, it's creeping up again

380
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the way it was creeping up before.

381
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's going up and it's going down.

382
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It'll take a while to.

383
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I would imagine it's going to take a while

384
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
before it goes back up to where it was before again.

385
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
People were saying,

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I was seeing some comments that were like,

387
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
can't wait to hear them like,

388
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
can't wait to hear them like cope with the fact

389
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
that like Bitcoin went up again.

390
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I think they were talking about Dogecoin specifically

391
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
because that's that shut up.

392
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Dogecoin.

393
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah.

394
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, I saw that.

395
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Does Tom still have Dogecoin?

396
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I got Dogecoin.

397
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I hope so.

398
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I bought some one while ago.

399
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I didn't get any of that, unfortunately.

400
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I wanted, when it was first going up that first time

401
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I wanted to buy it,

402
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
but Coinbase was just like,

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
your account's too new.

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We just error message.

405
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I would have had, I would have like,

406
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I would have Dogecoin.

407
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh wow, it's up to 30 cents.

408
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I guess Coinbase has a policy against

409
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
socialists or something.

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
They, it was, it's literally just,

411
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
no, at the time they weren't blocking Dogecoin.

412
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I actually think it was just that like,

413
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
my account was too new.

414
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Like I made my Coinbase account,

415
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and not my Coinbase,

416
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I made my Robinhood account like,

417
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
right at that moment,

418
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and it like didn't let me make purchases

419
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
for like another day,

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
but by then it was down to like three,

421
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
it went up to seven cents,

422
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
but by then it had dropped to like three cents.

423
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
If I had got, if dammit, it would have,

424
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I would have, it would be 10 times

425
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
what I bought it at,

426
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
if I had managed to buy it then at that,

427
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
at that point.

428
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I bought 20 pounds worth at some point,

429
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
which is 695 Dogecoin.

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So I've got 160 pounds.

431
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's quite a lot extra.

432
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's pretty good.

433
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's pretty good.

434
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It could go further.

435
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm sure this is the riveting for the audience.

436
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, you know,

437
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
they're gonna be like in the future,

438
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and they're gonna say,

439
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
how have these fucking stupid idiots,

440
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
they thought something was the case

441
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and they had a prediction

442
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and it has been different in the future.

443
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That's the, that's the entertainment for them

444
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
is to see how we are.

445
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Here's what makes me angry.

446
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's that like when I,

447
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
when I look at this Dogecoin,

448
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
this huge Dogecoin spike,

449
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm like, you know what,

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I should have known that this would eventually happen.

451
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And the reason why I should have known

452
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that this would eventually happen

453
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
is because Elon, it's Elon Musk's pet project.

454
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I would have known

455
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that he would just kept posting

456
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
like shitty boomer memes of like a smirking dog

457
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and that like that is enough to make this happen.

458
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Like, like as much as I hate it,

459
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
that it's true.

460
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I know that it's true

461
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
that he can just keep mentioning Dogecoin

462
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and this will occur.

463
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So I should have known.

464
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I should have known that this,

465
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that this dumb shit would take place

466
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
because of course it would.

467
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So it's really on me.

468
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's really on me for missing out.

469
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's how the stock market worked

470
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
before all the crypto stuff.

471
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I guess so.

472
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The news would make things go up and down.

473
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I guess so.

474
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Was it, was it this stupid?

475
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Or was it?

476
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I, well.

477
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Has it gotten stupider?

478
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I think.

479
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah, probably.

480
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The veneer of the internet has like,

481
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
like given it a new coat of paint.

482
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But I think it's basically the same shit.

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's just people.

484
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
People believe know what they're talking about.

485
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You know,

486
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
you know what it is?

487
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Change the way people think about stuff

488
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and then everyone does that.

489
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You know, people.

490
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think it.

491
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Newspapers and publications or whatever.

492
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I think it's that.

493
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Just go on Twitter.

494
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I, well, yeah, that's what I'm going to say.

495
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I think it's that the,

496
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
the internet has made news cycles shorter

497
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and because news cycles affect stock prices,

498
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
it has just made the cycles faster,

499
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
which has made it like more erratic.

500
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Right.

501
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Like these things happen.

502
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
These things happen faster now.

503
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Are stocks faster or is it just cryptocurrency?

504
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Well.

505
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I think all stocks are going up and down.

506
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I mean, GameStop was doing its thing.

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't know.

508
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I mean, this is probably not,

509
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I mean, we live in extraordinary times.

510
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So maybe it's not fair,

511
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
but on the other hand, you know,

512
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
crises of capitalism happen periodically.

513
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So it's probably not fair to not consider this

514
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
to be a part of normal,

515
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
normal fiduciary operations.

516
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Hmm.

517
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You know, speaking of crisis of capitalism,

518
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I've got a funny story, which is embarrassing.

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So.

520
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Nice.

521
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
As I said, cooking, right?

522
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm cooking and I'm like, oh,

523
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I should buy some potatoes.

524
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I like those, but I know I don't have a potato peeler at home.

525
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So I need to go buy one on the way back and.

526
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Just eat the fucking, just eat the fucking skins.

527
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Get rusted potatoes and eat the skin.

528
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I mean, I like the skin sometimes,

529
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
but like if you want to make mashed potatoes,

530
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I don't think you can have the skins on.

531
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Maybe you can.

532
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't know.

533
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You can.

534
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Well, it depends on, it depends on the type.

535
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

536
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't know what the, I'm just thinking,

537
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
okay, I probably would need a potato peeler.

538
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I, and today or the day I was doing that shop,

539
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
the, the UK COVID restrictions were slowly lifting.

540
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And it was the day where now lots of shops can open

541
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and you can go to a restaurant and, you know,

542
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
things are changing and now lockdown is being lifted slowly

543
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and people are going out and about and be careful.

544
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
They go, okay, cool.

545
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And shops that were on the high street that I hadn't seen open

546
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
were now open and there was a kitchen suppliers shop.

547
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I'm like, oh, but based, that's perfect.

548
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm on the way home, kitchen suppliers,

549
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'll go in, I'll get a fucking potato peeler.

550
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Everything's going correct today.

551
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I go up to them.

552
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't see a potato peeler in the store.

553
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Lots of nice pots and pans and stuff.

554
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I already got stuff from Amazon.

555
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And I say to the lady, you got a potato peeler.

556
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And she says, yeah, okay, we got one in the back.

557
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
She gets it and I hold it and I'm like, okay, I'll have that.

558
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
She says that'll be 17 pounds, please.

559
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
17 pounds for a potato peeler.

560
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That's a lot of money for a potato peeler.

561
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
17 pounds, she says.

562
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I did, but I was like, oh no, I've started this transaction.

563
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I'm like stupid.

564
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No, it's time to haggle.

565
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It's time to haggle.

566
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's time to haggle.

567
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And I just put no credit card.

568
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I put no credit card on the thing and it went beef.

569
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And then I was like, what the fuck did I just do?

570
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
No, you fell for the trap.

571
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's so expensive for a fucking potato peeler.

572
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Made a horrible mistake.

573
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It was like, it was just, it was better be a fucking,

574
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
made a fucking titanium potato peeler.

575
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I haven't even used it yet, but like I brought it back.

576
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Where did you walk home?

577
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I was like, why?

578
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Why am I so bad at normal conversing with people

579
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
who can't say, isn't that a bit much?

580
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't know if I want this.

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I could have said that and stopped.

582
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah.

583
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But I fucking didn't.

584
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I mean, I understand.

585
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's a high pressure situation.

586
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You're right there.

587
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You're staring down the barrel of the gun and you look weak.

588
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Honestly, if you say, I don't want to pay $17 for a potato,

589
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
but you look weak, you look cowardly, you look indecisive.

590
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You can't let your reputation take that.

591
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I didn't need anything else at the time.

592
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So I would have just left.

593
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm like, I don't know why that has sway in my decision-making

594
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
that I would just leave without buying anything.

595
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I have a roommate who once in complete earnestness told me,

596
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
yeah, I went shopping before, but I forgot to get,

597
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I don't know, rice or something.

598
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I forgot to get some essential ingredient that I needed

599
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
for the thing I wanted to make.

600
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Guess I can't make the thing.

601
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And I'm like, why don't you just go back and get the rice?

602
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And he was like, well, then they'd see me.

603
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
They'd see that I went back and forgot something.

604
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And like, I'm too ashamed.

605
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm too embarrassed.

606
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I can't let them know.

607
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
He'd never be able to live that down.

608
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, I can't let them see.

609
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I don't want to be seen losing twice in one store.

610
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He forgot his rice.

611
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, little baby forgot his rice.

612
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What a fucking dupe.

613
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I understand that, but I've definitely gotten over that myself.

614
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah, I understand the feeling.

615
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I understand the feeling, but I wouldn't actually let it stop me

616
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
from going back for the rice.

617
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah.

618
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Where was this that they were charging you $17 for a potato,

619
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
pounds for a potato?

620
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That's like $800.

621
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
No, it's a lot of money.

622
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I was trying to rationalize it as I walked home,

623
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
like, well, I mean, if I...

624
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No, it's a really nice potato peeler.

625
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's top of the line.

626
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It'll probably, if I can make it last for like 17 years,

627
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
then it'll just be $1.

628
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If I peel like 17 years worth of potatoes and it's still good,

629
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
then that'll be a good purchase, actually.

630
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I was just trying to...

631
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It was on the high street.

632
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And I guess it was like a high class,

633
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
upper class, big boy kitchen place.

634
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And they did look nice.

635
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What is the high street?

636
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I just didn't think...

637
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Well, it's just a street in the middle of the...

638
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's just a name for, you know, generic.

639
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Town has the main street where all the shopping happens.

640
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's called the high street.

641
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh, I see.

642
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Sure.

643
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Okay. Got you.

644
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yeah.

645
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So this is like banks and restaurants and shops, mostly.

646
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Is it high street?

647
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That was a high end thing.

648
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I mean, I guess lesson learned, don't shop there anymore.

649
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
No, I will never go there.

650
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I will see, every time I see those things,

651
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
they didn't have any fucking prices on the things.

652
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And I know why.

653
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If you had prices on those pots and pans,

654
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I bet there'd be like 50 pounds for one of those casserole dishes,

655
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
like fucking...

656
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Or about 100 pounds, probably.

657
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Was it like...

658
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Was part of the problem that there was like a very like...

659
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Like a high end atmosphere in there,

660
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
which like sort of made you feel more pressure than you would

661
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
in like a CVS or whatever.

662
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah, maybe.

663
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I mean, it was a small place.

664
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It wasn't like a bustling anything.

665
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It was just one person at the cash register,

666
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
another guy in the back.

667
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And I was just sort of like asking for a potato peeler

668
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and they had one and that was it.

669
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That was the one potato peeler they had.

670
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
They didn't have like a cheapo version.

671
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I didn't ask.

672
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I just bought it and I felt stupid.

673
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Absolutely tragic.

674
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's my embarrassing...

675
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
My embarrassing capitalism story.

676
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
How dare money be exchanged.

677
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We have to take them down.

678
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We have to tear the whole damn system down.

679
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
That was the time I became a socialist.

680
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That was like, this is so fucked.

681
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
They own these means of production and it's bullshit.

682
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They extracted my surplus value.

683
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I told them...

684
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And it was so effortless for them.

685
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They did it with ease.

686
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I told a stereo...

687
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They forced you to buy that potato peeler at gunpoint.

688
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I told the stereos on Twitter.

689
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Speaking of cooking, I was talking about how I have...

690
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I have still not been able to find IMO or isomaltoligosaccharide.

691
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I have not been able to find it in any reasonable quantities,

692
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
like from a vendor.

693
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But I am trying a new ingredient called alulose

694
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and I'm going to try and do a new...

695
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm going to try the formula again with a replacement

696
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and see if it works.

697
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And a stereos was like, why do you...

698
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I can't believe you work so hard.

699
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What did he say?

700
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
He said, I can't believe someone who doesn't get high

701
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
would work this hard on gummies.

702
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I saw that tweet.

703
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And I said it and then I reflected on what I said

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
and I was like, this is absolutely true.

705
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm not even joking.

706
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm not even kidding.

707
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I was sick and tired of them extracting my surplus value

708
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
through whole foods, through their keto gummies.

709
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So I'm literally seizing the means of production

710
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and I'm decommodifying it.

711
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Well, that's not true.

712
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I still have to buy the ingredients, but I won't let them take it.

713
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Come and take it, as my hero Ted Cruz might say.

714
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You're seizing the means of the slight profit that they would get.

715
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Of this one thing that they sell to me.

716
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And it made me think about gardening.

717
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And I was like, I kind of see the appeal of having a garden

718
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
if it's making food that you actually use.

719
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But only...

720
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't know.

721
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Vegetables are so cheap, though.

722
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Vegetables are so cheap.

723
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So I don't know if it's...

724
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I think maybe people that have gardens, they get it

725
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
so that the vegetables are fresher.

726
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's not because, like, ah, now the greedy fat cat Jeff Bezos

727
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
who owns Whole Foods, he's not going to get my 79 cents

728
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
for this zucchini that I grew in my backyard.

729
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah, it's a lot of fresh.

730
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Not tall enough.

731
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I think it's mostly...

732
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Sorry, we keep cutting each other off

733
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
because you've got a lag to me

734
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and I keep thinking you're talking over me

735
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and you think I'm talking over you.

736
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The lag is kind of rough.

737
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But go on, what were you going to say?

738
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I just said free is cheaper than 79 cents, I guess.

739
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It made me think about that.

740
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And then I'm like, but vegetables aren't a huge drain.

741
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And then I'm like...

742
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But it's true, they're not expensive.

743
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah.

744
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So, like, what things...

745
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Like, to me, like, literally,

746
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
keto gummies are a thing that I would spend...

747
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Like, you buy them at the fucking store,

748
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
like $5 for, like, a 1.5 ounce bag.

749
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So, you know, it actually represents a significant savings

750
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
if I can just make them at home.

751
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I'm just thinking, like, I don't know,

752
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
probably I should do everything,

753
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
like, anything that I can possibly do,

754
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
like, that anything I can DIY

755
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and not have to buy from, like, a commercial vendor is good.

756
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
This gummy talk takes me back

757
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
to the last couple of times I was on.

758
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Really?

759
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I haven't actually talked about it in a while

760
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
because I've had no IMO.

761
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, but I think the last couple of times I was on,

762
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
you were doing gummy stuff almost on a weekly basis.

763
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I was, for a while.

764
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You were talking about it for a while.

765
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I should have been on the bingo card.

766
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Remember that bingo card you posted?

767
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yes, the bingo card that Vale made.

768
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And then I asked him,

769
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
hey, like, you should tweet that so I can retweet it.

770
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Like, so people will know that you made it.

771
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And he was like, he was like,

772
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
he didn't want people to know, like, what his Twitter was.

773
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So I was like, and he was just like,

774
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
no, you can just tweet it.

775
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And I was like, okay, I guess I will.

776
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And he didn't want to be associated with a PCP?

777
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I don't think it was that.

778
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I think it was, specifically,

779
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
he didn't want his Twitter account to be associated with it.

780
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because I guess he probably has, like,

781
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
maybe he's got, like, an account that he uses

782
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
for, I don't know, business, I have no fucking idea.

783
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Something else, I think that was it.

784
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I think I made a joke recently about how

785
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
all the recent stuff happening with the PCP

786
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
is kind of bad for the gamer's tavern brand at this point.

787
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You think so?

788
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We're poison on you.

789
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
No, it was just a joke.

790
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It reminded me of what that person told you one time

791
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
that the PCP is ruining the gamer's tavern brand.

792
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes, my friend thought that, you know,

793
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
ever since gamer's tavern went on the PCP,

794
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
he's, like, been more edgy.

795
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And it's like you were a bad influence on him.

796
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah, well, now maybe it's going to become true.

797
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What do you think?

798
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Hey, let's...

799
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
The prophecy is going to be fulfilled.

800
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Why don't you just go off?

801
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Go off and just badmouth Trixie for a while.

802
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll listen.

803
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Talk about how...

804
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Tell me about how good it is that she's gone

805
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and how you never liked her in the first place.

806
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Go.

807
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You don't actually have to do that.

808
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But I would enjoy it.

809
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I'll just say that I have read everything that has happened.

810
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And I have to say I'm firmly in the Ben St. Camp.

811
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
There's a small but vocal minority of people

812
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
who say that I am cringe.

813
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But I say to you, viewers, that they are...

814
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Some people are like, Ben, why are you so...

815
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
How come you're so mad about it?

816
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You're a little too salty, Ben.

817
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Don't you think you should just let it go?

818
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

819
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I feel personally grieved and offended

820
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and I'm upset about it.

821
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But at the same time, probably...

822
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Okay.

823
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I think a lot of people assume that you don't feel personally attacked

824
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
or offended by what Trixie's done

825
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
and you are just doing it for fun and to bully her.

826
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Which I guess it can come across like that.

827
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I guess if you thought that, it would be like Ben...

828
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Someone said, you know, I don't want to assume intent,

829
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
but it was on a couple episodes ago,

830
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
the one where Trixie had just left.

831
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Someone said in a comment, like,

832
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Gib and Tom, you should not be neutral.

833
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And Tom made a comment that was like,

834
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't want to just trash my former colleague just for clout.

835
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I don't want to assume that he was talking about me,

836
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
but it was a sentiment that other people echoed that was like,

837
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
yeah, that like, Ben, you're just dog piling on a victim

838
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
who can't defend themselves just for clout.

839
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And like, I don't agree with that.

840
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's not true.

841
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I have been feeling kind of weird about it in this one specific way,

842
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
where I'm like, you know, these things are happening.

843
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And I feel like I don't particularly care one way or the other too much about like,

844
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
like, you know, but like the whole RV thing, it's funny.

845
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Right.

846
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And I can see that it's funny.

847
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Visit isthereanrv.com, isthereanrv.com.

848
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yeah, that is pretty funny.

849
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
To see whether there is an RV yet.

850
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's like, I can see that it's kind of funny,

851
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
but I personally don't find like the intense, what do you call it,

852
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
anticipation for that whole thing to happen.

853
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Like, if it happened, I feel like I'm too distant from Trixie in that whole crowd.

854
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Well, they keep piping it.

855
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Well, they keep piping it.

856
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Well, that's, it's not about them.

857
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's about like, I'm wondering whether that means that I wasn't very close to Trixie

858
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
in the first place and that this breakup doesn't affect me so much because I didn't.

859
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Consider.

860
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I mean, that's how like a close as much.

861
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That's how I feel.

862
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's like, I mean, we barely even heard from her.

863
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
We barely even heard from her for like months and months and months.

864
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Honestly, like, you know, she's, yeah, I said this before, she's got her new,

865
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
she's got her new posse who support, who unconditionally support whatever she does.

866
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And like, I feel like there's no, there's no, there's no even interest in us anymore,

867
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
which is fine.

868
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I mean, yeah.

869
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I just feel weird because I, because I feel like.

870
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But then people turn around are like, oh, why are you, Ben, why are you,

871
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Ben, why are you trashing your friend, man?

872
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This is your friend.

873
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
No, it's not.

874
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
No, it's not.

875
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Shut up.

876
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You don't understand.

877
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You do not understand.

878
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You are projecting.

879
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You are projecting.

880
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't know.

881
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I feel like people are projecting on me a lot of the time when they say this stuff.

882
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I mean, there has been like that whole parasocial relationship.

883
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Like they've seen the PCP, they assume things.

884
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But like, I think I feel weird because I feel like I should be like more close to Trixie

885
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and therefore should feel more upset about what's happening with the whole like never

886
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
coming on the podcast again.

887
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I know Trixie like doesn't.

888
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
She said like Tom and Gibb.

889
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't mind you, but I hate Ben saying, and I was like, oh, well.

890
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, there it is.

891
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I don't think I saw that.

892
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
She said, she said.

893
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
In here, she said.

894
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
In here, she said like you guys contact, can contact me like about red.

895
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
About red stuff.

896
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah, specifically, I guess it's not put words in mouths, but I don't know.

897
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I feel like if I don't know whether I feel bad that I am not angrier at her.

898
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You know what I mean?

899
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I don't know.

900
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I mean, I don't know what's going on.

901
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
People are very invested and I don't feel invested and I feel like I should be.

902
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And I feel like that's an indication that it's bad.

903
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I don't know.

904
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I feel like you're saying two things at once.

905
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It simultaneously sounds like you're saying you feel bad that you are not more sad that

906
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
she has left, but also that you are.

907
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Feel bad that you are not more angry at her for her.

908
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Well, I just I feel.

909
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I feel kind of bad that I am not emotionally invested in whatever is going on to any any

910
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,000
any sort of extent that I feel like other people are and you seem to be.

911
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I am I am I honestly I'm cool.

912
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm cooling off.

913
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm cooling off in it a little bit because like there's not there's nothing to I've

914
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
made I've made my jokes.

915
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I've had my fun at their expense.

916
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I've made my feelings on them clear and like there's really nothing more to be said about

917
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
it.

918
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So I'm starting to cool off in a little bit like whatever.

919
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Well, there's nothing more to say on it now until something else happens that is.

920
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah.

921
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Well, sure.

922
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I mean, they could they could turn around and do something that I found grievously offensive

923
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
again.

924
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And then it would ignite my ire once more.

925
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I mean, sure, that's possible.

926
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I think it's only a matter of time.

927
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I mean, I don't know.

928
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Could be could be.

929
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Well, I agree pretty much with with your take on everything, even though I don't personally

930
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
have anything against Trixie.

931
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, she never did anything against me specifically.

932
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah.

933
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Just the just the

934
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
just that she just that she would it was really mostly just about

935
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
the lecture, the not releasing the lecture.

936
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I do it does offend me.

937
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It does offend me and upsets me.

938
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But the thing that made me really mad was just that she would let her she would let her

939
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
weird friends talk on our behalf about things that are not their business and are only our

940
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
business and then and then would defend that and then would get upset at me for objecting

941
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
to that.

942
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Like, that's the thing that I'm like, this is unacceptable.

943
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This is unacceptable.

944
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I agree.

945
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That's pretty weird.

946
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah.

947
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
OK, but like I said,

948
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
it's just there's only so much to even say about it.

949
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And I'm not like you give them.

950
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I'm not that I'm not that worried about it anymore.

951
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I don't know.

952
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Let the healing begin.

953
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't know.

954
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Maybe in a couple of years, she can come back on.

955
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
No.

956
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
No, thanks.

957
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Maybe if she makes a full apology.

958
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Maybe if she makes like a full and thorough apology to the point that I'm satisfied that

959
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
she has turned over a new leaf, but not under that's what it would take.

960
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
One of those apology videos I am.

961
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I hear so much.

962
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I would I would have I would I would take a lot of convincing.

963
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I would take a lot of convincing to turn me around on her at this point.

964
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But I guess I guess never say never.

965
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
That's I guess that's all I have to say about that.

966
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Looking forward to that Alulose.

967
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That's going to be pretty good.

968
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I got to say I got to say, though, I tried.

969
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I think even the company that inspired me to do this on the smart sweets like candy company,

970
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I think they have also switched to Alulose, at least partially.

971
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And I tried some of their.

972
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I tried some of them again recently and they have a different consistency to them.

973
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And honestly, it's not as good.

974
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I feel like the texture is not as good.

975
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And so I'm a little concerned that Alulose is not going.

976
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I don't really understand.

977
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
That's that's what I want to know.

978
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Can I fabricate it?

979
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
No, I don't know how it's made.

980
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I know it is.

981
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Okay, technically the FDA does not consider it to be a fiber per se,

982
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:57,000
but it is some sort of non digestible carbohydrate that comes from tapioca root.

983
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And that's what IMO is.

984
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And how how is it extracted from the root?

985
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I have absolutely no idea.

986
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I assume it involves some kind of like chemical reaction.

987
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Does this thing cause autism?

988
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's just what you assume when you hear about a chemical.

989
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah, why not?

990
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I don't know.

991
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
If it could be a solution.

992
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It is the culprit of some sort of autism.

993
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And honestly, I don't I literally don't even know what Alulose is.

994
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I don't know where it comes from.

995
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It comes from Alu plant.

996
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's, you know, I could, you know, I never did try corn fiber.

997
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Corn fiber is also corn fiber is actually considered a fiber and it is similar in its derivation,

998
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
but it has a different like consistency.

999
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I tried cooking gummies with corn fiber once or twice and they didn't come out well,

1000
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
but maybe I just didn't try hard enough.

1001
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
It's Oh, no, no, no, you know what the difference is is that IMO is naturally sweet.

1002
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Isomalt oligosaccharide syrup is like itself.

1003
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It is both a thickener and a sweetener, whereas corn fiber is like completely neutral.

1004
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So I would have to account for that.

1005
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Alulose is also sweetener.

1006
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
IMO doesn't IMO doesn't sound too safe.

1007
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's it's the worst.

1008
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
There are there are some there.

1009
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I guess there's some very niche community of like culinary or like chemical YouTubers who had, you know,

1010
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
they have maybe 10,000 subscribers.

1011
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
There's like four channels like this.

1012
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
They have 10,000 subscribers and there was a big blow up in their community,

1013
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
which means that maybe they got like 2,000 views on a video explaining it when the FDA decided that

1014
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
isomalt oligosaccharides, we will not we will not technically accept its categorization as a fiber.

1015
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You can no longer list it as tapioca fiber on your on your ingredient list.

1016
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You must now call it isomalt oligosaccharide use its full chemical name.

1017
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It was a big hullabaloo.

1018
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I don't think it was a PR thing so much as like people see chemical name on their product and they go,

1019
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I think I think it was that like people were talking about like, oh, isomalt oligosaccharides.

1020
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Is this a is this like a new like hot ingredient?

1021
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Is this like a new like a sugar alternative?

1022
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Is this going to be replacing sugar in a lot of new foods and think a lot of people were skeptical of it?

1023
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And then these people who were skeptical were vindicated by the FDA's decision to not technically categorize it as fiber.

1024
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And they were like, I called it.

1025
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I called it just like I called the election of 2020 and 2016.

1026
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I am a God.

1027
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
They said I told you isomalt oligosaccharide is poison.

1028
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It will give you autism.

1029
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It's probably is it expensive sounds like it's pretty expensive.

1030
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah, it's kind of expensive.

1031
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I mean, it's what was I paying?

1032
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I think I was paying like $11 for like a pound of it.

1033
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Wow, that's that's pretty pricey.

1034
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
That's pretty right.

1035
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm pretty pricey, but not as pricey as buying the gummies from Whole Foods.

1036
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I'm looking on Wikipedia for the manufacturing of isomalt oligolarisaccharide.

1037
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And they say it's made from just starch from, you know, cereal wheat barley, starch, normal old starch that you can buy.

1038
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Starch is first converted by means of a simple enzymatic hydrolysis into high maltose syrup with di tri and oligolarisaccharides.

1039
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I don't know what that means.

1040
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Sounds right.

1041
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Glycocytolinkages, which are really digestible in the human intestine.

1042
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,000
These things are further converted into digestion resistant glycosidic linkages.

1043
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Absolutely.

1044
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Creating something.

1045
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It's so difficult reading science Wikipedia.

1046
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Absolutely.

1047
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
That is all makes perfect sense to me.

1048
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I can personally tell us that that is accurate.

1049
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
They say they say simple enzymatic hydrolysis.

1050
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So all you need is to do simple high.

1051
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I'm going to click on the high.

1052
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Simple enzymatic hydrolysis.

1053
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
That really that's all it takes.

1054
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah.

1055
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Okay. Hydrolysis is any chemical reaction in which a molecule of water breaks one of.

1056
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Wait, does this just mean put it in water?

1057
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Does it just mean you dissolve?

1058
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Does it just mean you're dissolving it?

1059
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
No, no, no, it's not.

1060
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's not dissolving it because dissolving it is when.

1061
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
The molecules of a substance are the molecule itself is not separated.

1062
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Like like the molecules are intact.

1063
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
They just disperse through the water.

1064
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's talking about the water itself is like reacting to break the molecule into two.

1065
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Sure.

1066
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Substances.

1067
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So it's not it's not just simple dissolution.

1068
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Sure, but it involves putting water next to it.

1069
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Didn't you major in physics or something?

1070
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
In it's technically not just dissolving it in water, but in practice.

1071
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Yes, it's just putting it in water and dissolving it.

1072
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You just put it in water.

1073
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
When I carbohydrate is broken into its component sugar molecules by hydrolysis.

1074
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
This is recognized as saccharification.

1075
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So it turns it into a saccharide.

1076
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So saccharide from Smash Bros.

1077
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Smash Bros.

1078
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
This is when this is like this is like this is the opposite of bimbofication is

1079
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
saccharized saccharization.

1080
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
It's when you turn sweet and nice.

1081
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I really feel like this means you could just buy like the sort of starch they use,

1082
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
put it in water and then this third thing that I can't figure out if we can crack the code.

1083
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Can you link me this?

1084
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Can you link me this article?

1085
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's just Wikipedia, but yeah.

1086
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So you're going to start cooking this stuff in your house like making drugs or something.

1087
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Like cooking in a bathtub and in a skill.

1088
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah, you make a fucking ton of it.

1089
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You make an entire gummy.

1090
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You're going to become the Walter White of gummies.

1091
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
This is this is what I that's literally what I wanted.

1092
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Like I would love to just have like buy like the basic like what's the word like elemental

1093
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
materials like carbon nitrogen stuff and just like combine the molecules from like their

1094
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,000
most base forms into like into, you know, benzene rings and chain the benzene rings together

1095
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
to form complex carbohydrates and then, you know, and then fold them, fold the carbohydrate,

1096
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
fold the benzene rings in the complex carbohydrates over a thousand times to harden them.

1097
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah.

1098
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Have an entire laboratory in your house.

1099
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Oh, oh my God.

1100
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Yeah.

1101
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Gluc isomalto oligosaccharides are glucose oligomers with alpha D one six linkages including

1102
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:29,000
isomaltos panos isomalto trios isomalto tetrose isomalto pentose.

1103
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Nigeros cojibeos and higher branched oligosaccharides.

1104
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
This is this is a whole new world.

1105
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
This is a whole world of saccharides.

1106
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Oh, so.

1107
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So is there any specific isomalto oligosaccharides that you were using or is it could you use

1108
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
any one of them?

1109
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Is it just one thing?

1110
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Um, I mean, hold on.

1111
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I will, I have the packaging.

1112
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I have the packaging right here.

1113
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And I think it just says it doesn't specify.

1114
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Yeah.

1115
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The first ingredient is isomalto oligosaccharides parentheses vegetable source.

1116
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So you don't even have to specify.

1117
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You don't even have to specify whether you're using isomalto tetrose or nigeros or cojibeos

1118
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
or any of the higher branched oligosaccharides.

1119
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
They're all they all fall under the same the same banner according to the FDA.

1120
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I guess experimenting to find the perfect saccharide.

1121
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I literally I'll just have to find every vegetable and and, you know, hydrolysis it,

1122
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
which just soak it in water and just see like what what fibrous fibrous powders float to the surface.

1123
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
We could go even further back.

1124
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Like if they use the starch from from foods, how do you make starch?

1125
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Could you just could you just grow your own food, start to fire it and then

1126
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
enzymatically hydrolysis it into a fucking oligosaccharides and then make that into gummies?

1127
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Could you do the entire thing?

1128
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Here's here's the important part.

1129
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Isomalto oligosaccharides are a normal part of the human diet and occur naturally in fermented foods such as sourdough,

1130
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
breads and kimchi.

1131
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But it has been identified as a natural constituent of honey.

1132
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And although chemically related, it isn't.

1133
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
OK, that's a different thing.

1134
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
IMO is a sweet tasting high density syrup, which could be sprayed dried into powder form.

1135
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
OK, the thing about it, the thing about this stuff, it sounds really bizarre,

1136
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
but it's actually delicious.

1137
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Like you can just like this goo that you get this stuff that you fucking hydrolysis

1138
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
out of, you know, complex carbohydrates.

1139
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It is it is just like a clear, like sweet syrup.

1140
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It kind of tastes like it kind of tastes like agave nectar.

1141
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's delicious.

1142
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's incredible.

1143
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I would live on it and nothing else if I could.

1144
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's like.

1145
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm like, I'm like me with isomalto oligosaccharides is like fry in that episode with a slurm when the slurm queen squirts out

1146
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
super slurm from her.

1147
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I just saw a clip of that the other day.

1148
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I also just saw a clip of that the other day.

1149
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
They must have been going around.

1150
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It must have been a part of the YouTube algorithm.

1151
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Someone someone tweeted it with like an attached thing that's like, I don't know,

1152
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,000
it was probably like, huh, this is like this is just like the Biden administration

1153
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
and bombing the Middle East or something is like fry in super slurm.

1154
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It seems kind of random.

1155
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah.

1156
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Well, I mean, considering like who I follow on Twitter, that's that's the kind of take I would expect to see.

1157
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah.

1158
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah.

1159
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But that's me though.

1160
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
If I would, I would recommend you.

1161
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Okay.

1162
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You can.

1163
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
There are vendors on there are vendors on Alibaba who will sell the stuff.

1164
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Like they won't sell you like a reasonable amount.

1165
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
They will sell you like 10 pounds of it or even 100 pounds of it, which is what I would want.

1166
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
They will only sell it to you in metric tons, which is bad.

1167
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But they will sell you like a sample bag of like one kilogram of it, which is not very much.

1168
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And it'll cost you like $50 because they have to ship it to you from from China.

1169
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But if you are curious, I would actually recommend buy like a sample bag of one kilogram of Isomolta

1170
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:50,000
oligosaccharide syrup and you will get it in like a like zip tied like sealed like hermetically sealed plastic bag.

1171
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And you can just open it up and eat a spoonful of it and you will discover a whole new world of sweetness.

1172
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Well, I do have to caution from ordering stuff from China like in weird powdered form because sometimes they don't have very good regulations over there.

1173
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And that stuff can be contaminated with, you know, foreign substances.

1174
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
No, no, no, they come with the entire thing is a foreign substance because it's from China.

1175
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That's true. That's true. That's a good point.

1176
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:33,000
No, no, no, the whole the whole thing is a is a it comes with a certificate of purity that says like what percentage of the substance it is.

1177
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And it's usually like 99.99%.

1178
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You know, they sell to you they sell it's it's it's all very it's all very official.

1179
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It's all very I got mine.

1180
01:01:46,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I got mine from and you can look this up you can get this yourself you can buy one kilogram of of IMO syrup from tapioca source for $53 and 50 cents from a company called Focus Herb Corp.

1181
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Focus Herb innovation is our nature is their slogan.

1182
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
That's a pretty good slogan.

1183
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Oh, you can buy they sell.

1184
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Wait a minute. Oh my God, they sell all kinds of great stuff.

1185
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:30,000
They sell only anolic acid, muslinic acid, hydroxy hydroxy tyrosol and only European.

1186
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Well, you know, all kinds of all kinds of good stuff on offer here at Focus Herb.

1187
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,000
A subsidiary of Shang Zifu Heng FH Biotechnology Corporation Limited.

1188
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
They are they are related to the Umbrella Corporation.

1189
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Is that is that from Resident Evil?

1190
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yes, the evil company from Resident Evil that spread the zombie virus.

1191
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I've never played a Resident Evil, but I still got the reference.

1192
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Do you remember there was an image going around of I don't know whether that was actually real.

1193
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Maybe it was of a Chinese bio lab that had a very similar logo to the Umbrella Corporation around the time COVID was happening.

1194
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Oh, yeah, I remember what you're talking about.

1195
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I was like, oh, no, I don't maybe maybe that sort of rings a bell.

1196
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Yeah, I remember this vaguely.

1197
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I don't know if it's real or not might have might have just been a joke.

1198
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,000
No jokes, that kind of thing that I've heard of jokes.

1199
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I have no idea what you mean.

1200
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Okay, this is it seems too similar to be real, but I don't know.

1201
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I don't know if it's fake or real, but it's like it's pretty bad PR.

1202
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's just got green arrows instead of red arrows.

1203
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah, wait.

1204
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Oh, wow.

1205
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:12,000
If this is real, it's not a very good idea to brand yourself in this way.

1206
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
This seems this seems like too much of a coincidence.

1207
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I don't think I believe it.

1208
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
No, I don't think I buy it.

1209
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But now that I'm thinking about it and looking, yeah, it seems to be debunked.

1210
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Oh, it's probably not real.

1211
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Well, that's good news for Shanghai, Rui-Lan, Bau-Hu-San, biotech limited.

1212
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Yeah, what if I Google that?

1213
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
What do I actually see?

1214
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Maybe they're the ones that can fucking stuff speaking of locations in the world.

1215
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I've been playing a lot of geography quiz stuff.

1216
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I've been playing GeoGuessr today.

1217
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I got almost a perfect score.

1218
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I was looking around.

1219
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I'm really annoyed, but I guess it's understandable.

1220
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The GeoGuessr is now a subscription service.

1221
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
You can play it for free, but only once per day.

1222
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That's the one.

1223
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's with no R, or GeoGuessr, right?

1224
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah, no U.

1225
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It says create account to play.

1226
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It says I have to create a game.

1227
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Wait, is this the thing that I was playing the other week?

1228
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
No, it's different.

1229
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You mean the thing I linked where it was just the map of the world?

1230
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yeah, what was that?

1231
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
That was online.cetera.com

1232
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Cetera, okay.

1233
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So what's GeoGuessr?

1234
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
GeoGuessr is like Google Maps, you go down into street view,

1235
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and you are tossed with trying to figure out where the fuck on Earth you are,

1236
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
and you can zoom around, you can click around just like in Google Maps, Google Earth, whatever.

1237
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
You move your little guy around the streets, you look at things, you zoom in,

1238
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,000
you figure it out based on, you know, the location, the street signs, things like that.

1239
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And it's really fun because it's like detective work.

1240
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You have to look for clues, you know, you're plopped down some random place

1241
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:30,000
that's in the Google Maps archive of photograph, you know, 360 camera stuff.

1242
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You could be fucking anywhere, and you have to figure it out, and it's, you know,

1243
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
it's just so satisfying doing the detective work to like, okay,

1244
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
cars are driving on this side of the road, so it can't be these countries, it could be these ones.

1245
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It looks like a hot climate, probably this sort of area, but I'm not sure.

1246
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
The language, Spanish, that could be Spain, that could be South America, you know, like,

1247
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
you got to look at things like that, and then you got to narrow it down, find landmarks.

1248
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It was extremely fun. I loved you, I guess. I'm really annoyed that I have to pay for it.

1249
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm probably just not going to play it that much.

1250
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Yeah, that sounds pretty interesting, you know.

1251
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Remember the sick acapella theme song to Carmen San Diego?

1252
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I remember the regular theme song, but not...

1253
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
What?

1254
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
What do you mean, what?

1255
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Chrono, you remember.

1256
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Are you talking about the regular theme song?

1257
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Yeah, the like, the acapella version, it's...

1258
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Was it played on the actual show?

1259
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Yeah, it was in the show, yeah, it was in the show.

1260
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah, then I probably do know what you're talking about.

1261
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
She puts the miss in misdemeanor when she stole the beans from Lima.

1262
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1263
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
How good is that?

1264
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
From the Red Sea to Greenland, they'll be singing the blues.

1265
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Got tips.

1266
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh, colors.

1267
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,000
She steals their soul in South Korea, makes Antarctica cry uncle.

1268
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Oh, no.

1269
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Somebody's got to find this girl and kill her.

1270
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
They tried finding her.

1271
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
The only person who could find Carmen San Diego is Waldo.

1272
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I was going to make that joke.

1273
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I remember I really liked where in time is Carmen San Diego.

1274
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And I literally, the reason I liked it is because it had crappy early 90s CG visual effects.

1275
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And I just thought those were so fucking cool.

1276
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:56,000
When I was a little kid, the incredibly, the horribly, the horribly dated CG,

1277
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Megazord transformation from the Power Rangers movie, that was my shit.

1278
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
That was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.

1279
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I remember that.

1280
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah.

1281
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
With the slime guy?

1282
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Ivan Ooze.

1283
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Ivan Ooze.

1284
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I remember that, that, that giant, like he becomes the size of a planet or something.

1285
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And he's like, I'm so evil.

1286
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And then he dies.

1287
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,000
But that, yeah, there's nothing quite like seeing CG on TV for the first time or first few times.

1288
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Where it's like, no, early, early, like Power Rangers and shit like that.

1289
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
But that's something that something zoomers will never get to experience.

1290
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I suppose.

1291
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
They grew up, they grew up with CG.

1292
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Whatever.

1293
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
They'll never experience everything that already happened.

1294
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
They will never get, well, but they will never specifically get to see like bad,

1295
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
like objectively bad CG and be like blown away by it like I want.

1296
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Yeah.

1297
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
They really missed out.

1298
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
They really did, for real.

1299
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Well, you know, millennials will never get to experience bagpuss for the first time and be scared shitless by a talking cat.

1300
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That's a real cat and it's talking, but it's not actually, it's a puppet.

1301
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
She'll ransack Pakistan and run a scam in Scandinavia.

1302
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Then she'll stick them up down under and go pickpocket Perth.

1303
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Why is she such a bitch?

1304
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
She's such a bitch.

1305
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
She doesn't even do it.

1306
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
She doesn't even do it for money.

1307
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
She went all the way to Lima to steal some fucking beans.

1308
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
She stole all the beans.

1309
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
She stole all the beans from Lima, not because they were like worth money.

1310
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
No, no.

1311
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It's like Lima's got some good beans.

1312
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It wasn't all the beans.

1313
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It wasn't all the beans.

1314
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It was a misdemeanor.

1315
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It would have only been like a fucking handful of beans.

1316
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
She just wanted to make the pun.

1317
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
She had to do a misdemeanor.

1318
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Oh yeah, you're right.

1319
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
It is.

1320
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
She had to miss and misdemeanor when she stole the beans.

1321
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So she was like, she had to pay a fine.

1322
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
She had to pay a fine.

1323
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
She flew all around the fucking world.

1324
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Little annoying petty crimes that people can't catch her.

1325
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:18,000
But it was just like that line from, it was just like that line from Final Fantasy Tactics.

1326
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
If the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class.

1327
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And she's like, you know what?

1328
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I'm well off enough.

1329
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I'll just steal all the beans from Lima.

1330
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I'll take the pun.

1331
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It's fine.

1332
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
She's probably a billionaire.

1333
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I'll take the fine.

1334
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
It's fine, she said.

1335
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
That's not a very good rhyme.

1336
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's not, no, it's a, it's, that's, it just sounds like something, sounds like a gamer's tavern joke.

1337
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I don't know.

1338
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Yeah, it does.

1339
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I don't know.

1340
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Isn't there like a rule that you can't, if there's a pun or a rhyme, it can't be exactly the same word.

1341
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
But it's, the point is, the point isn't that it's a rhyme.

1342
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The point is that it's the same word that means two different things.

1343
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Does it, wait, say it again?

1344
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Yeah, that's, that's known as a pun in some circles.

1345
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Yeah, I'll take the fine.

1346
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
It's fine.

1347
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Oh yeah, you're right.

1348
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah, of course.

1349
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Of course I'm right.

1350
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It's just not a very good one.

1351
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
It's, shout out.

1352
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It's fine.

1353
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It's fine, actually.

1354
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's a perfectly fine and decent.

1355
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Perfectly fine and that it is like sand that is very not coarse.

1356
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It slips through my fingers easily.

1357
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
But I really, I really like the, the writing and Final Fantasy tactics.

1358
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I think it's very good.

1359
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I, yeah, people say it's one of the best written RPGs.

1360
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I, I've said this before, but I, I'm one of the many, many people that got stuck in, in that, in the castle

1361
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
against, um, will, will we graph?

1362
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
We grow?

1363
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Yeah, something like that.

1364
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Yeah, I got stuck in that castle and I never finished the game.

1365
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And now I just don't have the patience.

1366
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I just don't have the patience for JRPGs anymore.

1367
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I'm just not interested in like a dialogue heavy fucking 60 hour game like that.

1368
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I'm just, I'm just not into it.

1369
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:23,000
It's cause a lot of them are like you're, you're following a character as they grow in this harsh world

1370
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
and the leveling up is sort of, it's, it's mirroring the story that's happening.

1371
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But you've, I've seen this story so many times.

1372
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
It's not that exciting to see that he gets strong at the end and beats the bad guy.

1373
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And I also don't want to do all that grinding.

1374
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So like, I don't care.

1375
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Actually, yeah, yeah.

1376
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's with a problem.

1377
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
It's not actually the, I mean, I'm hesitant.

1378
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I don't read enough anymore, but it's the thing that I think would drag it down for me.

1379
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's not the, it's not that it's heavy dialogue.

1380
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It's not that there's a lot of reading.

1381
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It's that the battles just take like an hour apiece.

1382
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And I'm just like, just give me, just put me in Noida and give me a wand that goes, that's all I want.

1383
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I don't have the patience to play RPGs anymore either.

1384
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
But back when I did Final Fantasy Tactics was pretty good.

1385
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I, I mean, I loved that whole, the tactical RPG genre.

1386
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
That was my favorite genre in like the PlayStation X era.

1387
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Whatever.

1388
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
What if you just say PlayStation X?

1389
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I don't know.

1390
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I just remember reading, I remember reading a Game Informer and because there was a PlayStation 2, they would abbreviate PlayStation as PSX.

1391
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I don't know why they just, that's what they would do.

1392
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I played, last week I struggled to remember the name and then I remembered it was Front Mission.

1393
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Front Mission 3, I think was the one that I liked.

1394
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
That one's on the PlayStation.

1395
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Yeah.

1396
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I remember there was another one called Vandal.

1397
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
No, Vandal Hearts was like the more traditional fantasy one.

1398
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Vanguard Bandits was the one.

1399
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Okay.

1400
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Front Mission was the one where you were in mechs, but it was like a gritty, like futuristic sci-fi.

1401
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Vanguard Bandits, you were in mechs, but it was like fantasy anime mechs.

1402
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And they were like powered by like jewels.

1403
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And there was like this one like holy ancient mech that like the good, that like the good campaign was like based around like finding and like taking back your rightful throne as Prince of the Kingdom or whatever.

1404
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That game was like kind of bad.

1405
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And like, I think even when I bought it, like I went to this, like I went to fucking GameStop and looking for it.

1406
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And I asked someone like, hey, do you got Vanguard Bandits?

1407
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And the guy was like, oh yeah, we got that.

1408
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Yeah, I'm not that into that game.

1409
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I've heard of this game, but I've never played it.

1410
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Funny thing, okay, it plays like Final Fantasy Tactics.

1411
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
You got mechs and like you got your characters in your mechs.

1412
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And like the characters have some abilities of their own, but mostly it's the mech that determines like what the character can do in battle.

1413
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And they, I don't know, they do like a tactical RPG thing and you can put different characters, different mechs and you upgrade them a little bit.

1414
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You can give them different gems that give them different powers.

1415
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:34,000
There are like multiple story paths, like whether you want to become, you know, take your place as king of the kingdom or whether you want to like become an evil conqueror and like take over the empire.

1416
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Or there's like a third one where you become like a renegade and start your own, I don't know, anarcho-syndicalist commune or whatever.

1417
01:16:41,000 --> 01:17:01,000
But then the funny thing is whenever you do an attack in this tactical RPG, the game goes to like a fully, it's not very good, but it's like an animated like 3G, 3D polygonal cutscene basically where the two robots will like do the attacks on one another.

1418
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And it takes ages, but I was so into it.

1419
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
That's a kid.

1420
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
It looked so cool.

1421
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I think Front Mission also does that, doesn't it?

1422
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Does it?

1423
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I don't think it does it to the same extent.

1424
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I don't, I don't think so.

1425
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I think Front Mission 3, you would just see the little, you would just see your little pixel man like shoot the little little missiles or guns.

1426
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I'm pretty sure you can see it in 3D, but you can turn that animation off in the options.

1427
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Because I have actually played Front Mission 3.

1428
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I remember being frustrated because in Front Mission 3, you can eject your guy.

1429
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Like the cool part about Front Mission 3 is that you can, you can choose in a battle to not destroy, but merely disable like an enemy's mech.

1430
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:57,000
And if that happens, you can eject your little person from your mech and have him go and run and jump into the enemy mech and take it over.

1431
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And like while he's out on the ground, he's really slow and he's really vulnerable and any mech that attacks him will just completely obliterate him.

1432
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Which is really, really cool.

1433
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You can steal enemy mechs like that.

1434
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And you can't do that in Vanguard Bandits.

1435
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,000
There's no way to like eject your guy and steal an enemy's mech in that game.

1436
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But from what I remember, that feature in Front Mission 3 wasn't very useful because it was pretty difficult to do and enemy mechs weren't that good.

1437
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I, I don't, I was, I mean, I was a young teen at the time.

1438
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I think I just thought it was cool.

1439
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I think I thought it was cool and I wanted to do it.

1440
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
There was a game for the Super Nintendo called Metal Warriors where you could do the same thing.

1441
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You can jump out of your mech and go into other mechs, but it wasn't a tactical RPG.

1442
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It was a, it was a side-scrolling action game.

1443
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Metal Warriors.

1444
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah, I remember renting that one when I was a kid.

1445
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I don't think it's too good, but it was very interesting.

1446
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I remember this box art, but I don't think I ever, I think I probably saw this box art at Blockbuster.

1447
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
The, the really good, the, the better mech game for the Super Nintendo is Cybernator.

1448
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It has a different name in, in, in Europe.

1449
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I forget what it was called in Europe, but in US it was Cybernator.

1450
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
That one's pretty good.

1451
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I, you know what, I think I probably, I was never into like sci-fi and like mechs and stuff.

1452
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I think I might have seen both of these games and just been like, eh, eh, it's nerd shit.

1453
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Uh, uh, uh, Final Fantasy, uh, Swords and Sorcery please, for chads like me.

1454
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Actually, um, in my opinion, the, the most fun front mission game I ever played is, uh,

1455
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I think it's called Front Mission Gun Hazard, and it was for the Super Famicom.

1456
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Uh, but there is a translation patch you can download to play it.

1457
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It's a side-scrolling action RPG with mechs and, uh, you can buy parts and level up.

1458
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And, uh, it's pretty cool.

1459
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Front Mission Gun, Gun Hazard.

1460
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I have a review of it on my website.

1461
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Look at, okay, okay, okay.

1462
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I, this is such, um, this is so, uh, this is so like, wait, no it is, it's Squaresoft.

1463
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Oh, it's Squaresoft.

1464
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yeah, it's made by Squaresoft.

1465
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Okay, this looks like, who's the Final Fantasy artist?

1466
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
This looks like, this looks like someone trying to do, this is either him being really lazy

1467
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
or it's someone doing like a bad impression of his art style.

1468
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Yeah, I don't remember the name of the artist, but I know who you're talking about.

1469
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
The guy who did the art for Final Fantasy VI and V.

1470
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
He does it for all of them, yeah.

1471
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And he did, and I think he did a bunch of the Metal Gear Solid, um, like, concept art

1472
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
and he did a bunch of like, stuff for them to, Yoshitaka Amano.

1473
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Yoshitaka Amano.

1474
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah, that's-

1475
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
No, maybe he, maybe I'm thinking of someone else who did the Metal Gear stuff.

1476
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Um, yeah.

1477
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But this looks like, this box art, it's like, it looks like his style, but it looks bad.

1478
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So, I don't know what's going on there.

1479
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I've never seen the box art, but the game itself looks pretty cool.

1480
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It looks like Cybernator, but it has action RPG elements and it has a story.

1481
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And the story is pretty decent.

1482
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I like that, I like that.

1483
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Was it a side scroller?

1484
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yeah, it's a side scroller, so you don't have to, you know, do the turn-based combat stuff.

1485
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I like the turn-based combat stuff when I was a kid.

1486
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I felt, I felt so fucking smart.

1487
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I felt so fucking smart beating games like that.

1488
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
It's like, damn.

1489
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
This is like a tactical, I'm making tactical choices and obliterating my foes.

1490
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Well, if you, uh, if you beat Final Fantasy Tactics as a kid, that was a pretty good accomplishment.

1491
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But I did-

1492
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
That game is actually pretty complicated.

1493
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But you know that I didn't.

1494
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You know that I, that I, uh, got stuck in the WeeGraph's castle.

1495
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Oh yeah, I just, I just forgot about that.

1496
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I did, I did beat it as a kid and, um, it's pretty, uh, it's pretty impressive.

1497
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I was able to beat it at, at that age.

1498
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Um, I, I mean, I really like, I really like that it has permadeath.

1499
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I've always loved games with permadeath.

1500
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Always, always, always.

1501
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Does that mean you're like Fire Emblem?

1502
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I've never played Fire.

1503
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I probably would have loved Fire Emblem as a kid, but I never played-

1504
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You've never played Fire Emblem?

1505
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
No, not a single one.

1506
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
That's, uh, that's weird.

1507
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Is that weird?

1508
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I don't know whether you'd be into it today, though.

1509
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I would, it would be cool if you-

1510
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I don't, I don't think I would.

1511
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Yeah, those are good.

1512
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
GBA, especially.

1513
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:12,000
What I like about Fire Emblem is that it's probably one of the fastest-paced, uh, tactical RPGs you can play.

1514
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That's, I mean, that's good.

1515
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Oh yeah.

1516
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
That's a-

1517
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
It's, it's lightning quick.

1518
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
It really does not feel like a turn-based RPG of any kind.

1519
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:27,000
You, you have your guys, and the only thing you need to worry about, aside from positioning, positioning is the main thing.

1520
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It's positioning and, uh, the weapons they have.

1521
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
And you can, sometimes you can buy new weapons.

1522
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
A lot of the time you'll get weapons from killing enemies or getting chests.

1523
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And the whole game, at least Fire Emblem 7 and 8, um, they're very linear.

1524
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Um, 7's, uh, particularly.

1525
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So it's all, like, you, you can't, like, go back to an area to grind in 7.

1526
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So everything in the game is laid out in such a way that you can always do it, um, unless you really majorly fuck things up.

1527
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It does have permadeath.

1528
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I like that.

1529
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I like that it, I like that it, like, yeah, grinding and, like, playing the game in a boring way.

1530
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Like, isn't even an option.

1531
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Like, it's just, it's just like, you must progress.

1532
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I like that.

1533
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
There is, there is one way, but it's extremely dangerous.

1534
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
You can go into, like, in certain levels, there's like an arena, like a gladiatorial arena.

1535
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
You, you send your little guy in there and you can wager if you will win the fight.

1536
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And, uh, the only thing you can do is just watch them wail on an enemy and then you can press a button to, to run away and lose the money.

1537
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
But if they die in the arena, they die.

1538
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
That's it.

1539
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And you don't get the money as well.

1540
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And so you can play a level, but you can, but you can, but you can save scum it, right?

1541
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
No, no.

1542
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Fire Emblem has a unique thing where, um, every action you take is permanently saved for that playthrough of that level.

1543
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:08,000
So if you fuck up and die, the only way to reset is to reset the entire level, which makes the stakes on the longer levels like raise and,

1544
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and when you get to the very end of the final levels of the thing, you're like, Holy shit.

1545
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
This took so long to get here.

1546
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Don't fuck up.

1547
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Oh my God.

1548
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
You know, it's very tense.

1549
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
What console?

1550
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
What console is this on?

1551
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It's on GBA.

1552
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I don't know how they did it, but like it was just sort of.

1553
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
They have like, oh wow.

1554
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That's badass.

1555
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
You could turn, you could turn the power off.

1556
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
That's badass that they wouldn't even let you save scum it.

1557
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
No, yeah.

1558
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So like if, if you're, if you're a little kid, you lose someone, you cry.

1559
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:45,000
You click the little power button and you turn it back on and then you reload and it loads exactly at the moment that you turned it off.

1560
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
So you see them die a second time.

1561
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And you cry again.

1562
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And then you realize, you realize that you have to restart level.

1563
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Fuck.

1564
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Fuck yes.

1565
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:05,000
But you can restart the level and you do have to do everything all over again, but it's better than losing that Pegas this night.

1566
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I'll tell you that.

1567
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Yes.

1568
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Um, all right.

1569
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
That's pretty cool.

1570
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
You should play Fire Emblem 7 on emulator or something.

1571
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Oh, I mean, it's got, it's got cool characters in it, but that's mostly the fun gameplay.

1572
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
The seventh one is the second GBA one, right?

1573
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Yeah.

1574
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
The one with Ellen Woodland and Hector, the first English translated one.

1575
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.

1576
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
What I should probably give a try is, um, Hades, which I bought at the same time.

1577
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I told you that people were telling me Hades was good, so I went and bought Hades, but then it recommended me Noida and then I also just also picked up Noida on a whim.

1578
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
And then I ended up getting insanely addicted to Noida and I haven't even played Hades at all.

1579
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Um, I should give, I should give that one a shot.

1580
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,000
The games that, that studio makes, they made like, what was it called, Bastion and some other ones?

1581
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah, um, Transistor.

1582
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Transistor and yeah, so I think there's another one between.

1583
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Yeah, I've been hearing a lot about it.

1584
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I haven't played any, I haven't played any of their older games by the way.

1585
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Those, those all look cool and I can appreciate that they're beautiful, but there's something about that camera angle that really annoys me and I just don't want to play a game in that camera angle looking down.

1586
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
You know what?

1587
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
You know what?

1588
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I feel the same way.

1589
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I feel the same way.

1590
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It just kind of inherently feels, I don't know, not as engaging as like a side scroller to me.

1591
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Yeah, the isometric, I know exactly what you mean.

1592
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
And I, and I can't, I can't justify it.

1593
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Yeah.

1594
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
There's no good reason.

1595
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:55,000
There's no way I could say, oh, I don't know about those games because of something like that, but it is, I mean, I've told, talked before about how like, if a game is in 3D, I just like it more than if it was in 3D.

1596
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
It's just some things that just resonate with me a lot.

1597
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I feel kind of the opposite.

1598
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
When a game is in 2D, I tend to like it more than 3D, probably because I guess I grew up with 2D games.

1599
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I think I'm with you.

1600
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I think I'm a 2D guy.

1601
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
If I had to pick.

1602
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
If I had to pick one or the other.

1603
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I know it's not a fair way to judge things.

1604
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
It's just a bias.

1605
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
No, not at all.

1606
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It's completely unfair.

1607
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
It's arbitrary.

1608
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
It's, it's not fair, but it is fair.

1609
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
But I can't help it.

1610
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah.

1611
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Yep.

1612
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
That's right.

1613
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Exactly.

1614
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Speaking of games, are you, Gib, are you caught up on Psycholonials?

1615
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Chapter 8.

1616
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yes.

1617
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Yes.

1618
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Shit's really, shit's really going places.

1619
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Shit's really getting, getting down to it now.

1620
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Only one more chapter left and.

1621
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Yeah.

1622
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Oh, yeah.

1623
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I can't wait.

1624
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Can't fucking wait.

1625
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Yeah.

1626
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Spoiler alert.

1627
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Watch, I mean, yeah, read Psycholonials.

1628
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It's a technically a video game, but it's weird to say play it because there's not yet any

1629
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
interactivity.

1630
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
It's, it's, there's hints.

1631
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I mean, it's basically.

1632
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
That's hints of future interactivity.

1633
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
But.

1634
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I, I don't think there will actually be any.

1635
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I think it's, I think it's a red herring.

1636
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I don't know.

1637
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I feel like, I feel like the, the, the, the pull the rug on out from under the player sort

1638
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
of moment would be get them thinking that they can't, they don't have a choice.

1639
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
And then finally like do the same thing again and chapter nine, the last chapter.

1640
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And this time the choice actually does something and people like, wait, I didn't, I didn't know.

1641
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Oh, and then you see the consequences.

1642
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Maybe that would be a thing.

1643
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
It would make, it would make for like a mechanical surprise.

1644
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
It would be, it would be pulling the rug out from under you, but I feel like narratively,

1645
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I don't know.

1646
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I mean, it would depend on what he did with it.

1647
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It would feel, I would feel like it was a little cheap.

1648
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
My inclination would be to think it's kind of cheap to like, oh, well, well, let's end

1649
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:08,000
the story with like two endings and you get to choose which one and oh, you go and you

1650
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,000
do one and, and it does one ending and you do another and it does another ending or something

1651
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
like that.

1652
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I had like this idea that like, once you get the final chapter and have seen everything,

1653
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
all the choices that were presented to you before, you could now see what would happen

1654
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
if you had made different ones or, you know, see made different ones.

1655
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Maybe.

1656
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Yeah, maybe.

1657
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But yeah, it's getting really heated.

1658
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's, it's getting very heated.

1659
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I really enjoyed, I really am enjoying the presentation of these things.

1660
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
It's just, I agree.

1661
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:53,000
It's just a really nice story and it's told in a way that's unique and cool.

1662
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I like Z.

1663
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:02,000
It's very, it's very homestuck in some ways and it's very not homestuck in others and

1664
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I think it works pretty well for the story it's trying to tell.

1665
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And I like the objectively bad visual presentation of it.

1666
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I think it's good and makes it better.

1667
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yeah.

1668
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I am.

1669
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Oh, I was a bit annoyed.

1670
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Did you see that the Sarah Zed video about homestuck that dropped on 413?

1671
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I, I heard about it.

1672
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
People linked it.

1673
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I didn't watch it though, because it was really long and I was like,

1674
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
what are they going to say?

1675
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Great pain or something?

1676
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I didn't, I didn't want to watch it at first because I was like,

1677
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Oh, what does she know about homestuck?

1678
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I was there, man.

1679
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I was there.

1680
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
But no, it turns out she is like an old homestuck fan.

1681
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So I was like, okay, this is actually fine.

1682
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I'm fine.

1683
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And then, but I was a little annoyed because she talked about like,

1684
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
you know, the Kickstarter, she talked about Hiveswap,

1685
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
she talked about Homestuck 2.

1686
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
She didn't even mention Psycholonials, which I mean,

1687
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I'm a little disappointed because I like Psycholonials and I would like to hear it mentioned,

1688
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
but also because like, isn't that sort of relevant to like the state?

1689
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Because like, Homestuck 2 basically did a thing like,

1690
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
like they're canceling their Patreon.

1691
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And it seems to be in a, in like a pretty like,

1692
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
who knows what's going to happen with it.

1693
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
So you would think the fact that like, oh,

1694
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Hussie then went and made this other unrelated thing.

1695
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I don't know, it just seems important and I don't know why it didn't get mentioned.

1696
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I was like, hmm, weird.

1697
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
So that was unfortunate.

1698
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
But other than that, it was like a pretty good,

1699
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
it was a pretty good like rundown of like,

1700
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
most of the video is actually devoted to like,

1701
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
post Homestuck bullshit that happened,

1702
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
like HiveSwap and the Kickstarter and stuff.

1703
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Maybe the first like quarter of it is talking about like,

1704
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
the experience of like, what was going on when the comic was actually running,

1705
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
but like, it's good, it's good.

1706
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Yeah.

1707
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Homestuck is how I feel during the pandemic.

1708
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
You guys talked over each other.

1709
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Sorry about that.

1710
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
No, it's fine.

1711
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Don't worry about it.

1712
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I just made a really stupid joke.

1713
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Something about the pandemic.

1714
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Hey, it's too soon.

1715
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
You can't joke about that.

1716
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Just like 9-11.

1717
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It's too soon.

1718
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Yes.

1719
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And it always will be.

1720
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I was saying the Hussie's Instagram,

1721
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
he's posted a new very unusual set of images.

1722
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Really?

1723
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Okay.

1724
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:46,000
He's got like, he's got coloured hair and extremely pixelated faces on clothing

1725
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and he's got a basketball.

1726
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And it's, you know, it's so strange.

1727
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
But you know, this is, this is, this is the whole thing.

1728
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
This is the, the e-boy Hussie Instagram account,

1729
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:08,000
which Psycholonials is absolutely like real and Hussie is doing it.

1730
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So obviously you saw that Hussie is in Psycholonials, right?

1731
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Yes, I saw him.

1732
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Did you?

1733
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
He, he, he jumps in front of the, the, the horse.

1734
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Oh God.

1735
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
What's the horses?

1736
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Dazed Hasselhoof.

1737
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Dazed Hasselhoof.

1738
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Yes.

1739
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Hasselhoof.

1740
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Yes.

1741
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Someone pointed out to me that like, I guess at some point you see,

1742
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
like some of his makeup is scraped off and he is yellow.

1743
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Meaning that he.

1744
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I think that was the whole time.

1745
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
His little character avatar, whenever it first showed up,

1746
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
you could see that it had like the Hussie skin tone underneath.

1747
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
This, this is, this is fascinating.

1748
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
This is horrifying.

1749
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I mean, this, this suggests that this is canonically the same Hussie

1750
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
that appeared in Homestuck.

1751
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
To me, that's what that says.

1752
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
This Hussie has got some hustle.

1753
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
He sure does.

1754
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
So the drip is unbelievable.

1755
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
It's fucking sopping.

1756
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I, I like the clown.

1757
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I like the clown sonar better.

1758
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I don't know about this one.

1759
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I, in theory, I like the.

1760
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I'm just looking at his Instagram in general.

1761
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
If you scroll down a bit, there's his clown sonar.

1762
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And then before that was some other cool, cool things.

1763
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
This, this new outfit, I don't know.

1764
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
It's a little upsetting, honestly.

1765
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It's that clown sonar.

1766
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
But Sheezy's not here.

1767
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
He, Sheezy, Sheezy is a big Psycholonials fan.

1768
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I turned, I turned Sheezy onto it and he loves it as, as he should.

1769
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I kept thinking about making my clown sonar, but I never did.

1770
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
It's, I mean, yeah, it's, you read this and it's,

1771
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
it's just the natural reaction.

1772
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It's like, I got to make a fucking, I got to make a jubilee.

1773
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I got to be a jubilee.

1774
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I got to make a clown sonar.

1775
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
The, yeah, I don't know.

1776
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I'm just, I'm just pretty mystified and horrified to think that, I mean,

1777
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
that means, that means that Psycholonials and Homestuck take place in the same

1778
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
universe. That's the only thing that it can mean.

1779
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Well, I mean, it could, it could also mean that this universe right here,

1780
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:24,000
that Zeezyn is one created in Homestuck as in like it creates universes.

1781
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
And then Hussey just.

1782
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Sure.

1783
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah, I guess, I guess the world of Homestuck is one in which that is one in

1784
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,000
which there are infinite worlds, which are basically similar to our own or a

1785
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
lot of them are.

1786
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,000
So yeah, this could easily just be one of those.

1787
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I don't really take it as like a, oh, a cannon thing.

1788
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It was just like Hussey's putting himself in stuff.

1789
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
But it is, but it is cannon, but that's what it means.

1790
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
But it can, but it also makes no difference to anything.

1791
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
So yeah, it does.

1792
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Okay.

1793
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I mean, yes, it doesn't make a difference to anything, but it never,

1794
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
nevertheless, it's cannon.

1795
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
It's fucking cannon.

1796
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
That means everything.

1797
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
The reason I don't really think of, the reason I don't really like to think of it

1798
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
as like, oh, this means Homestuck.

1799
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Like, because Homestuck operates on different loads of physics that like

1800
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
reality like can't have capture logs, whatever they were called.

1801
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Well, oh yeah.

1802
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
No, I guess you're right.

1803
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So, so, so in, in Psycholonials, the whole is the fucking dreams real?

1804
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Is there actually like a clown god speaking to this character that's left up in the air?

1805
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Is it her going insane?

1806
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
If like Homestuck rules apply, it could be real and it's more likely to be real.

1807
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And I don't, I think that the, the unsureness of the reader is important.

1808
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I, I agree.

1809
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I mean, I, I agree that if you think like, oh, this is in the same universe as Homestuck.

1810
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Therefore, I should be like thinking about the events through like a Homestuck lens.

1811
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Like what, what, what does the cannon of Homestuck say is possible in this world?

1812
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Then yeah, I agree.

1813
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
You've, you've, you've read too far into it for sure.

1814
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Yeah.

1815
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I think it's more likely that Hussie depicting himself is just um,

1816
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
because he does exist in our reality and where COVID happened.

1817
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
So this is like that version of him, the real version.

1818
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,000
And then the version that appeared in Homestuck is just him drawing himself into the comic that he wrote.

1819
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I, I, I think, I don't, I think the fact, the fact that it's yellow when every other,

1820
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
every other person in Psycholonials is white.

1821
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I mean, he has to be, he's got to be the same.

1822
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
He, he, he's true though.

1823
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Just look at them.

1824
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
They all, they all white though.

1825
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
They're all white.

1826
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I mean, well, they got the clown makeup on.

1827
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
So I guess you can't tell for all of them.

1828
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:05,000
No, but every other person, but, but even without the clown makeup, they all still have white faces.

1829
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Do they?

1830
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Maybe.

1831
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I don't know.

1832
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I can't tell.

1833
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
All the, all the police did, Percy did, Zee and Abby do.

1834
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
No, I'm pretty sure.

1835
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Well, let me, let me, I can go look.

1836
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
If there, if anyone has had a non-white face, I mean, then I guess I would be wrong.

1837
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And maybe Hussie would just be yellow.

1838
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Oh no.

1839
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Yeah.

1840
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It's just like, like ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, white.

1841
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Yeah, they're all, they're all ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff.

1842
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
But Hussie's yellow.

1843
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I don't know.

1844
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I don't know.

1845
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I feel like it says something.

1846
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Like, no, I don't think it says something.

1847
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I think it says Hussie is letting us know that yes.

1848
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It does.

1849
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
It does.

1850
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
But it was, it's obviously him.

1851
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
He didn't have to be yellow for it to obviously be him.

1852
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Cause it's, cause it's the same for, it's the same clown sonar that appeared in the trailer

1853
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
and it's the same one that Hussie dressed up as on Instagram.

1854
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
It was already obviously him.

1855
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
It didn't, it didn't need that.

1856
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:05,000
But he deliberately was like, well, I'll include this detail and make him the only yellow human.

1857
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I don't think that makes a difference.

1858
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
They're all white.

1859
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So is this like an alt-right thing?

1860
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
No, no.

1861
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Hussie's, he's good.

1862
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
He's a good Bernie bro.

1863
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
He's a good Bernie down the establishment.

1864
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Yeah.

1865
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Yeah.

1866
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Based.

1867
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I really do agree with that.

1868
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I really do admire Hussie's joie de vivre though.

1869
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:38,000
I hope when I'm Hussie's age, I'm looking like a total freak.

1870
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Yeah, that's a good way to be.

1871
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Yeah.

1872
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
He's tall though.

1873
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Being tall means you can pull things, pull looks off that other people can.

1874
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It's a shame.

1875
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
It's a real shame.

1876
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Since we were on the subject of clowns, I'd like to present something.

1877
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Please.

1878
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
It'd be good if Cheesy were here to see this.

1879
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I'm sure he will.

1880
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Did you hear that Cheesy killed the Pizza Party podcast?

1881
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I heard something about the Pizza Party podcast, but no specifics.

1882
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
You heard it here first.

1883
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
He did it.

1884
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
He was our man on the inside.

1885
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
He brought the whole system down and on itself.

1886
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I'm proud of him.

1887
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
That's pretty cool.

1888
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Clown-Vis Presley.

1889
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I found this weird YouTube channel by accident, or mere happenstance, about a guy that dresses

1890
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
up as a clown version of Elvis Presley.

1891
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Naturally.

1892
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:47,000
He has a couple of music videos that are actually surprisingly good.

1893
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
He does like a weird stream.

1894
01:41:50,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I don't know what the deal is with this guy, but I was very fascinated when I found this.

1895
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
This?

1896
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I mean, is there like, is there lore?

1897
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Oh, God.

1898
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I'm sure there is, but I haven't dived in all the way yet.

1899
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Just look at the thumbnail to this video and tell me what you think is happening.

1900
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I haven't seen that thumbnail yet.

1901
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:35,000
It looks like two fish eating an eel in between them.

1902
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Yeah, maybe something like that.

1903
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I thought it was two frogs shitting out their mouth into each other's mouth was where my

1904
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
mind went.

1905
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Yeah, that's kind of what it looks like.

1906
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
But no, they could be pulling a lady in the tramp with an eel.

1907
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I hope it's that.

1908
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I mean, it's too clear and perfect a tube to be like a thing of liquid happening.

1909
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I can see why you would see that.

1910
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I don't know why.

1911
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Episode 149.

1912
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
What?

1913
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yeah, he does like weird streams where he just talks to the audience and I guess tells

1914
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
jokes or something.

1915
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I see there's like an alien puppet.

1916
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:27,000
There's like an alien puppet in some of these, you know, just because.

1917
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
It's very, very strange.

1918
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Oh, wow.

1919
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Yeah.

1920
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
This is a, this is a find.

1921
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,000
This is a, this is a, I don't know.

1922
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I don't know what's going on.

1923
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I like it.

1924
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I was thinking we click a random one.

1925
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
You should invite this guy.

1926
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I was thinking you should maybe invite this guy into PCP sometime.

1927
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I mean, I'm, I am interested in what he has to say.

1928
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
What is he?

1929
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Okay.

1930
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
You see he's talking about conspiracy theories.

1931
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Huh?

1932
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
What?

1933
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I just clicked a random one.

1934
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
He's talking about like this, this defies scientific understanding.

1935
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I don't, I don't know.

1936
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I didn't, I didn't listen for, for more context.

1937
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I don't know what his views are or anything.

1938
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I just know that he dresses up as a clown version of Elvis Presley for some reason.

1939
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
He says clown this plays a new instrument, the marshmallow planted in soil from the

1940
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:31,000
North Pole last week is revealed to be a full grown dancing snowman with basic skills.

1941
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
That's the episode description.

1942
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Wow.

1943
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
It sounds interesting to me.

1944
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Wow.

1945
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Wow.

1946
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Okay.

1947
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Scientology video?

1948
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Oh no.

1949
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
It's got to be a joke.

1950
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
It's got to be a joke.

1951
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I mean that, maybe that's Zinu, maybe the little puppet man with him is Zinu.

1952
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
It looks like him.

1953
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I hope whoever this guy is, I hope he reaches a million subscribers someday.

1954
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:05,000
He is only 5,000 for such, for such a, for such a winning, for such a winning concept.

1955
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Isn't it an undiscovered gem?

1956
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Oh, he's got a robot dog.

1957
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Oh, he's got a little robot dog.

1958
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
This is very good.

1959
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
This is a great character design.

1960
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It's fun.

1961
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:27,000
You need to promote this guy.

1962
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
This is what I wanted to see.

1963
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Clownvis covers insane clown posse, chicken hunting.

1964
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
But I'm definitely going to check that out.

1965
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Perfect.

1966
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:47,000
This reminds me of, well, it's not really the same, but okay.

1967
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Did you see that The Folding Ideas video about the Doug Walker Wall review that came out this week?

1968
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I saw a preview of that, but I haven't watched it.

1969
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I like that video.

1970
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I like that video a lot.

1971
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:10,000
And the ending part when he talks about the, like, animated monsters,

1972
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Discount Gumshoe in my Discord showed me a little bit of, like, the videos that they come from, the Satellite City videos.

1973
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And that is a, I think that that is like a fascinating rabbit hole of, like, cringe.

1974
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:41,000
The videos are very, like, the one I saw was, like, the guy who is on the phone in the Wall review.

1975
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
It's him, like, yelling at another guy, like, pick my weeds, Slave.

1976
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Pick my weeds in my field.

1977
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Do it now.

1978
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I haven't killed you yet, so pick my weeds.

1979
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I have to pick the weeds.

1980
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:03,000
And the 3D monsters are like, uh, hey, this guy's got to pick the weeds now.

1981
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I'm sure glad I don't have to pick the weeds.

1982
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
And that's the video.

1983
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And that's the fucking video.

1984
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Wait, wait, that, of the person that made the original, that the ending cinematic 3D stuff, that's one of his videos?

1985
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Yes.

1986
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Yes, that's a video from Satellite City.

1987
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
No, not from Clownvis.

1988
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Not Clownvis.

1989
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Um, and I don't know.

1990
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Like, I saw that video and knowing, because Dan mentions it in the Folding Ideas video, that, like, there's, like, pages and pages and pages of lore.

1991
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
And I don't know, I just think it's really funny.

1992
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:51,000
And apparently, okay, according to the channel description, the fena, this is the Satellite City guy, according to the fena channel description,

1993
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:57,000
he has, like, the videos themselves are just, like, a side project.

1994
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
They're, like, an experimental side project.

1995
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And his actual, his actual brain, ew, ew, it's face.

1996
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:11,000
The actual project that he really wants to do, his masterpiece, is that he's writing a novel.

1997
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
He's writing a novel called The August Few.

1998
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
And the novel is the real story.

1999
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And these videos are just, I don't know, to gauge interest or something.

2000
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And I just hate them so much.

2001
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
There's an animation test.

2002
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Hold on, I'll find it.

2003
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:45,000
You know, these character designs, unlike Clownvis, these character designs are so overdone and terrible.

2004
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Like, any, I'm looking at one, and it's like, she's got it, I don't know what it's supposed to be.

2005
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I think it's a she, has, like, one wing on one side of her body, and then a missing leg, and then a weird eye.

2006
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Like, any moment where there could be symmetry, there is, like, make sure there's no symmetry.

2007
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Make sure there's as odd as, like, humanly possible.

2008
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Why do people do that? Why do people try to make every aspect of the character, like, different from every other aspect?

2009
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Just like, it's a hodgepodge.

2010
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Why? I don't get the appeal.

2011
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:29,000
This video, this video that I just linked, this Lucy Lace Maker Oompa Pa animation test.

2012
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I hate it, because she's, like, dancing and singing, but she doesn't really move.

2013
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:47,000
She just kind of, the rig just kind of stays in one place, and she just kind of, like, gyrates around and, like, swings her limbs around and makes faces at the camera.

2014
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
And it's so awkward.

2015
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And the comments are all, like, the comments are all, like, oh my god, she thick, though.

2016
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Like, ooh, those hips.

2017
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And I'm, like, I hate, I fucking, I fucking hate what is going on here.

2018
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:13,000
This reminds, and the fact that he is, the fact that his real project is that he's, ooh, he's writing like a, he's writing an epic fantasy novel about these characters.

2019
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,000
It just reminds me of, do you remember that German guy Dave from the Brony days?

2020
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
The furry guy, he did a bunch, he did a bunch, I've talked about him.

2021
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:29,000
He did a bunch of, he did a bunch of art for Dr. Wolf, for no pay, of course, Lamau.

2022
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
And then he, he was, his real project was that he was writing a novel.

2023
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
He was a comic artist, but he was writing a novel.

2024
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And he would, he sent me, like, early drafts of the, of, like, chapters and was, like, here, what do you think about this?

2025
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I was, like, I don't want to offend you.

2026
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I know English is not your native language, but the English in this chapter is very awkward to read.

2027
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
And maybe you should be writing in German instead.

2028
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:02,000
And he got, just got, like, really offended, like, no, there's no market, there's no market for fantasy literature in German, you idiot.

2029
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Like, that's, that's just, why don't you fucking give me good faith criticism instead of this bullshit?

2030
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
It, it, it just reminds me of that.

2031
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
And it makes me sick to my stomach.

2032
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
The thought of a furry writing a novel just makes me ill.

2033
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I'm sorry. They just shouldn't do it. They just shouldn't do it.

2034
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I'm looking at.

2035
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Is that why you never criticize Trixie's music back when she was in the PCP?

2036
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I genuinely have no opinion about her music because I have no opinion about most music.

2037
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,000
I know everybody, everybody says that the music is bad and everybody says that, like, her music has gotten worse.

2038
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I genuinely can't tell. I can't, I can't tell the difference.

2039
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
So it's whatever.

2040
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'm looking at this fucking video.

2041
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Imagine, but imagine what you were saying. These, these awkward, these awkward overdone character designs.

2042
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
They're so hideous and overly detailed.

2043
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Imagine that person trying to write prose.

2044
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I haven't read any of it, but like, his priorities are like fucked.

2045
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
His priorities are all wrong.

2046
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
This person can't tell a good story. I'm convinced.

2047
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
It's, it's like, um, like the character designs and this animation.

2048
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,000
So much is happening and yet all of it is badly done.

2049
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Like, it's just a lot. It's just a lot of work.

2050
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
It's just a lot.

2051
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
And nothing is like, like, you know, it's like.

2052
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
It's just a lot and I don't like any of it.

2053
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Like, like the people, people who like it, they're probably just like how it moves a lot and smoothly and doesn't stop moving.

2054
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:39,000
And they just are amused by the motion because it's, it's just badly, it doesn't, it doesn't convey weight.

2055
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
It doesn't, it's just not good animation.

2056
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:46,000
The character designs are like overly like, like detailed with so many things,

2057
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
but they're all like clashing, like extraneous details.

2058
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Whereas the focus supposed to be like all that sort of stuff.

2059
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Yeah, they do a lot of work. They don't work smart.

2060
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
That's what the problem is.

2061
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I think that they, I think that the people that like this, they like what it looks like and they like that it moves a lot.

2062
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
And that's like the extent of it.

2063
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
It's not even like about like how it moves.

2064
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It's just that like, this is like a very, this is a very complicated.

2065
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
This is a very detailed rendering of a creature with a certain aesthetic.

2066
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:27,000
And I like the aesthetic and I like that it is moving around a lot and making faces at me.

2067
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
And that makes me clap.

2068
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
It's really a unsightly character design.

2069
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:43,000
I mean, this one is, this one is pretty is ugly, I guess on purpose because it looks like a scary clown.

2070
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:50,000
But then there's like the other ones are like dragons with like too many eyes and like and stuff.

2071
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
And there's the one with the tits.

2072
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:59,000
There's like the one with like the leathery neck and the tits.

2073
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
That's and horns, I guess.

2074
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And I don't know.

2075
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I said this before, but it's just to reiterate, looking at these videos, I can see what this person's priorities are and they're bad.

2076
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Yes.

2077
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Yeah.

2078
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Oh, oh, oh.

2079
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
All right, this is funny.

2080
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I just saw that this is like behind the scenes of like the wall.

2081
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I always wondered how they made the iconic trial scene from Doug Walker's The Wall.

2082
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
But that's not the funny part.

2083
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
This is the funny part.

2084
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
They put the footage of Doug in the green screen footage in the screens.

2085
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
So I think you could get that.

2086
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
He's pretty funny.

2087
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
You could use his Doug Walker green screen footage if you wanted.

2088
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I just think, like anyway, my point in talking about this is just that this is exactly the kind of like,

2089
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:05,000
this is exactly the kind of like lower train wreck that I think would be fascinating.

2090
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:13,000
And I kind of would like a, I would like to hear like a deep dive, like discount gum.

2091
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
She was talking about doing a lecture on it, actually.

2092
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
And I thought that was like, this is this is perfect lecture material.

2093
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Like just don't, I don't want to watch this.

2094
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Just tell me like what's up with this and make me laugh.

2095
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
As you explain it to me.

2096
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,000
This, this is the kind of thing that is good for that.

2097
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
So yeah, I want to lecture on clown vis Presley.

2098
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Yeah, that too.

2099
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Clown vis Presley is a is an enigma.

2100
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I wonder if he's read Cyclonials.

2101
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I wonder if he's a communist based.

2102
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
You never know.

2103
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Oh, or almost two hours. Do you think maybe we should go to voicemails?

2104
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Yeah, I think so.

2105
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Two hours seems pretty good.

2106
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Okay, let's try.

2107
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I will try and you know, the voicemails were probably taken hour or more.

2108
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I will try to I will try to speed through them.

2109
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Okay, the first voicemail.

2110
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Oh God, first voicemail is called Grumple Stiltskin.

2111
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Here we go. Three, two, one, go.

2112
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Yeah, what's the point of it all anyway.

2113
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Great question. Thanks for the voicemail.

2114
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Next voicemail is called.

2115
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Yes, is called.

2116
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Unironic gang, gang weed guy.

2117
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I assume it's meant to say gang weed guy.

2118
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Everything if there's it's a long title.

2119
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Fuck it. Three, two, one, go.

2120
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Just like you said, $200 for red cotton.

2121
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

2122
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
So, where's the Virginia?

2123
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Jokerman, what did you do with all your money?

2124
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
You see, I'm a guy of simple tastes.

2125
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I enjoy t-shirts, posters, streams, and the lectures.

2126
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
You know the thing that they have in common?

2127
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
They're part of Radcon.

2128
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
You said you were a man of your word.

2129
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Oh, I am. I'm only burning my half.

2130
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
All you care about is whether or not it was promised.

2131
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:35,000
This show deserves a better class of content creator.

2132
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I'm gonna give it to them.

2133
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Tell your fans they work for me now.

2134
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
This is my Radcon.

2135
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
You were a freak.

2136
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Freak.

2137
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Well, why don't we cut you up into little pieces and feed you to the hellhounds?

2138
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
And then we'll see how hungry a loyal jigger really is.

2139
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
It's not about the lecture.

2140
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
It's about sending a message.

2141
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Everything strands!

2142
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Okay.

2143
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
You know, Radcon is a pretty good title.

2144
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:13,000
It was kind of funny up until they sort of showed their handle at the end there.

2145
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Radcon is a good title because some people got conned out of Rand, if you think about it.

2146
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I don't really know what the message was, so I'm not gonna think about it anymore.

2147
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Next one is called The Monopoly Man.

2148
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Oh, wait. Next one's called The Monopoly Man, but last week...

2149
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Never mind. There was a voicemail I didn't understand last week.

2150
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
And you know what? That's good.

2151
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
It's good. I don't want to understand. Never mind.

2152
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Next one is called...

2153
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Someone tried to tell me, like, Ben, obviously it was meant to say this, and I was like, uh, okay, I guess.

2154
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Doesn't matter.

2155
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Next one is called The Monopoly Man, 3, 2, 1, go.

2156
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho! This is The Monopoly Man, the president of the League of Natefuckers.

2157
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I'm here to announce that I have a plan for the well-being of Nate and all the Natefuckers.

2158
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I will let everyone fuck Nate from 9 to 5, one hour each, for 200 Dodgecoin.

2159
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
This is my decision. Ho, ho, ho, ho!

2160
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:30,000
200 Dodgecoin, as The Monopoly Man says, is like, that's like, um...

2161
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
That's like, 60 dollars.

2162
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
That's like, some money. Okay, next one is called...

2163
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Not as much as 200 actual dollars.

2164
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Next one is called Hi Ben, 3, 2, 1, go.

2165
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Hey, y'all, I just wanted to come in and say that this whole situation is fucking hilarious.

2166
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Thanks.

2167
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I haven't heard... I'm a little bit off.

2168
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I always listen to these on Mondays, so you guys have already recorded last week's episodes.

2169
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
So maybe there was some Trixie Defender who came online last time.

2170
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
A little bit.

2171
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Oh, no. Ben was being... Trixie did nothing wrong.

2172
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
A little bit.

2173
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
But like, let's be fucking honest.

2174
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Ben was right.

2175
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Everyone agrees that Ben was right, and this is fucking hilarious,

2176
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
because anyone who pays attention to anything could have seen this coming a mile away,

2177
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
when they uprooted his whole goddamn life to do something with Trixie,

2178
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
and Trixie is never committed to anything in her fucking life.

2179
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Yes.

2180
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And it's very funny.

2181
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:31,000
It's very funny, it's very sad, and it's just so goddamn funny.

2182
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
All right, see you.

2183
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
This guy's absolutely got the right attitude.

2184
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Hi Ben is a... Hi Ben for Voice Grail? Hi Ben for Voice Grail?

2185
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I don't know.

2186
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Your own personal collection, maybe.

2187
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Okay.

2188
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I was hoping to hear something from Doid Geysers.

2189
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Doid Geysers said that he is bowing out at the top.

2190
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Doid Geysers says that last week was his finale.

2191
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Yeah.

2192
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
It's unfortunate.

2193
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
It was a good way to end.

2194
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
It was a good bit.

2195
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I think it had run its course though, and he went out on the high note with the song,

2196
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
so let's hope he doesn't fuck that up with another voicemail.

2197
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Next one is called Fuck PCP Callers Addendum 321 Go.

2198
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Just listen to another cringus bingus voicemail.

2199
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Never mind.

2200
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
I take it all back.

2201
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Callers are great.

2202
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Thank you.

2203
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
True.

2204
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
That's right.

2205
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
It's all about perspective.

2206
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Next one is called Challenge 321 Go.

2207
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Name every former member of the PCP in the order in which they left the podcast.

2208
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:54,000
What about that jazz guy?

2209
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
People have left.

2210
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Majors definitely left.

2211
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Davoos definitely left.

2212
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
When?

2213
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I can't remember.

2214
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Okay.

2215
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
There was a time when they said, oh, by the way, I'm not coming back.

2216
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I don't want to come back.

2217
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Maj never even made a specific, like, I am leaving the PCP.

2218
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
She never even did that.

2219
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Davoos did.

2220
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I would say.

2221
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Maj never wanted to make a thing of it, which was her reasoning, but I'm pretty sure she

2222
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
does not want to come back.

2223
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
There's no intention of her coming back.

2224
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
She has said that here and there.

2225
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I guess it is.

2226
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Wait, has anyone else?

2227
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Who else has left?

2228
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I think maybe Jeff Mumkey, Davoo, Maj, who else?

2229
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Trixie, obviously, is the latest one.

2230
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Nate has not technically left.

2231
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Jesse has not technically left.

2232
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
They can both appear at any time whenever they feel like it.

2233
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I think Jesse is pretty much officially.

2234
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I would say, no, I would say Jesse is officially.

2235
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Well, I mean, he came to red for anything.

2236
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Like if Davoo and Maj wanted to come back, that'd be fine.

2237
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Like there's no like contract here.

2238
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
It's just how you defined, like, left.

2239
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I guess if Jesse hasn't been on the show for a very long time and it doesn't seem like

2240
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
he wants to be on, then he's fine.

2241
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I would say that Jesse has left the show to basically the same extent that Maj has,

2242
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
which is to say pretty much 100%.

2243
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Yeah.

2244
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
He's basically left the internet except for his Patreon, I think.

2245
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

2246
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I would say that he's basically left the internet except for his Patreon, I think.

2247
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
And then he's basically left the internet except for his Patreon, I think.

2248
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,600
100% he's basically left the internet except for his patron.

2249
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:48,120
I think. Yeah.

2250
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:51,560
Got to keep got to keep that shit exclusive.

2251
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:53,720
Oh, and don't forget Munchie.

2252
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:55,560
I think did you mention Munchie? Oh, yeah.

2253
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,920
Oh, yeah. Munchie.

2254
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:01,160
He also has not like made a any like he's like mage.

2255
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:03,800
He has basically said that he won't be back,

2256
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:05,960
but he never made like an I'm leaving statement.

2257
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:11,960
So he made an I'm leaving statement for for like the internet,

2258
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:13,720
which I think just applies to everything.

2259
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:16,280
Yeah. Okay.

2260
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:18,200
My best guess for order would be Jeff,

2261
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:26,600
monkey, DeVoo, Jesse, mage, Munchie, Trixie.

2262
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,600
I think I think something like that.

2263
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:33,960
Okay. Who's going to be next?

2264
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:35,800
Who's who's leaving next?

2265
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:39,720
My vote is I think it's going to be it's going to be me.

2266
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:47,320
It's going to be me getting banned when Trixie comes back when it's when it's when Trixie,

2267
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:54,120
Trixie, it's when Yig Studio fails and Trixie attempts to do like a redemption arc.

2268
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:59,640
And everyone and every fucking sucker and mark immediately falls for it.

2269
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:06,600
And then she and then I'm the bad guy because everyone wants to forgive her.

2270
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:08,520
And then I say no, she can't come back.

2271
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:11,480
And then there's a forced vote and everybody votes me out.

2272
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:13,160
So Trixie comes back there.

2273
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:16,360
I'm pretending to have a monkey pulled on you.

2274
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:18,600
But worse.

2275
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,400
That's pretty good fan fiction.

2276
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,600
That's what's it's true.

2277
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:25,320
It's true.

2278
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:26,520
It's I've seen the future.

2279
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:31,720
The next voicemail is called I don't like this.

2280
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:34,440
It's called Noiter is bad.

2281
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:36,520
And I'll upload it right there.

2282
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,120
Three, two, one, go.

2283
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:48,520
You know, the body of Isaac is a much better game than Noiter because it is top down and not as side

2284
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:55,960
scroll because the top is always more powerful than the down and the side scroller means that

2285
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,800
you are not equal footing with the game.

2286
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:05,800
So you are actually more in control in Isaac, which makes it obviously objectively the better

2287
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:06,840
game also.

2288
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:13,480
It is the better game because it has items that are actually good and not just items that are

2289
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,960
just bad like Noiter does.

2290
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:16,920
Just bad.

2291
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:23,800
Ignore all the items in Isaac that are bad, which you will always get on every floor because

2292
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:28,520
that is that's just good game design for making it hard.

2293
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:29,640
Noiter has bombs.

2294
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:34,920
But at Noiter, when you get a shitty one, that is not a game design because

2295
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:37,080
the game is bad.

2296
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:43,400
You know, he wasn't getting me until he said that Isaac was bad and Noiter was

2297
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:46,040
no, wait, he said Isaac was good and Noiter was bad.

2298
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:48,920
When he said it in such clear terms, I agreed instantly.

2299
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,240
Right.

2300
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:55,320
I mean, that was, you said he wasn't getting you until he said that, but that was literally

2301
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:58,360
like the opening statement of the voicemail.

2302
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:58,840
No, no, no.

2303
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:06,280
When he said the items is the, what I meant to say is that the whole thing with the top

2304
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:08,920
down and side scrolling is dumb and stupid.

2305
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:09,720
Just say it sucks.

2306
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:11,880
That I agree that.

2307
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:12,120
Yeah.

2308
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:13,560
No, side scrolling is better.

2309
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,360
Side scrolling is better than top down for sure.

2310
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:17,560
We can all agree on that.

2311
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:19,880
Yeah, I prefer side scrolling.

2312
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,400
I just like doing things from the side.

2313
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:30,520
Noida has, Noida's items are not very good, but Noida's has perks.

2314
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:35,400
And I guess, you know what, Isaac's items are better than Noida's perks.

2315
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:36,520
I'll give it that.

2316
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:39,160
I'll give it that, but no more.

2317
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:40,280
Okay.

2318
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:44,600
Next one is called Penisus.

2319
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:48,440
Penisus, it is there.

2320
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:49,160
Upload.

2321
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:49,480
Okay.

2322
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:50,600
Three, two, one, go.

2323
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,400
Ah, can't dance, ah, can't talk.

2324
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:58,600
The only thing about me has been since big call.

2325
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:00,840
Yeah.

2326
02:08:00,840 --> 02:08:01,400
Very good.

2327
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:04,760
Thank you for the voicemail.

2328
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:07,800
Next one is called Chad McChad.

2329
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,520
Three, two, one, go.

2330
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:14,200
Hey guys, it's Chad McChad here.

2331
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:17,160
And I just want to say, good coin.

2332
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,280
More like shit coin.

2333
02:08:19,080 --> 02:08:19,720
Yeah.

2334
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,520
That was all.

2335
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:23,880
Drop 10% in 10 minutes, baby.

2336
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,160
It's going through the floor.

2337
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:31,400
Maybe it'll be back to 60,000 by next week.

2338
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:35,320
Wait, it's kind of just hanging out.

2339
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:39,080
Maybe my thing was like behind when you were talking about it before,

2340
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:41,960
because it hadn't gone down as far and now it has.

2341
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:49,560
I'm looking at it and it's been pretty stable since like an hour or two after

2342
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:50,280
the big dip.

2343
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,000
It's just kind of hanging out around 56.

2344
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:53,960
Big dip.

2345
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,600
Big di-ah.

2346
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:00,920
Oh, my thing on TV has been Saints big cock.

2347
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:02,440
That's going, Boy Scrail?

2348
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:03,320
Boy Scrail?

2349
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:04,200
No, no.

2350
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:05,080
Personal collection.

2351
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:06,760
Personal collection of Ben St.

2352
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:07,560
All right.

2353
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,520
Personal collection.

2354
02:09:09,480 --> 02:09:11,000
Who's personal collection?

2355
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,960
My personal collection, which I never look at.

2356
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:18,600
Next one is called What Is Happening?

2357
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:19,960
3, 2, 1, go.

2358
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:23,240
Okay, you're going to get me up to speed here.

2359
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,160
Just listen to the episodes.

2360
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:30,360
Okay, to be honest, I haven't watched a fucking episode of BZP in like two years.

2361
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,640
See, this is the problem.

2362
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,600
This is the problem.

2363
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:34,200
Pretty much.

2364
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,760
Are you even going to watch this one?

2365
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,400
You fuck.

2366
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:43,160
So I have no idea what's going on here with any of these things.

2367
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:44,280
Jesus.

2368
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:49,160
And I just noticed that Trixie is no longer here.

2369
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:51,560
And then I saw that Nate's no longer here.

2370
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:52,360
And I'm like, nice.

2371
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:56,360
Like Ben and I like Ben and Gabe.

2372
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:57,960
Damn, damn, damn.

2373
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:58,360
So that's cool.

2374
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:00,920
Hello, Tom.

2375
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:03,720
Yeah.

2376
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:07,800
Could you like compress the last two years into...

2377
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,480
Dog, we've been doing that.

2378
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:12,760
Into like a one thing.

2379
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:17,000
So I can understand what is going on with this podcast at this point.

2380
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:17,800
Okay.

2381
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,520
Yeah, I will, I will.

2382
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:22,040
Okay.

2383
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:22,520
Post.

2384
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,840
He's obviously not going to listen to this episode.

2385
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:26,440
So why bother?

2386
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,720
Here's my soundbite version.

2387
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:33,400
Post Redcon 4, Nate just basically falls off ever showing up.

2388
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,600
Trixie also does that.

2389
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:40,120
And, and that's, and that's it.

2390
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:42,520
That's, that's like it.

2391
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:43,560
Davoo was already gone.

2392
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,520
They both just stopped falling off.

2393
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,000
Trixie falls in with these Yeg people.

2394
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:54,280
I hate them and I tell her so and she has a tantrum about it and is like,

2395
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:58,360
I won't be on the PCP anymore because Ben doesn't like my friends.

2396
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:02,040
And that's it.

2397
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:03,080
That's what happened.

2398
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:05,400
Actually, I just got a pretty good idea.

2399
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:06,360
Yeah.

2400
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:08,840
What if, wait, hear me out.

2401
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:12,280
What if Riley replaced Trixie on the PCP?

2402
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:15,960
Ooh, ooh, ooh, now we're talking.

2403
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:17,560
Ooh, now we're talking.

2404
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,040
Well, Riley on the PCP would be kind of funny, actually.

2405
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,280
You could hash it out.

2406
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,320
You could yell at each other.

2407
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:26,040
Yeah, exactly.

2408
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:29,640
No, I wouldn't, I don't want to do that.

2409
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:31,960
It's, it's not cool.

2410
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:34,200
It's just not cool, man.

2411
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,280
It's like homework.

2412
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:38,200
It's just not cool and I don't want to do it.

2413
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:41,800
No, no.

2414
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,120
They're dead to me.

2415
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:45,400
They're dead to me.

2416
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:46,120
No more.

2417
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:47,400
Well, it was not an idea.

2418
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,160
We're about a bird stork.

2419
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:52,360
I don't know who these fucking people are.

2420
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:53,000
Yes, I do.

2421
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,280
I wish I didn't.

2422
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:56,840
I'm going to pretend, I'm going to pretend that I don't know who these people are

2423
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:59,080
because I would be a happier person if I didn't, though.

2424
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:01,480
Who?

2425
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:01,960
What?

2426
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:03,160
What are you talking about?

2427
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:07,240
Okay.

2428
02:12:07,240 --> 02:12:11,480
Next one is called, do you have anything more to add on

2429
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:15,000
getting this idiot who doesn't watch the podcast up to speed?

2430
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,840
No, that was pretty succinct.

2431
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:21,240
It's more than he deserves, honestly.

2432
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:26,840
Oh, this one is called obligatory Ben dick sucking bones.

2433
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:27,880
Three, two.

2434
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:28,520
Voice grail?

2435
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:29,080
Voice grail?

2436
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:29,560
No.

2437
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:30,520
Am I right?

2438
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:31,240
Okay.

2439
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:32,600
Three, two, one, go.

2440
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:35,800
Ben, I've been a fan of yours for a long time,

2441
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:40,840
but somehow I miss your preservation of the It's All So Ugly

2442
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:46,360
original page, and I just stumbled upon it on stcomics.com.

2443
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:51,160
And holy shit, even at the beginning, you were fucking funny.

2444
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:51,800
That's not true.

2445
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:55,080
This power of science comic is fucking hilarious.

2446
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:55,480
Really?

2447
02:12:56,360 --> 02:12:57,880
Sophisticated entertainment.

2448
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:03,880
And then you scroll down and you have this brilliant splash page of you begging for money.

2449
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:04,520
I love it.

2450
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:05,560
It's so funny.

2451
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:07,240
I like that.

2452
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,760
Why don't you do this more often, dude?

2453
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:09,720
Holy shit.

2454
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,040
Wow.

2455
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:11,240
Thank you.

2456
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,360
I hate all those old It's All So Ugly.

2457
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,400
That one is like, I don't hate that one that much.

2458
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:18,920
I think it's kind of dumb.

2459
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:23,240
Some of the old It's All So Ugly comics are like really bad and embarrassing,

2460
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:25,720
and I hate them, but they're there for posterity's sake.

2461
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:30,920
The website, yeah, the website, if you've never seen it,

2462
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:34,200
it's designed so that like the comic is at the top of the page.

2463
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:39,560
And if you scroll down, you can see that it is me under the page holding it up

2464
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:43,160
as I'm like kneeling on the ground holding it up to show it to you.

2465
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:44,680
And I'm begging for money.

2466
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:49,400
I thought it was a pretty funny design.

2467
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:51,320
Glad you appreciated it.

2468
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:55,160
I've seen your saintcomics.com website.

2469
02:13:55,160 --> 02:13:59,640
If you go to saintcomics.com, one of the like on the dropdown menu,

2470
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:02,840
one of them is, I think it's labeled IASU.

2471
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:03,720
It's also ugly.

2472
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,880
This is short for that.

2473
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:10,040
And it'll bring you to an archived version of the old website.

2474
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:14,120
I should read your comics one day.

2475
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:20,920
I mean, some of them are kind of good, maybe, if you're into that sort of thing.

2476
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:24,600
Yeah, no, you absolutely should.

2477
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:28,840
That goes for you, that goes for you too, listener.

2478
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:38,200
Well, no one has no one has given no one has said anything, let alone anything positive

2479
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:41,800
about it's also ugly, the brand in ages.

2480
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:43,880
So I made my day.

2481
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:44,280
Thank you.

2482
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:46,280
Next voice.

2483
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:47,480
Voice growl, right?

2484
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,120
Voice growl.

2485
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:48,760
Voice growl.

2486
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:50,200
Per personal collection.

2487
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:51,080
I know what you're going to say.

2488
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:52,440
It's your personal collection.

2489
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,960
Next one is called based three, two, one, go.

2490
02:14:56,680 --> 02:14:57,160
LeMau.

2491
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:02,760
Just.

2492
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:06,680
No, it's fucking stupid.

2493
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:10,760
You know, people say she's a pedophile, but I don't know, because I don't know if she

2494
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:13,160
should be considered able to consent either.

2495
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:17,640
So I think maybe her and a child should be considered on like similar footing intellectually.

2496
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:18,760
LeMau.

2497
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:23,320
Well, I did say that.

2498
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,360
When did you say that?

2499
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:26,440
Or was that on a PCP?

2500
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:27,960
I didn't remember hearing that.

2501
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:29,080
It was on a PCP.

2502
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:30,920
It was a while ago.

2503
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:35,960
I think it was like right after the breakup announcement or.

2504
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:37,800
Was that talked about?

2505
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:38,120
I think it was.

2506
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,200
What?

2507
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:44,360
I don't, I guess I just can't remember it being talked about on the show.

2508
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:47,480
Yeah, we talked about it a little bit.

2509
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:55,800
It was, yeah, it was after, I mean, it was after it was like a public.

2510
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:59,880
Maybe it was, I think it was before the Ralph Braykin video.

2511
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:02,520
Well, it would have been then before then, yeah.

2512
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:04,520
Yeah.

2513
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:07,960
I don't, I don't remember.

2514
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:11,960
It was a while ago, but I thought it was pretty funny.

2515
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:14,040
So I'm glad this guy thought so too.

2516
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:15,560
Yeah, I think it was pretty good.

2517
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:16,680
I really hate her.

2518
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:18,760
I probably shouldn't.

2519
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:26,440
Honestly, I probably should just like pity her and like not consider her like an entity with like

2520
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:33,480
moral, what's the word, agency, like on a level that deserves hate, but I can't help myself.

2521
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:42,760
She followed me on Twitter recently because I was, because I was making fun of Trixie.

2522
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:44,840
And I said, oh, yuck.

2523
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:45,880
Oh, gross.

2524
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,360
Christ.

2525
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:47,400
What do I do?

2526
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:48,360
Who followed you on Twitter?

2527
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:49,160
You mean Trixie?

2528
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:49,880
No, May.

2529
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:50,360
May did.

2530
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:51,720
Oh.

2531
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:52,760
You know who that is?

2532
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:53,480
Do you know who that is?

2533
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:55,000
Yeah.

2534
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:55,640
Yeah.

2535
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:55,960
Okay.

2536
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:57,880
I don't know.

2537
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:00,840
I might, might soft, might soft block that.

2538
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:04,680
Just might, might just wait, might just wait for a minute until she forgets that she did that.

2539
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:08,760
And then just soft block that and just don't want, don't want those eyes on me.

2540
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:11,080
Thank you very much.

2541
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:17,320
Um, next voicemail is called Hamshank.

2542
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:19,080
And here it is.

2543
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,880

2544
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:25,240

2547
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:28,760
Damn.

2548
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:31,800
I'm like an evil Ben St. Guy.

2549
02:17:32,360 --> 02:17:35,240
What I'm like, I'm like a, I'm like a Ham guy, like a pig guy.

2550
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:36,600
Isn't that just the regular one?

2551
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:37,960
That's the regular Ben St. Guy.

2552
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:40,920
You know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill Ben St.

2553
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:42,680
Because I hate him.

2554
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:43,640
I thought you were my guy.

2555
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:44,760
That's my character.

2556
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:47,720
And I'm gonna turn, I'm gonna turn him into fucking pork steaks.

2557
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:49,240
I'm gonna fry him up on my grill.

2558
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:51,160
I'm not, I'm not pork.

2559
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:56,920
And also I wanna fuck Nate.

2560
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:58,040
This guy is so on point.

2561
02:17:58,040 --> 02:17:59,720
He's got so much such strong theming.

2562
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:00,200
Or whatever.

2563
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:04,280
That's also my bit is that I wanna fuck Nate.

2564
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:06,760
Also I'm one of those, I'm one of those Nate.

2565
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:07,960
You're in good company friends.

2566
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:09,560
That's me.

2567
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:12,120
I'm Ham, I'm Hamshank.

2568
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:12,920
Voice grill?

2569
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:13,560
Voice grill?

2570
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,120
Hamshank.

2571
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:21,320
That's a pretty good fit.

2572
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:24,200
That's a respectable hustle with that bit.

2573
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:24,760
Hey, thanks.

2574
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:25,480
Hey, thanks.

2575
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:26,760
Nice to meet you, Hamshank.

2576
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:30,280
I can't, I can't wait for the Hamshank arc to begin.

2577
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:31,880
The saga.

2578
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:34,360
That was, was extraordinary.

2579
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:35,960
Okay.

2580
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:38,520
Next one, I posted it.

2581
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:43,400
It is called ice cream fiend, three, two, one, go.

2582
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:47,640
Hey guys, I just wanted to know how you eat your ice cream.

2583
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:49,480
Do you eat it right out of the box?

2584
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,280
Do you, uh, do you microwave it first?

2585
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:53,800
Do you pour milk in it?

2586
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:54,680
Microwave it?

2587
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:55,720
Let me know.

2588
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:56,520
Pour milk in it?

2589
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,520
Who the fuck eats it out of the box?

2590
02:18:58,520 --> 02:18:59,720
Do you mean just with a spoon?

2591
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:01,640
Or do you mean you shove your face in there?

2592
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:04,680
I would say, yeah.

2593
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:08,760
Well, I mean, back when I used to eat ice cream normally,

2594
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:10,680
I would just take a spoon to the tub,

2595
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:11,960
eat a few bites out of the tub,

2596
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:13,400
put it back in the freezer.

2597
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:17,800
Now, the only ice cream I get is keto ice cream from Aldi,

2598
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,920
and the way that I eat it,

2599
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:21,160
because it's very hard when it's out of the freezer,

2600
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:24,120
so I microwave it for about 30 seconds to soften it up,

2601
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:27,240
then I scoop out exactly half of one tub,

2602
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,600
and I put it in a bowl, and then I eat it out of the bowl.

2603
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:35,880
Or if I'm feeling saucy, I take out half of the tub,

2604
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:40,200
and I put it into a mason jar full of coffee and almond milk,

2605
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:42,600
and then I, and then I stir it around in there,

2606
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:45,080
and I make a, and I make a whatever the fuck it's called

2607
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:46,520
when you put ice cream in coffee.

2608
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:51,000
So those are the two ways that I consume my ice cream.

2609
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:54,840
Thank you for asking and have a blessed day.

2610
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:58,760
I just eat a scoops in a bowl,

2611
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:01,560
and I sometimes put something crunchy in there,

2612
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:07,480
like a Rice Krispy or like a chocolate flake or something,

2613
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:11,960
something to give it a crunchlets.

2614
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:13,320
Oh, wait, wait.

2615
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:16,120
You like pour some Rice Krispies into your ice cream?

2616
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:20,120
Not Rice Krispies, I'm trying to think of like,

2617
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:23,960
there's things I've put in ice cream that were like, based.

2618
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:25,880
Oh, no, like granola?

2619
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:26,680
Like granola!

2620
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:30,480
brownie bits it was brownie crumbs if there's like cake crumbs or brownie

2621
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:34,920
crumbs from like a cake but then I put those in there do you do you do you

2622
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:39,880
frequently just have like cake and or brownie crumbs like stashed no we're

2623
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:43,480
not frequently not stashed I mean like if there's like a somebody's got a

2624
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:47,400
birthday and there's a cake we put like the cake out on a plate and put like a

2625
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:51,960
bowl over it and yeah and people can just take a slice when they feel like it

2626
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:58,360
sure and similar with brownies like some sometimes my brother made brownies

2627
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:01,520
just on a whim and then we would have brownies around and we could just have

2628
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:07,120
them and I like putting ice cream on brownies so you would scoop yourself some

2629
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:11,120
ice cream and they would go over to this like half-eaten tray of brownies and

2630
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:14,680
just I don't know like crumble it with your hands like grab some with your

2631
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:19,000
hands and just like crumbled up I would take a whole brownie it's not just the

2632
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:24,160
crumbs I would take it's only a few times I put a brownie I just eat ice cream

2633
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:28,680
so whatever okay putting putting a brownie on it it mean if you've got a

2634
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:33,720
brownie sure that makes that makes perfect sense well I just I eat it out

2635
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:41,040
of a cup and I shelled out you know just have an ice cool time I'm so I school

2636
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:45,480
wait I want to go back I want to go back so you do not you're saying you do not

2637
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:51,080
pour rice Krispies on your ice cream no but saying it makes me think maybe that

2638
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:54,960
could work maybe I mean that's what you said maybe like you said you honey

2639
02:21:54,960 --> 02:22:00,720
and not Cheerios or something some cereal okay do you give it a crunch do

2640
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:04,360
you actually do that though or is this just this is all hypothetical it's

2641
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:08,880
hypothetical the rice Krispies it's funny it's a funny idea it's if I saw you

2642
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:13,720
someone do that I would be like what the fuck are you doing hey it's ice cream

2643
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:18,160
and cream is just milk that's different I you know I get I say that but at the

2644
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:21,280
same I'm imagining it I'm like I guess it wouldn't be too bad I guess it'd be

2645
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:27,760
alright don't you guys eat beans on toast I'm a beans on toast defender yeah I

2646

innovate on this ice cream eating stuff because eating it with a spoon why who

2660
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:55,040
cares you don't I'm putting it in some sliced bread but it was like nice like

2661
02:23:55,040 --> 02:24:00,280
tasty bread I don't think it would work on whole meal or anything it's sort of

2662
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:05,560
the sweetness of like the the you know the processed loaf and you put the ice

2663
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:13,840
cream in there and it's somehow it's good it's like chocolate spread like

2664
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:17,840
Nutella you put that on a sandwich that works it's the same thing except it's

2665
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:29,440
cold you know it's roll I don't know if I know that I mean I wouldn't put I

2666
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:40,960
wouldn't put no no no I would I wouldn't do it but it's not because I think it

2667
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:44,960
would taste bad I wouldn't do it because to eat a sandwich you have to bite it

2668
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:48,400
with your teeth so you would have to bite the ice cream with your teeth and

2669
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:52,120
that would hurt my teeth well you wouldn't put like so much ice cream it's

2670
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:57,440
like the ratio of bread to ice cream is that there's enough bread to like soften

2671
02:24:57,440 --> 02:25:01,880
the blow of the cold so it's sort of like you've chomp in you chomp into it

2672
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:06,880
and it's like right on the bottom and it's sort of like so sort of insulates

2673
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:11,600
only as much so only as much ice cream as like you would put like peanut butter

2674
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:15,560
on a peanut butter sandwich yeah maybe a little bit more but yeah something like

2675
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:20,920
that it wasn't like seven scoops squished into I just I don't see I don't see what

2676
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:24,960
the bread adds I don't see what the bread adds I would like right so I just eat

2677
02:25:25,320 --> 02:25:29,840
bread I like bread but not in this not what I'm in an ice cream mood I don't

2678
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:34,680
know I'm challenging your perceptions of reality and you can't yeah and I'm yeah

2679
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:40,680
I can't handle it stop challenging me stop fighting me on this maybe put some

2680
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:45,400
pastrami in there and some cheese and have an ice cream cheese that sounds

2681
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:48,320
really good without the ice cream without the ice cream that sounds great

2682
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:54,560
no but bread is neutral those other things are like savory food that's why

2683
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:59,840
it's like it's not depends on which bread you're talking about but I guess so

2684
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:04,320
but like sometimes you get a white bread that's like kind of sweet or kind of you

2685
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:08,400
know like not salty and it's just sort of delicious scrumptious you would say

2686
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:12,520
putting ice cream on it turns it into a dessert thing rather than a I think a

2687
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:16,000
lunch thing I think we're just I think we're just gonna have to agree to

2688
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,520
disagree on this one I don't I don't think we're gonna see what about putting

2689
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:25,360
I'm gonna leave the podcast I'm gonna leave the podcast I'm gonna leave the

2690
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:29,680
podcast over this you just can't I just can't I just can't be party to this

2691
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:34,160
anymore you're gonna make a website called is ice cream in a sandwich good is

2692
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:43,480
the ice cream on a sandwich I that's a good one I okay we got to move on we

2693
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:46,640
don't have much time we got to keep it under three hours the next the next one

2694
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:54,080
is called sincerity bro time three two one go you know it does kind of suck to

2695
02:26:54,080 --> 02:27:00,560
see this podcast with such like a rich history and background rich like ice

2696
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:07,240
cream a lot of lore behind it like pastrami fall to you know bullshit

2697
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:15,160
fucking Kiwi Farms drama but that's what things have settled a little bit now

2698
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:21,280
that you know there's been some finality to some long-standing issues and you

2699
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:27,960
guys are doing okay and you have fun doing the show because I know yeah it's

2700
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:32,440
fun it is you shouldn't fucking I mean you know I don't know how many fucking

2701
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:39,160
like I don't know how many of those guys there are but it's just that one guy

2702
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:44,640
whose name I s s s ch w videos he's just been doing that for like a year and

2703
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:51,480
God bless him and hopefully there's good things yeah feature thanks for doing a

2704
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:58,520
show thank you I mean I mean I thank you I appreciate it I disagree with the whole

2705
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:05,120
like I don't see what is like watching us fall to Kiwi Farms drama like not

2706
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:08,560
really it didn't have anything to do for I'm first of all I don't consider

2707
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:11,920
Trixie leaving to be the fall I've said this before like it's just we just have

2708
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:16,120
less members which like I don't know if you like those members yeah maybe it's

2709
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:19,720
kind of a bummer that like Trixie was the one with the most subscribers they

2710
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:23,800
associate that with it's a little leading the show and she wasn't on that

2711
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:31,440
much and I especially recently recently recently but yeah recently I hate to

2712
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:36,280
say it happened way before that I hate to say it it's a little unkind to the

2713
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:41,440
viewers but like it's a bit when when people say like oh Trixie left shows

2714
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:46,960
over it's a little bit of the like old oh the procrastinators podcast is Digi

2715
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:52,800
Bro's anime podcast energy it's a little bit like that and it's like I don't I

2716
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:56,720
don't know about that I just don't know about that but this I don't want to say

2717
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:59,840
that this guy is not like that this guy is you're a nice guy glad you like the

2718
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:03,920
podcast I'm still having fun yeah we're just gonna keep we're just gonna keep on

2719
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:09,400
you know I mean it's it's so easy why wouldn't we it's such a surprise that so

2720
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:15,120
many people have left it take it thank you thank you yes this is what I say

2721
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:20,240
there's like there's so little there's so little involved in doing this there's

2722
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:26,080
nothing you just show up for three hours on a Sunday and you and you just

2723
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:33,320
fucking that's it I'm not having fun I'm just here for the paycheck that's

2724
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:37,200
right that's right and we want and we aim to keep it that way you're not you're

2725
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:40,880
actually not allowed to have fun when you're here you have to be working you

2726
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:47,480
have to be picking up the slack for the rest of us but to move it along the next

2727
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:54,440
voicemail is called what is it called it is called oh wait okay I had to skip

2728
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:59,600
some here I just want to I got this this one guy left some voicemails and

2729
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:05,920
apparently these voicemails were about being angry about not getting the

2730
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:12,360
plebe and the weeb blu-rays a completely valid thing to be angry about in my

2731
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:18,360
opinion but I guess but I guess this guy is in he's a Jesse patron and I guess

2732
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:24,280
and I guess bring after bringing the issue up in that the Jesse patreon

2733
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:31,040
server this guy was convinced through some by someone to withdraw that

2734
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:35,680
statement and say no no I don't want you to play my voicemails where I'm mad I

2735
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:40,360
know it's okay no no I'm not mad no it's fine it's really don't let them know

2736
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:44,840
that I'm mad that I didn't get the thing I paid for so I just thought that was

2737
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:53,400
funny but he wanted me not to play them so I won't play them Lamal you screened

2738
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:58,720
this particular voicemail I didn't know I didn't listen to them but he just said

2739
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:05,000
please don't play them and I was like fine next one so the next one is called

2740
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:20,040
farms times three two one go is it not working do you guys hear I don't hear

2741

2742
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:33,800

2743
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:38,960

2744
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:46,240
mom key three two one go it's me your mom you drill I love I would just like to

2745
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:54,120
say that told you so what does that mean also I cheated on sheep it's true it's

2746
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:59,720
true this is when you did a minute okay I guess this I guess this is a joke but

2747
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:04,880
this reminds me some some people say and I don't know about this so I've seen some

2748
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:09,320
people respond to the Trixie thing along with the doomsaing of oh no the

2749
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:15,080
podcast isn't is ruined the podcast is over PCP is finally fallen to the sands

2750
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:19,680
of time I've seen a few people say like Jesse knew this would happen Jesse called

2751
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:25,800
it and I saw that and I don't know what that means I genuinely don't know why

2752
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:30,440
you would think that unless maybe the only thing I can think of is like did

2753
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:35,720
Jesse predict either that Trixie would leave one day I don't remember him

2754
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:42,440
saying that did Jesse predict that the podcast would end one day well guess

2755
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:48,760
what everything ends eventually so even if the podcast were destroyed and in

2756
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:54,080
shambles and over wouldn't really be that much of a prediction so you know good

2757
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:59,180
job I guess I think I saw them link to I'm not sure if this is a quote from

2758
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:04,580
Jesse but they link to something where supposedly Jesse said that everyone in

2759
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:08,740
the PCP will eventually turn against each other and hate each other that's

2760
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:13,900
just how life goes of course obviously that's going to happen eventually on a

2761
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:20,100
long enough time frame I think that's what they're referencing um well that's

2762
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:25,020
not even true I mean it's I mean it's it's literally only like me and Trixie I

2763
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:31,940
mean I think that's like that's that's by far the biggest beef that there is when

2764
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:36,340
it when it comes to like beef between members that's the biggest one that I

2765
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:40,980
can think of everyone else is like not not interested in being on a podcast

2766
02:33:40,980 --> 02:33:45,340
which is a different thing than hating each other but there was also the

2767
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:50,420
the monkey thing before right okay but yeah yeah I guess yeah I mean I guess

2768
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:54,860
that's true I guess that's true yeah if you want to count that one sure but still

2769
02:33:55,740 --> 02:34:02,380
still I mean was there infighting did it cause refs yes I mean I guess I mean we

2770
02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:08,260
had arguments way back in the day so like I whatever sure it was sure none of us

2771
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:12,540
were like agreeing with literally everything else everyone else said

2772
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:18,380
there was strong personality so like yeah I think prediction of that like you I don't know

2773
02:34:18,380 --> 02:34:23,180
whatever I mean I guess it's a little true but yeah whatever okay infamous uh yellow

2774
02:34:23,180 --> 02:34:30,700
argument right gotta say uh the the explaining yig studios video looking real

2775

2840
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:33,940
you are they talking about a flash cart I yeah I think they're talking about a flash card which

2841
02:42:33,940 --> 02:42:40,580
yeah honestly that is pretty definitely the best way to enjoy the 3ds or ds or whatever

2842
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:47,140
actually yeah super super cool super good that's how I played uh that's how I played heart gold

2843
02:42:47,140 --> 02:42:51,700
that was the game that I like when I when I got brunswick in that game I was playing heart gold

2844
02:42:51,700 --> 02:43:00,340
on a flash card um next voicemail is called stealing is cool stealing is cool shoplifts

2845
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:06,820
folks don't get caught that's that's my shops are too heavy to lift next voicemail is called

2846
02:43:06,820 --> 02:43:13,380
frost drive three two one go so on a recent episode Tom mentioned the story of how Godzilla was

2847
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:19,460
created to be a representation of nuclear warfare yeah and I'm guessing the Godzilla creators wanted

2848
02:43:19,540 --> 02:43:26,180
the message to be that nukes are bad but they did the exact opposite because Godzilla is the coolest

2849
02:43:26,180 --> 02:43:31,700
monster ever just like hell nukes are the coolest thing ever which is why they just made a new

2850
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:37,540
type of nuclear bomb that can travel so fast that countries can't even detect it and respond in time

2851
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:42,180
nice I love meaning the president in the white house will be killed and it's all destroyed

2852
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:47,460
before they even know when nuke is coming and so how do you combat that you just make your country

2853
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:52,100
automatically fire nuclear bombs to the other country in every country bombs every other country

2854
02:43:52,100 --> 02:43:56,100
and if you haven't heard of this guys I recommend looking it up because it's interesting

2855
02:43:56,100 --> 02:44:01,060
yet scary as fuck because this could be what ends life on earth if climate change doesn't you know

2856
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:04,900
I know about I know about mutually assured destruction it's all inspired by Godzilla so

2857
02:44:05,540 --> 02:44:11,860
no thanks Godzilla no we got it backwards you're right you're right I fucking Einstein saw Godzilla

2858
02:44:11,860 --> 02:44:19,300
and he thought hmm oh right though god's nuke to make that real in in like other movies Godzilla

2859
02:44:19,300 --> 02:44:23,780
is like the kind of I mean he's he's just kind of like a dumb force of nature but he still is

2860
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:30,580
like kind of a good guy who fights against some like even worse monsters I think which I mean

2861
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:36,180
I guess you could argue that nukes could like if if aliens invaded and like we fought them off with

2862
02:44:36,180 --> 02:44:42,420
nukes I guess you could say that like we use them for good against a greater evil so maybe it's not

2863
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:49,780
a complete metaphor failure I don't know the idea that you know I googled like a really quick

2864
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:55,860
nuclear bomb fast nuclear bomb I can't find anything yet what does it seems like

2865
02:44:57,460 --> 02:45:03,620
my nukes are pretty cool I don't know I'm sure I'm sure there is a new a fast nuke that's undetectable

2866
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:11,620
it sounds exactly like what we would do next voicemail not to get hung up is called a message

2867
02:45:11,620 --> 02:45:20,420
from your gaping ass three two one go hi Ben so I'm just driving around my car after a long day of

2868
02:45:20,420 --> 02:45:31,300
work and it's got me thinking is Trixie retarded um that's all I wanted to ask let me know and uh

2869
02:45:32,980 --> 02:45:39,860
love you I think I don't know what that uh like for talking literal medical I don't think so

2870
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:47,620
I know I wouldn't say literally stick somewhere on the spectrum she's she's not I don't what you

2871
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:52,580
can't just you can't just say that what you can't just say that you can't just self-diagnose that

2872
02:45:53,700 --> 02:46:01,140
huh everybody knows because she said so a doctor didn't say oh yeah okay whatever she's not well

2873
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:07,700
whatever not neurotypical I mean what do you want she who says she's not neurotypical who said who's

2874
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:14,260
to say I don't know because she does she act weird and dumb I mean so do I sometimes I mean not as

2875
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:20,260
much obviously the title of this voicemail I'm surprised it wasn't just a giant fort

2876
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:27,700
this this a message from your gaping ass has left voicemails before I I nominate him for voice

2877
02:46:27,700 --> 02:46:33,860
grail actually I'm a little bit disappointed this wasn't a no worthy one no no unlike all those

2878
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:39,940
other ones that I nominated this episode that were absolutely grail worthy um I think she is

2879
02:46:40,900 --> 02:46:48,500
a fundamentally unintelligent person who is furthermore at the moment deeply entrenched

2880
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:57,300
in delusional thoughts that are being enforced by others by her own choosing because she likes

2881
02:46:57,300 --> 02:47:03,700
those people because they reinforce her her thinking sure Ben do you think me saying that she

2882
02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:12,420
might be autistic um or like probably is is like uh uh what's the word absolving her of bad thing she

2883
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:20,020
does no I don't I don't think no I don't I don't think that no I know I didn't I see why you would

2884
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:26,420
think that I was assuming that that's not what I meant but I don't think it's it's no my problem

2885
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:31,540
is a different thing which is like sure whatever yeah first of all we're all on the spectrum

2886
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:38,500
but you can't just be like oh I'm autistic because I think I am like this is a you you can't you

2887
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:46,660
can't just self-diagnose yourself you just you just can't do that um uh next voicemail what you do

2888
02:47:46,660 --> 02:47:53,460
with the diagnosis that you make but sure no it that you can't you can't you just you don't do it if

2889
02:47:53,460 --> 02:48:03,540
if you all right I know like literal technical like you can't say for sure until a doctor

2890
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:10,100
does a test or whatever I mean but I mean like practically you can you can see when somebody

2891
02:48:10,100 --> 02:48:17,140
is a little neurodivergent in the way they approach things and I know me better than I know other people

2892
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:27,140
I don't wait I mean I you don't I mean you seem pretty neurotypical I don't know I think I honestly

2893
02:48:27,140 --> 02:48:37,140
Trixie seems pretty neurotypical too they don't look they can judge their if if if if they can just

2894
02:48:37,140 --> 02:48:41,620
like kind of look at themselves and be like hmm I think I kind of act autistic then I can look

2895
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:49,060
at them and be like hmm I think you kind of don't you where's the where's the fair enough I just I

2896
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:55,220
don't know I don't I don't see a problem with it I just feel it's more accurate but what if um

2897
02:48:55,940 --> 02:49:01,060
if they like Sonic the Hedgehog then obviously they're autistic they don't nobody nobody likes

2898
02:49:01,060 --> 02:49:08,660
Sonic the Hedgehog um it's not no you're right no you're right I know you're right um I just okay

2899
02:49:08,660 --> 02:49:14,340
when you go to the doctor it's it's not like they take a brain scan and they look at your corpus

2900
02:49:14,340 --> 02:49:20,260
colosum and you're like ah the structure here is such like a test to determine like based on the way

2901
02:49:20,260 --> 02:49:27,860
you respond to the the questions when you go to the doctor yes yes yes and when you go to the doctor

2902
02:49:27,860 --> 02:49:34,260
they show you a picture of Sonic and they ask you do you like this then they show you with his shoes

2903
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:38,980
off and they say do you still like it they show you they show you a train and then you're off the

2904
02:49:38,980 --> 02:49:47,060
deep end yeah they show you a train and then footless Sonic no okay I understand that qualitatively

2905
02:49:47,060 --> 02:49:52,900
all that a that a doctor does is basically just ask you like how do you feel what is your thought

2906
02:49:52,900 --> 02:49:58,660
process like how do you behave what things do you think and and what are you like and it's and it's

2907
02:49:58,660 --> 02:50:06,820
it's subjective in the same way that just like taking a fucking quiz online is but nevertheless

2908
02:50:07,460 --> 02:50:13,380
I like I would I would only trust an expert I would only trust an expert to make that judgment

2909
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:17,860
I would never I would never trust a layman I would never trust a layman to make that judgment

2910
02:50:17,860 --> 02:50:24,900
about themselves including someone talking about their own themselves or anyone else is is is inherently

2911
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:31,860
like biased like it's it's compromise yeah it totally is yeah it totally is totally the

2912
02:50:32,420 --> 02:50:39,620
this argument is called appeal to authority well it's a no appeal generally I feel like

2913
02:50:39,620 --> 02:50:45,540
there's there's nothing wrong with Ben's reasoning here when I don't think my reasoning is like out

2914
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:51,700
of line either but you know it's just a difference it's a appeal to authority is only a fallacy

2915
02:50:51,700 --> 02:50:58,660
if there's not good reason yeah if it's not if a person's authority is not like directly relevant

2916
02:50:58,660 --> 02:51:06,980
to the question being asked um like sometimes doctors get things wrong you know yeah sometimes

2917
02:51:06,980 --> 02:51:11,860
they are more likely to be correct every every expert does something wrong at some point that

2918
02:51:11,860 --> 02:51:18,340
doesn't mean their expertise is therefore inherently bad because that would contradict the point of

2919
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:27,700
expertise I I mean I I've said this before we're we're all on the spectrum I really think we are

2920
02:51:27,700 --> 02:51:37,620
all we are all to a certain degree autistic but like that doesn't really mean much no especially

2921
02:51:37,620 --> 02:51:42,020
not to this voicemail question who just basically just asking is Trixie dumb

2922
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:51,700
um yeah well I guess you could say that we're all on the retardation spectrum to one degree or

2923
02:51:51,700 --> 02:52:00,260
another maybe I don't know that's a good point perhaps I don't know um okay I feel like we've

2924
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:07,060
I feel like we've answered this one plenty um next voicemail is called uh

2925
02:52:07,780 --> 02:52:19,300
um wait next voicemail is called what I lost my place PCP protag three two one go hey so to

2926
02:52:19,300 --> 02:52:26,420
answer last week's question on who is the protagonist to the procrastinators it's really

2927
02:52:26,420 --> 02:52:33,060
more of an ensemble piece but I'd say who the main character is depends on what era the show

2928
02:52:33,060 --> 02:52:39,300
you're watching so I would say the original main character was Digi back when they were called that

2929
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:44,500
because they were the one that everybody kind of knew and got into the show from them so they'd see

2930
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:50,900
it through his eyes and then I don't think that's a good argument they left and the show kind of

2931
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:55,300
went over to Nate uh because they were the one because he was the one steering the ship for

2932
02:52:55,300 --> 02:53:02,020
the longest time and now it's Ben Ben is the main character now that Nate is gone and Trixie is the

2933
02:53:02,020 --> 02:53:11,060
antagonist uh sorry give your side character get a subplot uh the end of the PCP Tom will be the

2934
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:16,660
main character because everyone else has long been dead and he's just waiting out the heat

2935
02:53:16,660 --> 02:53:22,820
death of the universe because Tom will never die Tom is completely stable call me back Tom is a

2936
02:53:22,820 --> 02:53:28,580
completely stable element like lead he will never decay he will never change at all maybe it's true

2937
02:53:28,580 --> 02:53:33,540
that like when you when you assume when you assume the leader the role of leader of the PCP you

2938
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:39,140
become volatile and eventually you explode and you have to you have to leave the podcast eventually

2939
02:53:40,100 --> 02:53:46,740
I thought I was a protagonist you are a you are a um you're like uh what's the word

2940
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:55,700
you're an exchange student from an anime you're like you're like Griff what's oh the Griffin

2941
02:53:55,700 --> 02:54:03,460
in Milo Pony who had like the two episodes about her gilda no gilda you're like gilda you are like

2942
02:54:03,460 --> 02:54:10,180
a side character who I haven't seen the shows I don't know you are a side character who by by popular

2943
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:17,940
requests keeps getting brought back for increasingly irrelevant diversions that's true yeah by popular

2944
02:54:18,020 --> 02:54:26,580
request next voicemail is called uh I wanted to say quick about the oh sure this the the side

2945
02:54:26,580 --> 02:54:33,380
character thing uh it sounds like it's a dig and I mean from their perspective I guess it would be

2946
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:39,460
but like I've never been much for the the leader I've always been like a quip sort of person

2947
02:54:40,500 --> 02:54:45,060
even way back in the beginning I was always the one who like made the punchline while everyone

2948
02:54:45,060 --> 02:54:52,820
else like filled the air it would be like so I side character fits yeah it's yeah I don't know

2949
02:54:52,820 --> 02:54:57,620
whether I need a subplot like what would I do like I just take over the show like I'd be the one

2950
02:54:57,620 --> 02:55:02,100
saying welcome to the progress days it doesn't doesn't mean anything I'm too chill I think it I

2951
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:07,700
think a side that would be just like you should be going at uh uh welcome to show when I first came

2952
02:55:07,700 --> 02:55:14,100
on I think uh in 2018 I think I think a side plot would be like it's not that you're hosting the

2953
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:18,420
show it's that just like you're on the show and it's not like the main focus but you like

2954
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:25,140
occasionally like make reference to some like weird side story that you've got going on in the

2955
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:31,860
background you're like oh yeah uh you know these uh uh this week uh it's kind of kind of a rough

2956
02:55:31,860 --> 02:55:37,940
week I'm a little stressed out these guys these guys in black suits and sunglasses keep knocking

2957
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:43,300
on my keep knocking on my door every hour of every day um just you know it's it's hard to sleep but

2958
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:46,660
like you know I'm dealing with it you know and then like you're you're gone from the next week and

2959
02:55:46,660 --> 02:55:52,100
you're like oh yeah I spent the last couldn't be on last week because I was like duct taped in someone's

2960
02:55:52,100 --> 02:55:56,180
car trunk but like you know they let me out eventually and I'm back and like don't worry about it

2961
02:55:57,300 --> 02:56:02,740
that would be like a side arc I think well can't you have a multiple protagonists

2962
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:09,940
yeah I suppose yeah I mean first this guy says it was an ensemble piece but then he goes on to be

2963
02:56:10,260 --> 02:56:14,900
well but in spite of that let me make arguments for who to pretend I guess it's a I guess it's a

2964
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:21,380
reasonable I guess it's a reasonable way to category okay I don't I don't hate this uh uh

2965
02:56:21,380 --> 02:56:27,620
thinking too much it's fine voice grail voice grail I don't hate it voice grail sorry bits old bits old

2966
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:37,540
next voicemail is called oh it's called a message from your gaping ass two uh I already posted it

2967
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:44,740
okay three two one go hey it's me again uh just want to say like

2968
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:48,980
is it wrong yes

2969
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:59,060
um okay what wrong sure it's wrong definitely it is wrong probably deaf definitely wrong

2970
02:56:59,940 --> 02:57:13,060
uh next one is called l o b r rise up uh come on come on discord upload okay three two one go

2971
02:57:14,500 --> 02:57:22,340
you know I'm getting tired of the league of natebuckers so I'm starting a new

2972
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:32,180
organization christ the legion of ben rapist oh god no come on because I'm coming for you

2973
02:57:32,180 --> 02:57:40,260
please come in hard gross it's even even more sinister because rape is explicit rather than

2974
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:48,100
implied rather than the old one was merely implied yeah um the the um I how am I supposed to be

2975
02:57:48,100 --> 02:57:52,980
intimidated by this guy he doesn't even have a voice filter I don't I frankly I I don't think he

2976
02:57:52,980 --> 02:58:00,660
could do it I don't think he's man enough I don't think he's I don't think he's wait no I'm going to

2977
02:58:00,660 --> 02:58:06,900
say I don't think he's flanged enough but then no when you have a flange you don't rape you have

2978
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:11,860
consensual sex when you are flanged and you have a non you have forced copulation when you're

2979
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:19,140
unflanged because you're a loser so I do think this guy is unflanged but I don't think he will

2980
02:58:19,140 --> 02:58:28,100
rape me he he's got aspirations to be flanged yeah but he can't do it obviously nobody can only

2981
02:58:28,100 --> 02:58:35,460
only the only the greatest ape on the boreal range can claim that honor okay next voicemail

2982
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:41,780
is called um the brony lecture is dead let's keep it that way three two one go

2983
02:58:42,580 --> 02:58:47,060
so Trixie is still going on about how she's willing to redo the brony lecture with you guys

2984
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:53,460
I gotta ask what the fuck would even be the point anymore yep because even under the best

2985
02:58:53,460 --> 02:58:59,380
circumstances trying to recapture that energy would be kind of awkward and forced yeah but it's a

2986
02:58:59,380 --> 02:59:04,740
lecture about how you became friends and then half of the people who are at the lecture aren't on the

2987
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:10,580
show and now you guys fucking hate each other and then Riley would be there and producing it

2988
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:17,140
so it would just be objectively worse by every single metric imaginable I don't even want it

2989
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:24,740
anymore frankly uh it's dead let's keep it that way this guy uh I still want sonichu 102 though Ben

2990
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:30,820
I know I know the dimensional merge I I know that's true you're right about that um about the

2991
02:59:30,820 --> 02:59:36,820
brony lecture I totally agree I I would still I would like it if Trixie were to have a change of

2992
02:59:36,820 --> 02:59:42,340
heart and post the old lecture because it was an entertaining lecture she seems dead set on never

2993
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:50,740
doing that um and if and if I mean I guess I can't force her so that that's just she has made up her

2994
02:59:50,740 --> 02:59:56,340
mind and I don't know what I can do about it the idea of re-filming it though is like I have no

2995
02:59:56,340 --> 03:00:00,500
interest in that at all I think for all the reasons you said it it's a terrible idea it wouldn't

2996
03:00:00,500 --> 03:00:06,820
even be good even if we did it which we shouldn't because it's stupid um and I I'd never really

2997
03:00:06,820 --> 03:00:13,140
considered the the the awkwardness of the recording I didn't mind in my brain had never even got to

2998
03:00:13,140 --> 03:00:18,420
the point imagine what it would be like if we actually did it imagine like reacting to that

2999
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:25,700
and like pretending you didn't hear the first one yeah I agree that um that sounds like a horrible

3000
03:00:25,700 --> 03:00:32,500
idea it is so yeah no not interested in that under any circumstances um I would only care

3001
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:37,780
about the first one but yeah that seems to be that seems to have been taken off the table

3002
03:00:38,340 --> 03:00:45,300
by Trixie so I mean it is what it is good voicemail and now you've been taken off the table too

3003
03:00:46,260 --> 03:00:54,100
I will take you out behind the shed and put you out of your misery sir

3004

3007
03:01:20,740 --> 03:01:26,340

3008
03:01:26,340 --> 03:01:32,900
kingdom hearts hearts I have not watched that one um I haven't watched it yet but uh seems like it

3009
03:01:32,900 --> 03:01:37,860
might be good I think maybe it's pretty good it's like it's classic Nate talking about something

3010
03:01:38,660 --> 03:01:44,820
it's only part one apparently um okay well Nate I'm sorry you feel that way

3024
03:03:48,980 --> 03:03:56,500
furniture and like appliances sorted um so how about you do you have a fridge

3025

03:04:08,340 --> 03:04:14,340
wonder stoveless wonder over here well I got so what was the hard what was what was the hardest

3028
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:19,060
part of moving so what was what was the hardest part of moving I think is the question oh um

3029
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:29,220
uh I mean I don't know it was most things are quite simple obviously uh the ground I got

3030
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:35,140
everything I got everything uh packed and then parents helped me drive it all the way over there

3031
03:04:35,140 --> 03:04:42,580
it wasn't that long got it all out and uh then I had to like buy like a frying pan and a

3032
03:04:42,580 --> 03:04:50,420
and spatula and stuff for cooking on Amazon and that's it I mean it's not really been very

3033
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:55,220
difficult to get settled in the only thing that sucks is that the illness that is

3034
03:04:55,940 --> 03:05:02,740
it's oh yeah that would be the hard part yeah I didn't expect it at first it was like oh this is

3035
03:05:02,740 --> 03:05:10,740
so cool I felt fine and then something something about the new location the water the you know maybe

3036
03:05:10,740 --> 03:05:16,340
I cooked something really bad for myself I'm not exactly sure what's different and I got sick

3037
03:05:16,340 --> 03:05:22,340
and I've been sick for a little quite a while now actually almost two weeks I'm fine some some of

3038
03:05:22,340 --> 03:05:30,740
the time I'm fine more than I used to be so it's looking up the um that reminds me um Munchie and

3039
03:05:30,740 --> 03:05:35,700
Cassie are moving in like because like with the end of the school at the end of the school year

3040
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:41,780
oh did they yeah at the end of the school year they are moving to like a place and I told them I

3041
03:05:41,780 --> 03:05:48,740
would help them move so I guess I guess I'll be I'll be doing a terrible mistake Ben you should

3042
03:05:48,740 --> 03:05:55,940
never help anyone move I know I know but I helped I helped Cassie move into her dorm

3043
03:05:55,940 --> 03:06:00,980
like at the beginning of the year so I guess I guess this is just a theme now I guess I'm just

3044
03:06:00,980 --> 03:06:06,980
on the hook for all future moves didn't you watch the Seinfeld episode about helping people move

3045
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:15,300
I feel like I think I have I think I have I don't mind by the way I don't actually mind at all it'll

3046
03:06:15,300 --> 03:06:27,220
probably be fun uh next next voicemail I guess is called exploring the great beyond lyrical

3049
03:06:47,300 --> 03:06:56,180
that fridge is made of lead so it's gone for good machines are meant to drown unless they're the

3050
03:06:56,180 --> 03:07:10,580

3067
03:09:15,700 --> 03:09:20,820
gonna try to steal the channel from Trixie I think that the rebrand was a way for him to then

3068
03:09:21,860 --> 03:09:29,220
be like oh well yiggs our thing now and Trixie's not a part of us anymore uh I'm a producer

03:09:29,220 --> 03:09:34,580
or some stupid shit uh you try to similar thing with monkey jones he like wore the mask and

3070
03:09:34,580 --> 03:09:39,540
pretended to be him or something at least that's what I heard I heard about uh I think you talked

3071
03:09:39,540 --> 03:09:45,540
to monkey jones about it he said that he is down for an episode then I know that Tom and give don't

3072
03:09:45,540 --> 03:09:51,140
want to shit talk Trixie but monkey jones is definitely down to shit talk Trixie and I really

3073
03:09:51,140 --> 03:09:57,780
want to see it um uh make it happen uh I might do something I don't know I might do something um

3074
03:09:57,780 --> 03:10:05,540
but um okay I don't think yig I don't think yig by which I mean the collective entity that is the

3075
03:10:05,540 --> 03:10:13,060
four of them I don't think it will even survive the year um uh there's the the money's just not

3076
03:10:13,060 --> 03:10:21,380
there I kind of thought it's gonna last that long the money's just not there to sustain it um the um

3077
03:10:22,180 --> 03:10:29,380
I I don't okay I I thought like you that this is like a right that yiggs studio is like Riley's

3078
03:10:29,380 --> 03:10:35,380
scheme to rebrand the channel and call it like um hit a thing that he has partial ownership of

3079
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:40,820
stealing the channel maybe but I think I have reconsidered and I think I was giving him too

3080
03:10:40,820 --> 03:10:46,980
much credit that he's some kind of like mastermind behind all this I believe Trixie when she says that

3081
03:10:46,980 --> 03:10:52,500
yiggs studio and like changing the channel was her idea maybe maybe she didn't think of the name

3082
03:10:52,500 --> 03:10:57,060
I don't know but I believe that like completely changing the channel and changing the branding

3083
03:10:57,060 --> 03:11:05,620
to something totally unrelated I believe that that was all her doing um because um from recent

3084
03:11:05,620 --> 03:11:12,580
comments on like streams and stuff from Riley suggests that Riley at least now he seems to be

3085
03:11:12,580 --> 03:11:18,820
or have been I think I think he probably said he wasn't against it before but I think he has seen

3086
03:11:18,820 --> 03:11:25,780
the consequences of it and is now saying that he was against the rebrand uh in the beginning to begin

3087
03:11:25,780 --> 03:11:33,060
with because it like has like killed the viewer base and uh and killed their ad revenue I think he

3088
03:11:33,060 --> 03:11:39,220
is against it and like he claims to be the one that is getting her to make anime content because

3089
03:11:39,220 --> 03:11:45,140
it's the only thing keeping the old subs around and he claims to be like uh you shouldn't you

3090
03:11:45,140 --> 03:11:51,060
shouldn't have changed the channel name you shouldn't have not parked your old twitter handle uh and

3091
03:11:51,060 --> 03:11:56,820
stuff like that so I don't think it's entirely like uh this is just Riley's scheme to steal the

3092
03:11:56,820 --> 03:12:04,500
channel I think there's I think it's more of a two-way street there um but yeah I feel like

3093
03:12:05,460 --> 03:12:11,940
regardless of of Riley and the gang I feel like Trixie would have done something like this anyway

3094
03:12:11,940 --> 03:12:19,700
due to associating the name Digi Bro with previous life and transitioning so get it rid of the old

3095
03:12:19,700 --> 03:12:26,820
name I feel like a rebrand was coming anyway you know that um old videos have started reappearing

3096
03:12:26,900 --> 03:12:33,860
though right uh few of them yeah yeah I've seen uh I've seen you mentioned that she has this really

3097
03:12:33,860 --> 03:12:39,620
this really annoys me because she in her in the announcement video she says I'm deleting

3098
03:12:40,420 --> 03:12:46,260
all but the video all but the videos that I feel like most encapsulate like my current mindset

3099
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:50,660
or something actually uh I should correct you here because she said she's privating all of them

3100
03:12:50,660 --> 03:12:54,900
but you're right leading them she said she was she said she was privating them well she said

3101
03:12:54,900 --> 03:13:00,100
she was privating them permanently and she encouraged people to archive all of them and she

3102
03:13:00,100 --> 03:13:07,220
said that ones that she liked she would like re-dub and re and perhaps re-upload but she didn't do

3103
03:13:07,220 --> 03:13:13,460
that she has just started like un-privating them and I really think I really think this is a Riley

3104
03:13:13,460 --> 03:13:20,180
thing I really think Riley is like what you did killed the channel please unkill it by like

3105
03:13:20,260 --> 03:13:26,740
un-privating those videos even though you don't like them I did see a snippet of a stream where

3106
03:13:26,740 --> 03:13:34,100
Riley was talking about uh that the decision to private all the videos wasn't his decision

3107
03:13:34,660 --> 03:13:40,820
yeah yeah yeah that's what I mean he he he is now against it and well he should be because I mean

3108
03:13:40,820 --> 03:13:46,020
I think he's a little more pragmatic I don't think Trixie has like any clue she's like has like no

3109
03:13:46,020 --> 03:13:53,300
feat on on reality in terms of like what money is I think Riley at least understands that money

3110
03:13:53,300 --> 03:14:00,980
is required to continue this operation um so he's the more pragmatic one in this situation he's the

3111
03:14:00,980 --> 03:14:07,860
one that's like we gotta not kill the channel we gotta not do this I think he's yeah that sounds

3112
03:14:07,860 --> 03:14:16,740
pretty crazy I think he's panicking a little bit um uh anyway I guess that's all I have to say about

3113
03:14:16,740 --> 03:14:28,180
that um next voicemail is called Sakurakan ikimasu part one uh sorry let me get it here right there

3122
03:15:45,300 --> 03:15:51,220

03:16:14,340 --> 03:16:21,620
says we can't go over that kill elia's are remove elia's are elia's are doesn't run the podcast

3127
03:16:21,620 --> 03:16:26,740
if elia's are doesn't have a computer that can edit basic video he shouldn't be the editor

3128
03:16:26,740 --> 03:16:30,340
you know what you're literally going to voicemail is just to your idiots be like

3129

but i don't want to fuck me i don't give a fuck give me podcasts unconstrained by time release the

3130
03:16:37,060 --> 03:16:46,340

3131
03:16:46,340 --> 03:16:54,900
guy um it's i mean it was confusing i was well i guess it's not that confusing but like doing the

3132
03:16:54,900 --> 03:17:01,220
the animated faces to our voice does it does break down after about three hours and like

3133
03:17:01,220 --> 03:17:08,420
after effects um but that doesn't mean you can't like do two passes and then stitch them together

3134
03:17:08,420 --> 03:17:18,100
in premiere i feel like it's possible to make a long video like that yeah yeah yeah it really

3135
03:17:18,100 --> 03:17:24,580
should be i mean we're we're already over the three hour mark now so i guess i guess we'll see

3136
03:17:24,580 --> 03:17:29,780

03:17:30,500 --> 03:17:34,340
a lot of it is the voicemails well we've been going for i mean we've been we've been on the

3142
03:18:06,660 --> 03:18:13,620
hey guys i just wanted to say that i really like the direction that the show has been going

3143
03:18:13,620 --> 03:18:20,180
lately so thank you give up the good work on that front but i have a question mostly directed

3144
03:18:20,180 --> 03:18:26,740
towards gib although the others are free to answer if they wish what is your opinion on the minecraft

3145
03:18:26,740 --> 03:18:33,780
of modding scene i know that on the pcp microsoft server you guys do like pixel mom or whatever but

3146
03:18:33,780 --> 03:18:39,460
i don't know a bunch of mods actually a lot of variance with other mods is if any so feel free

3147
03:18:40,420 --> 03:18:48,420
thank you well um good well in what do you think i'm not much of a like when i when i play minecraft

3148
03:18:48,420 --> 03:18:55,140
i like vanilla i occasionally i i add like a shader like i have been recently um for like

3149
03:18:55,140 --> 03:19:00,900
realistic shadows and and water effects because it just it's just really funny to see like minecraft

3150
03:19:00,900 --> 03:19:08,580
blocks rendered in realistic you know ish uh conditions like it's fucking real you can really

3151
03:19:08,580 --> 03:19:14,820
place the blocks um i've not really been much with mods ever mostly because i feel like i never

3152
03:19:14,820 --> 03:19:19,700
conquered vanilla minecraft i never beat the end the dragon on a single player playthrough

3153
03:19:20,340 --> 03:19:31,860
i never got that far play playing um playing uh minecraft on the pcp server i have i i kind of

3154
03:19:31,860 --> 03:19:36,820
initially didn't want to fuck with any of the mod stuff because i just thought it was like some weird

3155
03:19:36,820 --> 03:19:42,820
shit but i have i have sort of had to grapple with some of it and i have i have come to like um

3156
03:19:44,180 --> 03:19:48,260
what i have done i haven't really delved that deep into it but like there's um the magic stuff on

3157
03:19:48,260 --> 03:19:53,860
the pcp microsoft the magic stuff and the mana stuff it actually is pretty cool and i like what

3158
03:19:53,860 --> 03:20:03,460
i've seen of it um it's nice to i mean some of it is like like the fact that you can make these like

3159
03:20:03,540 --> 03:20:10,180
weird exotic metals and then craft the the tera shatterer out of them like it's hard to do but

3160
03:20:10,180 --> 03:20:15,460
it's a really useful item to have once you have it and i really appreciate it being there it just

3161
03:20:15,460 --> 03:20:21,380
makes mining so much so much less of a grind i don't know stuff like that is is pretty cool like

3162
03:20:21,380 --> 03:20:27,300
it's like an extra challenge in the game that gives you a a reward that like you know actually

3163
03:20:27,300 --> 03:20:34,260
affects your play experience positively it's pretty pretty cool pretty nice i like uh the pokemon mod

3164
03:20:34,260 --> 03:20:42,740
that you guys have going i i like it too although i will say it is very it's pretty rough it's pretty

3165
03:20:42,740 --> 03:20:50,820
rough in a lot of ways but it does like pretty well simulate like battling and catching pokemon

3166
03:20:51,300 --> 03:20:57,860
in minecraft so like it does exactly what it's supposed to do it's the pokemon mmo that nintendo

3167
03:20:57,860 --> 03:21:04,340
never released it it basically yes yeah it basically is which is i mean pretty red microsoft

3168
03:21:04,340 --> 03:21:09,620
server is the best place to fix i was gonna say i was gonna say i can cut this if you want me to

3169
03:21:09,620 --> 03:21:14,900
but i was gonna say that i really think we should i really think we should just cancel the pcp

3170
03:21:14,980 --> 03:21:25,300
minecraft separate server and just make membership like a a like pcp regular uh a pcp just regular

3171
03:21:26,420 --> 03:21:33,220
patreon reward at like the five dollar tier or something uh i kind of because like yeah there's

3172
03:21:33,220 --> 03:21:38,260
be against it i i really the more i think about it the more convinced i am that that's what we

3173
03:21:38,260 --> 03:21:43,620
should do because like makes uh makes sense there's definitely more people who would

3174
03:21:45,540 --> 03:21:53,620
the cross section of people who one listen to the pcp and two specifically want membership in

3175
03:21:53,620 --> 03:22:00,420
a minecraft server is like us is like small i feel like this there's more people who might be like

3176
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:06,900
yeah i'd like to get the bonus episodes and oh i would also get the minecraft server that's cool

3177
03:22:06,900 --> 03:22:10,980
too as well as people i want to be in the minecraft server oh and i also get the bonus episodes

3178
03:22:10,980 --> 03:22:17,220
that's cool too um i feel like we wouldn't lose very much by it and it's probably just makes more

3179
03:22:17,220 --> 03:22:24,180
sense than having a separate patreon so i think i might just do that soon yeah okay uh so that's

3180
03:22:24,180 --> 03:22:29,700
just one more reason to become a patron a patreon.com slash the tpcrastinators the procrastinators

3181
03:22:29,700 --> 03:22:36,580
whatever whatever fucking url is tpcrastinators is the twitter yes just uh it just further sweet

3182
03:22:36,580 --> 03:22:42,340
ends the deal i'm going to be i'm going to be making that a pzp patron reward instead of a separate

3183
03:22:42,340 --> 03:22:51,540
patreon reward uh probably this week sometime it's it's a good idea i i i agree i don't think anyone

3184
03:22:51,540 --> 03:23:00,020
would mind cool yeah nobody would mine crap oh oh but they will though oh but oh but they will

3185
03:23:00,100 --> 03:23:13,700
um based okay next voicemail is called um uh based joker four three two one go when i tell people

3262
03:32:38,980 --> 03:32:45,780

3269
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:56,340
pricking sin is a himbo i don't know why really i i imagine him i imagine him has like a

3270
03:33:57,140 --> 03:34:04,340
as like a toll booth worker i imagine him as like a fat you know kind of just like slob he

3271
03:34:04,340 --> 03:34:11,300
probably he might sort of like a mr. plinkett type who kind of like maybe has like a a rascal scooter

3272
03:34:11,300 --> 03:34:16,900
to get around sits in a toll booth definitely a toll booth worker uh that's my take

3273
03:34:17,300 --> 03:34:27,060
uh next uh voicemail is called um receipts are important in any transaction verbal or

3274
03:34:27,060 --> 03:34:29,700
otherwise three two one go

3275
03:34:29,780 --> 03:34:30,500

3277
03:34:48,500 --> 03:35:03,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't get him.

3278
03:35:03,340 --> 03:35:07,060
The deal, the compact is broken.

3279
03:35:07,060 --> 03:35:08,580
The deal is off.

3280
03:35:08,580 --> 03:35:17,580
Alright, next voicemail is Friendly Reminder. 3, 2, 1, go.

3281
03:35:21,580 --> 03:35:23,580
Hmm.

3282
03:35:23,580 --> 03:35:31,580
I've been masquerading the castle in strife.

3283
03:35:31,580 --> 03:35:32,580
What?

3284
03:35:32,580 --> 03:35:36,580
You can't stop me.

3285
03:35:37,580 --> 03:35:38,580
I can't.

3286
03:35:38,580 --> 03:35:39,580
You can't stop him.

3287
03:35:39,580 --> 03:35:40,580
I can't stop him.

3288
03:35:40,580 --> 03:35:41,580
You can't stop him, Ben.

3289
03:35:41,580 --> 03:35:43,580
You can't stop the...

3290
03:35:43,580 --> 03:35:44,580
He's unstoppable.

3291
03:35:44,580 --> 03:35:45,580
He's got momentum.

3292
03:35:45,580 --> 03:35:46,580
He's got momentum now.

3293
03:35:46,580 --> 03:35:47,580
He can't be stopped.

3294
03:35:47,580 --> 03:35:55,580
He can only be diverted in his course, but he's definitely getting where he's going, one way or another.

3295
03:35:55,580 --> 03:35:59,580
Next voicemail, we're almost done.

3296
03:35:59,580 --> 03:36:02,580
Christ Almighty, we're almost done.

3297
03:36:02,580 --> 03:36:05,580
The next voicemail is called Cake.

3298
03:36:05,580 --> 03:36:06,580
No.

3299
03:36:06,580 --> 03:36:08,580
No, the next one is called...

3300
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:09,580
No, I already played that one.

3301
03:36:09,580 --> 03:36:10,580
Never mind.

3302
03:36:10,580 --> 03:36:12,580
No, yes, the next one is called Cake.

3303
03:36:12,580 --> 03:36:13,580
Wait.

3304
03:36:13,580 --> 03:36:14,580
Come on, Discord.

3305
03:36:14,580 --> 03:36:15,580
Don't fuck with...

3306
03:36:15,580 --> 03:36:18,580
Don't fuck me on this one.

3307
03:36:18,580 --> 03:36:20,580
There it is.

3308
03:36:20,580 --> 03:36:21,580
Okay, Cake.

3309
03:36:21,580 --> 03:36:24,580
3, 2, 1, go.

3310
03:36:24,580 --> 03:36:29,580
This is everyone's favorite Natehead turned Saint Head Cake coming in with a request for Ben Saint.

3311
03:36:29,580 --> 03:36:34,580
Because you see, Ben, I actually purchased the Vapors 1 a few years later, purchased the Vapors 2.

3312
03:36:34,580 --> 03:36:40,580
And when I did this, I made a really grave, grave mistake in the sense that my Vapors 2 is signed by Ben Saint.

3313
03:36:40,580 --> 03:36:42,580
But my Vapors 1 isn't signed.

3314
03:36:42,580 --> 03:36:47,580
So now, every single time I look at my shelf, there's deep, immense, crippling pain.

3315
03:36:47,580 --> 03:36:53,580
A pain so strong, I cannot even begin to describe how painful this pain is in my right ankle.

3316
03:36:53,580 --> 03:36:58,580
It's preventing me from standing up and moving forward with my life unless I get this resolved.

3317
03:36:58,580 --> 03:37:02,580
So, Giga Head Galaxy Chat idea.

3318
03:37:02,580 --> 03:37:04,580
I send you my Vapors 1 copy.

3319
03:37:04,580 --> 03:37:06,580
Of course, I pay for shipping and everything.

3320
03:37:06,580 --> 03:37:10,580
And then you sign it and then send it back to me.

3321
03:37:10,580 --> 03:37:12,580
And then I'd be able to walk again.

3322
03:37:12,580 --> 03:37:16,580
And I'd also own the most Giga Chat item ever created in the history of the world.

3323
03:37:16,580 --> 03:37:20,580
If Vapors 1 copy is signed by both Ben and Munchy.

3324
03:37:20,580 --> 03:37:23,580
And you'd be an actual Saint since you had a performant miracle.

3325
03:37:23,580 --> 03:37:25,580
I think it's a pretty win-win scenario.

3326
03:37:25,580 --> 03:37:29,580
Also, Gib, any chance the old crew might be setting sail again?

3327
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:33,580
I'd love to hear the tales of Wano from my favorite two boys.

3328
03:37:33,580 --> 03:37:37,580
Also, my house is actually on fire right now.

3329
03:37:37,580 --> 03:37:42,580
And because I can't hear of the tales of Wano, my left ankle is in immense pain.

3330
03:37:42,580 --> 03:37:44,580
So I can't stand up from that either.

3331
03:37:44,580 --> 03:37:46,580
Now, I'm just stuck in a burning building.

3332
03:37:46,580 --> 03:37:48,580
And I'd really like to kind of walk out of this building.

3333
03:37:48,580 --> 03:37:50,580
Like, this building is really on fire.

3334
03:37:50,580 --> 03:37:52,580
It's really hot in here, guys.

3335
03:37:52,580 --> 03:37:57,580
Reach over, grab your copies of the Vapors and throw them out the window.

3336
03:37:57,580 --> 03:38:00,580
And local authorities will arrive to pick...

3337
03:38:00,580 --> 03:38:04,580
A local telekin will scoop them up and send them to Ben's Saint.

3338
03:38:04,580 --> 03:38:07,580
Well, you gotta make sure to save those copies.

3339
03:38:07,580 --> 03:38:11,580
Do you want to answer about the Poty cast first?

3340
03:38:11,580 --> 03:38:15,580
Yeah, I keep forgetting to talk to Nate about it.

3341
03:38:15,580 --> 03:38:19,580
There's nothing holding it up except I'm not doing it lol.

3342
03:38:19,580 --> 03:38:22,580
I mean, it's both of you, right?

3343
03:38:22,580 --> 03:38:25,580
Well, yeah, he hasn't talked to me, I haven't talked to him,

3344
03:38:25,580 --> 03:38:29,580
but I feel like if I say, hey, Nate, let's do the Poty cast, he'll just say, yeah, okay.

3345
03:38:29,580 --> 03:38:32,580
So it's not really an issue.

3346
03:38:32,580 --> 03:38:35,580
Also, has cake left a voicemail before?

3347
03:38:35,580 --> 03:38:38,580
I can't remember if they have.

3348
03:38:38,580 --> 03:38:40,580
Possibly? I don't know, why?

3349
03:38:40,580 --> 03:38:46,580
Because I think that might be the cake that came to RFC KCON London

3350
03:38:46,580 --> 03:38:49,580
that I remember meeting them.

3351
03:38:49,580 --> 03:38:55,580
And they introduced themselves as a Nate head and everyone was like, oh my god, how embarrassing.

3352
03:38:55,580 --> 03:38:57,580
That's cringe.

3353
03:38:57,580 --> 03:38:59,580
But he was cool.

3354
03:38:59,580 --> 03:39:04,580
Cake, if you want, maybe you can DM me on Twitter or on Discord or whatever.

3355
03:39:04,580 --> 03:39:09,580
If you want to, I will do it.

3356
03:39:09,580 --> 03:39:15,580
If you want to pay for shipping, you can send me that copy of Vapors 1

3357
03:39:15,580 --> 03:39:23,580
as well as the difference between, oh god, I think a signed copy was $50?

3358
03:39:23,580 --> 03:39:27,580
So I guess, I'll look it up, I'll double check,

3359
03:39:27,580 --> 03:39:30,580
but I think it'd be whatever the difference between a signed and unsigned copy,

3360
03:39:30,580 --> 03:39:33,580
which would be something like 35 bucks or something.

3361
03:39:33,580 --> 03:39:39,580
Pay for shipping and pay that, send me that, I will sign your copy and send it back to you.

3362
03:39:39,580 --> 03:39:44,580
I have no qualms about it, sounds good, bro.

3363
03:39:44,580 --> 03:39:47,580
Was there something else that he asked about?

3364
03:39:47,580 --> 03:39:52,580
Oh, no, no, but there was, there's one thing, I don't know if I've mentioned this before,

3365
03:39:52,580 --> 03:39:58,580
but okay, about the Vapors 2, I went to the post office a while ago

3366
03:39:58,580 --> 03:40:03,580
and I found two copies that had been returned to sender

3367
03:40:03,580 --> 03:40:08,580
and these were both people whose copies had previously been returned to sender.

3368
03:40:08,580 --> 03:40:12,580
So this, for both of them, this was the second time I was getting them back in the mail.

3369
03:40:12,580 --> 03:40:16,580
Both of them, I contacted them and be like, did you change address?

3370
03:40:16,580 --> 03:40:18,580
And they were like, yes, here's my new address.

3371
03:40:18,580 --> 03:40:20,580
And I resent them with the new address.

3372
03:40:20,580 --> 03:40:24,580
So these people have chronic address impermanence issues.

3373
03:40:24,580 --> 03:40:27,580
But so now, I now have two copies sitting in my room.

3374
03:40:27,580 --> 03:40:32,580
I have contacted both of these people on, through Kickstarter

3375
03:40:32,580 --> 03:40:36,580
and asking them like, hey, it seems like it got, it returned again.

3376
03:40:36,580 --> 03:40:39,580
What's the deal? Where should I send it again?

3377
03:40:39,580 --> 03:40:41,580
But neither of them had gotten back to me.

3378
03:40:41,580 --> 03:40:43,580
So I don't know how else to contact these people,

3379
03:40:43,580 --> 03:40:45,580
but if you are listening and you never got,

3380
03:40:45,580 --> 03:40:48,580
you are one of these two people who never got their Vapors 2,

3381
03:40:48,580 --> 03:40:51,580
check your Kickstarter messages because I'm asking like,

3382
03:40:51,580 --> 03:40:54,580
just tell me where to send it, I will resend it.

3383
03:40:54,580 --> 03:40:56,580
No problem.

3384
03:40:56,580 --> 03:41:00,580
Do they happen to live in an RV by chance?

3385
03:41:00,580 --> 03:41:02,580
I don't think so.

3386
03:41:02,580 --> 03:41:05,580
They both had street addresses, technically.

3387
03:41:05,580 --> 03:41:08,580
Because you know RVs can move.

3388
03:41:08,580 --> 03:41:11,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, these are, maybe,

3389
03:41:11,580 --> 03:41:13,580
maybe these, they're just constantly on the move,

3390
03:41:13,580 --> 03:41:15,580
just living the nomad life. I don't know.

3391
03:41:15,580 --> 03:41:17,580
I don't know.

3392
03:41:17,580 --> 03:41:21,580
Okay, next one is the last voicemail.

3393
03:41:21,580 --> 03:41:26,580
It is called, Bleach Fan 17.

3394
03:41:26,580 --> 03:41:29,580
Three, two, one, go.

3395
03:41:38,580 --> 03:41:53,580
Okay, okay, okay.

3396
03:41:53,580 --> 03:41:57,580
Endlessly adorned, knowing it will be cut off.

3397
03:41:57,580 --> 03:42:01,580
Endlessly polished, knowing they will be cut off.

3398
03:42:01,580 --> 03:42:04,580
They are terrifying, terrifying in their fall,

3399
03:42:05,580 --> 03:42:10,580
The hair flutters to the ground, a lifeless husk.

3400
03:42:10,580 --> 03:42:14,580
Hair and fingernails are beautiful ornaments.

3401
03:42:14,580 --> 03:42:18,580
So why do they seem so baleful when removed?

3402
03:42:18,580 --> 03:42:20,580
The answer is simple.

3403
03:42:20,580 --> 03:42:25,580
They are previews of what is to come, of death.

3404
03:42:25,580 --> 03:42:27,580
Jesus.

3405
03:42:27,580 --> 03:42:31,580
Bleach Volume 29, The Slashing Opera.

3406
03:42:31,580 --> 03:42:42,580
Well, at least it wasn't about foreskins.

3407
03:42:42,580 --> 03:42:47,580
He's right. God damn it, Bleach was right, all along.

3408
03:42:47,580 --> 03:42:50,580
Does that happen in Bleach?

3409
03:42:50,580 --> 03:42:54,580
Or is he just saying something and attributing it to Bleach?

3410
03:42:54,580 --> 03:42:56,580
I mean, there's a lot of Bleach.

3411
03:42:56,580 --> 03:42:58,580
I could, I could believe there's all kinds of

3412
03:42:58,580 --> 03:43:01,580
weird poetical shit in there somewhere.

3413
03:43:01,580 --> 03:43:03,580
I believe it.

3414
03:43:03,580 --> 03:43:08,580
I didn't watch Far Enough Into Bleach to know if this is something that happens later.

3415
03:43:08,580 --> 03:43:13,580
You both are saying, happens.

3416
03:43:13,580 --> 03:43:15,580
Nothing, nothing happens.

3417
03:43:15,580 --> 03:43:18,580
It's just like a thing that someone said.

3418
03:43:18,580 --> 03:43:20,580
I watched like one episode of Bleach ever.

3419
03:43:20,580 --> 03:43:22,580
So I don't know.

3420
03:43:22,580 --> 03:43:25,580
Someone probably says this in Bleach.

3421
03:43:25,580 --> 03:43:27,580
I'm sure of it.

3422
03:43:27,580 --> 03:43:29,580
Karen, I know everything about Bleach.

3423
03:43:29,580 --> 03:43:30,580
I watched a whole episode.

3424
03:43:30,580 --> 03:43:34,580
This is exactly what it's like.

3425
03:43:34,580 --> 03:43:35,580
I don't know.

3426
03:43:35,580 --> 03:43:36,580
It's pretty good though.

3427
03:43:36,580 --> 03:43:38,580
Makes you think.

3428
03:43:38,580 --> 03:43:40,580
Really makes you think.

3429
03:43:40,580 --> 03:43:44,580
Really makes you, I mean, no, that's, that's the, when you,

3430
03:43:44,580 --> 03:43:48,580
that's when you hear a brown note is what really makes you stink.

3431
03:43:48,580 --> 03:43:49,580
Yeah, exactly.

3432
03:43:49,580 --> 03:43:53,580
Bringing it all the way back to the beginning, baby.

3433
03:43:53,580 --> 03:43:55,580
Nice meme.

3434
03:43:55,580 --> 03:43:56,580
We, we did it.

3435
03:43:56,580 --> 03:43:58,580
We listened to all the voicemails.

3436
03:43:58,580 --> 03:43:59,580
Oh my God.

3437
03:43:59,580 --> 03:44:00,580
It's almost four hours.

3438
03:44:00,580 --> 03:44:03,580
Oh, oh my God.

3439
03:44:03,580 --> 03:44:05,580
That doesn't make any sense.

3440
03:44:05,580 --> 03:44:06,580
Sorry.

3441
03:44:06,580 --> 03:44:08,580
A minute ago I looked and it was only three hours.

3442
03:44:08,580 --> 03:44:09,580
Sorry.

3443
03:44:09,580 --> 03:44:10,580
Sorry, Elias.

3444
03:44:10,580 --> 03:44:11,580
Sorry, Elias.

3445
03:44:11,580 --> 03:44:13,580
Are we really fucked you?

3446
03:44:13,580 --> 03:44:14,580
But it was funny.

3447
03:44:14,580 --> 03:44:15,580
Sorry.

3448
03:44:15,580 --> 03:44:16,580
Not sorry.

3449
03:44:16,580 --> 03:44:19,580
Sorry to him, but also sorry to the fans, the audience.

3450
03:44:19,580 --> 03:44:24,580
Definitely, definitely sorry to the listeners to subject you to all this.

3451
03:44:24,580 --> 03:44:25,580
No, they like it.

3452
03:44:25,580 --> 03:44:28,580
They like large amounts of audio.

3453
03:44:28,580 --> 03:44:29,580
I hope so.

3454
03:44:29,580 --> 03:44:34,580
I mean, I would, if, I mean, I can't think of a podcast that I like,

3455
03:44:34,580 --> 03:44:36,580
that I wouldn't like more of.

3456
03:44:36,580 --> 03:44:37,580
I had a scene.

3457
03:44:37,580 --> 03:44:38,580
Yeah.

3458
03:44:38,580 --> 03:44:41,580
I have seen a couple people say like episodes are too long.

3459
03:44:41,580 --> 03:44:46,580
And if you think, if maybe if you like don't like the voicemails,

3460
03:44:46,580 --> 03:44:50,580
I could be, I could see being like, yeah, it's too long because there's too much voicemail

3461
03:44:50,580 --> 03:44:51,580
or something.

3462
03:44:51,580 --> 03:44:56,580
But like in the absence of like something about it that you don't like hearing,

3463
03:44:56,580 --> 03:45:01,580
I can't imagine being like, I wish this were the same, but less of it.

3464
03:45:01,580 --> 03:45:02,580
You know?

3465
03:45:02,580 --> 03:45:08,580
So I don't, I feel like that, that complaint needs qualification or I don't understand it.

3466
03:45:08,580 --> 03:45:18,580
Anyway, patreon.com slash the procrastinators for bonus episodes of which there are what,

3467
03:45:18,580 --> 03:45:20,580
like 50 or more?

3468
03:45:20,580 --> 03:45:22,580
More than 50.

3469
03:45:22,580 --> 03:45:29,580
And, and also Minecraft server access because I am, we are merging, we are merging that into

3470
03:45:29,580 --> 03:45:35,580
one place, as I think we probably should have done a long time ago, but oh well.

3471
03:45:35,580 --> 03:45:45,580
And that's speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail if you want to send a voicemail, but hey,

3472
03:45:45,580 --> 03:45:50,580
we don't have to because we don't have to have like 50 voicemails in episode.

3473
03:45:50,580 --> 03:45:52,580
It's not a requirement.

3474
03:45:52,580 --> 03:45:53,580
Yeah.

3475
03:45:53,580 --> 03:45:56,580
If you really want to, you can send a voicemail.

3476
03:45:56,580 --> 03:45:57,580
I'm sorry.

3477
03:45:57,580 --> 03:46:00,580
Oh, no, no, I mean to them.

3478
03:46:00,580 --> 03:46:01,580
Oh my God.

3479
03:46:01,580 --> 03:46:06,580
I mean to them, like stop, stop speaking into the voicemail so that we don't have to listen

3480
03:46:06,580 --> 03:46:07,580
to them.

3481
03:46:07,580 --> 03:46:08,580
That's what I meant.

3482
03:46:08,580 --> 03:46:09,580
Oh, then I agree.

3483
03:46:09,580 --> 03:46:10,580
Oh, then I agree.

3484
03:46:10,580 --> 03:46:11,580
Then I agree.

3485
03:46:11,580 --> 03:46:12,580
I agree 100%.

3486
03:46:12,580 --> 03:46:13,580
Fuck these guys.

3487
03:46:13,580 --> 03:46:16,580
Fuck these mutants, these monsters, these fools.

3488
03:46:16,580 --> 03:46:18,580
Okay, I think we're done.

3489
03:46:18,580 --> 03:46:21,580
I think we got to, we got to wrap up.

3490
03:46:21,580 --> 03:46:24,580
Anything else before we leave?

3491
03:46:24,580 --> 03:46:30,580

What's what's the last video you put out?

3495
03:46:37,580 --> 03:46:41,580
The last one was from two weeks ago, I think.

3496
03:46:41,580 --> 03:46:43,580
What was that one?

3497
03:46:43,580 --> 03:46:49,580
Just a short like tips video hints and tips.

Well, glad to know.

Sorry for everything.

Bye.
