1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We should standardize an intro for this.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's what all real podcast entertainment shows do.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, we're a little aligned on branding.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I feel like that would be nice. I feel like if we just set our brand better,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
then more people will be able to get into it.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And we want many people to get into it because it's the most insane asinine,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
like not a real show show.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And so we need that initial branding marketing to get them into a show

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that is not about marketing or having any sort of defined motivation.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I feel like the fact that The Routing Markers' Calculator is this obscure niche of a niche.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's like the biggest part of the appeal.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I know. Yeah, you're right. But I feel like...

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like no matter what.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That it's totally unbrandable.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, it's so obscure, but it's also so specific.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I kind of like the idea of making it a show that carries itself.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's like a big deal in spite of being the least known thing.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I love the fact that the B.C.P. or The Routing Markers' Calculator

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
is a completely unknown, it should be.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No one watches it.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It has the most dedicated fan base of any B.C.P. show.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And no matter what release or the content of the video,

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
people will rejoice that there's new R.F.C.P. films.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And then you'll have comments on normal B.C.P. episodes saying

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ben and Munchie just keep doing R.F.C.P. films.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're better on that. Just keep doing that.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, we don't spoil them. We don't spoil them with the RFCK content.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I would like to hear the two things that I want to increase its brand.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And this is the only two.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to have a standardized intro that will take

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
literally less than two seconds.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And I want to release it monthly.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We should definitely release it monthly at the very least.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are we on right now?

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is this going to be on the show?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This discussion?

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let me just make sure.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's fine. I'm just wondering.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, okay. Our intro.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How about...

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, this is genius. Check this out, right?

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's like we each say one word, but we take turns.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So it's like, rowdy.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Fuckers.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Cop.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Killers.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Fuck.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's pretty good.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean, it's a start.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right, all right.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And then we should both at the same time play.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then whatever.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And the thing about the word play is that it's not a

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
like a let's play specific thing.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So we can have R.F.C.P.ers play me channel,

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
or we can have R.F.C.P.ers play being in the park.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Like in real life.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or maybe it could be something more like do or like...

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do New York.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Or like on.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
R.F.C.P.ers on Broadway.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
R.F.C.P.ers on musical.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Imagine R.F.C.P.ers cop killers on musical.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
R.F.C.P.ers in the Sports Resort.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
In, in, we sports, I like that.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I like that.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're in it.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Actually, now I'm thinking do you like R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers,

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
or do you like R.F.C.P.ers?

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Cop, killers.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, okay.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In Canon.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are the cop killer and I am the R.F.C.P.er.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's, I've always forget.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You are the, after the rowdy fuckers, cop, killers,

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
they should be like a sound sting,

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
like a sound effect of like gunshots, like...

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's pretty good.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's pretty good.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I'm like,

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
fuckers, cop, killers.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Maybe like some police sirens.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And I love, I love those guys.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That we never played particularly violent gangs.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We always played baby shit.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Like we're the toughest, like the toughest fucking gangs.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Like if you just came over to selling drugs

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and killing crooked cops.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's all we have to fucking do.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I love that.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, okay.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So we're gonna go with in.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, I think we do R.F.C.P.ers, cop, killers.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go back and forth like that.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then should we do in, and then title?

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In, we sports, resort.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, that's good.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I like that.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I like that.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
When people hear that intro and get strapped in,

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
only to find that the podcast is primarily like we sports

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and my little pony drop.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's like long sections of us saying um and then and.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then also like punctuated by moments of us getting really mad

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
about how the video game is too hard for us to play.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The we sports episode was particularly like incredible.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You know, there was a competition, but all,

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
but we were both so geared up and ready to like just like try our

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
all that none of us talk.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And the only time that we did talk, we were just doing ass

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
like insults.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
God, the most you told us is don't worry.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But you can't do it.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But now we're here.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We have the webcam.

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We're ready.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh yeah.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is ready for this cop killers live.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Take two.

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Take two.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're right.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're fucking wrong.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Um, should we pick it up by the way?

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The microphone.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Wait, say something.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, it's me.

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah.

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm in this episode too.

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah.

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
In the same room.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're on the switch one.

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Was I?

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Cool.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think you were in the three share or something.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We're doing strategy.

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We were coming from the intro here.

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're on.

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're on.

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ready.

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Fuckers.

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Cop.

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Killers.

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
In.

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sports.

166
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Resort.

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Baby.

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Fuckers.

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Fuck.

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Cops.

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm fucking wrong.

173
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I want Digi to make some sort of rap.

174
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I also want him to be rapping.

175
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I feel like write a rap for us to produce or something.

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's got to be like the most inner city jungle.

179
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, I know.

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know, me and my friends in high school actually wrote a rap.

181
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We wrote like a shitty gangster rap.

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's use that.

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was, my gangster persona was super hard red snapper.

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That was my, yeah.

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's bad, but here it is.

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Give it up for super hard red snapper.

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Get up in his grill and he's going to bust a capo yo ass.

189
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sprayin' out a buck shot and punchin' and kickin' and keepin' those fat beats red hot.

190
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Like the bitch is my homie slapas guy.

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No pants.

192
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ho slapas got the right stuff.

193
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Always with a bunch of hoes showin' them.

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He makes a bunch of hoes and wears one out and finds two more.

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
See, he pretty fly, but then my man Chewie is one ho stickin' ass kickin' thugger.

196
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And that's why we call him the monkey smuggler.

197
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Cause he go eat shit if he don't like it face.

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And piss a whipper chicken ass all over the place.

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, he's a god damn credit to the white race.

200
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ben, do you understand how the syllables of what you're saying

201
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
can easily, perfectly be changed to red for this cop though.

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Instead of red hot whippersnapper.

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Red hot red snapper.

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Super hot red snapper.

205
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And literally Chewy, Munchy.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is literally the easiest song in the entire world to change.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Should I just cannibalize my old high school bullshit?

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes, literally.

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, I used to have a beat.

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
My friend Ryan wrote a beat for it.

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And there was like a chorus.

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It was like, suck it out this thugger's way.

214
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You think you got something to say, and I'll break your knees.

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's just another thugger day.

216
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And all the guys say, is just bitch please.

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
A bitch please.

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This is a marketing supernova.

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is the nexus of marketing.

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is the black hole where all brands go to die.

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I want the show to be more interesting.

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah.

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But now, I think you'll get it soon.

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is your mom who gave you credit.

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No, no, we have to get to it.

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's play for me channel.

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's play for me channel.

228
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll be stomping on your chest.

229
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Feels like good.

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm going to be stomping on the cop cars hood.

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Much like how I wear the KKK hood.

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the exact same tone and demeanor.

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I was just going through the second verse with the rap.

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And I was thinking, oh, this is actually really great.

235
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I actually like this verse better.

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But then towards the end, it really dates itself really hard

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
with references to Osama bin Laden and Anna Nicole Smith.

238
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That is perfect.

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's pretty funny.

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
All right.

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Here's what we should do afterwards.

242
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Or even, you know, fucking on it.

243
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All right.

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's write this down.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We will never play the game.

246
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We will never start playing.

247
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is all pre-show since we haven't done our intro yet.

248
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So hold on.

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Rowdy Fuckers USA is a mythical metropolis where Osama bin Laden

250
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and Anna Nicole Smith are still on the hook.

251
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let me show you how to start.

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So we should definitely work on this though.

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I want you to type out this rap.

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can easily be changed to a rapper exactly a brand.

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Easily.

256
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We would need a beat.

257
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because like it had a beat.

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But I don't have the beat anymore.

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We can just get someone to produce it.

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OK.

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We could literally just release the beat.

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I totally do not mind candle-lizing.

263
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We literally just released the beat that someone made for Slinger Dead.

264
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The only thing...

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Wait.

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They're very similar aesthetic shows.

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
OK.

268
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, that's fine.

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We have my rap and your show's beat.

270
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We can combine them.

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

272
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Perfect.

273
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That makes sense.

274
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
All right.

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Perfect.

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll remember that.

277
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll type it out.

278
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ask me sometime and I'll type it.

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It won't take me very long.

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
OK.

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And then we'll type it out.

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll choose the lyrics to be...

284
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Reversed.

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
...a popular theme.

286
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Which I don't think will be hard.

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like just like do the first line again

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but replace the name with reverse calculators.

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Well.

291
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
OK.

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Because I wrote one verse.

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, I wrote one verse.

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
My friends wrote the other.

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I forget which one I wrote.

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Whatever.

297
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It doesn't matter.

298
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's like I'm curious.

299
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah.

300
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

301
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's parody.

302
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
OK.

303
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Try to...

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Try to...

305
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Reversed.

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Reversed.

307
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Being...

308
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Instead of your rap.

309
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What?

310
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What is the first verse of the rap?

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I forget how it starts.

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's like...

313
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Shit.

314
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't remember how the rap that I just sang started.

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yep.

316
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's nothing...

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is fucking record because you...

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He's literally gone out of your mind

319
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
through one mouth to the ether.

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Uh...

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sss...

322
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is the right verse type of rap that you want.

323
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's Vincent and then looking up in the sky.

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Because he does that literally every episode.

325
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Red snapper.

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Red snapper.

327
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Here's the intro.

328
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Super hard red snapper.

329
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What the fuck is wrong?

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Wait, the super hard red snapper.

331
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Chewie the monkey smuggler.

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And the other one.

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
My friend Dave.

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That was less involved.

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't remember how it fucking started.

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That was like a flash in the pan.

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's gone.

338
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We're gonna start our let's play of the Wii channel.

339
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We're not doing Wii Sports Resort?

340
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Well we gotta make some Mii's first.

341
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Alright.

343
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Enjoy the intro.

344
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wait.

345
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hold on.

346
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's coming.

347
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Rowdy.

348
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Fuckers.

349
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Cop.

350
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Killers.

351
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In.

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mii Channel!

353
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The video has officially started.

354
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Here we are.

355
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We're ready to do this fucking bullshit.

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We are ready to start Clay the Mii Channel as hard as we can.

357
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We're going as hard as a motherfucker.

358
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We're gonna do this to the best of our ability.

359
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's really what we've got so far.

360
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hey, is that you?

361
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, me.

362
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Hey, that's me.

363
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We don't actually have to make Mii's because we got them.

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Where's my...

365
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, it's Ben's.

366
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ben's.

367
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's made by God.

368
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, you know.

369
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Here, here, here.

370
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to update my...

371
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wait.

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think I have to use yours.

373
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What the fuck?

374
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I know.

375
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is really fucking with the theme that we just established.

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh, shit.

377
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, that I'm Player One.

378
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

379
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You come to me, Munchie, you come to me insisting that I be Player One.

380
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How could you ask for shoulder responsibility?

381
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I rash the controller out of your hand and I thrust upon you a new Wiimote.

382
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I said, my God.

383
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You can tell the Wii was created at a less advanced age,

384
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
as there are only two genders to choose from.

385
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah.

386
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Is this Mii?

387
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Is this one?

388
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh my God.

389
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Which one's Mii?

390
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He's all jaundiced.

391
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't know.

392
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait, you're just like me.

393
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're bottom left.

394
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah.

395
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay.

396
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, you're somewhere between...

397
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There I go.

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're somewhere between two, three, and four.

399
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're a monster.

400
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm the monster no one deserves, and yet everyone shall obtain.

401
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, look, Mii.

402
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Jumping Jack Jones.

403
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's the worst guy ever.

404
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Jumping Jack Jones.

405
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, I never told the Wii U Torturer character description.

406
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What is the Wii U Torturer?

407
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The Wii U Torturer is a character that I came up with for a...

408
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Nate, you're looking hairy.

409
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm busy.

410
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay.

411
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a character I came up with for a series of novels that have not started yet

412
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and could probably be called failing and never to exist.

413
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But God damn it, one day they will probably never.

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But still, we're working on it.

415
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean, I've made a novel idea.

416
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's quite a novel idea.

417
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Anyway, there's a character called the Wii U Torturer.

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
His real name is Arthur Wii Allen.

419
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And he...

420
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I forget the entirety of his story, but just first to show that he stomps,

421
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
like as hard as he can, Wii U's over and over again.

422
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It is a fetishistic urge that he smashes Wii U gamepads.

423
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Only Wii U's?

424
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes, only Wii U's.

425
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because he wanted to be Sony PlayStation 5 bomb for his first day.

426
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
First day?

427
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But his parent, who I believe is the evil CEO of Twitch in the story, Tom Twitch,

428
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
got him a Wii U instead, which was about 1,500 generation of video games behind.

429
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, God, I mean, I can understand why he's a little fucked up over it.

430
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I know.

431
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And that's why he's dedicated his life to torturing Wii U's.

432
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You need some fan of the Wii U Torturer, even though I already have a design firm,

433
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
so you know what you make will be good.

434
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What is my...

435
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What do I...

436
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is this...

437
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I kind of like that one on the bottom right.

438
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This one?

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I mean, it's a little small.

440
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Maybe you could go back one.

441
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Go back one.

442
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This one?

443
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No, no, it's back one page.

444
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I think that the middle one there, bottom middle...

445
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That one's okay.

446
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is me.

447
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah.

448
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I mean, right?

449
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, I mean, it's not far off.

450
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Just keep going a little bit.

451
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Maybe it'll be like a slightly, slightly fro-ier one.

452
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah, that's what we need.

453
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's no Jew fro.

454
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The Wii character creator is so fucking limited.

455
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Even on the Switch, it's so fucking bare-bones and shit.

456
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

457
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well...

458
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, fuck it.

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You win some...

460
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What are my eyebrows?

461
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well, they're kind of triangular.

462
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

463
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Go over a page.

464
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Look at me again.

465
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Kind of like knuckle jewelry.

466
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
They're kind of like...

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They're thickest in the middle.

468
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
They kind of get thicker in the middle.

469
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Go back one.

470
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know what I have.

471
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This one?

472
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That one's not bad.

473
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I was looking at that one.

474
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

475
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, what about this?

476
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
If I angle this a certain way.

477
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Try that one.

478
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You know, actually, top right.

479
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, you know what?

480
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah.

481
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

482
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

483
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, this is the real shit.

485
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
All right.

486
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
All right.

487
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When I was a little kid, I used to always, like, without question.

488
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Go for these eyes.

489
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Really?

490
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I mean, they've certainly got their charms.

491
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I have, like, thin eyes, right?

492
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
A little bit.

493
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay, here, guys.

494
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They're kind of all...

495
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What about these?

496
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I like the one to the right of that.

497
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah.

498
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, that's better.

499
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay.

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Whoa.

501
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This is a charm.

502
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
God.

503
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I have a big, fat one.

504
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So either this one or this one.

505
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Probably this one.

506
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think that one.

507
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

508
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Shit.

509
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's good, right?

510
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No, that's not that big.

511
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay.

512
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, I like that.

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I like that.

514
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay.

515
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, okay.

516
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You have a small mouth.

517
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's small.

518
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Do I have a noticeable lips?

519
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, yeah, they're noticeable, but they're not huge.

520
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, no.

521
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You have a...

522
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You have, like, a pretty pronounced, like, curve, you know?

523
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay, like this.

524
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No.

525
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's like that.

526
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Wait, to the right, to the right, on the bottom.

527
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Make it small.

528
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm pretty close.

529
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
One more down.

530
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There.

531
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah?

532
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Maybe move it down a little.

533
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Well, actually, no.

534
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No, it's good there.

535
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Okay.

536
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I think we're...

537
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Actually, you know what?

538
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Make your eyes a little smaller.

539
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay.

540
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Actually, there might be...

541
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes.

542
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay, we're getting somewhere.

543
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay.

544
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Go try the next page.

545
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
All right.

546
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I fucking love making knees, by the way.

547
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I know, this is great.

548
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I used to do this.

549
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Literally, what I would do every sleepover was we would want to play Super Smash,

550
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
which was probably me and my offline friends,

551
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but we'd just get so caught up in making knees

552
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and we'd just spend the entire night making knees

553
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and just telling stories about what we'd done

554
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
during the most absolutely incredible...

555
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Going over it?

556
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I mean...

557
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think these ones are pretty good.

558
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I like...

559
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay.

560
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't think there...

561
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There's none that I think is an obviously better fit,

562
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but I think that there are other ones that could work.

563
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I feel like this mouth does not fit me simply

564
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
because it does not communicate that I'm a little shit.

565
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I mean, I think it looks pretty...

566
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think this one actually...

567
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Actually, that one's pretty good, too.

568
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That I'm a little shit.

569
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think it's a little less...

570
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
...photo.

571
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's a little less anatomically accurate,

572
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
but it's more like...

573
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
...totally accurate.

574
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Spiritually, right?

575
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah.

576
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah, okay.

577
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's pretty good.

578
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
All right.

579
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I like fitly kind of glasses, right?

580
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah.

581
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I wish I could...

582
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I mean, I guess...

583
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I wish they had half-brands.

584
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

585
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Actually, wait, can...

586
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
No.

587
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Maybe use the bigger, the wider ones.

588
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think that looks a little closer

589
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
to the reality of the situation.

590
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This guy looks nice.

591
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
This guy actually looks like me.

592
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I look like me.

593
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I make like, based off the way I draw myself.

594
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

595
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Which, oh god, you know what I do that I fucking hate?

596
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Or is that I always...

597
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I do the webcomic artist curse

598
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
of making myself look better than I do in real life.

599
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

600
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I kind of do...

601
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I just made my guy look as generic as possible.

602
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So, I don't know.

603
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I mean, everyone does it.

604
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I know.

605
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's...

606
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't blame it.

607
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Like, it annoys me when I see other people do it,

608
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
but not too much,

609
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
because I totally understand why the compulsion is there.

610
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

611
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Because you don't want to like...

612
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Just like, like, no...

613
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And like, constantly portray yourself as being...

614
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah.

615
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You guys have a poop.

616
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

617
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Like, the last part of a poop doesn't want to come out.

618
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh my god.

619
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You feel it, like, inside your butt all day.

620
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's what the, like, shit stool is for.

621
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like, the thing that you put your feet up on?

622
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

623
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Dude, I have never used it.

624
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But I have heard.

625
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, okay, okay.

626
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It helps with that.

627
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There are so many points I want to make here.

628
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Like, if an entire podcast

629
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
is based off of this short exchange right here.

630
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
By the way, we are literally the green triangle

631
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
of intellect right now.

632
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What does that mean?

633
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We're a range of...

634
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't know, but I agree and support it.

635
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay.

636
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
First of all, I have heard the shit stool.

637
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Does that mean that all intellect dies?

638
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

639
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It goes and never comes back.

640
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I've never tried the shit stool,

641
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
but I've heard of it,

642
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and so now whenever I take a shit stool,

643
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I go like this,

644
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
as big as I can.

645
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I still have never tried the technique.

646
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There was a chair in my bathroom,

647
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
like next to my toilet.

648
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah, he did!

649
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I used it as the shit stool.

650
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh, my God.

651
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We are on the same wavelength.

652
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I haven't had to,

653
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
but maybe I should.

654
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Maybe I should just fight that bullet.

655
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Do it.

656
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We all got to make it up.

657
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And Roddy fuckers,

658
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
fuckers, fuckers!

659
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It is!

660
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's a shit stool.

661
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Sponsored by the shit stool.

662
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I had an irritable bowel syndrome.

663
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
They had to stick someone's hand up my ass.

664
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Really?

665
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah.

666
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, I know.

667
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Wait, did it go away?

668
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

669
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I didn't know it could go away.

670
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I think I had some sort of weird option of it,

671
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
where it was like I had the symptoms of it,

672
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
but I didn't actually have it.

673
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, God.

674
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Very sick.

675
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So the last shit,

676
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
the experience I have of trying to get the shit out,

677
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
like the last one that you've just tried,

678
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
was every part of the shit forever.

679
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, my God.

680
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So I spent...

681
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, my God.

682
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Jesus, bro.

683
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
All right.

684
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The real triangle of intellect, ladies and gentlemen.

685
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Hashtag that shit.

686
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Do you want to...

687
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is it here?

688
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How do we...

689
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah, this is kind of weird, but I'm into it.

690
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Okay.

691
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, looks good.

692
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And so I would be in the toilet for like two hours.

693
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, two hours.

694
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Camera, too.

695
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I didn't even notice that one.

696
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, dude.

697
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Uh, fuck you.

698
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's static.

699
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Mangle.

700
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Wait, yeah, okay.

701
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Let's turn the mic.

702
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So it goes this...

703
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Then again.

704
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, who cares?

705
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We can breathe down.

706
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So, there you go.

707
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah.

708
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Once you hear a little louder, dude.

709
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Jess, like you have short hair.

710
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Like, I would describe it as like some sort of friendly,

711
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
a hitchhiker that is too friendly.

712
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And so you don't trust them and you drive past them.

713
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Good.

714
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You look like...

715
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Like you work in a library.

716
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I like that.

717
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I love...

718
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Libraries are like the only...

719
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I love the fact that they're still a place where people are not allowed to make noise.

720
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Or like a newsroom.

721
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Or like a printing room.

722
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, you want to make me?

723
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh, hell yeah.

724
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Do you have any experience in making a book?

725
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You can make yourself a beard.

726
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Let's see here.

727
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I guess the beard obviously sucks.

728
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Should I make it me that looks like me?

729
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Or should I make a fucking freak of hell?

730
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Make one that looks like you and then we can do one.

731
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Hey, what's up with the...

732
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
The OBS is not showing the entire thing.

733
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What do you mean?

734
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, like, look how little of the video it's capturing.

735
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Um...

736
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, sure.

737
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Has it been doing it this whole time?

738
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, but I don't really care.

739
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It sucks.

740
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Man, it's fine.

741
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No, get the whole thing in there, man.

742
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I am. I'm doing that right now.

743
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Hey.

744
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah?

745
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll beat you up.

746
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Listen, man, that would be funny if it weren't physically impossible.

747
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah.

748
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Come back with some real-ass coming next time, kid.

749
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well...

750
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Listen, I bet you didn't even go to Los Angeles.

751
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I mean...

752
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
God, I don't want to dox my birthday.

753
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Uh...

754
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Wait, I can put a question mark.

755
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's not fucking paranoid I've become.

756
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't want to dox my birthday.

757
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, they can find me.

758
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Someone might give me a fucking present.

759
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't want that shit.

760
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Jesus.

761
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Someone might be nice.

762
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
All right.

763
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
All right.

764
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
All right.

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This is the real shit, right?

766
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's not cool.

767
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's professional.

768
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Dude, do you want to get underneath the mic?

769
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, yeah.

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What should I do to get out from underneath the mic?

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Uh, we...

772
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Since we're doing...

773
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Wait.

774
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I need it to get out from under the...

775
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Under its thumb.

776
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Hold on.

777
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You can put it backwards.

778
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
How is this...

779
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay, wait.

780
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
How is this any better?

781
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Move that around much here.

782
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And then move the thing around to its axis.

783
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
This is some fucking...

784
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Bermuda's Triangle of Intellect Geometry.

785
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Arrange the...

786
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You know, point the mic towards the center of the galaxy.

787
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Let it...

788
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Then Rhymoscopilus will become 10 times faster.

789
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I made me a favorite to help this other guy.

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Well, play your cards right.

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Maybe one day you'll earn that title.

792
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Well, it's not any better because it's still right in front of you.

793
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

794
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I think it's true.

795
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Favorite color.

796
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It used to be yellow.

797
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Don't dox favorite color, Cassie.

798
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm taking it back.

799
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't give a fuck.

800
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That actually looks quite bad.

801
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

802
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Unfortunate.

803
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'll do purple.

804
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Here we go.

805
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm always black.

806
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Well, make sure the audience are right.

807
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
How will you know?

808
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Say something.

809
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No.

810
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah, you say something.

811
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Hey, there.

812
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I think I just have a powerful diaphragm.

813
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I just have some sort of...

814
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Whoa.

815
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's working.

816
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Are you? Because I'm not seeing anything.

817
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Hello.

818
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Ooh.

819
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Hi, it's me, Munchie.

820
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's working like...

821
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I don't think it's getting in here.

822
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I mean, I'm sorry, audience, that I'm like...

823
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Hello.

824
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
No, no, no.

825
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Hello.

826
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Hello.

827
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
No, no, no, no, it's...

828
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think it's just the backside of the mic.

829
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Wait, this is the back of the mic?

830
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
No, I just rotated it, I think.

831
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And so I think...

832
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I have no fucking clue.

833
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I have no fucking...

834
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Hey, hey, hey.

835
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's me saying words.

836
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Hold on.

837
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm sure this sounds really good for them.

838
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's fine.

839
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's getting in our voice.

840
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's getting in our voice.

841
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, it's fine.

842
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What else could we be recording from?

843
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't know.

844
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It thinks I'm louder when I'm over here.

845
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You know what it probably is doing.

846
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That was perfect.

847
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, it says so.

848
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's Jesse for you.

849
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yep.

850
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Got it.

851
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Hello.

852
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes, I forgot.

853
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I forgot how much I love making beats.

854
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, you know what it's doing?

855
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
What?

856
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Which is fine.

857
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Is it recording through the laptop speakers?

858
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yes.

859
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I know it.

860
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's fine.

861
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No, it sucks to ask.

862
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So can we just get this fucking microphone out of here?

863
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes.

864
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The microphone is not recording?

865
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
No.

866
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What the fuck?

867
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Complete waste.

868
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
This could have sounded really bad then.

869
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I love that concern effect.

870
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't really mind that.

871
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, okay.

872
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's a bummer.

873
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I feel like we're in a right focus like this.

874
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You don't care about stuff like audio quality.

875
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah.

876
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah.

877
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah, the problem is that this is not plugged in is the problem.

878
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Let's just plug this in and see what happens.

879
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You know, I read somewhere like I'm like cracked.

880
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That like parting your hair to the right looks more masculine to the left.

881
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Like with the part on the right?

882
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That's what was my question because like I was reading the article and I'm like, wait,

883
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
what do you mean by parted on the right?

884
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Like going right or from the right?

885
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Well, part on the right, which I do not do.

886
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I part my hair on the left.

887
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So the hair goes from the left to the right.

888
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Like my hair naturally does it like this and sometimes I do it.

889
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't know.

890
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Hold on, wait.

891
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But like I had a bunch of examples from like pop culture.

892
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
How like Captain Kirk's hair is always like this.

893
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Superman's hair is like this.

894
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But Clark Kent's hair is like this because he's a weakling.

895
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Like you think that you think that the creators of Superman would have had to

896
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
have read that crack article to make that creative decision.

897
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They sent one cracked article back to 1978.

898
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So that they could get Superman's hair right.

899
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's the only thing that was ever done with time travel.

900
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
After that we threw the technology away.

901
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We were like, okay, we've got to steal this away.

902
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But first we can make one change.

903
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We have to choose carefully.

904
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh, wait.

905
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It is.

906
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I think it's just going to record through this until we restart it,

907
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't really care about doing and I don't, am I?

908
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You want me to just let it go?

909
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, just let it go.

910
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So if we get rid of this thing?

911
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah, it cares.

912
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay.

913
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean, the people, oh my God, Jesse.

914
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh, there it is.

915
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is the most fucking N with G God.

916
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh, shit.

917
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I look at this guy's eyes and like like literally like time has stopped.

918
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
My life has paused.

919
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And I have just watched for version finale five times in reverse.

920
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
He's so cool.

921
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But is that what you have?

922
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, you're green eyes.

923
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah.

924
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That's fucking like, that's character style.

925
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That's like clear as that.

926
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, yeah, I have green eyes like F and Jack.

927
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Oh, fuck!

928
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, you think that's where they got it from?

929
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Do you think that's where they got my eye filler from?

930
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

931
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I mean, I had to come from someone.

932
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Where else?

933
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah.

934
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I had to come from someone.

935
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's always done somewhere.

936
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
All of these buses are mods.

937
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, Skull.

938
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah.

939
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Skull.

940
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Skull.

941
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Skull.

942
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Hey, should we move like laptop?

943
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Nah, fuck it.

944
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh my God, I love that.

945
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That guy knows what's up.

946
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's the PCP guy mouth.

947
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He is, he totally is.

948
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Here, guys, do you want to pause for one second

949
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and then just check and make sure the audio is here

950
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
quite listenable?

951
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Okay, sure.

952
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah, okay.

953
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Hey, Jesse, screamer will be funny between cuts.

954
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Wait, what?

955
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Screamer, quick.

956
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We're back now, we're back.

957
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Does the laptop not have speakers?

958
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
No, it's connected to like two of the Elgato's

959
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
so I can't really tell what it's saying,

960
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
like I can't believe the headphones in.

961
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Hey, I'm going to show you, here comes back

962
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
when you're still on the bus.

963
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Sorry, recording again?

964
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah.

965
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Okay, a second.

966
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Where do they miss?

967
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't know.

968
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Jesse finished as me.

969
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I want to do like that.

970
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That's pretty much it.

971
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah.

972
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Here, hold on.

973
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Check out this.

974
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, shit.

975
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh, shit.

976
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Here comes Backman.

977
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

978
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What's up?

979
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Hey, Backman.

980
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What's up?

981
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Hey, this is a high-end product.

982
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What, a free base?

983
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
No, Backman, drugs are bad.

984
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, can't help it.

985
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay, I've heard this.

986
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I have not seen this animation.

987
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Whoa!

988
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh, shit.

989
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Okay.

990
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

991
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I feel like Backman is me.

992
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Every single day.

993
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Every day when I wake up, this isn't required anywhere,

994
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
but whenever I wake up, I come down and say,

995
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
hey, motherfuckers, who wants a freebie?

996
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm high, I'm crack.

997
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And I say that every time I come down to this.

998
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Can you say in the video that's just like six minutes

999
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
of Hagrid and Harry Potter, of him like,

1000
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm Harry, just Harry.

1001
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
He's like, no.

1002
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Who is your dad, right?

1003
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Like back, like, do you guys know what I'm talking about?

1004
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
No.

1005
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Good, look it up.

1006
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Uh, fuck.

1007
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm not sure what to type,

1008
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
but type like you're a wizard, Harry.

1009
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Or something like that.

1010
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Make some fucked up shit.

1011
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Make some fucked up shit.

1012
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Coming right up.

1013
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I want to do like a skit of like,

1014
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
if people treat it like how they want to look in real life,

1015
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
like how they want to look in games.

1016
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Like a guy goes to a plastic surgeon,

1017
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and like, he's like, look,

1018
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I want purple skin.

1019
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I want eyes like Brock from Pokemon.

1020
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I want to be fat as fucking shit.

1021
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Hop to it, you fuck.

1022
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I want to be a monster.

1023
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Not this.

1024
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It's like a, it's like a, like an animation.

1025
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
This is the top right there.

1026
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Is that heck?

1027
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Let's see.

1028
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This is different than what it's just been.

1029
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
They're just Harry.

1030
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I suppose the lines are just lines.

1031
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And gods are just gods.

1032
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You know, you know what this has the same tone of?

1033
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's Goat and Seller.

1034
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

1035
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's that kind of like bullshit.

1036
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Bullshit.

1037
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Alright, I want this nigger.

1038
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I want, okay, first of all, nigger.

1039
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
First of all, nigger.

1040
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I want this nigger to be like cut,

1041
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
the kind of cut where you can still beat him up.

1042
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Another one.

1043
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, like model cut.

1044
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, like model cut.

1045
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, like tiny weights.

1046
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Or just company has aids.

1047
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So a strong breeze will push him over.

1048
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I think you want that one.

1049
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I think you want that sunken cheeks.

1050
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What if, what if you're an anorexic girl

1051
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and you wanted to kill yourself because you were anorexic.

1052
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But because you were anorexic, you were wobbly.

1053
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So you got up on like a lead and you're like,

1054
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
you know what, I don't actually want to kill myself,

1055
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but a breeze pushed you over because you were anorexic.

1056
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I feel, well, I imagine

1057
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
he wouldn't be too,

1058
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
this guy looks awful.

1059
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah.

1060
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He's, he looks impossible.

1061
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That's like the AIDS hat.

1062
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

1063
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What's it, what's it with me hats being like the most

1064
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
the me hats are like the most iconically awful video game

1065
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
mechanism or any sort of thing from a video game.

1066
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Most iconically terrible thing.

1067
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah.

1068
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Like it's like they knew that they would never approach

1069
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
like the breadth of what a hat could be.

1070
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So they didn't even try it.

1071
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I mean, just pick one and did it.

1072
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
All right.

1073
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I guess that'll do.

1074
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Would you make one that like looks like your avatar

1075
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
because they have to be.

1076
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah, I've, I've done it.

1077
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's great.

1078
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Actually, I'll do that next.

1079
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Okay.

1080
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Let me flex my mean hats.

1081
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
On my way.

1082
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I think you want real thin.

1083
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
My, my, my, my stoner fringe.

1084
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
He's always come over to my house.

1085
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
He would just make me literally all night.

1086
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And he would just explain to me what kind of stoner parties

1087
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
he's gone to.

1088
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And so he comes up with stuff like Ferdinand,

1089
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
zzzzzzz music.

1090
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Sign.

1091
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Seed and a lot of.

1092
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Who.

1093
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah.

1094
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I feel like that's our dynamic.

1095
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
In your.

1096
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes.

1097
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,280
Dude, we should put that at like the beginning of every episode.

1098
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
You know what's fucked up?

1099
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,680
We should make them our mascots.

1100
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,560
You know what's fucked up too is that the Applejack's background is literally the same

1101
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,760
color as like the background of Roger Scott's podcast.

1102
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Oh, the green.

1103
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Yeah.

1104
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Yes.

1105
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,480
Shut your face, dad.

1106
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm totally me.

1107
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Me.

1108
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Eating Applejack's from A to B.

1109
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,240
That's just the first thing that comes to your head no matter what.

1110
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
No matter what.

1111
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,240
I'm not a fan of the Dramium.

1112
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Bye.

1113
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,240
We the hell no dogs.

1114
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Yo, I'm high on crack.

1115
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Wanna free me?

1116
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,240
No, I'm straight laced.

1117
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,240
I only smoke the natural ganja as God demands.

1118
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Yes, she was this Rupert not God to you.

1119
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,240
It's free.

1120
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,240
This guy looks nice.

1121
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,240
I want him to teach me to ride a bicycle.

1122
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,240
He kind of looks like my dead grandpa.

1123
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Really?

1124
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Yeah.

1125
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Nice.

1126
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
I know.

1127
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,240
It doesn't look anything like my dead grandpa.

1128
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,240
This is like the happiest nigger I've seen in a while.

1129
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,240
I'm really uncomfortable with the use of the hard R on an actual person of color.

1130
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
What a hot take.

1131
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah.

1132
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,240
He's not a person yet.

1133
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
He will soon.

1134
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
That's true.

1135
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
He doesn't have rights yet.

1136
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Yeah.

1137
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Those are his eyebrows.

1138
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,240
We haven't cut the umbilical cord.

1139
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Yes.

1140
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,240
What a piece of shit.

1141
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:09,240
This guy looks like Gendo Ikari.

1142
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Can you imagine how much better it would be?

1143
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,240
He's right here among us.

1144
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
What?

1145
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Gendo Ikari.

1146
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
So much better.

1147
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,240
He didn't get the part.

1148
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
He was a method actor.

1149
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,240
I just love the idea of Gendo so much that he just became Gendo for the rest of his life.

1150
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,240
He's got no body.

1151
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,240
Just like Gendo in real life.

1152
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Gendo has navy blue and red, right?

1153
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Yeah.

1154
00:41:51,240 --> 00:42:04,240
I like how on the capture, our picture-in-a-picture camera is just tying up so that you can't

1155
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
see the body.

1156
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
I forgot.

1157
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
Hold on.

1158
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
I have to do something important.

1159
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,240
What?

1160
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Is it suicide?

1161
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,240
Order transform.

1162
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Order.

1163
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
Order.

1164
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
Not order.

1165
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Order.

1166
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Order.

1167
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
I'll do it.

1168
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,240
It doesn't make any sense.

1169
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
It sounds scary.

1170
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
Alright, let's see.

1171
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Man fuck.

1172
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Okay, I said I was going to make me, but I don't want some anymore.

1173
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,240
I'm going to have something cooked up.

1174
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:57,240
One little change is all it takes to go from a human being to a fat shit.

1175
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:07,240
Do you think we can afford to get some BBW whenever there's got to be some time?

1176
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Can we afford it?

1177
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
I don't know.

1178
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Can we afford not to is the question.

1179
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
No.

1180
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,240
Well, I don't know.

1181
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
What happened?

1182
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
What?

1183
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
You lost the signal.

1184
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
Wait, wait.

1185
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Oh, it's back.

1186
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Okay.

1187
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,240
False alarm.

1188
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,240
All right.

1189
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
Here we go.

1190
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Actually, yeah.

1191
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
There we go.

1192
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
There we go.

1193
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
There we go.

1194
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
Okay.

1195
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,240
I have centered the webcam within the screen.

1196
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,240
So now you can literally not avoid it no matter what you do.

1197
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Literally in the center of the screen.

1198
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
That's awful.

1199
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
That's the worst.

1200
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,240
No, that's good.

1201
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Oh, okay.

1202
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Yeah.

1203
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
I mean, I guess it's in the spirit.

1204
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
Yeah.

1205
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
But it's pretty fucking big.

1206
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
Oh, you know what we should do?

1207
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,240
We should make a rather as popular as the Valentine's Day special.

1208
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Did you say Valentine's Day?

1209
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Yeah.

1210
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,240
Okay.

1211
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Good.

1212
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I don't know what it would be about.

1213
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
Valentine's Day special.

1214
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,240
Well, it would probably be about how much we love killing cops.

1215
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
What do we love?

1216
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,240
We love killing cops.

1217
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,240
We love breaking mops.

1218
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
We love.

1219
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
We love practicing.

1220
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
We love killing cops and breaking mops.

1221
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Off in our assholes.

1222
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
The end.

1223
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,240
How long do you think you can take before something like a dick of your ass would hurt?

1224
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,240
Like how many inches do you need to take?

1225
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,240
I mean, I think it would hurt right away.

1226
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Yeah.

1227
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
Yeah, I don't think there's...

1228
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Unless we got like thicker at the bottom.

1229
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
Yeah.

1230
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
It's like a needle.

1231
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Dude.

1232
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Oh my God.

1233
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,240
What if you had like a, like, not like a needle pin, but like a small pin.

1234
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,240
Like you could poke and stab with it.

1235
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,240
I feel like that would be ideal if you're sucking out the juice of the clit.

1236
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
For pop and that's hard to pop.

1237
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,240
You're sucking out the juice of the clit.

1238
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Wait, wait, wait.

1239
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Oh, you're dead.

1240
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Oh my God.

1241
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
Oh, no.

1242
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
Dude, is that shinging?

1243
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,240
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1244
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Yes.

1245
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Here we go.

1246
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Now we're talking.

1247
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
Now we're cooking.

1248
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Oh my God.

1249
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Holy shit.

1250
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Pretty cool, right?

1251
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
Is that a triforce?

1252
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
It will be.

1253
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Hold on.

1254
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,240
Eyebrows, these can go a little...

1255
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
Oh, they all could push together.

1256
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
Oh, what?

1257
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
Mouth.

1258
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,240
Yeah, it's a little better.

1259
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,240
Okay, yes.

1260
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
What are you trying to do here?

1261
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
I'm just trying to make something great.

1262
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
They'll stay on the test of time.

1263
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
And something to be remembered for.

1264
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
That's a humble goal.

1265
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
What do you think it's like after you die?

1266
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
It's probably a lot like this.

1267
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
Yeah.

1268
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Dude, what?

1269
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1270
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,240
I feel like it was just the meat channel on week.

1271
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,240
That's a black mirror episode.

1272
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
I could deal.

1273
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
I could deal.

1274
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
I could probably deal with anything.

1275
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,240
I'd take anything and I'd be happy for it.

1276
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
I know.

1277
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,240
I know.

1278
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,240
I know.

1279
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,240
I want no hair.

1280
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,240
Here we go.

1281
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
Oh my...

1282
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
I think this is it.

1283
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
I think I've done it.

1284
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Well...

1285
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,240
Day is...

1286
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
Day is...

1287
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
Wait, hold on.

1288
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,240
Yeah.

1289
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
That'll be his mouth.

1290
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,240
Yeah.

1291
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,240
No, yeah, just be really close like that.

1292
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
Yeah!

1293
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Wait, is it better if it's up here?

1294
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,240
I feel like below is better.

1295
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,240
Yeah, I agree.

1296
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,240
It kind of looks like a butt.

1297
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,240
No.

1298
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,240
Yeah.

1299
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
No.

1300
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
No.

1301
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
That's awful, yeah.

1302
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
Yeah, just give him some cool shade.

1303
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,240
Give him a little beard.

1304
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,240
You don't have to be an asshole for beard.

1305
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
That's actually not too bad.

1306
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,240
I almost like it.

1307
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
But it's a little too human.

1308
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
It kind of looks like fucking...

1309
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
Dude, is that Gendo card?

1310
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
No.

1311
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
I was going to say ndeki.

1312
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
Oh yeah.

1313
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
He looks like...

1314
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
He looks a bit like an egg.

1315
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
I don't want this.

1316
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:39,240
Handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar, handlebar.

1317
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,240
I'm not even like getting gun sex artifacts.

1318
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
Like you were in stream, you know, just be that.

1319
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,240
Yeah.

1320
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
My baby!

1321
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
They shot my baby!

1322
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,240
The Gendo Capitalist Revolution is here!

1323
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
Nah, I don't like this.

1324
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,240
Handlebar.

1325
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240
He's getting too many gimmicks, he's getting overcomplicated.

1326
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,240
Yeah!

1327
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,240
Yeah!

1328
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,240
My god, he's like a bum now!

1329
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,240
Oh my god, he's a praying mantis!

1330
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,240
How did I...

1331
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Did I fucking do it or what?

1332
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,240
You did it.

1333
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,240
Did I fucking nail it or what?

1334
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
Did I knock it out of the park?

1335
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,240
I didn't.

1336
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,240
You know what, actually, hold on, let me experiment with drugs and lesbianism.

1337
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,240
I think this guy was the original bug that started the bug war.

1338
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,240
I think this is the genesis of all bug war activities.

1339
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Yeah, this is Joey Bug War.

1340
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,240
Joey Bug War.

1341
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,240
No, just Joey Bug.

1342
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,240
Joey Bug.

1343
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,240
Uh, I think...

1344
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,240
It was named after him, you know, Bug War.

1345
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
Joey Bug.

1346
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
I think the color you originally had was the best.

1347
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
Yeah.

1348
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
You think so?

1349
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Yeah.

1350
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
We can't have everyone be black.

1351
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
That's true.

1352
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
That would be it.

1353
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,240
In the words of God, we can't have everyone be black.

1354
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
Oh my god!

1355
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,240
I'm gonna make some white people now.

1356
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
That can't possibly go wrong.

1357
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
Yeah.

1358
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
Fucking...

1359
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
Okay, God creating humans fake.

1360
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Like, humans evolving fake.

1361
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:30,240
The real shape is higher conscious beings are just plain, like, me-maker,

1362
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,240
and whatever me's they make aren't a lower level of conscious, like a lower dimension.

1363
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,240
It's just me-makers all the way down is what you're saying?

1364
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
Yeah, exactly.

1365
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,240
So, like, the 11th and 12th dimensions are making, like, human-like me's,

1366
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,240
and human-like me's are making weird, fucked up monster ghosts,

1367
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,240
and those are what probably are the lower dimensions.

1368
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,240
Uh, what do you think?

1369
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Like this?

1370
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
Or like this?

1371
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,240
I think the one you were just on.

1372
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
This one?

1373
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,240
Yeah, I think that one's the best.

1374
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,240
Okay.

1375
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,240
Uh...

1376
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,240
Oh!

1377
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,240
Make them really thin and really, like, small.

1378
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,240
What a creepy creature.

1379
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,240
Oh!

1380
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,240
No, not fat.

1381
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
Yeah, yeah.

1382
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
Yeah, like that.

1383
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,240
Small.

1384
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
Yeah.

1385
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
He's a bug.

1386
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
He's Joey Bug.

1387
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,240
It's not small.

1388
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
It's pretty small.

1389
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
Okay, should I quit?

1390
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,240
Go to his name.

1391
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Joey Bug.

1392
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Um...

1393
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,240
I'm...

1394
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Jorg...

1395
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
I'm...

1396
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
I'm gonna be honest.

1397
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,240
I like Joey Bug War better.

1398
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Right, that's fine.

1399
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Oh!

1400
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,240
Joey Bug War.

1401
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,240
Joey Bug War.

1402
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
Joey Bug War.

1403
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
Is that French?

1404
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
Yeah, Joey Bug War.

1405
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,240
Joey Bug Wadi.

1406
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
Okay.

1407
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,240
Joey Bug War.

1408
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Yeah, female.

1409
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,240
Female Joey.

1410
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,240
Yeah.

1411
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,240
Like a kangaroo.

1412
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,240
Yeah.

1413
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,240
Definitely a favorite.

1414
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,240
Birthday is, uh, 11...

1415
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
20...

1416
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,240
Uh...

1417
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,240
He's a few months late,

1418
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
but he still is ready to smoke that weed.

1419
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
There we go.

1420
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
That's Joey Bug War.

1421
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,240
Joey Bug War.

1422
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,240
Joey Bug War.

1423
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Any creator?

1424
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
God.

1425
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
He makes all the best of me and stuff.

1426
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,240
Save him quick.

1427
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Hell yeah.

1428
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
Hell yeah, Joey Bug War.

1429
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,240
Joey Bug War!

1430
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,240
You open the...

1431
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,240
The fucking Bible.

1432
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Oh, look at...

1433
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,240
Oh, look at him!

1434
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,240
What a good little booge.

1435
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,240
What a good little booge.

1436
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,240
You know what game is my fucking shit?

1437
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
What's fucking Mario...

1438
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,240
Not Mario.

1439
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,240
You want Balor Revolution?

1440
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,240
I love that game.

1441
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,240
You've never heard of it.

1442
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,240
You've never even heard of it.

1443
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
Wait, what's Balor Revolution?

1444
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,240
Balor Revolution was like the other state.

1445
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,240
Like stadium for weed.

1446
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,240
Um...

1447
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
Fake.

1448
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,240
You made that up.

1449
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,240
This TV...

1450
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,240
The colors are so fucking blown out.

1451
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
You're asking me blown out.

1452
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
Fucking smoke a pile.

1453
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,240
They just washed the shit.

1454
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
You've washed the shit.

1455
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,240
They've been turned into fucking goo.

1456
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,240
Disintegrated.

1457
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
Whoa, okay.

1458
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
He's got nice hair.

1459
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
That's Lieutenant Surge!

1460
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,240
This is the very fucking capitalist commentary you come for.

1461
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,240
Create a guy who...

1462
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,240
His wife just divorced him.

1463
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,240
And so he burned down his house with his kids in it.

1464
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
And now he's on the run.

1465
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,240
From the cop killers, because he is a cop.

1466
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,240
Oh, yes.

1467
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,240
That's a twist.

1468
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,240
You know, the only...

1469
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,240
You know, when a cop goes bad,

1470
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,240
you gotta call him a cop too late.

1471
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,240
Regular cops can't hit you.

1472
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,240
You're a special branch of the police.

1473
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,240
You're a cop too.

1474
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,240
You're sanctioned by the fucking city.

1475
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,240
Yeah.

1476
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,240
Yeah, the ratty fucker is a cop killer.

1477
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,240
He's a good boy.

1478
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
We're civil servants.

1479
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Like, with us around, people don't have to live in fear of police brutality.

1480
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
Really?

1481
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,240
All I have to do is wear that Oscar brutality.

1482
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,240
The mayor gets, like, a speeding ticket.

1483
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,240
Get me the cop killers.

1484
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,240
We gotta clean up this city.

1485
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Oh, yes, sir.

1486
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
It's too much.

1487
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,240
Our pleasure.

1488
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
We'll take our payment in the...

1489
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,240
We'll take our payment in the...

1490
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,240
in the gum, please.

1491
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
Oh, my God.

1492
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Literally, yeah.

1493
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
Literally, yes.

1494
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,240
Please send one month's worth of rent and pizza.

1495
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,240
For every job.

1496
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,240
For every, yeah.

1497
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,240
Don't make us buy it ourselves.

1498
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,240
Pay our rent and give us the pizza.

1499
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,240
Yes.

1500
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240
We do not deal in money.

1501
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,240
We deal in debt shops.

1502
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,240
We do it for the convenience.

1503
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,240
You think we got on this job?

1504
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,240
We think we got on this job to make money?

1505
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,240
We got it, we got it, because we wouldn't have to think about it.

1506
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,240
You know, it's easy.

1507
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,240
You know, to kill a few cops, live another month.
