1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You all thought Digibro's decompression chamber was cancelled, didn't you?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Well it is.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,920
I stopped doing them.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,600
This is the special edition, yay!

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,200
Special depressing podcast, just for you guys.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,000
And to see, I love this idea that the PCP is becoming this mishmash of hilarious comedy

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,960
shows and then just utterly, gutturally depressing solo podcasts.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,440
So this one is going to get extra meta, because this is kind of a response to the second episode

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,200
of Tom's hyperbolic wine chamber.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,480
And if you didn't listen to that one to summarize it, essentially it's Tom, as usual, being

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,720
very hard on himself and talking about his need to earn his keep in The Pro Crastinators

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,480
by feeling like he's under-talented and not doing enough, I don't know why he thinks

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,200
he has to earn his keep, no one's ever said anything of the sort, but you know, Tom's

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,720
always pretty down on himself.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,600
Personally, I think Tom will always be in the PCP because I like Tom, I like having

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,200
him around, I hope he keeps living, um, might be selfish of me to say so, but uh, but anyways,

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:21,080
I want to respond to it, because in it, Tom has some admiration for me and Jesse and

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,120
Monkey Jones.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,200
And this is not just about Tom, this is also about a lot of The Pro Crastinators fans,

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,160
a lot of my fans in general, a lot of people who look up to us, um, you know, even within

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,840
our own group, I mean, just as Tom looks at, you know, looks at us and feels like he's

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,800
not doing enough or isn't, isn't talented enough, I've always felt the same way looking

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,800
at Jesse, I've always felt Jesse was exponentially more talented than me, and you know, I really

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,200
struggle with the idea that the videos I make aren't really doing anything artistically

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,880
in comparison to what Jesse's doing, you know, and I mean, I have a lot more self-confidence

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,160
and I enjoy my own content a lot more than I think Tom enjoys his own content.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,160
So like I'm able to find a reason for it to exist, uh, but you know, I still feel it

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,280
pales in comparison to Jesse, but I think the difference I have in mindset here and

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,520
that like the perspective I want everyone to keep, everybody, everybody in our audience,

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Tom, myself, everyone, is that nothing about this is admirable, nothing about what any

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:33,460
of us is doing is admirable, and none of us is really happy doing this.

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,080
I need, I need to stress this.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,920
If you look up to us because you want your life to be like us, what you're going to

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,000
get is not going to be a life of satisfaction and happiness.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,720
You're not going, if you're trying to pursue, I want to have the exact same career that

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,320
those guys have or the same art that they have, like none of us is someone who sits

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:06,360
around being satisfied with our lives and, and is like, and is like super okay with the

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,980
way things stand or the way they are, you know, and maybe you think it'll be different

39
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,240
for you, maybe you think it's not going to turn out the same way, but I just want you

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
to like before you go looking up to what we do, just remember that we're doing this largely

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,840
out of being broken people who can't function normally in society, either because of the

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,560
circumstances surrounding us, or just because I don't know, I don't know what's wrong

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
with us.

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
I mean, Monkey Jones has a channel called Monkey's Countdown to Suicide in which he

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,440
is constantly reassuring everyone of the fact that he will kill himself.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,680
He hates being alive.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,800
He is a depressed suicidal man.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,280
You know, it's cool that he got a book written, like I know that's what Tom was admiring

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
about him is that Tom, you know, also wants to write a book and he read Monkeys and he

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,040
really admired Monkeys writing, but writing that book has not made Monkey not suicidal.

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,640
And all he's gotten out of it is that it paid his rent for one month.

52
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,680
You know, it's sold incredibly well for a self-published book, which is to say it made

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,600
like $600, you know, and paid his rent for one month at a crucial moment when he was

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,880
in between moving and, you know, needed that money because he couldn't get a job during

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
that month.

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
So it's not like he's got spending money as a result of the book.

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,600
It just covered his living expense.

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,080
You know, his Patreon's not super successful or anything.

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,920
He's not living off of it.

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,240
He hopes to be possibly, but I'm pretty sure when he moves to North Carolina, he's going

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,500
to get a normal job, you know, writing that book.

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,120
That book will never be publishable.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,680
He knows it himself.

64
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,480
The book has an 11-year-old rubbing cum all over her body.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Spoilers.

66
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,560
He doesn't like it when I tell people that.

67
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:05,440
So that's, you know, being Monkey Jones, you might see it as artistically fulfilling

68
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,160
because you admire his art more than your own, but Monkey Jones himself is not happy

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
with it.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
Like if you were in his shoes, you wouldn't be happy.

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,200
He's not a happy person.

72
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:26,800
If you were Endless Jess, Endless Jess, his art comes almost exclusively through adversity,

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
through just the horrible things that are happening to him constantly.

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,600
This is a man who was already depressed and didn't want to fly across the country to make

75
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,200
a bunch of videos at the time that he, you know, that we did a Kickstarter, so he kind

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,360
of had to, but he flies down here, you know, works through his crushing depression for

77
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,520
just long enough to finish these videos, goes home, and his fucking house is flooded and

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,120
everything's ruined.

79
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,400
And he's sick and he's just like, you know, sifting through the ashes of his dead life,

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,760
trying to harness nuggets of art out of that just to make money to live.

81
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,800
Jesse doesn't want to be doing YouTube videos.

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,800
He's doing it because he's broke and he has no other choice, you know?

83
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,080
I just, he's not happy with it.

84
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,200
He doesn't like his work that much.

85
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,560
He's usually dissatisfied with his videos.

86
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,760
He's looking back at them, you know, like, as much as we look up to it, as much as we

87
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,120
look at it and go, wow, Jesse, the stuff you're doing is so amazing, I admire you so much.

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,240
None of that matters to him because where that art is coming from is a, you know, it's

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,920
a place that's, it's a dark place.

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,200
And this is sort of the subject of this song that me and Jesse made called Paradise recently,

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,240
because a while back, me and Jesse made this song called Get Action.

92
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,560
And the point of this song was to shit on everybody who wasn't putting in as much work

93
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,240
as we were, but it was not necessarily meant to inspire people, which is what it did.

94
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,200
And we both saw it as kind of ironic and maybe even dangerous.

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,880
I mean, I do say in the song, you know, you have to get action, you got to put your life

96
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,240
on the line, you got to go all out if you want to be as good as us.

97
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,320
But it wasn't my intention to suggest that you want to be as good as us.

98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,560
I was merely like, like the anger of that song is in people looking at me like I don't

99
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
know what I'm doing.

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,760
You know, like the point of it was to say, I am amazing at this, I'm built for this,

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,800
I've done nothing but practice this, this is my life.

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,040
So don't, don't try to say, like don't even look at me for advice unless you're willing

103
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,560
to put this level of insane effort in.

104
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,880
But it's not me saying that you should put this level of insane effort in, that you

105
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,400
should become this person.

106
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,160
Because when I look at what I am, I spend 50% of all my time sitting around wondering

107
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
what the fuck am I doing with my life.

108
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,520
You know, I sleep for ridiculous amounts of my day.

109
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,200
I sleep through as much of the day as possible and the only way that I manage to get through

110
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,240
because of the fact that there's nothing happening in my life.

111
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,120
The reason I'm so productive is not because I have a great work ethic, in fact I don't

112
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,840
even think I have a good work ethic because actual work, like work that, like if I wanted

113
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,320
to be making money and doing like the right kind of videos and like putting out stuff

114
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,840
that's gonna advance my career and stuff like that or like sometimes I write, I have a main

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,120
series video that needs to get done and I put it off for days to just go make a bunch

116
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,560
of bullshit and I'm not making the bullshit because I think it's good work, I'm doing

117
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,200
it because I'm fucking bored and I don't know what else to do with myself, I don't

118
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,520
know how to live a normal life, I don't know how to do anything other than make YouTube

119
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,720
videos, I'm just a machine built for this.

120
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,920
It's not admirable, it produces fun art for all of you but like wanting to be like me,

121
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,240
I don't think you should and keep in mind because in everyone else's case I can say

122
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,960
like they're throwing themselves against a brick wall with maybe seemingly no reward,

123
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,680
no matter how much Jesse works he can't get himself out of that shitty house, no matter

124
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,280
how much Tom works he can't get himself out of his shitty house, no matter how much

125
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,160
Monkey works, well we don't know, Monkey's kind of up in the air because he's about

126
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,400
to move, Hippo just wants to have a breakthrough, he's making all these videos, just trying

127
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,240
to have one of them get big enough that his channel can actually sustain, Hippo's talking

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,480
all the time about how he's not sure if he should keep doing YouTube forever because

129
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,920
it just hasn't fucking broken through, it's been three years you know and for all of them

130
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:53,720
there's that aspect but that's not true of me, I am successful, I made $50,000 last year,

131
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,440
I made more than a lot of your parents probably made, you know I made a lot of money, I had

132
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,040
a successful year, this is a career, this is a real career for me, that hasn't made

133
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:12,680
it happy, it's given me lots of perks, it's given me great ways to get through this crushing

134
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:22,200
nihilistic depression, you know, I'm able to survive and to come off as like you know enjoying

135
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,480
myself because I constantly distract myself, I constantly make videos because when I'm

136
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,440
not making videos I'm just sitting around with myself and the only ways that I know

137
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,320
how to escape that are to just go and eat, you know I go out to a restaurant and I try

138
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,480
to waste as much time as I can, I go out you know I fucking drive across town, go to some

139
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,320
far flung restaurant and I have a nice meal and I enjoy myself, yeah that's cool, it's

140
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,680
a perk that I get for having so much money and being successful on YouTube but it's just

141
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,840
there to make me not think about what I'm doing at home, you know I've developed a shopping

142
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,520
addiction because every day I want to go out and go somewhere and be not at home for as

143
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:10,520
long as possible so I feel like I'm doing anything with my life so I'll go out to just some store

144
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,480
and just wander around until I buy something, you know just to just to have that thrill of

145
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:24,120
purchasing a thing and taking it home, you know, I'll, I drink all the time, you know I get bored,

146
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I can't stand being alone with my thoughts so I just start drinking, you know, or I make another

147
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,600
video, just do anything to distract me from the fact that I'm not doing anything and I don't know

148
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,280
how to do anything, making all this money hasn't taught me how to do that, it hasn't taught me

149
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,840
how to get out of the house, how to how to meet new people, how to like make connections, how to

150
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,080
figure out what's wrong because this is not how I envisioned my life was going to be when I was

151
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:59,000
growing up, you know, like I always thought that the road towards success was going to be from

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,200
escaping this, like I thought when, because this is what I've been doing since I was a teenager,

153
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,280
I've been locked in my room, you know, sitting on the internet talking about anime for over 10 years

154
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,880
now, this is all I've ever been doing and back then when it didn't seem like there was a career

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,240
to be made out of this, when it seemed like this was just this was just throwing shit into the void

156
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,040
that no one would ever care about, you know, which is how it was for over five years, may I remind

157
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,080
everyone, I have only been successful for as long as I was doing this completely unsuccessfully

158
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,320
to an audience of no one, you know, I started anime writing in 2007, I spent five years before I even

159
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,520
had a YouTube channel, you know, and even then another year before it was successful enough to

160
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,840
consider a job, you know, and another two years after that before it was a job that that was

161
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:58,200
above minimum wage, but like in all that time, I always thought that the road to being successful

162
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,840
would mean getting out of the house, going out and finding something to do out in the world,

163
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,600
and so the fact that I found work here that I was able to be successful without changing anything,

164
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,840
what that feels like it's telling me is that I won't ever change anything, like why

165
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,240
why would I change if I can be successful just staying here, but this kind of success,

166
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,720
this doesn't feel right to me, like I'm not happy with the idea that I'm a guy who just

167
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,920
lives in his room all the time, I want to be someone who goes out and does things and has

168
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:42,440
stories to tell, who meets people, who goes places, like I really admire and look up to people who

169
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,560
have like a storied life, you know, and I don't have that, all I have is, I mean I do all these

170
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,360
fucking podcasts and let's plays where always the story is, well I watched a lot of anime this week

171
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,720
and I made a whole bunch of videos, that's what I was up to, you know, like I can't tell stories

172
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,520
about what's happened in my life, because nothing's happening, and like there's a huge part of me that

173
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,960
always thought things would be different, and I'm standing here like, but how do I even justify it,

174
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,640
how do I even justify leaving the house, you know, and it's not like I want to do something else,

175
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:23,800
because I love doing this job, but I could, like I just don't know how to branch out, I don't know

176
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,520
where to go, because I'm just broken, I'm broken in the mind, the reason I'm able to have such

177
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:38,520
an amazing work ethic is because I am broken in the mind, so before you go looking up to me

178
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,760
and what I do, take a step back and ask yourself, do you actually want this life,

179
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,440
because this is what it will cost you, you'll have to spend five plus years working in complete

180
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:01,000
obscurity just to hone your skills, that's what it took, I've been doing this non-stop for 10 years,

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,080
I started my anime blog in 2007, I was writing, there were times in 2009, I had a post out every

182
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:14,280
day, sometimes three posts a day, you know, I had 59 posts in the month of February 2009,

183
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:21,320
I remember that, no one read any of those, I was just grinding material, and then finally it got good

184
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,200
enough and I figured out a platform where people would actually watch the shit, and then another

185
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,720
five years to get actually successful, you know, I've got 10,000 hours in this shit, that's why

186
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm good at it, so first you gotta be willing to just waste years of your life, and I got lucky

187
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,840
in that I got to waste those years young, you know, if you're already my age, get ready to

188
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:49,000
waste the next 10, I mean you probably have a leg up on 15 year old me who was just garbage

189
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,440
at writing, you know, it had no worldview whatsoever because I was so young, you've got a leg up on

190
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,800
that, but expect to take some time, you know, now the next thing you have to be ready for is to lose

191
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,600
all social connections in all of your friends, I used to have a group of friends who was at my

192
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,960
house all the time, none of them are here anymore, I don't talk to any of them because we have nothing

193
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,600
in common, because all I do is work, this is my whole life, I don't relate to anybody, the only

194
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
people I relate to are other people doing the same thing, which is why I'm in the PCP and why

195
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,640
those are my only fucking friends, so you have to be ready to burn away your social connections,

196
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,840
to spend all your time on this, to burn away your health, because in the process of trying

197
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:43,000
to make videos constantly, you will sit in a chair for, you know, dozens of hours a day,

198
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I know there's only two dozen in a day, but you know, I sit in this chair 12 hours a day,

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,680
that's a fair statement, you know, assuming I'm awake for that long out of a day, I am always

200
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:04,920
here working and I just don't, you know, I don't really find time for health and upkeep and personal

201
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,560
fucking like grooming or anything, like that stuff doesn't come naturally to me, all of my teeth

202
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,840
are falling out of my fucking skull, I keep getting fatter, I've become an alcoholic, I was addicted

203
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,760
to cigarettes for a little while, you know, I'm trying to keep away from that, but I'm fairly

204
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,560
certain I'm gonna end up smoking again before too very long, because it just looks too cool not to do

205
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:36,360
it, like, you know, I quit smoking and I quit caffeine for the last few weeks, because of the

206
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,120
fact that I started having anxiety attacks and, you know, I looked up what causes anxiety and it

207
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,760
was a lot of the things I was doing, so I cut those things out and I have stopped having anxiety

208
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,080
problems since doing that, it's just made me incredibly lethargic and I've just been laying

209
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,400
around staring at the ceiling all day, you know, like, I'm always bouncing between those two extremes,

210
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,480
it's always either I don't want to do anything or I want to do everything and it's driving me insane

211
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,560
and why do I still live here and why am I still acting this way and am I ever going to be normal

212
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,680
because even when I find myself in situations where I should be able to talk to people,

213
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:18,280
I completely fail at it, you know, I just, I don't want people to look at me and think that

214
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:25,000
because I'm making videos all the time and I'm making lots of money that you want that life,

215
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,160
because what that life comes with is just this constant feeling that you're doing something wrong,

216
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,080
that this wasn't what you were supposed to be doing, that like this isn't what the world,

217
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:48,040
you know, told you you were meant to be doing growing up, you know, and it's not that I don't

218
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,040
like this job because I do and this job is what's keeping me from being completely depressed because

219
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,040
anytime I try to just say I'm going to put distance between myself and this job,

220
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,080
I just do nothing, you know, I don't know how to do anything else, this job is the only thing I

221
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,600
have, but I don't think it's something to seek out, you know, if you have the opportunity to go

222
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,880
do something interesting and normal, I would encourage that, you know, normalcy is not a

223
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:23,720
bad thing to pursue, it's stability, it's like the idea of normal is that there's nothing wrong

224
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,360
with you, you know, like to do this kind of job you have to have something wrong with you,

225
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:38,920
something kind of broken, you know, and I mean not to say that it can't be fun, it can be and

226
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,360
if you do get really successful, like I totally encourage best guy ever to keep going on the

227
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,600
path he's going to eventually get successful at YouTube and to, you know, make enough money

228
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,080
out because he's going to treat it like he treats his job anyways, you know, it's just going to be

229
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,680
a more creatively fulfilling version of what he was doing and I kind of almost admire all these

230
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,960
YouTubers who do just like treat it like work, you know, these guys who are just doing it as a

231
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,400
job because the way people consume it doesn't change if you do it as a job versus doing it as

232
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:17,320
art, you know, and I worry that guys like us are just inspiring a whole a whole fucking group of

233
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,120
people who are setting themselves up for disappointment because either you're going to go down the

234
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,800
road of constantly straining yourself trying to become an artist and failing and getting depressed

235
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,240
over it or actually becoming an artist and realizing that it doesn't bring you any more

236
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:40,600
happiness than what you already had, you know, except in the the mere pride that you can eke

237
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,640
out of the fact that you did what you wanted to do, which I guess is what keeps us all going in the

238
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,480
long run. Anyway, yeah, that's that, I guess.

239
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:27,480
Nice.

240
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,560
Give me an mentor to all who admire me. I know it fired me if I had ever hired me.

241
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:39,080
And I mean by firing squad. I'm gayer than God and deserve to be deader than a door now.

242
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,840
That's love but I quit smoking so I won't be choking on anything other than dick for a while.

243
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,800
Never been in style. They didn't like something of a prick in its wild or some punk to act like

244
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,840
I stabbed someone just because I gave a one to their favorite show. Do you even know what is

245
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,400
an opinion? Objectivity doesn't exist. I told you a million times. There is no rule to write no

246
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,800
design. Only what you decide you like at this time and I hate myself. So don't emulate me unless

247
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,760
you're better with self-help.

248
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,760
Trillion fans ain't worth a damn. They ain't worth one friend. I can't call my man.

249
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,160
Ambition is living how others won't floor a vision and a mission. Getting what others don't but

250
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,640
that's missing the mark. Given every spark makes your heart dark because ambition is a prison.

251
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,680
Not a walk in the park. I've had best friends tell me that they envy me and look with jealousy

252
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,720
like I'm the enemy, like I'm a rival. But when you ain't a rival to me, I'm rival. My survival

253
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,880
two miles of trials would be tragedy if not for the fact that I'm getting back to my family.

254
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,360
Nothing else helps or is held to have you mad at me because I'm broken. I don't know how long

255
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,920
you've spent. Since I've seen the sun or put my lungs with oxygen, I'm too far gone. I take

256
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920
norminess over this. Gotta check the pulse of my wrist to know I exist.

257
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:42,760
I go wild, I go wild, I go wild.
