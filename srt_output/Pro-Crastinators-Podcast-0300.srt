00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,560
We did it ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,680
We actually made a fucking podcast.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,760
Hey everybody I'm Mumkey Jones, you look up Mumkey in the dictionary, that's a p-

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
He really is the best guy.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
I wish I was there.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Whoever.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:53,760
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:06,160
come on, come on, come on, come on come on, come on, come on, come on

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:39,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck. I'm going to fucking withdraws. Oh god. Oh fuck. I gotta put that

11
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:48,040
Give a better than occasional guest right into my veins. Oh god. Oh fuck.

12
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,920
Oh no. Hey everybody. Excuse me. Excuse me. What's going on? What's going on here?

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,480
You're all banned. You're all gone. You're all killed. It's 2018, Give. Nothing bad ever happened

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,920
ever. No. Get out. Get out. I'll attack you. I'll kill you. I killed Ben. This is the

15
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,960
announcement of the episode 300. Ben's dead. It's my show now. It's my show. It's Gib show.

16
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Yo. Oh hell yeah. Let's start. Let's just fucking. Fuck yes. Give. I really like this

17
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,240
comic you started. I think it's going places. Thank you. Oh you know what? You can stay.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,360
You're too kind. What a generous overboard. Money. YouTube dollars. See this is what happens

19
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,960
when a YouTube channel is run by a woman. They kill their co-host.

20
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,840
But they accept compliments. That's the that's what happens. Let me check all that city.

21
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,760
Should we be already recording? I mean Craig's recording right now.

22
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:26,920
Craig was recording so it's fine. I don't trust Craig. I'm recording. I'm recording right now.

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't trust him. I'm sorry about my recording in a second.

24
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:43,560
Well you know it's a nice year 2018. Wait when did the PCP started? 2016? Was it before that?

25
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh yes. I forgot. It was very late. It was late 2050 and it was right at the end of 2050.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,720
Yes. Let me check. It was one or two episodes in the year. The PCP outlasted Trump. That's funny.

27
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,640
Oh yeah. First episode. So December 2015. Hey Ben. It's me. What the fuck Ben? I killed you.

28
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,360
I stabbed you. I saw you die. She did. You wish. It's a guess like a girl boss.

29
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,360
Oh no. That was your ninja clone jutsu. It was just a log.

30
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,280
It was just a log that appeared in a poof of smoke. I know you've just been waiting

31
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,320
until the day that I die and you can take over the PCP. Damn it. It was my big plan.

32
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,320
You'll curl claw this PCP for my cold dead hands. But instead of a log it's a

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,280
even the whip blurry. Yeah. Instead of a log it's the lord of ghosts. I can't hear anything.

34
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,720
We're all on left. That's because Gabe stabbed you in the ear so that's why you can't hear anything.

35
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,200
Can we invite like CMC and pretend like he's Jesse?

36
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,520
We need Jesse. I think we're fine. We've got Jeff, we've got Monkey, we've got Nate.

37
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,680
Who can be mage? Like Gamer's Tavern? No.

38
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,720
No. Yeah, that sounds about right.

39
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh, Lumia, it feels made to Jason. Oh god. That is true. Where is Tom Oliver can come back and play the boo.

40
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,600
That's great. That's great. Perfect casting.

41
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:46,200
Okay, I'm going to take this opportunity to pee. I'm going to also pee.

42
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,520
Don't do it, guys. Wake up at 1am for this and you two need to pee.

43
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,360
Just pee in a cup. Just pee on stream.

44
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah, 1am then.

45
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,160
1am waking up in the morning. Gotta be fresh. Gotta go downstairs.

46
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,560
Gotta have my ball. Gotta have cereal. I'm pretending to be Monkey Jones.

47
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,040
Okay, I'm trying to think of like what Monkey sounds like and my first thought in my head was

48
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,000
like Jacksepticeye's intro where he does the whip crack and he's like, what top of the morning to you?

49
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,360
And I'm like, that's not... I've never heard Jacksepticeye's intro.

50
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,920
Oh, you got it. Let me get the... Oh, you haven't lived. You haven't lived.

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,560
She's not wrong. She's not wrong. I watched the beginning of a Monkey video before I showed up

52
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,360
and it's like, hey, everybody, it's me, Monkey Jones. So it sounds like it's...

53
00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:01,880
It's Monkey Jones here. I'm fresh out of... I'm fresh out of fucks to give and I'm ready to rape you.

54
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,080
That's what he says, right?

55
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,840
You know what? I think we should recast Ben as Monkey and I should pay Ben.

56
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,160
All right, all right, this is a video. You should just watch this video.

57
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,200
Oh, god. Come at the morning.

58
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,720
Okay. I think I've seen this one. Oh my god. Fucking rape my ears.

59
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,400
I need to make a version of this with, like, all of the...

60
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,600
Hello and welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast and have that be the intro.

61
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,640
You need to make one with the...

62
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,560
Is that the bite of 87?

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,840
It's the bite of 87. It's always the bite of 87.

64
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,360
I need to grab, like, 100 episodes of the PCPs and, like, put all of them in one audacity and,

65
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,760
like, have them aligned where Nate says, hello and welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast

66
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,840
and then it's just incomprehensible noise on either side of that.

67
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,840
Why don't you make a noise album or radio oblivion?

68
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,680
You know you want to.

69
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,400
Who's oblivion?

70
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Can you make a noise album already, Jeff?

71
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
Now you want to.

72
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,040
Yeah. If algorithm... I don't know what Jeff means.

73
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,360
I just know he's a money machine.

74
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,920
I was, um...

75
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,280
I was, um...

76
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,320
He's the paper's gone.

77
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
I was editing the, uh...

78
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,200
I was editing the documentary yesterday.

79
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,400
It's so fucking weird that Jeff is in there.

80
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,320
He's just walking around.

81
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,480
Just walking around.

82
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,280
Documentary?

83
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,560
Yeah, Radcom the Documentary from the Blu-rays.

84
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,160
Oh, shit.

85
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah.

86
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,560
I guess I should mention, uh...

87
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,800
Yeah, I'm, uh...

88
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920
I'm gonna put...

89
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,760
Along with the 300 episode, I'm gonna put out, yeah, Radcom the Documentary.

90
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,320
There's no, like, ending.

91
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,160
It's just, like, random footage.

92
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,000
It just ends at no particular point.

93
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,080
Uh...

94
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,880
It's just, like, two hours of random footage from Radcom, too.

95
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,880
Oh, my God.

96
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Yeah.

97
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,520
Oh, and I guess, uh...

98
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,120
I'm gonna put out that along with episode 300.

99
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,240
And I think, Gib, I think we're gonna do a commentary, right?

100
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,320
We're gonna do a commentated version.

101
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,720
Are we?

102
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,200
With all the slur...

103
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,720
Yeah!

104
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,360
With all the slur...

105
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,240
With all the slurs.

106
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,080
Unedited.

107
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,320
No.

108
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,760
Well, the private version.

109
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,480
Private version.

110
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm taking them out.

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,080
I'm cutting that out of the public release.

112
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,680
Of course.

113
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,080
It's not the...

114
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,720
It just ends.

115
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,920
I don't know.

116
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,800
It's, like...

117
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,400
I think Victor edited it, but it's just, like, random footage.

118
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,880
And there's no point.

119
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
There's no, like...

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,360
There's no start.

121
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,880
You just end it.

122
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,200
It starts...

123
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,120
It starts like it's gonna go somewhere.

124
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,440
It starts like there's gonna be a point to it.

125
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,360
Like, it's gonna tell a story.

126
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,160
And then the footage just becomes, like...

127
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
It's just random things that happened up until, I think, you know...

128
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,680
Jeff arrives, and then Jesse arrives.

129
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,960
And then it's like, well, we're all here.

130
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,760
And then we were just, like, fucking around in the living room.

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,400
And then that's the end of the documentary.

132
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
That's exactly what the PCP is.

133
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,840
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,280
You just end with a fade into black and say a text that says,

135
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,640
and nothing bad ever happened.

136
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,920
That's such a good idea, Nate.

137
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,840
They made so much content.

138
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,320
And everyone was content with the content.

139
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,120
And it was fine.

140
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,120
Just to check, let me see how many episodes of the PCP I've ate.

141
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,920
Gotta be...

142
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,680
Is it 100?

143
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,040
It's probably less than 100, right?

144
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,840
Oh my god, no, it's more than 100.

145
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,640
Are you serious?

146
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,400
I started with Christian Minecraft and Soup.

147
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
I guess we should talk about this on the episode.

148
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,360
I'm recording already.

149
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,880
Is everyone else recording?

150
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
Yeah, I'm recording.

151
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,880
I said when I was recording.

152
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,520
Recording.

153
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,080
Recording.

154
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, Craig is recording.

155
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,720
It's recording, all right.

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,520
Just notice.

157
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,480
They uploaded to Spotify the rooftop performance of the Beatles from Get Back.

158
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,240
And to listen to that.

159
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,760
Sometimes I forget that you and Lane had huge Beatles heads.

160
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,440
I used to be an Amos swan's head.

161
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,040
You should listen to swans, each one.

162
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,320
Yeah, it's a funny guy screaming.

163
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,520
If I wanted to listen to that, Elisa, I'd listen to the PCP.

164
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,960
Cute laugh track.

165
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,520
A funny guy's creamy.

166
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:52,760
Yeah.

167
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,440
That's he then.

168
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,400
You're the funny guy.

169
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,560
Although keep in mind, the Beatles do scream a lot.

170
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,680
You know, I just, I just...

171
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,960
I saw, I had a little bit of a panic attack when I looked at the chat and I saw Jeff and

172
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,320
Mumkey and Nate in here.

173
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,040
But now I realize, I'm looking again and I'm like, oh wait, it's that picture of Mumkey.

174
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,480
Yes.

175
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,720
Wait, where's...

176
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,320
Is that really the picture from the sextet?

177
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,200
Yes, it is.

178
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,680
Yeah.

179
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:24,760
Yeah.

180
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,480
Oh my God.

181
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,120
I've seen it.

182
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,840
I've seen it.

183
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,480
I've seen it.

184
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,360
It's so weird.

185
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,840
It feels weird.

186
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,120
I haven't seen it.

187
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,080
And I...

188
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,520
It's very strange.

189
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,720
I mean, whatever.

190
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,440
It's pretty funny.

191
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,680
I don't feel that.

192
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,160
I don't feel bad laughing because he filmed it on purpose.

193
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
So, like...

194
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,480
I mean, yeah.

195
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,160
Yeah, it's, it's, yeah.

196
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't feel, I don't feel bad.

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,280
But when you record it, it's very...

198
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,960
When you record something like that, you're like, need to expect this.

199
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,200
It is going to get leaked.

200
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,600
Only if you're a public figure.

201
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:57,960
Yeah.

202
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,080
All right.

203
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:06,360
It could have been, that could have been me, that could have been me having sex with that

204
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,520
furry pedophile, if only, if only the dice of history had landed a little differently.

205
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,160
To see that you needed to be with sheep over first.

206
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,480
You need to be with someone who treated you well.

207
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,520
So, so you'd be sick of them and treat them bad.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,640
If only.

209
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,640
Okay.

210
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
So, is this the episode?

211
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,720
Have we started?

212
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,280
I started.

213
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,240
I didn't think we had.

214
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,880
I thought this was...

215
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,360
I thought you saying you killed Ben was a cold open.

216
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,800
That could go right at the beginning and then Ben could appear and I like that part.

217
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,240
That could go that open at the beginning.

218
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,920
Well, I'm recording.

219
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,880
So, fuck it.

220
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
I am recording.

221
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Let's sync.

222
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,600
Okay.

223
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,520
On the count of three, say sync.

224
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,440
One, two, three, sync.

225
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,000
Sync.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,560
Sync.

227
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,640
One, two, three, sync.

228
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,120
Sync.

229
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,200
Sync.

230
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,680
Sync.

231
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,000
Hello.

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
I'm the nostalgia critic.

233
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,680
And this is the Procrastinators podcast.

234
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,600
The podcast that thinks racism is good and civil rights are bad.

235
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,040
I'm Ben Sane.

236
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,600
And this is everyone else.

237
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,840
What's going on?

238
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Nothing.

239
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,480
Just episode 300 of a show that we're in.

240
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,160
This is 300.

241
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,360
Hello, it's me, Jeff.

242
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,280
I read the algorithm and it said,

243
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,120
I should come on to the PCP for big YouTube money.

244
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,640
Jeff sitting in his pondering chamber

245
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,200
observing the algorithm like his wizard's orb,

246
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,600
just reading the signs and the tea leaves.

247
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,960
Somebody else go.

248
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,840
Hey, it's me, Monkey Jones, freshly reborn from Nate's Busy

249
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,040
and ready to take a hold of my personal responsibility.

250
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,680
Oh, my God, he's monkey.

251
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, I didn't see him there.

252
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
I hope you like that impression.

253
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm not doing it again.

254
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,440
It's Monkey Jones here.

255
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,240
I had to commit a real life school shooting.

256
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Hey, it's Monkey Jones.

257
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,720
It's a school shooting.

258
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,520
I mean, I'm taking a camera into the girl's bathroom.

259
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,480
It's me, Monkey Jones here to commit real life sex crimes.

260
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,320
Let's let's get into it.

261
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,960
Shall we put some typo?

262
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,840
And it's me, Nate.

263
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,080
Today we're going to talk about personal responsibility.

264
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,320
Personal fucking responsibility.

265
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,800
It's going to be a five hour podcast of that.

266
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,720
You can't believe like you can fix poverty

267
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,560
just by telling people that it's their fault, but they're poor.

268
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,280
Yeah.

269
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,240
It's really amazing.

270
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,560
Jeff.

271
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,240
I can't believe you can fix suicidality

272
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,200
by cheating on your girlfriend with a pedophile.

273
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,600
Oh, Jeff, you and your lib, you and your libcuck ways,

274
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,240
you and your, you probably voted for Hillary

275
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,760
because your sex worker girlfriend told you to.

276
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,680
Fuck you.

277
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,360
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

278
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,440
Yeah.

279
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,160
Actually, you fucker, you got me.

280
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,520
I know.

281
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,120
Die.

282
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,080
Oh, fuck, Jeff's dead.

283
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,960
Shit.

284
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,360
Darn.

285
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,520
Now, now what'll I do?

286
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,320
Now what big money connections will I use

287
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,000
to get ahead in the YouTube game?

288
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,200
This is stupid.

289
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,640
I know it's stupid.

290
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,280
I know.

291
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,360
Jeff's dead.

292
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,240
Oblivion Falls here.

293
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,760
Hello, welcome to the PC.

294
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,800
Wow, it's Oblivion Falls.

295
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,680
I prefer that person.

296
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,360
Oh, shit.

297
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

298
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,360
Is that Seachole?

299
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,800
Oh, yeah.

300
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,760
Seachole?

301
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,320
I like Seachole.

302
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh my god.

303
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,400
I broke, I broke through the shell that was monkey Jones.

304
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,920
I split myself out of his organs and now I am here.

305
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,640
I've killed him.

306
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,600
You are all saved.

307
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,160
Thank god.

308
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,640
Praise him.

309
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,080
That's me, Elia, Sardator of the BCP.

310
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,000
Elia, is I the editor of the pro?

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
Pressnators is here.

312
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Dude, that guy's famous.

313
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,120
Are you guys hungover?

314
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,920
I'm hungover.

315
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,960
I feel terrible.

316
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,440
No.

317
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:18,920
Oh, no.

318
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,400
What happened?

319
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,920
You drunk alcohol?

320
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,520
Why are you drinking alcohol?

321
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,560
Tragically, I did.

322
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,320
Tragically, I didn't buy a bottle.

323
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,440
My, well, my good friend John, a.k.a.

324
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:37,000
D'Wubo, invited me over for a Friday game night and I bought a beer and I drank it.

325
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,920
And I guess, and I guess I, you know, I was too, you know what?

326
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,200
I was just too demure.

327
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,960
I was too like, I was, I was so focused on making a good impression and being polite

328
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,040
in polite company that I was like, no, no, no, I can't, I can't drink water.

329
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,200
I must not drink water from the tap to prevent a hangover.

330
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,600
Yeah.

331
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,680
So now here I am dehydrated and in agony.

332
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,000
And that's, and that's just how it goes sometimes.

333
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,800
Why not drink water?

334
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,840
That's so silly.

335
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,080
I told you why because I wanted to make a good impression on polite company.

336
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,640
What would they have thought if they had saw me drinking water?

337
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,200
They would have thought you didn't want to be a hangover.

338
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,560
They would have shaken their head and said, what an filthy animal, filthy animal.

339
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,240
Why he might as well be drinking, he might as well be drinking it directly out of an

340
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,680
outhouse latrine.

341
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:29,880
No.

342
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,880
That you would think it's bad to drink water.

343
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,040
I don't want people to think badly of me.

344
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,880
No, he thinks it's bad to drink water from the tap specifically.

345
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,320
These, these friends that I've known for years and years, if they saw me drinking water,

346
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,600
they would, they would, they would lose all their respect for me.

347
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,880
They don't sound like very good friends when you put it that way, Ben.

348
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,520
You know what?

349
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,080
You're right.

350
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,960
Fuck those guys.

351
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,720
Damn.

352
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,480
I was hungover on Saturday because instead of sleeping, I was in the pronoun server

353
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,040
watching Dog Day Afternoon, which is an amazing movie.

354
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,840
It's about Al Pacino robbing a bank to get money for his wife to get a sex change.

355
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,240
Uh, it's from the 70s.

356
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,400
It's a great movie I recommend it.

357
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,240
Like, like a trans woman, like his wife is a, is a, is an MTF and wants a sex change.

358
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,080
Yeah.

359
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,400
Neat.

360
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,200
The head of it, the head of its time.

361
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
And it's like from like 75 the movie.

362
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,520
So it's like, it really is a hit of the time.

363
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800
Damn, be gay, do crimes.

364
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,720
Is she like a prostitute?

365
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,600
Is he like falling, falling in love with a prostitute?

366
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,640
And it's like, I'm going to get you as that sex change I always wanted and then we're going

367
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
to run away to Mexico together.

368
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,720
Oh no.

369
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,560
No, they run to Wyoming.

370
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,680
Okay, that's good.

371
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
That's good too, I guess.

372
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,000
I watched a movie.

373
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,640
Tragically, I watched a film this, this week.

374
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,200
Oh my god.

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,480
I know.

376
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,200
I never do that.

377
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,640
The story is I saw, I saw a random tweet that was like, hey, it was a random tweet

378
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,080
in appreciation of some filmmaker who had made two movies before dying at the age of 39.

379
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,160
And it said both.

380
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,400
Both of this guy's movies are on some fucking streaming service.

381
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,280
I think I still have the tab open.

382
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,280
Wait, the streaming service is...

383
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,640
Tooby.

384
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,680
Tooby.

385
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,720
And it was like...

386
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,360
Tooby.

387
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,560
Yeah, T-U-B-I.

388
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,240
And this guy made two movies.

389
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,280
One is called Night Vision and the other is called Mind Killer.

390
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,360
And I was like, fuck it.

391
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,120
And I went and I watched Mind Killer.

392
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
And it was okay.

393
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,560
It was bad.

394
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,320
But I guess it had some charm to it.

395
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,680
It had some things that I liked.

396
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,480
I liked the nerdy friend side character who liked to howl like a coyote.

397
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,120
He was charming.

398
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,880
It's about a nerdy weirdo who has no success with women

399
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,480
and watches like pickup artists' self-help videos.

400
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:27,000
He works at a library and he finds a manuscript that teaches him

401
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,760
concentration exercises to unlock the power of the mind.

402
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:37,880
And it turns him into like a psychic genius and he becomes like a sociopath freak.

403
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,600
Who like controls women's minds to fuck them.

404
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,200
I'm looking at the poster of the movie.

405
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,160
And this looked like when I ate the PCP.

406
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,840
Hold on, I don't even know what the poster looks like.

407
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,360
They should have called the movies Night Killer and Mind Division.

408
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,640
Hold on.

409
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,120
Hold on.

410
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,840
I gotta see this.

411
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,480
That Rubik's Cube sucks.

412
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,760
I gotta see this shit for myself.

413
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,880
Is that only three colors?

414
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,360
In general.

415
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:03,880
It is.

416
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
It's a three-color Rubik's Cube.

417
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,640
Wow, this poster actually is exactly what the movie is like.

418
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
This is exactly what it's like.

419
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Warren's brain is out of his...

420
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,440
Ew.

421
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,480
You know what?

422
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,160
In hindsight, this movie ruled.

423
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,520
This is a great film.

424
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,040
Looking at this poster, I'm like, hell yeah.

425
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,960
This is what March Simpson looks like.

426
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,360
I feel like I'm gonna say...

427
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,040
This is like a thing that like an idiot...

428
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,680
This is like a thing that an idiot would say to sound...

429
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,280
But think they sounded smart.

430
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,440
And other idiots would think, wow, this guy's really smart.

431
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,680
The appeal of this movie was not so much in the monster

432
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,840
and in the special effects and in the horror.

433
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,040
It was about the characters.

434
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,600
You know, it was about the characters really.

435
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,440
It was about getting invested in their characters.

436
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,840
And then only then did the fear and the terror

437
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,960
presented by the creature and the horrific scenario,

438
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,520
you know, impact one emotionally.

439
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
When one was already invested in the drama

440
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,880
of these characters and their lives,

441
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,960
much like a film ought to do, right?

442
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,920
Wow.

443
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,400
Yeah.

444
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,600
Sounds like at the end of every nostalgic critic review

445
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,920
where he gets serious and he actually reviews the movie.

446
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,600
This episode of the Road Runner, the Coyotean Road Runner,

447
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,160
it says so much with just a desert road

448
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,160
and a rock dropped off of a cliff.

449
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,920
It really shows the dichotomy between men, you know,

450
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,040
a wolf and a road runner.

451
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,440
It's a coyote.

452
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
Yeah, same diff.

453
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,280
No.

454
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,160
Well, cool.

455
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,280
I didn't watch a film.

456
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,760
Good.

457
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:55,880
Don't.

458
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,640
So I will never speak of such things.

459
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,040
Don't waste your life like I did watching one movie.

460
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,520
While you were studying...

461
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,560
It's 90 minutes.

462
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,520
I'll never get back.

463
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,440
While you were watching simple media made by artists that suck.

464
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,560
He sucks so much, he's literally dead now.

465
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,200
He died at 39.

466
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,000
I was studying.

467
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,560
Just like you will when I get through with you.

468
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,720
In many years time.

469
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,120
Yeah, in nine years or so.

470
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,960
11 years.

471
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,080
Right, okay.

472
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,640
Close enough.

473
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:45,400
I've been getting really into ancient history and geography and stuff

474
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,040
because springing off of my world building sort of interest,

475
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,360
building maps and stuff and mountains and being like,

476
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,400
oh, lore, you know, like how do I make lore?

477
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,040
How do I make a lore of like ancient civilizations

478
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,200
that rose and fell and wars they had?

479
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,320
Oh, I'll look at history.

480
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,080
And now I'm just into history videos.

481
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,120
I know why you've been looking into this stuff and I'm surprised.

482
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,680
I'm surprised that you've delved deeply into it, I guess is what I'm...

483
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,640
Wait, you know why?

484
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,800
Partly, yeah.

485
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,640
I don't know if I can say it without spoiling stuff.

486
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
Maybe you're thinking of something else.

487
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,640
Maybe I am thinking of something else.

488
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,480
My secret project.

489
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,200
Isn't this stuff involved with like your secret project and the backstory for it?

490
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,560
Yes, yes, a little bit.

491
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,600
A little bit, okay.

492
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,720
I just think it's cool.

493
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,400
I just think it's neat that like, you know, things happened

494
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
and people wrote it down so we can learn about it.

495
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,680
Dude, people had cats and...

496
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,480
It's just so novel that I can read like letters

497
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,960
I can read funny lines on a page or hear them spoken by a person

498
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,200
and like get a sense of stuff that was happening before I was born.

499
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,120
Isn't that crazy?

500
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,640
Like the Beatles?

501
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,720
Yeah, there's kind of still alive.

502
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,840
I can walk around in Colombia in Bioshock Infinite

503
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,440
and I can pick up little record tapes and play them and people say,

504
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,120
hey, and people say, hello, everybody, welcome to the Procrastinator's podcast.

505
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,600
You can listen to podcast episodes.

506
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,200
You can find on little tapes that people left scattered around the wreckage of the former world.

507
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,920
Like an annoying like secret.

508
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Like you've got like this big open world like fallout or whatever

509
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,000
and the logs are entire episodes of the Procrastinator's podcast.

510
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,480
And then like four hours later, you're still playing the game,

511
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,160
listening to this thing I'm like...

512
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,360
I think when Phantom's Revenge is done,

513
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,600
I think I'll have to start work on a new game that is just a walk around like world.

514
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,720
It's just a post-apocalyptic walking simulator.

515
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,560
There's no combat, nothing happens.

516
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:20,520
You just walk around and you pick up audio logs that are just all 300 episodes of the PCP.

517
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,360
And you piece together the wreckage of the old world.

518
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,960
You should make that game.

519
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,840
Like in 200 years from now, in 200 years from now,

520
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,240
it would be the younger video game Nerdmeme.

521
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,400
It's like, hey, wanna listen to some tunes?

522
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,960
Hello, it's the piece, the Procrastinator's podcast.

523
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,200
What you should do is you could put them on little tapes

524
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,360
and then spread them out in the real world.

525
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,080
And then they'll be like a weird mystery that people will freak out about.

526
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,000
The literal lust tapes.

527
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,720
I like that.

528
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,000
And then we archive the PCP.

529
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,280
I mean, I have a burner.

530
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,640
I have dick.

531
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,920
Those discs could be cheap.

532
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,240
One episode of the PCP would probably fit on...

533
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,040
It'd be pretty small, right?

534
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,800
It'd be a pretty small file.

535
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,440
You could fit that out.

536
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,800
As an audio file, yeah.

537
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,640
It wouldn't have to use...

538
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,320
Yeah, it's like an MP3.

539
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,160
It wouldn't have to use a whole 50 gigabyte Blu-ray disc.

540
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,640
I could just use some fucking like four gig.

541
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Some four gig shitty CD, yeah.

542
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:27,880
No problem.

543
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,400
I mean, I was thinking of literal cassette tapes, but I can't.

544
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,640
But nobody has a player for those anymore.

545
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,760
No, no, no.

546
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,400
Exactly, only true chats can actually listen to them.

547
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,440
Wait, I should just leave them around on the USB thumb drives.

548
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,600
Just leave them scattered around in garbage cans.

549
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,480
Leave them scattered in garbage cans for civil waste municipal sanitation workers

550
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,120
to find.

551
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,240
Only the big market for the PCP is garbage men who find it in trash cans scattered

552
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,200
around Boston, Massachusetts.

553
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I can guarantee no garbage man actually.

554
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:14,200
You could look at the waveform and then film the waveform with an old timey camera

555
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:21,320
and then make a film real of the waveform that people will have to look at and then

556
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,960
decode and turn it into audio so they can listen to it.

557
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,920
There's like a skill floor.

558
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,520
A skill floor for listening.

559
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,120
You know, and they get like arguments about Final Fantasy and Pokemon as the reward.

560
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,200
Do you know about the Boyager, the gold disc that they send to

561
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,640
space for the Martians to find?

562
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,640
The what they send?

563
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,800
Not Martians, just anyone.

564
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,480
Aliens, just aliens in general.

565
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,760
It's like they send a satellite into space just to travel around the whole galaxy with a gold disc.

566
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh, does it with the little plaque on it that has those things that they hope will be decodable

567
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,600
and understandable by anyone?

568
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,080
Yeah, they should send another one with PCP episodes on it.

569
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,040
No, I don't think.

570
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,600
I think they've suffered enough being aliens and all.

571
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,800
Talking about.

572
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,600
Where's Ben?

573
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,080
Ben died.

574
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,080
Ben did die.

575
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,760
We're talking about ancient history.

576
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,080
I watched this video, just the archaeology I swear to explain.

577
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,240
That was that was a really interesting theory that I found there that I don't know if you

578
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,800
know this kind of statues are very famous.

579
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Oh, I've seen that statue.

580
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,000
We've talked about this stupid thing.

581
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,880
I hate this thing.

582
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,280
Why do you hate it?

583
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,160
It is ugly.

584
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,440
Yeah, look at it.

585
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,960
Why do you hate it?

586
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,360
I hate it for the same reason I hate you.

587
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,160
It's ugly.

588
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,040
Oh my fucking god.

589
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,760
Typical white male opinion.

590
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,160
I know, right?

591
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
This is the right thing to say.

592
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,800
What's ugly about her?

593
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,520
There was a theory that's like.

594
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,240
Got no face.

595
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,520
She looks she's basically she's basically been saying look at that cap.

596
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,720
She's pulled it so down low.

597
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,320
It's just like Ben's saying.

598
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,040
It's just too close to home.

599
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,080
It hits too close to home.

600
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,640
That's why you have to lash out.

601
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,160
You can't you can't handle it in the video.

602
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
There's the theory of why they look like that.

603
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,400
And it's that since they had no mirrors,

604
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,640
they just like look below their bodies and that's how they saw their bodies.

605
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,720
So that's how they that's the best.

606
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,520
Tarbuck transom said the same thing in a voicemail.

607
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,360
Stupidest fucking thing I ever heard.

608
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,640
That was making sense.

609
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,080
Just look at another human being.

610
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,040
Yeah, yeah.

611
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,440
Yeah, I know why they look like that.

612
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,040
It's because back in the day,

613
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,320
there was a prehistoric oblivion full who needed to make people

614
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,680
with fat tits.

615
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,560
That's all about them hips.

616
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,760
It's all about them titties.

617
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,120
It's all about that little chub.

618
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,680
You need that.

619
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,160
Yeah, that's what that's about.

620
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,240
That weird like hoof foot mess at the bottom there.

621
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,280
Feed a hug.

622
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,400
I'll tell you what that's up.

623
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Have you ever noticed that like 50% of porn artists just never draw feet?

624
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,920
The image always comes off at the ankle.

625
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,320
I have noticed that.

626
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,520
And I always find it to be.

627
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,880
All artists never draw feet.

628
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,680
They just cut them off.

629
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,560
It's it's so much easier and I hate it.

630
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,760
But I also I'm like, I guess if I want to draw more often,

631
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,320
I should I should take shortcuts where nobody cares.

632
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,000
Nobody actually wants to see the except specific feet people.

633
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,720
That's exactly it.

634
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,600
I mean, like that's what you do in life in everything you do.

635
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,200
You got to be like, how can I what's the cheapest way I can do this?

636
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,360
The easiest possible way so I can do so I can do more of it.

637
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,000
The only reason Quentin Tarantino shows the feed is because he's like,

638
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,280
look, I'm not taking shortcuts.

639
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,600
See you.

640
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,520
He didn't saw off their feet to make the access cheaper.

641
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:59,640
You know, speaking of fertility goddesses, this month I came up with Febubrary.

642
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,800
Hashtag Febubrary, which is rolls right off the tongue.

643
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,000
It rolls right off the page, not off the tongue.

644
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,840
You can't say it, but you can read it.

645
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:17,480
Um, and I'm like, I wanted to draw more like titillating imagery

646
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,560
because I just need practice in that.

647
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,600
And I like the idea of being good at that.

648
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,600
And that's what I'm doing this month.

649
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,560
It's a gimmick art month, just like many other gimmick art months

650
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,160
where you do something every day for a month.

651
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,040
And I'm drawing a boob every day, kind of sort of.

652
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,320
I'm putting it on Twitter.

653
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,440
How's this for a gimmick month?

654
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,040
Uh, hold on.

655
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,320
January, February, March.

656
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,680
How about ape, uh, ape, ape, live April?

657
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,560
How about April live real where I just am alive?

658
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,280
I just live for every, every day.

659
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,400
I just live in a hole all day every day.

660
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,040
Oh, sounds like a hustle.

661
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,240
30 times a month.

662
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,680
I, I like April where in April you draw ape.

663
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,840
Just draw apes.

664
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,760
It's too, in 2022 it's a little, it's a little NFT adjacent.

665
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,440
It makes me a little uncomfortable.

666
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,920
But they do be monkeys though.

667
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,960
They do be monkeys though, but, but they just,

668
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,120
you know, it's, if it's ape adjacent, it's just, it's just,

669
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,240
there's something, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?

670
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,320
It's too, I don't know.

671
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,120
Make an active effort to co-op the apes back from the NFT bros.

672
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,640
And I steal that property.

673
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,920
They love so much.

674
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,760
We do have to reclaim.

675
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,040
We have to reclaim the apes.

676
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,320
You know what I haven't, you know what?

677
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,960
I haven't seen a lazy lion in months.

678
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,720
Everyone forgot about lazy lions.

679
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,040
Oh my gosh.

680
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,160
The apes are still around.

681
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,760
The apes are the ones that everyone knows,

682
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,280
but the lions are gone.

683
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,920
So that's cool.

684
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,240
I, I, I unfortunately was, I was approached by someone

685
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,960
who, they were really desperate to message me.

686
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,000
They pledged to my Patreon.

687
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,080
They tried every avenue to be like,

688
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,000
hey oblivion, oblivion, I've got an idea.

689
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,720
I've got an idea.

690
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,440
It's going to be big.

691
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,960
It's you, you're going to want to do it.

692
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,120
It'll, it'll be bigger when it comes on.

693
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,560
It'll be the biggest thing ever, please.

694
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,440
I have such a good idea.

695
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,800
And I'm like, I, I didn't get back to him for a month

696
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,360
because I was like, I had just caught COVID

697
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,720
around the time I saw their messages.

698
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,400
And I'm like, I'm a fucking bleh.

699
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,000
And then they unplugged my Patreon.

700
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,960
So I'm like, I'll, I'll get back to you later.

701
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,680
Eventually message them on Discord.

702
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,360
Turns out they're just an ideas man.

703
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,000
And I mean, okay, they want to get the ideas good.

704
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,520
They didn't give me specific ideas for what their idea was.

705
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,720
So I'm like, I don't know.

706
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,480
How can I know if this is worth my time?

707
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,800
But I checked again the next day and they have since then

708
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,920
now have a fucking monkey profile picture.

709
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,120
And it, there's a little Discord verified sticker next to it.

710
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,240
And I'm just like, oof.

711
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,960
I'm a little, I mean, you say they're an ideas man.

712
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,720
Like what did they, what did they want?

713
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,400
I don't know.

714
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,720
They're like, it's going to be the next come zone.

715
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,320
What's going to be the next come zone?

716
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:01,560
What?

717
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,960
I don't know.

718
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,920
They have ideas apparently.

719
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,960
What are you talking about?

720
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,680
Like, do they have lyrics?

721
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,600
Do they have, what do they have?

722
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,160
I don't know.

723
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,440
I mean, I don't know.

724
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,520
Well, what did they expect you to do before they would explain it?

725
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,240
Did they say, like, give me your bank account information

726
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,520
and I'll tell you all about it?

727
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,560
Like, what would they say?

728
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,480
I don't know.

729
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,640
Look, when I make my Discord, like my Patreon Discord,

730
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,160
I will let them join.

731
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,880
And, and if they want to like explain it forever,

732
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,680
like I'll hear them out because it's possible they'll have an idea.

733
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,880
And I'll be like, oh yeah, that sounds fun.

734
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,760
Maybe I do want to do that.

735
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,640
But like, currently I have, I don't know.

736
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,040
Oblivion, I have a great idea.

737
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,240
It's possible the sun won't rise tomorrow as well.

738
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,200
Yeah.

739
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,920
Yeah, hear me out, Billy.

740
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,040
It's going to be the next come zone.

741
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,000
It's going to be the next come zone.

742
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,880
This idea is so great.

743
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,440
Are you ready?

744
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,120
Yeah.

745
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,600
Okay.

746
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,160
So, Fed Boop Worry, right?

747
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,720
Oh my God.

748
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,280
We just do that on the PCP, on the PCP, on the draw cast with Giv.

749
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,560
Oh yeah.

750
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,760
We give on, we do one of the short quick episodes of Fed Boop Worry.

751
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,400
Okay.

752
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,960
What about this?

753
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,680
We should do an episode that isn't tits and ass, it's just tits.

754
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,560
And then later, we can do an episode that's just ass, you know?

755
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,120
Hell yeah.

756
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,160
What about, oh yeah, we'll do an episode called Top Heavy

757
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,840
and then we can do another one called Bottom Heavy.

758
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,720
What about, what about?

759
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,480
What about July?

760
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,400
A month where every day I say I'm going to do something but I don't do it.

761
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,240
Wait, what?

762
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,520
Listen, listen, if I didn't-

763
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,880
July, July, a month where every day I say I'm going to draw something but it's a lie

764
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,400
and I don't do anything.

765
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,600
Sorry, I was thinking of an alternative spelling then.

766
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,080
Yeah.

767
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,080
I feel like that would encourage certain individuals that I know to get on my back

768
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,360
about certain things.

769
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,120
Okay, okay, I didn't even think of that.

770
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,240
I was just, I was just thinking.

771
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,600
Wait, how did you not think of that?

772
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,360
That was a great, that was a great, like funny joke that you just did.

773
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,040
Max, you would have been so proud of you, you know, before he died in the war.

774
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,720
I was just going for the lie part of it.

775
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,440
I don't know.

776
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,320
Listen, I don't see, I don't see color.

777
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,560
Unlike whoopie gold, unlike whoopie Goldberg, I don't dehumanize the Jews

778
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,000
by calling them white.

779
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,400
All right.

780
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,480
Elias are eight that out.

781
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,880
You always heard of that out.

782
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,240
My God.

783
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,240
Definitely.

784
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,440
If it was for Madrakas, I would have fucking bleeped that whole thing.

785
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,360
You would, you would just cut it.

786
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:32,840
You would have just straight up cut it.

787
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,480
When are we going to make the Garfield episode?

788
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,360
Oh yeah, you want to do another Garfield episode?

789
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,560
I mean, we did one already.

790
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,160
No, we did one.

791
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,280
It was just a comic jam.

792
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,400
Yeah, we need, we need a Garfield episode.

793
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,440
That's just Garfield.

794
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,440
How about Garfield boob?

795
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,680
No, no, no, no, no.

796
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,160
Wait.

797
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,720
Arlene's a pretty, is a sexy, sexy cat.

798
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh, fuck that cat.

799
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,360
I'd fuck that, I'd fuck that cat for a dollar.

800
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,160
Oh my God.

801
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,400
You just reminded me.

802
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,520
Have you seen this meme?

803
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,400
It's awful.

804
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,440
It's so bad, huh?

805
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,280
I have to pull this up.

806
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,800
Apparently it's from 2017, but I never heard of it to now.

807
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,360
It's a brick and roll.

808
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,720
Creative, it's like normal people versus creative people.

809
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,280
Oh, the dragon, the dragon cooking the turkey.

810
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,000
The dragon.

811
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,320
Oh no.

812
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,120
Yeah, yeah.

813
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,440
What?

814
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,400
Wait.

815
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,520
For creative people, it's like a dragon lives in their oven, cooking their fucking turkey.

816
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,040
Wait, what?

817
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,800
It's the person who said that.

818
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,200
It's the most boring individual I can imagine.

819
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,920
Bore on, yeah.

820
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,200
Creativity is Western fantasy and nothing else, yeah.

821
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,520
Yeah.

822
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,000
Like, I'm not like other girls, but just slightly different.

823
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,040
I'm not like,

824
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,560
I'm not like other girls.

825
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,400
When I play tennis, I think it's a sword instead of a racket.

826
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm not like other girls.

827
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,480
I watched Lord of the Rings.

828
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,440
That's it.

829
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,080
Yeah.

830
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,560
Yeah.

831
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,760
Are they Lord of the Rings?

832
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,160
Which one?

833
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,880
I'm not like other girls.

834
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,920
I'm not like other girls.

835
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,160
I have dissociative identity disorder.

836
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,120
I am a danger to myself and others.

837
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,760
I'm not.

838
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,120
I'm not like other girls.

839
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,760
I'm a boy.

840
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,160
Hold on, I found it.

841
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,280
Let me get these images up.

842
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,440
Wait, is it like that thing from The Little Prince

843
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,800
where grown people see a hat and a little kid see an elephant with a rope?

844
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,760
I mean, it looks like the elephant is underneath the hat.

845
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,960
You say an elephant with a rope and all I can think of is an elephant committing suicide.

846
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,720
Why would you put that inventory into my head?

847
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,920
Ordinary people, creative people, yes.

848
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,640
So apparently creative means you also have like bad eyesight, I guess.

849
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:55,160
This one, I saw, the original one is, you know, four different things.

850
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,520
It's not all dragons.

851
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,080
Creative people just can't do anything without thinking there's a dragon present.

852
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,520
Guys, this burning is crutch for the dragon.

853
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,640
I'm looking up the sky, but wouldn't it be great?

854
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,480
I was being fucking burned alive.

855
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
It's just the same drug.

856
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,760
This also was, oh god, there's one not included in that image.

857
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,720
That's like a fucking, when I saw this, I thought this was a parody.

858
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,520
Because I, well, first glance, I thought the the conclusion would be creative people just

859
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,480
want to fuck the cat, but it wasn't.

860
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,520
No, it was disappointing.

861
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,160
Ordinary people, because not that.

862
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,480
I don't like the dog, but really, what do we need him for?

863
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,360
This is okay.

864
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,320
I took matters into my own hands.

865
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,640
Oh my god, this is so awful.

866
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,480
I'm looking, okay, the original, the original one is so, it's almost as bad.

867
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,880
It's almost as bad as this like joke version.

868
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,160
So ordinary people see a purring cat, creative people imagine the cat is talking like it was in

869
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,240
like a cheesy DreamWorks film.

870
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
God of some kind.

871
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,160
This way, look at this one.

872
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,280
Look at this one.

873
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,640
Okay, ordinary people, water bear flower, creative people imagine like, what if my

874
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,480
flower was like a little bit bigger?

875
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,640
What if it was ever so slightly bigger than it actually is?

876
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,440
That flower was from Undertale.

877
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,560
Yeah.

878
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:47,000
Creative people wear a slightly like fit flowier dress and they dye their hair and they have

879
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,440
glasses and some and several necklaces.

880
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,720
Ordinary people just wear gray and they don't wear any necklaces at all.

881
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,960
If you look closely, you can see, you can see that the way they're pouring their water is more

882
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,440
like there's more force coming out.

883
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,480
So creative people care more about watering the plants.

884
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,600
Creative people care more about over watering their plants and then getting upset when their

885
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,320
plants are dead.

886
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:18,840
Just like the mom of the guy who created the mental like, unlock the power of the mind guy

887
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,680
in Mindkiller.

888
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,440
His mom was like crazy lady and she was like, don't overwater the plants.

889
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,640
There's all her fault.

890
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,560
The nurse is over watering the plants.

891
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,240
I'm going to lose my fucking mind.

892
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,040
That's what happened.

893
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,720
That's what happened in the movie.

894
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,920
In the movie I saw.

895
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:46,040
Dude, this is the guy we went and he was like, oh, you know, you know what I'm fucking talking about.

896
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,640
Oblivion is a great name.

897
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,680
The skeleton appears.

898
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,720
It's not even, it's not even creative people.

899
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,360
It's just like, what if it's instead of an ordinary day?

900
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,400
The skeleton appeared.

901
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,080
The skeleton.

902
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,320
I like how it's not a skeleton, it's a de-skeleton.

903
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,640
The one.

904
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,640
I'm going to steal that and use that elsewhere.

905
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,120
Thank you.

906
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,880
The skeleton appears as a, it's been going around.

907
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,480
I just ate a whole pint of Nick's Swedish chocolate ice cream and none of you even knew.

908
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,080
None of you even knew that I was eating while I was talking to you.

909
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,040
You fucking morons.

910
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,840
Okay.

911
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,720
In post.

912
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,440
Nimrods.

913
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,520
No, in post.

914
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,920
I'll just add like, sounds.

915
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,680
Look, Elias, I'll get some food.

916
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,280
I'll start eating and then you just take my audio of me eating and put it when Then was eating.

917
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
No, it'll be too sexual if you do that.

918
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:54,040
Elias R, put at the beginning of this episode, when I say the thing about the documentary,

919
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,880
the documentary, I have it open.

920
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,920
I went through, I watched Radcom the documentary.

921
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,040
I made a note of all of the slurs that need to come out.

922
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,680
There's about one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

923
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,600
There's about 10, there's 10 of them.

924
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,840
I'm going to edit those out.

925
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,400
Those are going to be, we're going to, we're going to commentate it.

926
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,720
We're going to put the, that's going to be Patreon.

927
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,240
Patreon bonus.

928
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,360
Patreon paying for slurs.

929
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,720
Paying for, yeah, well, yeah.

930
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,760
Well, basically, yeah.

931
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,640
Most people pay people not to be racist, but people pay you to be more racist.

932
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,360
I was a little bit, I was, you know, I was a little bit hopeful.

933
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,200
Okay, I'll admit, I'll admit to this.

934
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,800
I was a little bit hopeful that Jeff would say a slur and I would have to edit that out,

935
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,840
but he doesn't, because I know that that would bug him.

936
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,160
I know that that would bug him, but he did not on, not on camera anyway.

937
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,760
He didn't say any slurs on camera in the, in the documentary.

938
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,560
So good for him.

939
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,120
I may, no, I said the R word.

940
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,200
I said the R word one time in the documentary.

941
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,800
I'm not going to cut that.

942
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,480
I'm not going to cut that out, but I'll bleep it.

943
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,200
I'll bleep the R word if you, if they haven't said it a few times.

944
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,280
What's the R word on the PCP?

945
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:12,040
Like, you know, you know, retarded, the, the, the, the retarded word.

946
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,000
Oh, I thought you meant like something like rapist or.

947
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,920
No, no, I'm leaving.

948
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,960
I'm leaving raping.

949
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,840
I'm leaving raping.

950
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,800
I'll preserve the integrity of God.

951
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,200
Bricks in, atelisms out, kids.

952
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,000
That's right.

953
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,480
That's correct.

954
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,800
Just so you know, the title of this episode will be Nate Returns.

955
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,080
Yes.

956
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,680
Whatever you want.

957
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,760
Listen, I don't care.

958
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,440
I'm hungover.

959
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,320
It's, it's, it's over for me.

960
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,480
I've decided to never drink water again.

961
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,240
Why?

962
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,560
I've decided this is, this is the end.

963
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,160
You know, this hangover is good, actually.

964
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,120
This hangover is good.

965
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,160
I'm just going to lean into it.

966
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,560
I'm just going to lean into it and just go hard.

967
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,560
And this is it.

968
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,440
This is where it ends.

969
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,480
Just going to, just going to drive right off this cliff that I'm on.

970
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,480
So this is, this is the PCP, right?

971
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,080
So this is the, this is right.

972
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,680
This is episode 300 of the Procrastinators podcast.

973
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,720
Does that mean it's okay for me to talk about the new Pokemon game?

974
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,640
Oh, Jesus.

975
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,440
Oh, no.

976
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,640
Well, I haven't played it, but I mean,

977
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,520
I suppose there's whatever.

978
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,000
It looks good.

979
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,480
It looks fun.

980
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,760
And I like the look of it.

981
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,480
I have not, I don't have any opinion.

982
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,200
Okay.

983
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,080
It's fun.

984
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,400
It's a different kind of game.

985
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,840
Some people might not be partial to it, which is fair enough.

986
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,720
I don't believe you.

987
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,120
But I had, that's why it looks good to me.

988
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,080
Yeah.

989
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,240
I had fun sneaking around in the grass,

990
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,120
trying not to get killed by giant Pokemon.

991
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,040
I caught a massive Lopini.

992
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,560
She's twice my size.

993
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,120
It's great.

994
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,560
That's pretty cool.

995
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,440
Can you have sex with the Lopini?

996
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,240
Exactly, dude.

997
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,240
This is, this is set like back in the day when people and Pokemon were equals,

998
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
you know, when they were seen of as equals.

999
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,080
And you're the newfangled person going around putting these things into balls.

1000
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,280
Is it, okay.

1001
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,480
Isn't there a line in one of the games where they say that like people

1002
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,160
and Pokemon used to marry each other?

1003
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,960
So something basically equivalent to that.

1004
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,680
Yeah.

1005
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah.

1006
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,000
And this is the, and this game is set in those times in the olden days.

1007
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,880
Yes.

1008
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,720
And you get a massive Gardevoir.

1009
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,280
I got a Gardevoir and she's the same size as me.

1010
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,400
And I'm looking around for a massive Gardevoir.

1011
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,120
Can you make your Gardevoir fuck your Lopini?

1012
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
Oh, that's a great idea.

1013
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,040
I don't even want, I don't even want sex with the Pokemon.

1014
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,880
I just want to make them do it and watch.

1015
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,760
The bonus points if they don't want to do it, but I make them anyway.

1016
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,320
You can toss your Pokemon out.

1017
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Yeah, you need a pretty high gym bench level.

1018
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,960
Yeah, you need to have beaten all the gyms or else they won't fuck.

1019
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,760
But if you get enough gym badges, you can make over the canteen.

1020
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,840
I know, because it's like.

1021
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,400
If you have enough gym badges, Pokemon have to consent to sex them.

1022
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,600
You're on their trainer.

1023
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,080
You are their owner and they are your possessions.

1024
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,840
You say when they have sex or not, I think so.

1025
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,040
I think because this is a back in the day, you're like a little adventurer.

1026
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,800
You're like making the Pokedex.

1027
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,240
And it's a little book because of course it fucking is.

1028
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,480
Of course it is.

1029
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,760
I just read the last creative one and got to the part where you have to use your pee.

1030
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,360
Yes.

1031
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,520
I didn't read it before.

1032
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,680
And it throws to the little flower.

1033
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,040
You have to water me.

1034
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,040
You have to use your pee.

1035
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,040
You have to water me.

1036
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,800
Ow, ow, ow.

1037
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
OK, the rib cage.

1038
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,000
That's a lot of people too.

1039
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,720
They are massive Loponies and massive Garth was.

1040
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,320
Yeah, it's fun.

1041
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,520
It's a fun game.

1042
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,200
It is a Pokemon game.

1043
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,960
Some people might not be satisfied.

1044
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,240
But you know, I'm depressed, so I have no standards.

1045
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:16,760
I used to when I was playing fun, comfort game where I roll around in the town.

1046
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,520
Yes.

1047
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:19,640
High five.

1048
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,640
Pokemon challenges said that like the new the new like battle style is cool,

1049
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,880
but there's only like five of them in the whole game.

1050
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,400
Five what?

1051
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,080
Of like a new some like new style of battle.

1052
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,440
Oh, yes.

1053
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,840
That's for like specifically like battles or something.

1054
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,320
Yes.

1055
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,480
There are like the noble the noble Pokemon or whatever.

1056
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,120
Yes.

1057
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:50,200
Basically, they've they've they've taken some ice and they're trying.

1058
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,560
God gave them some ice and now they're trying to kill everybody.

1059
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,960
God gave them ice like like jewels.

1060
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,160
Like the like the drug then.

1061
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,080
Ice like they're high.

1062
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,920
OK, OK.

1063
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,400
Like like God zaps them with electricity and made them go crazy.

1064
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,680
Gotcha.

1065
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,040
Yeah.

1066
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,920
Ice ice baby.

1067
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,480
Like like the like the government body.

1068
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,000
Yes.

1069
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,720
Like vanilla ice.

1070
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,920
Like ice cubes.

1071
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,640
Yeah, ice tea.

1072
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,440
Anyway, God fucked them up.

1073
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,160
God fucked them all up and now they're going crazy.

1074
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,280
And you're the kid that got isekai to this land and everyone's like,

1075
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,000
hey, kid, you're not scared of Pokemon.

1076
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,400
I saw you walk up to a cricket to your super powers that you don't know

1077
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,280
that you should be afraid of the power is that you are from the future

1078
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,400
and therefore are unafraid of Pokemon because you can be babies.

1079
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,080
But in this world, they will kill you and do try to.

1080
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,280
Hmm.

1081
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,880
Oh, yeah, it sounds.

1082
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,240
Should I?

1083
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,480
Well, I don't have a switch, so I don't even have the means to play it.

1084
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,320
I wouldn't I wouldn't get a switch just to play it.

1085
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,440
If I had a switch, maybe I would buy it just to fuck around.

1086
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,840
I don't know.

1087
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,240
Yeah, babe has a switch and he bought this game for himself

1088
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,920
and therefore also bought it for me.

1089
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,520
Who did?

1090
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,520
Babe, my partner.

1091
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,880
That's what I call my partner.

1092
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,640
Renown character, babe.

1093
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,120
Yeah, everyone's favorite character, babe.

1094
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,680
Yeah, babe, pig in the city, as I was going to say.

1095
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,080
Yes.

1096
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,880
Don't tell them my secret.

1097
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:34,600
I call them.

1098
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:36,920
When you when you.

1099
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,720
Yes, I read that out.

1100
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,200
I read that out.

1101
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,600
I read that out.

1102
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,880
I read that out.

1103
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,920
I want people to think I'm white like Shane Dawson or something.

1104
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,680
Time to go.

1105
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,280
Time to go get a girlfriend just so I can start calling her pig in the city.

1106
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,400
We know what it means.

1107
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,440
We know what it means.

1108
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:00,520
You know, the only reason I want to get married so that I can say,

1109
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,000
hey, that's my wife you're talking about.

1110
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,320
Yeah, so I can punch people and say.

1111
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,600
And say, what are you doing to my wife?

1112
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,720
But she's not even there.

1113
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,720
She's not even anywhere, anywhere nearby.

1114
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,600
Allison, why don't you just marry Lane and then you also get citizenship in America?

1115
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,880
Or she gets citizenship where you are.

1116
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,240
Having a wife is reason to punch people.

1117
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,480
It's reason to punch someone, I think.

1118
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,520
I don't know why it's also a reason to punch people.

1119
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,200
Yeah.

1120
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,200
Punishing people is good, actually.

1121
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,480
There's never not a reason.

1122
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,400
You know, I've done the math.

1123
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,840
To commit assault.

1124
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,800
So I've done the math and I've edited a hundred and twenty two episodes of the PCP.

1125
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,160
My God.

1126
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,640
You're insane.

1127
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,760
I was a young innocent 17 year old child and now I'm 20 years old.

1128
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,120
A hundred.

1129
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,080
Wait, a hundred and twenty two.

1130
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,240
But that's yeah, it's a lot.

1131
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,240
But that's but that's so too many.

1132
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:03,800
It can't be.

1133
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,680
It's not even it hasn't even been that many episodes.

1134
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,680
Ben, don't panic on don't panic on me.

1135
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,600
No time to panic attack right now.

1136
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,920
Ben, I'm trying to gaslight you so it doesn't have to pay you.

1137
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,320
You're full.

1138
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,280
There hasn't been that many episodes.

1139
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,720
No, no, you only ate 20.

1140
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:22,920
That's right.

1141
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,560
That's right.

1142
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,240
I don't think we I don't think I agreed.

1143
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,960
I don't think we agreed to pay you for a hundred and twenty two episodes.

1144
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,600
And yet here we are.

1145
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,520
This is this Chris Chan and soup.

1146
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,880
Is this the first one you did?

1147
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,240
No, that is the first one.

1148
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,600
Damn.

1149
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,080
Well, I I didn't think.

1150
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,720
I didn't think you didn't.

1151
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,080
I didn't think you'd be doing it for that long.

1152
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,720
But I guess time.

1153
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,000
A hundred and twenty one is our I did edit one of those since then.

1154
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,560
Remember.

1155
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,600
Oh, that's right.

1156
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,240
That is right.

1157
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,680
So Ben was right.

1158
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,960
You haven't done that many.

1159
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:59,080
Ah, you know, you know, how the funny story of how, like,

1160
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,760
for the eight or contest, I think, like, I tie with first place with.

1161
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,280
I don't remember who.

1162
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,440
But you just won because you were just so much powerful than us.

1163
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,400
We pick.

1164
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,840
Yeah, we.

1165
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,160
Yeah.

1166
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,520
We had a couple.

1167
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,600
There were there were there were a few that we liked.

1168
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,800
I can't remember you talking about that green, fleshy flowers was a name that was

1169
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,760
bandied about.

1170
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,600
Yeah.

1171
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,960
That guy is an art guy.

1172
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,560
That guy.

1173
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,200
I'm assuming that they do the sketchy people podcast.

1174
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,560
Yeah.

1175
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:33,880
Yeah.

1176
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,680
When I look at those videos, I see all the little TVs and I'm like, oh, yeah,

1177
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,840
that's similar to what they did for the PCP, isn't it?

1178
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,160
Yeah.

1179
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,960
He has another he has another handle that he uses.

1180
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,040
He's got like two and green, fleshy flowers is one of them.

1181
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,040
I forget what the other one is.

1182
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,480
But that guy's good.

1183
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,240
The guy's good at art.

1184
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,080
I don't know.

1185
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,040
Back at that time, when you won, I have I have sworn revenge.

1186
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:04,120
I will as I will fly to America and kill oblivion fall for taking this opportunity from me.

1187
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,240
Somebody's got to do it.

1188
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,840
Somebody look at us and we're best friends.

1189
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,000
It's true.

1190
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,400
Oblivion.

1191
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh, yes.

1192
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,720
Hello.

1193
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,040
Sorry.

1194
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,560
You got distracted for like a second.

1195
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,200
This is this is like the worst hangover I've ever had.

1196
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,080
This is so bad.

1197
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,120
I can't even believe it.

1198
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,880
I didn't even drink anything that bad.

1199
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,240
I just drank beer.

1200
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,280
It was just beer.

1201
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,920
And on the 300 episode of the podcast, Ben,

1202
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,480
I like Chuck vodka and I don't have hangovers as bad as this.

1203
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,280
I'm not old.

1204
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,160
I'll never be old.

1205
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,360
You keep telling yourself that, sweetie.

1206
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,120
You keep telling yourself that I'm just going to do a Carl Pilkington.

1207
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,480
And when I get old enough, I'll just start aging in reverse and become a baby again.

1208
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:50,680
Oh, yeah.

1209
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,160
You wish.

1210
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,600
Ben says, I will never get old also.

1211
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,920
300 episodes of the PCP.

1212
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,000
Oh, no, no.

1213
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,080
It's true.

1214
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,440
It's true.

1215
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:05,880
I'm not old.

1216
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,160
I'm just dehydrated.

1217
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,200
I just need some water to fill my cells.

1218
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,680
You need water from the fountain of youth.

1219
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,440
Yeah, I love that part of the Caribbean movie.

1220
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,920
I love Jesse's review of that movie.

1221
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,440
I don't remember that.

1222
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,320
I haven't seen Pirates of the Caribbean 5, but Jesse did like an hour long review.

1223
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,920
We're halfway through it.

1224
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,200
He just breaks down and starts screaming, my doubter.

1225
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,280
And it was funny and I liked it.

1226
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,880
I remember my doubter.

1227
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,760
I remember my doubter.

1228
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,400
My doubter.

1229
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,040
My doubter.

1230
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,640
It's good stuff.

1231
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,160
People who don't watch Jesse Conn and are missing out looking at you, Simsie.

1232
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,360
Do you think to just send Simsie piss style on repeat?

1233
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:52,920
P-style.

1234
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,120
P-style.

1235
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,760
Piss style.

1236
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,960
I was thinking of Piss Christ.

1237
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,320
I should just do that, yeah.

1238
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,840
Wait, Piss Christ?

1239
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,480
Yeah.

1240
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,840
You know about Piss Christ, right?

1241
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,520
No, what's Piss Christ?

1242
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:02,920
Wait.

1243
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,760
How do you not know about Piss Christ?

1244
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,760
I don't know.

1245
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,960
Elisa, you need to read the Bible.

1246
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,480
Yeah, I'll send you.

1247
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,840
There's a picture of Piss Christ.

1248
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,400
People get really offended about Piss Christ.

1249
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,360
What do you think Piss Christ is, Oblivion?

1250
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,160
I think Piss Christ is Jesus.

1251
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,880
Okay, it's like a reverse urinal.

1252
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,760
You walk into the bathroom and instead of a urinal that you pee into,

1253
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,880
there's like a sculpture of Jesus on the cross and he pisses on you.

1254
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,040
Okay, what do you think?

1255
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,800
What do you think Piss Christ is, Elisa?

1256
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,520
What do you think Piss Christ is, Elisa?

1257
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,960
Jesus Christ drank holy water and he holy pissed on everyone.

1258
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,240
Okay, cool.

1259
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,440
Here's Piss Christ.

1260
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:51,960
Here he is.

1261
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,240
He's entering General Chat.

1262
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:00,200
It's Jesus Christ on the cross and a giant piss that someone took a photo of.

1263
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,040
Why a piss jar?

1264
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,400
That's like, that's baby shit.

1265
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,760
Come jars of the real effort.

1266
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,000
Because it's us.

1267
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,560
This looks like a great album cover for a heavier record.

1268
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,320
Because also because it was made in 1987.

1269
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,120
It was made in 1987 by Andre Serrano.

1270
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,720
Oh, so it's old.

1271
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,160
Is that the title of the album?

1272
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:25,960
Yeah, it's old.

1273
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,040
It's old and French, so it's old.

1274
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,040
Really? I thought this was like made a couple years ago.

1275
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,080
It's American, actually.

1276
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,360
Okay.

1277
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,920
Hmm, hmm, yeah.

1278
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,320
All right.

1279
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,440
I'm going to go back to sleep.

1280
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,520
End of the episode.

1281
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,000
Are we done?

1282
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:41,800
No.

1283
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,920
You're going to go back to sleep.

1284
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,760
You're going to go back to sleep.

1285
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,040
You all get Ben.

1286
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,720
Ben, do you remember what time it is for me?

1287
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,440
Mr. Ben St. You're going to go back to sleep?

1288
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,800
You said it's like 1 a.m.

1289
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,240
Is it time to get vaccinated?

1290
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,920
I already did.

1291
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,960
I've had all my jabs.

1292
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,920
I'm a good boy.

1293
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,480
Is it time?

1294
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,320
I haven't, should I still haven't got my booster?

1295
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,080
Is there even any point anymore?

1296
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,480
Is there even a point to getting boosted?

1297
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,680
Is there a point to anything?

1298
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,320
Any of this?

1299
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,400
After 300 episodes,

1300
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,920
should I even bother getting the booster

1301
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,680
or should I just let COVID take me?

1302
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,160
Just let it take me, just sweep me off into the...

1303
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,840
You've already had COVID, Ben.

1304
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,120
Trump won't do anything.

1305
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,960
Look at me, my maid.

1306
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,600
Yeah.

1307
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,240
Yes, I know.

1308
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,280
I'm so proud of you, Ken.

1309
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:24,840
Look at it.

1310
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,320
That's good.

1311
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,280
Also made a fucking template as well.

1312
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,120
I made the flower turn its frown.

1313
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,360
Smile upside down as well.

1314
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,440
You're a genius, Ken.

1315
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,440
But it still has the heart.

1316
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,400
It still loves it.

1317
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,920
That's great.

1318
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,080
Creative people.

1319
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,120
Creative people have...

1320
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,240
They dye their hair.

1321
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,600
They dye their hair.

1322
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,320
Just like you.

1323
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,040
That's true.

1324
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,240
Just like me.

1325
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,520
That's how we know that you're creative.

1326
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,800
I'm not creative anymore

1327
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,080
because my hair is normal now.

1328
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,280
What the fuck?

1329
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,640
You just have to re-dye it, Ben.

1330
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,080
The branding, the branding, Ben.

1331
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,960
The pink is gone.

1332
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,760
The pink...

1333
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,280
No, they have no more brand.

1334
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,960
My hair is normal color,

1335
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,320
and I don't vape anymore.

1336
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,440
And what...

1337
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:10,920
Who are you?

1338
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,720
Normal color.

1339
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,920
What's the point?

1340
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:14,600
What's the point?

1341
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,960
Are you even doing keto?

1342
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,840
I have been.

1343
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,320
But the strip doesn't turn purple.

1344
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,720
I think you just fucked up your body, Ben.

1345
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,080
I have been eating so clean.

1346
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,440
I have been eating so strict.

1347
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,320
I've had a very strict low calorie regimen.

1348
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:33,880
And yet...

1349
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,040
And yet the keto strip does not turn purple.

1350
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,800
I don't know if it's because...

1351
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,600
It must be the water.

1352
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,880
The water can't be keto.

1353
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,400
Oh, I have stuff to drink in water.

1354
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,240
I can only drink alcohol from now on.

1355
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:45,960
Yeah, yeah.

1356
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,320
Maybe you're pregnant.

1357
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,400
I wish.

1358
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,520
That was said almost like sincere.

1359
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,520
It was too sincere.

1360
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,360
Too sincere.

1361
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:01,640
Yeah.

1362
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,120
You could have a keto bun in the oven.

1363
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:07,960
I just...

1364
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,360
I don't understand.

1365
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,120
I don't understand why I'm not in keto mode.

1366
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,480
I've been very...

1367
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,040
I've been very scrupulous about it.

1368
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:16,520
And yet...

1369
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,000
And yet...

1370
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,440
Listen, Ben.

1371
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,160
It just doesn't happen.

1372
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,760
Your keto in our hearts, okay?

1373
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,120
Oh, thanks.

1374
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:25,800
Yeah, that'll...

1375
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,520
Means nothing.

1376
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,280
Yeah, that'll keep me at it.

1377
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,920
That'll keep my body weight optimal.

1378
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,040
Yeah, sure.

1379
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,080
Just jump into your death.

1380
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,040
I think I have lost some weight, though.

1381
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:38,440
I've been...

1382
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,680
I'm not in keto, but I've been eating very...

1383
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,280
I've been eating at low calorie.

1384
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,560
And I think I have lost a little bit.

1385
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,520
I think I look pretty good.

1386
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,920
I looked in the mirror the other day and I was like,

1387
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,720
fuck yeah.

1388
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,360
So you know what?

1389
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:48,840
It's fine.

1390
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:49,640
It's good.

1391
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,520
Lamal.

1392
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:50,840
Yeah.

1393
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,720
All right.

1394
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,320
I have a small topic.

1395
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,840
It's sort of like a two-part topic.

1396
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,000
Let it to what I've been working on the last couple of days.

1397
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,840
So does anyone remember a video by a guy called Noodle

1398
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,200
talking about AI interpolation for animation?

1399
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,600
Yeah, I've seen that.

1400
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,440
Yeah, I think so.

1401
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:12,920
Maybe.

1402
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,360
I don't know if I actually watched it.

1403
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,600
I would like to destroy the purpose.

1404
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,800
Yeah.

1405
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,040
Every time you see a video, it's like anime fight scenes in 60 FPS.

1406
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,160
Track down the people who made those videos

1407
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,880
and kill, oh wait.

1408
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,520
I can't actually.

1409
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,320
And kill them?

1410
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,200
I can't kill them.

1411
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,800
I want to say that, but I'm not allowed to.

1412
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:32,920
Because of how YouTube-

1413
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,720
Why do you chose this?

1414
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,600
Look, in Minecraft, okay?

1415
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,560
Just destroy the ship.

1416
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,280
Blow up the house in Minecraft.

1417
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,240
Exactly, exactly.

1418
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,440
You hear that, Susan Wojcicki?

1419
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,840
It makes me so mad.

1420
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,920
It makes me so mad that people,

1421
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,560
one, don't understand that 24 frames per second

1422
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,960
cannot be converted to 60 frames per second

1423
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,080
without fucking up literally everything.

1424
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,280
Even if you have a line moving at a set speed,

1425
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:03,960
it'll get fucked up because going from 24 FPS to 60 FPS,

1426
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,160
some of them will have to be split into two frames

1427
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,240
and some of them will have to be split into three frames

1428
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,200
and it'll just make all the motion look jumbly and bad.

1429
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,320
And also the AI does a shit job anyway

1430
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,240
because it doesn't know what the fuck it's doing

1431
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,360
because it was trained on live-action footage and not cartoons.

1432
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,840
It's all just terrible.

1433
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,560
But.

1434
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,120
It is.

1435
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,760
But, but.

1436
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,240
That doesn't stop me.

1437
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,240
You see, I am a smart boy.

1438
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,760
I am using AI interpolation for my own animations

1439
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,800
to double the frame rate.

1440
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,920
And it does kind of a crappy job.

1441
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,520
I'll show like a little example.

1442
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,000
I'll drop a little mini MP4 in chat

1443
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,840
because I've been manually cleaning up all the frames

1444
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,120
that got fucked up, right?

1445
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,440
And that's just what I've been doing for the past couple of days,

1446
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,400
just painting out all the mistakes that the AI made.

1447
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,720
But it has actually saved me a lot of time.

1448
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,280
And I'm not applying the AI to the end product for 60 FPS.

1449
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,240
I'm actually just using it for basic in-betweens at 30 FPS.

1450
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,120
And I'm doing the cleanup before all the effects

1451
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,680
and all the camera shake and all the gradients and bloom

1452
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,280
and all that shit goes on top.

1453
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,760
So it's actually working out pretty well

1454
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,840
and I've pretty much finished all this work.

1455
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,120
And that's what I've been working on.

1456
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,280
I like how the cleanup video is just a close-up of the kuchi.

1457
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:22,520
Yeah.

1458
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,800
Not that big.

1459
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,600
Can I post this?

1460
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,680
Can I like show this on the video?

1461
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,280
Just put a demonetization symbol over the poos

1462
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,240
and you'll be fine.

1463
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,120
Okay.

1464
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,000
Or I do remember seeing this noodle video.

1465
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,040
Those are the things with like video

1466
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,880
Dragon Ball Z, but a thousand frames per second.

1467
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,880
I never click on them because I know they're stupid.

1468
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,400
And this noodle thing was like,

1469
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,360
yeah, animation fundamentals don't work

1470
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,320
because AI doesn't know whether something is supposed

1471
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:01,000
to be bouncy or not, or what is the meaning

1472
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,360
of the movement in the scene.

1473
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,120
You can't say that.

1474
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,760
It cannot best go in between two different frames

1475
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,520
and if it understands what a human face is and what an arm is,

1476
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,280
it can be like, okay, this is the arm here.

1477
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,640
This is the arm here.

1478
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,440
So we need to make a frame in between that meshes them.

1479
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,880
But like for intent, it's hard or impossible for an AI

1480
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,960
to like know what the hell of like an action scene is trying

1481
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,120
to do, especially with a cartoon.

1482
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,360
We needed some AI to act.

1483
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,240
People love it though.

1484
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,080
People really enjoy looking at those videos.

1485
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:37,480
It's like-

1486
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,200
Because we're stupid.

1487
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,080
Not like go out and make their brain feel good.

1488
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,640
It's like, do you remember AT Audio?

1489
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:48,760
It's just like music that pans all over your head.

1490
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,240
It's like that.

1491
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,280
It's just like gaming.

1492
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,800
You know when like a 3D has like

1493
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,920
tastefully decided to run at a lower frame rate

1494
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,960
for like effect or-

1495
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,640
Like spider-verse and stuff, yeah.

1496
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,520
And you know, there's always going to be that

1497
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:13,720
sect of people who look at it and they notice that is not as

1498
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,760
smooth as other three-dimensional imagery they've seen before,

1499
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,920
such as a 60fps game.

1500
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,960
They will think of it as bad animation.

1501
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,960
Yeah, I saw that.

1502
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,120
Even though they're like, they're basing it on like stupid things,

1503
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,360
it is the response they have.

1504
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,080
I don't know really what the solution to that is.

1505
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,920
Um, the solution is you need to-

1506
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,400
Kill them.

1507
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,720
Like it's a legitimate response.

1508
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,680
Like people feel-

1509
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,200
It's because they've played too many video games that they think,

1510
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,200
oh, oh, it's dropping frame rate.

1511
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:44,920
Oh, I'm bad.

1512
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,760
And that's the response they like have been like led to expect.

1513
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,520
They, I bet they don't even realize that like every fucking like 2D animated

1514
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,280
movie ever made is animated on twos and frees for the most part,

1515
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,800
using ones like sparingly.

1516
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,920
Sure, sure.

1517
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,360
Like every Disney movie, everything.

1518
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,040
And no one thought that looked bad.

1519
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,720
No one ever thought there was a problem with it.

1520
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,160
Um.

1521
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:11,400
I think there's more to just like people being stupid.

1522
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,040
I think, like, because people don't complain about those Disney movies

1523
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,400
because it's not even noticeable that it's at a lower frame rate.

1524
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,680
For some people, for, I don't know.

1525
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,200
I don't know how to describe it.

1526
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:32,760
I just feel like there's more going on than people thinking about video game frame rates.

1527
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,040
Yeah.

1528
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,760
Sometimes things do look-

1529
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,360
Maybe it's just like, okay.

1530
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,160
Maybe it's like-

1531
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,560
Not in a bad way, but like in an artistic way that they're just not ready to accept.

1532
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,120
I don't know.

1533
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,480
Like maybe they, like they see the low frame rate, they notice it,

1534
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,800
but they don't know what to say about it.

1535
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,320
So they like interpret it as like something to criticize.

1536
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,440
Yeah, so-

1537
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,880
Even though it doesn't look bad.

1538
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,760
Like nobody thinks that like Spider-Verse looks bad because-

1539
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,600
Oh, there are people who think it looks bad.

1540
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,560
I've seen people who can-

1541
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,280
Do they actually, or do they think that they ought to think it looks bad?

1542
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:09,720
Because-

1543
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,160
Like there are some people who said that like, because it's actually a mixed frame rate.

1544
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,480
Like Spider-Verse is animated at 24 FPS.

1545
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,520
I'll say at least half the movie is animated on ones.

1546
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,720
And things are only animated on twos in a way that looks good,

1547
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,560
like in a way would for 2D animation.

1548
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:29,080
The thing about 2D animation is like in-betweening everything on ones,

1549
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,280
which basically means that every single frame is a new drawing,

1550
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,120
doesn't always look better.

1551
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,120
Using twos and frees sparingly can actually improve the look of the animation

1552
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,520
and help it feel more like organic and good and stuff.

1553
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:41,320
I know.

1554
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:41,720
Oh, no.

1555
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,640
I know that.

1556
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,040
You know.

1557
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,920
And especially for like limited animation as well.

1558
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,560
And using those techniques for 3D is like really cool.

1559
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,320
And Spider-Verse did it extremely well.

1560
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,640
Like the animators, people seem to think that like,

1561
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,920
oh, they were being lazy.

1562
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,480
They were just cutting corners and saving on costs.

1563
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:03,080
That is like provably false because even on frames

1564
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,440
where the characters are standing like still for like two frames,

1565
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,440
the lighting still moves.

1566
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,720
Like if there's a lighting effect but it's moving on ones,

1567
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,480
like you'll see the light update on their model even though the model is like still.

1568
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,560
This is like that old DigiBro video about Kill-a-Kill.

1569
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:27,800
And this is like the Kill-a-Kill, you know, the parts where like a limited thing,

1570
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,760
a thing doesn't move.

1571
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,600
But it's like, yeah, Kill-a-Kill did like super like limited,

1572
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,280
like they use like tweens and stuff in a way,

1573
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,640
like for comedic effect that looked really good.

1574
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,640
Yeah, they use it for comedy.

1575
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,360
Like it's obviously, they're obviously doing it on purpose,

1576
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,360
like because it, yeah, for effect.

1577
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,960
I think that's the main thing is when it's used for effect

1578
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,560
and the effect doesn't distract from the content

1579
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,840
of the scene or whatever is trying to be shown.

1580
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,640
If like you're watching something and the main thing you get out of it

1581
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,880
is that the frame rate is like notable,

1582
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:10,280
then the animation hasn't really done a good job at like making you not think about that

1583
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,160
and instead pay attention to like the thing that's happening.

1584
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,120
I mean, if you're watching a scene and all you feel about it is

1585
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,960
the like something about the frame rate seems weird to you,

1586
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,120
then like I guess the artists has failed, right,

1587
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,040
in making the scene effective in the way they wanted to.

1588
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:36,360
There's definitely a lot of like misunderstandings and like pseudo,

1589
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,520
like what's the term for someone who thinks they know what they're talking about but they don't?

1590
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,360
Pseudo-intellectual?

1591
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,160
I don't know if it starts with pseudo, but like, yeah, basically it's like people

1592
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,320
thinking that they have

1593
01:11:55,080 --> 01:12:04,680
like a misunderstanding of terms, they just use terms that aren't

1594
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:10,200
correct in analyzing the thing they're looking at because they had an emotional reaction to it

1595
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:16,280
that was negative. Yeah, I see a lot of that going around as well.

1596
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:22,200
I've seen that with, I've seen a lot of bad animation takes in general and like when you

1597
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:28,200
read the responses, people just, it's clear that they just really don't know much about animation

1598
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:34,040
at all. I have a good example actually. I mean, you can't expect the layperson to know about

1599
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,840
techniques, right? You can't expect them to know like the technical,

1600
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,160
you can't expect the audience to know like the technical aspects of it.

1601
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:48,440
All they should be expected to know is like how it impacts them, right?

1602
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:54,680
Okay, so here's an example of one thing recently where someone's like,

1603
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:59,880
I, because you know, High Guardian Spice, it's that show that everyone hates even though

1604
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:06,680
I know it's just kind of mediocre, but you know how every time like something is like

1605
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:10,680
not great, people have to freak the fuck out and call it, say it's a travesty and a disaster and

1606
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,280
all this bullshit. Well, High Guardian Spice had all this other

1607
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:27,080
reasons for that. People hate it for reasons that have little to do with like the quality of the

1608
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:35,320
show itself. They just hated it in concept and in pop culture. It was because of,

1609
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:40,520
it was because, not even for the thing itself, it was because it was like the fact that it was

1610
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:45,560
crunchy roll and the fact that it called itself an anime despite looking obviously western and

1611
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:51,640
the way that it marketed itself as like diverse, right? Like the thing about, they sold it on like

1612
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,800
Oh yeah, I mean, the trailer had absolutely nothing to do with the show and everything.

1613
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,480
It's categorically not an anime. It's made by a fucking western studio.

1614
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:07,000
Right. Yeah, but that's the sort of thing I'm getting at is like the reasons people would go

1615
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:13,560
and like talk about these things and try to dissect it on a technical level when they don't

1616
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:19,800
know about the technicals. They're going into it trying to destroy it because of all these other

1617
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,520
things that they're actually the things they care about. And so the thing I posted is someone's

1618
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:29,240
being like, oh, look, I remade a scene and doesn't it look so much better? And it is just

1619
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:33,800
worse. Like the animation is worse in every object by every objective measure. Yeah,

1620
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:39,880
they just made the art style more anime-esque. Yeah, they've made the art style more anime,

1621
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:46,360
but the movements are way worse. There's like, I've left a huge comment, like a huge breakdown,

1622
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:52,760
like pointing out every single way in which it failed to be as well animated as the original.

1623
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:59,160
You know what? There's one thing specific. I mean, I always hate bloom, but the bloom in the

1624
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:05,160
remade version of this little scene here is a thing in anime that I've never liked ever.

1625
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:10,440
And they turned it up to like fucking 12. Yeah. Why did they make the ground look white?

1626
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:15,080
Digital anime always has bloom to make it look like it's actually real.

1627
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:20,520
Yeah, I don't get it. This scene that they re-animate, it's literally like six frames.

1628
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,440
I feel like you spent longer writing this comment than you spent drawing it.

1629
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:31,480
He did. I mean, I spent two hours on writing that comment to be fair. I should never be allowed

1630
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,120
to write anything because I'm so picky with my words. I like to think that the creators just

1631
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,680
reply with, okay. That's what you would do, Eleazar. Well, apparently the creator thanked

1632
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:43,640
people for like constructive feedback and I made sure my comment was constructive.

1633
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:51,160
I like how I click on this video and the first comment I see is from a month ago.

1634
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,080
The original VA is definitely not helping, but the animation is way better than the original

1635
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:59,000
props to you. The animation is not better than the original. It is worse animated.

1636
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,560
It is objectively worse. They complicated the image to the point where they had difficulty

1637
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:09,560
animating it. It's so short, it's barely even animated. Yeah. Yeah, it manages to be worse

1638
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,680
than the original, which is a pretty low bar because the original is nothing special.

1639
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:18,600
Yeah. Hold on. The motion, the drawings are not consistent. Her ear like moves all over the place

1640
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:25,800
like. Her hand is tiny, tiny little baby hand. Yeah, the hand is badly drawn. The hat changes

1641
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,560
size. Her face like facial proportions change. Every frame it's moving. The easing on her arms

1642
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:37,640
is nonsensical. I feel like this person just thinks that like the fact that they drew it more

1643
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:46,840
anatomical is just like categorically better. Yeah. The fact that they made it less cartoony,

1644
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,760
I guess. I don't know. Yeah, it's like the problem is that it looks like a Western art style and

1645
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:55,400
that's why it's bad. It's like, no, the art style for high guardian spice is fine. It's not even bad,

1646
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:00,840
in my opinion. It's just like kind of like. It's a cute cartoon. You might not like it,

1647
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,800
but this is what peak performance looks like. I saw similar things when people are like,

1648
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,120
what if Gravity Falls was an anime and then they draw like a scene that it's not even,

1649
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:14,120
the style doesn't even look like anime. It's just some like kind of chippy deviant art version of

1650
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:19,560
anime and all the comments are, wow, you're better than an entire studio, even though like the production

1651
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:27,480
is like mostly just gradients and bloom filters and shit. It's easy to animate a single shot.

1652
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:34,840
It's easy for like, yeah, one person can do that. Imagine doing like an entire season of a show.

1653
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:40,520
It's almost like animation studios give shots to individual people and that's how a shock gets

1654
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:48,040
done. Makes you think. And then these YouTubers come along and do like a version that from a

1655
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:52,840
technical animation perspective is nowhere near as impressive or like clean or well done and uses

1656
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:58,200
a whole bunch of shortcuts and filters and people just eat it up because they see a gradient or

1657
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:04,520
they see an anime eye and they go, wow, and they clap like a seal. Yeah. Media literacy. Makes me

1658
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:12,760
mad. This reminds me of on, on Saturday after in the pro and on server after watching Dog Day

1659
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:18,840
Afternoon, we watched Raging Ball with my good friend SackDev. Like in the afternoon, I was

1660
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,360
hanging out with a friend and I said, oh yeah, I watched Raging Ball. It's a, it's a movie that

1661
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,760
despite being from the 80s, it's in black and white. My friend was like, ugh, I could never

1662
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,880
watch a movie in black and white. So I'm like, you're awful. You're awful, Murray.

1663
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:38,760
This is why we need to break into Zack's home. I'll remove his skeleton eyes and replace him

1664
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,960
with skeleton eyes from the 80s. I can only see in black and white. That'll show him.

1665
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:51,320
What is this, this ordinary creator, this, this, all right. So ordinary person is like,

1666
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:57,320
hates their boss, but is too weak and shy to do anything about it. The creative person imagines

1667
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:05,880
them as a witch and likes them. She's just gay. She's just gay. She's just gay. She's gay for her

1668
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:15,160
evil boss. She's gay for her evil witch boss. She's insolent. Ordinary person hates being,

1669
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:20,040
being chastised and abused by their, by their boss. Creative people get off on it a little bit.

1670
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:31,960
It's true, it's true. What if my, what if my, what if my sexy boss were a green witch who hated me

1671
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:39,880
just as much? He didn't drink coffee, but instead swept the floor. She's imagining that the boss

1672
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:46,680
is going to sweep the floor for her. See, Tull, I just, just to say, I really like the, you know,

1673
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:55,480
need, but I need to make him creative. She's just going to be really confused when the boss

1674
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:01,320
like starts taking a swig from the broom. I like, I like the creative, creative people live in a world

1675
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:08,920
where everything is reimagined as being part of intellectual properties that exist already.

1676
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:16,360
Creative, creative people populate their, their, their, their inner fantasy worlds with the, the,

1677
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:21,080
the inner life of a creative person is basically like Ready Player One, where it's just like, you

1678
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:27,640
know, the Iron Giant and Wicked and, and Pokemon, Pokemon. The person, the person who made these

1679
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:33,880
images definitely is a big Ready Player One fan. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Creative people are just

1680
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:40,360
delusional. Delightfully devilish. Delightfully devilish. Delightfully devilish.

1681
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:46,920
Yeah, yeah. Creative people imagine that their, their thing is on fire, but delightfully devilish

1682
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:53,720
people actually have it on fire and it burns their, their roast and ruins it. Delight, to, to,

1683
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:58,920
to ordinary, ordinary people see that the house is on fire. Creative people say it's just, it's

1684
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:04,680
the Northern Lights at this time of year in this part of the country, located entirely inside your

1685
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:08,440
kitchen. Ordinary people think they're hamburgers. Creative people steam hams.

1686
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,520
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up.

1687
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:22,040
Like tell the steamed ham story on the PCP. Ordinary people throw up, Ben.

1688
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:27,560
What? Yeah, Ben. I wish I was an ordinary person. Creative people drink tap water.

1689
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,440
Oh, ruined. Ben's ruined.

1690
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:39,000
Creative people drink, drink beer and never drink tap water. They'll never, they'll never

1691
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,320
hydrate themselves. Ben, you know, being straight edge is more creative than, than consuming

1692
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:50,120
substances nowadays. This lady, this lady with the, with the pink hair, is it pink? It's like

1693
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:57,240
gray pink. This lady with the gray pink hair is, is, is straight edge. She is, she's straight edge.

1694
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:02,120
Oblivion, she's high on creativity. Oblivion, what is that, steamed ham story?

1695
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,560
Yeah. The steamed ham story. What is it? I know I told the story somewhere. I don't remember if it

1696
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,680
was the draw cast or the PCP, but um, I don't remember hearing it. Oh God. All right. So I have

1697
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:18,040
an interesting history with fucking English classes. With steamed ham. Throughout my entire life,

1698
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:22,920
throughout my whole fucking life. The first, the first example when I was at this fucking

1699
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,120
microscopic tiny school for Amoeba that had like four students after me and my sister joined.

1700
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,880
It was the tiniest school you could ever imagine.

1701
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,720
It wasn't a Christian school. That's my, that's my question.

1702
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:39,960
It was a Christian school and it was in Mozgiel by Dunedin in the south of New Zealand.

1703
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:46,200
If anyone lives in Mozgiel by Dunedin. If anyone lives in Mozgiel watching the PCP,

1704
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,480
that's crazy because it's a fucking microscopic town with like no one in it.

1705
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,560
Um, if one person there watches the PCP, they all do.

1706
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:59,720
Well, we got a creative writing assignment and I had recently watched that episode of The Simpsons

1707
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:04,680
with steamed hams and I thought it was so funny. You did tell the story. You did tell the story.

1708
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:10,200
Oh yeah. Yeah. Didn't you just write, you just wrote it as your essay? You just wrote it as my

1709
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:19,000
assignment and submitted it and I got failed. Yeah. And I didn't know what Aurora Borealis was

1710
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:24,760
and I just made up the spelling in my head. No wonder you got it. So you called this your essay

1711
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:30,040
when it was clearly steamed hams. Despite the fact there's obviously steamed hams.

1712
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:36,040
That's funny. Well, there is a part two to this because later in high school I did some similar

1713
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:41,800
bullshit in terms of just, except this time it succeeded. This time I worked out my favor.

1714
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:49,800
So me, a little boy in high school with autism, we had to do speeches. We had to write a speech

1715
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:55,720
and deliver speech and I was kind of nervous because public speaking, that's like scary. That's

1716
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:02,280
like even scarier than just talking to a regular person. What the fuck? So my plan was just to

1717
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:10,360
write this stupidest like speech imaginable and I was currently like obsessed with DarkDemon.org,

1718
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:14,440
the Pivot Animation website and me and my friend had a bunch of inside jokes and so I just took

1719
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:20,680
those jokes and I turned them into a story and I wrote a story about how there was a guy called

1720
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:27,000
Damon who's just a guy from this animation website who created a time machine to go back in time

1721
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:35,320
to create a bunch of free legged creatures that are like indestructible and wiped out

1722
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:41,720
the dinosaurs and they're also immortal and they worshiped him because they consist of

1723
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:45,160
free legs joined together and that's their entire anatomical structure.

1724
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,560
This sounds like something out of pastel defender heliotrope.

1725
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:55,640
Maybe. And they worshiped Damon. They thought he was a god because he has four limbs. Imagine

1726
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:00,920
four limbs and they're religious symbol for him. In the land of the three legged, the four legged is

1727
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:07,960
king, I guess. Yeah. And so their symbol for him was a swastika and that's where it came from

1728
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:14,360
because four and these creatures live forever and they made all the decisions throughout history

1729
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,600
and they created World War II and Hitler was actually one of these free legged creatures

1730
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:24,600
after all and they covered it up and I told all this bullshit that I was just making up when I

1731
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:32,040
was 15 and I delivered the speech and I got the highest marks in the entire class only because

1732
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,400
I was enthusiastic and actually projected my voice instead of fucking mumbling.

1733
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:44,200
Didn't even listen to what you were saying. Did they just edit in like Hitler's other arm

1734
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:50,760
into all of his old pictures? Yeah, exactly. They had to turn one of the legs into a head

1735
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,400
because these creatures don't have heads either. It's just like free legs connected and there's

1736
01:25:55,400 --> 01:26:00,680
no torso. Yeah, he's just three legs. He's just three legs in a trench coat.

1737
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,040
Very strange. I'll be right back. I gotta go to the bathroom. I'll be back in a second.

1738
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:16,360
Who did the rule on? Elias are other puking sounds and fart sounds and toilet sounds.

1739
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:23,800
Fart with reverb specifically Elias are. Fart and fart with reverb. Puk with reverb.

1740
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,920
Puk with reverb. That'd be like a cool archaeological find. Is the fart without reverb?

1741
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:38,760
No. Without reverb. The original. This is like with a brush taking the dust out. Oh my god.

1742
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:43,720
Is this just a fart? Is this fart without reverb? That's insane. I don't believe it. I don't believe

1743
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:48,920
that's possible. I had to scroll so far down on that video to see your comment oblivion.

1744
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:54,040
Did you even find it? Yeah, I found it. I was like, for a second I was like, wait, did they,

1745
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:59,880
I kind of have this many comments. It's not a big video. Did they delete it? And then I found

1746
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:04,520
it. I'm like, oh, they didn't delete it. Okay, that's nice. Yeah, I took the screenshot like

1747
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,880
just earlier when I clicked on the video because it shows up for me, obviously,

1748
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:20,440
because it's my comment. Yeah. So, for February. Yes. Yeah. Go check out Big Girl Squish on Twitter.

1749
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Dude, I like that one. We should definitely. I forget if it was Gun Girl or it was probably

1750
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,800
Gun Girl. Just looking at the boobs. Gun Girl. That was a good one. That makes me feel inspired.

1751
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:36,520
I'm like, I need to draw big again, but like even more like, like the boobs have to be like

1752
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:44,440
disgustingly sexy. I gotta do it. It was really just like, I had drawn like a few images. I don't

1753
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:52,840
know why, but I've always had trouble actually committing to drawing like, oh, this is like

1754
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:59,960
sexually attractive woman. Obviously, like, I can do it sometimes, but it's like difficult,

1755
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,760
or I try to mask it with like, oh, it's comedy. There's a joke. I'm not actually serious. Haha.

1756
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:11,400
It's a, there can't be serious feelings here. It's just a comedy. That was your first mistake.

1757
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:18,600
And so I'm like, I'm trying, I'm trying to like, to get over that because like, I know I have the

1758
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:26,280
power. I have the power to draw good stuff that's like actually good. You know, and I spent a long

1759
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:32,440
time on that drawing. You know, hiding behind irony and sarcasm and cynicism didn't help anyone,

1760
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:37,960
especially Dr. House. But he had a whole TV show. He got a TV show deal. Oh, shit.

1761
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:44,680
But yeah, that's, it like started as like, haha, wouldn't it be funny if, and then I'm,

1762
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:48,840
I'm getting more like serious about like improving my drawings with each drawing.

1763
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:58,040
Maybe too serious. Why so serious? It's just big boobies. It's, it's, it should be fun.

1764
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,760
You want to know who I got these boobs?

1765
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,280
Do you want to take estrogen every day?

1766
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,960
Oh, it's an animation I made around the time I gave that speech.

1767
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,680
Oh my god. Oh my god.

1768
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,720
Hey, look at that little stick guy.

1769
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,960
The little, yeah, it was, so it was like a meme to take a regular stick man,

1770
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:24,680
delete his arms in his head and treat the torso as just a third leg and just animate them fighting.

1771
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:28,280
Oh, I was going to say, I found this one.

1772
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:32,440
One of them had four legs. It would be Nazis.

1773
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,760
Yes, I love this image. It's so good.

1774
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:43,560
I'm big. It's so, so big. Six foot nine, nine foot 11.

1775
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:55,320
Oh, I see. She is not actually that tall, but the amount.

1776
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:01,800
Felly is spooky for him that I haven't drawn yet is like nine foot 11 because of course it is.

1777
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Oh, big is only nine foot tall.

1778
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:06,120
Damn.

1779
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:09,400
Only, I say.

1780
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,880
Yeah, only. What a shame.

1781
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,400
She could be even bigger.

1782
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,760
Make it bigger.

1783
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:21,960
A regular Gib, regular Gib has Felly as a tits resting on her head in spirit.

1784
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:24,920
Probably.

1785
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,440
Huh? Regular Gib?

1786
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:28,920
Gibbob.

1787
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,160
What do you mean resting on?

1788
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,000
Because you're not, you're not, you're not super tall.

1789
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,880
Oh, no. Yeah. Oh, I get it. Yes.

1790
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,880
Yes.

1791
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,880
Notice, we've got to do the attack on Titan size comparison video,

1792
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,760
but it's all like the big booby OCs from Twitter artists.

1793
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,800
That would be kind of interesting.

1794
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:53,960
That the thing with like huge women is that when you draw them in a white void,

1795
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:58,520
you can't tell. There's no like, there's nothing to compare them to.

1796
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:05,000
So like, if you really want to show off the size, it has to be in relation to something

1797
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,800
either that a normal person will know what it is, like the average size smartphone.

1798
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:14,120
If it's like smaller than their thumb, it's like, wow, that's a huge woman.

1799
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:19,480
Or, or like, you know, trees or buildings or other people.

1800
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:25,640
And the laziest is just to say, oh, this is how many, this is how high they are in a number.

1801
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,160
But it works sometimes when there's like two people there.

1802
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:36,920
But like, Fali is quite tall in this image and big is even taller,

1803
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,720
but the average person is so much smaller.

1804
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,000
Exactly.

1805
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,920
I need, I need to, I need to draw one with them.

1806
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:48,040
Oblivion, you need to remake show of the Colossals, but with Fali and all

1807
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,720
fucking the giant woman you drew.

1808
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,440
Funny, I could, but that would take a million years.

1809
01:31:55,400 --> 01:32:00,760
I've, in general, I've just been thinking of, of like improving it out.

1810
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:11,160
And, and like, I was getting a little frustrated because I feel like when I try harder than

1811
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,840
like not at all, if I, if I don't try at all, it's like a sketch.

1812
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,160
It's like a very simple thing.

1813
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,880
I don't go over it a second time and it's fine.

1814
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,480
Maybe it's funny.

1815
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:27,320
If I try a bit harder and I try to like, okay, let's do a sketch layer and then like

1816
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:32,840
clear, clean it up with some line art, maybe color it, shade it.

1817
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,600
If I try harder, it looks worse.

1818
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,040
It's less interesting.

1819
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,800
People don't care about it as much.

1820
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,480
I don't care about it as much.

1821
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,240
And yet I spent longer on it.

1822
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,600
And then to do like a really good image.

1823
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:55,240
I, it's not like spending large amounts of time is actually like necessarily

1824
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,760
going to make it better, but it's more likely.

1825
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,920
It's just, sometimes it sucks.

1826
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:06,840
Sometimes it sucks when you work hard and then nobody cares about something you did.

1827
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,760
I've been feeling, feeling a little bad about that recently.

1828
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,360
I want these images, I want Febubri to be a success.

1829
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:17,080
I want to make stuff that people are actually like pogging about.

1830
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:18,600
I'm pogging.

1831
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:19,880
I'm pogging.

1832
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:27,800
Like for most of my favorite, like NSFW art is just like sketches or like uncolored things

1833
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,120
that like they made in like a day, you know.

1834
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:36,120
If you make these really gestural, like especially with porn, if you can get like the feel,

1835
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,400
the visual feel of the squishy bits, right?

1836
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,360
That's all people need.

1837
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,360
Yeah.

1838
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:45,000
And for that, you just have to learn the shortcuts for like,

1839
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:48,760
like in your mind, you just have to like get it, get a knack for like,

1840
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,560
which, what are the essential lines?

1841
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:57,240
Like I can construct like a nicely shaped boob with just like free lines and it looks great.

1842
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,440
And like figuring that out is what like gave me like confidence to like keep going.

1843
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:06,520
And then I figured out, you know, fies and figured out other things.

1844
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,280
And a lot of it, a lot of it helped.

1845
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:11,480
A lot of the like progress I made came from just being on the draw cast

1846
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:12,840
because I drew women all the time.

1847
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,840
And because I have to be fast, like eventually, like I figured out,

1848
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,960
oh, I can do a five, like using just two lines like this.

1849
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,080
And then like, if I want to like add a more detail, I can, but I don't usually need to because

1850
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:31,480
it's, you know, just a couple lines can be enough to convey like the shape well enough, you know.

1851
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,960
This is how plan is still give. This is how plan is still give. This is how plan is still give.

1852
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,240
Yes. We will still give.

1853
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,080
It's time to back onto the draw cast more often.

1854
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,680
I mean, I'd come on. I just, you're always doing something with other people.

1855
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,120
Oh, shit. We'll just invite you more because we love having you.

1856
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,880
Yeah, you're fine and cool.

1857
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:55,720
Thanks.

1858
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:02,680
All right. Look at this one. This one was the second day or third day.

1859
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:03,320
Yeah, this one.

1860
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:08,840
I was like, I tried really hard and I feel like I did a pretty good job.

1861
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,720
But like, I don't know, people didn't really care about it.

1862
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:19,400
And I don't, I think it was just sort of demoralizing because I spent so long

1863
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:23,960
trying to get that looking right. And I look at it now and I'm like, yeah, so it's fine.

1864
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,480
But there's just sort of like something about it that feels like,

1865
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:35,480
not that it sucks. I'm not trying to say like, oh, woe is me. My art sucks. It's bad. It's just sort of,

1866
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:41,640
I'm in an art moment. I'm having an art moment these past few days.

1867
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,760
A creative people moment.

1868
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:48,440
I don't know how to be good at what I'm doing. I'm just going to draw every day and

1869
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,880
That's just how, that's just how you do.

1870
01:35:54,440 --> 01:36:03,400
I mean, the ultimate trick of porn that I have seen is don't try to have them or not.

1871
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,480
Is this podcast still going?

1872
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:05,960
I know, right?

1873
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:06,840
Yes, Ben.

1874
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,760
It's been 300 episodes.

1875
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,040
300 episodes.

1876
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,880
It's been 300 episodes. Give it, give it a rest already, guys.

1877
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,200
Go drink some tap water, Ben, Jesus.

1878
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:22,840
Is it a coincidence that you got the worst hangover on the 300 episodes of the PCP?

1879
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:25,240
Yes.

1880
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,440
He did on purpose.

1881
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:37,400
I'm drinking Hannaford sparkling water beverage tropical punch flavor.

1882
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,160
It's the best one.

1883
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:48,760
It's got pineapple, kiwi, mango, raspberry.

1884
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:54,280
No, I was drinking raspberry before, but I finished that.

1885
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,920
Now I'm drinking tropical punch and tropical punch is yellow.

1886
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,440
It's not.

1887
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,800
I'll tropical punch you.

1888
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,400
Don't do that, Gip. That's what he wants.

1889
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,720
Violent. That's, I'll sue you.

1890
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,040
Ben's a creative person. He likes it when people do that.

1891
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,960
Ordinary people just get punched, you know, the bones broken.

1892
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:20,840
Creative people.

1893
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,560
I love being beaten.

1894
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,080
I'll take them to court for this.

1895
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,520
This is going to make me a rich man.

1896
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:33,160
Mm. And also I have pink hair and wear hipster glasses.

1897
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:36,920
Nice boob drawing.

1898
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,640
Yeah.

1899
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,360
I'm sick.

1900
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,000
Thanks.

1901
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,560
You're sick.

1902
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:39,880
Fuck.

1903
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,200
I like this situation.

1904
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,040
I've been, I don't know.

1905
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,320
These boobs look great.

1906
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:47,080
These are great boobs.

1907
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,400
Yeah.

1908
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,200
Okay.

1909
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,480
Gip, back to my tips on porn art that I see that people like.

1910
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:54,680
Don't try too hard on the line art, because no one cares about that.

1911
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:54,760
That's true.

1912
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,200
Make the skin shiny.

1913
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:56,680
True.

1914
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,160
Because everyone loves that.

1915
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:58,280
That's just true in general.

1916
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,080
That's just true in general.

1917
01:37:59,080 --> 01:37:59,240
Yeah.

1918
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:00,520
Yeah.

1919
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,640
I was looking at Clip Studio Paint.

1920
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:07,800
I don't think any of the brushes are brushes I like using except the marker,

1921
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,960
which is like a, doesn't taper.

1922
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:14,360
And it's just sort of like a, a fixed size and it's very thin.

1923
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:17,960
Could you make a custom brush that's like got the same texture as the marker,

1924
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,840
but also has like the kind of taper that you like?

1925
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,280
I, uh, I was looking around.

1926
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,600
Like maybe we'll just need to look at a tutorial.

1927
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,640
Oh, you can just edit.

1928
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,320
You can just edit the brush size.

1929
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:33,320
If you, next to the brush size is a little like, like button.

1930
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:34,360
And if you click on it, you can.

1931
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,960
I pressed around with some of the buttons.

1932
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,880
They didn't seem to like actually do anything.

1933
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:39,080
Okay.

1934
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,000
Oh, yeah.

1935
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,200
Also.

1936
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:42,920
I saw that Ben.

1937
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,120
Also the important thing.

1938
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,320
Did someone post this already?

1939
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,880
Oh, I don't know if it was posted in this chat.

1940
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,160
This one, this one's a winner.

1941
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,520
This one's a real winner.

1942
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,560
Oh my God.

1943
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,680
People do love to be racist.

1944
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,320
I just, I just saw the Godzilla dunking

1945
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,280
the basketball.

1946
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,640
That does remind me of something to bring up.

1947
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,040
I love that image so much.

1948
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:02,840
Yeah.

1949
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,320
Yeah.

1950
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:04,520
Well, I'm just posting.

1951
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:04,600
Yeah, man.

1952
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,280
How big is that fucking basketball?

1953
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,360
Oh yeah, Godzilla.

1954
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,560
Yeah, that's, that's too big.

1955
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,920
Godzilla got busy.

1956
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,320
Um, I don't know.

1957
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,680
Godzilla's a little bit is even darker

1958
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,120
than the man in that image.

1959
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,360
That's why he's so good at basketball.

1960
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,480
Ben's words, not mine.

1961
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,320
Keener.

1962
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:28,840
Disavow.

1963
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:31,160
I mean, he's got night, he's wearing nikes.

1964
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,480
As we know, creative people love to be racist.

1965
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,160
It's true.

1966
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,280
It's true.

1967
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,280
You're, as those two images together,

1968
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,080
the, the pro, the procrastinators podcast,

1969
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:44,280
300 episodes of creative people being racist.

1970
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,440
Loving it.

1971
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,920
Here's the 300 more.

1972
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,560
Yeah.

1973
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:49,960
Yeah.

1974
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,360
Speaking of racism towards.

1975
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:54,760
Oh no.

1976
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:57,560
That group of people.

1977
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,880
You're so slur, I can't remember.

1978
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,200
No, I've been, I've been workshopping it.

1979
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,120
Have you guys been hearing about

1980
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,440
the Canadian trucker protests?

1981
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:07,320
That's stupid.

1982
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:07,480
Yeah.

1983
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:10,120
I have heard a few things about it now.

1984
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:13,320
It's like super co-opted by alt-right fascist type.

1985
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,000
I heard the Simpsons predicted it,

1986
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,400
but I also heard that the Simpsons didn't predict it.

1987
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:22,040
Simpsons successfully predict and don't predict everything

1988
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,480
because they've just done everything.

1989
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,360
So what is it?

1990
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,560
Because I don't know what's going on.

1991
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:25,880
All right.

1992
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,680
So, you know, vaccine, I, I, I, I don't know.

1993
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:31,640
Vaccine's bad.

1994
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,400
Vaccine's bad.

1995
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,920
Trucker's not real.

1996
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,440
That's why Ben hasn't gotten this.

1997
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:37,000
That's why Ben hasn't gotten this.

1998
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,400
Trucker's driving back and forth across the Canadian

1999
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,880
and a U.S. border or other places,

2000
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,800
wanting them to be vaccinated

2001
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,080
because they drive around a lot

2002
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,760
and they could potentially spread things.

2003
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,920
Uh, clearly, uh, dumb.

2004
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,680
Oh, why would you want them to be vaccinated?

2005
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,160
So they're just blocking a bunch of like major roads,

2006
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,640
blurring the horns day and night.

2007
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:57,400
No one can sleep in those areas.

2008
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:01,640
Um, I got, I got messaged by a Canadian

2009
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,240
who like lives near of a protest

2010
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,560
and is like being annoyed by it.

2011
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,280
And then, yeah, it was co-opted by right-wing people.

2012
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,520
There's been people spotted with, uh, like Nazi flags,

2013
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,400
harassing people in homeless shelters,

2014
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,800
taking food from homeless shelters and shit.

2015
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,080
These truckers like, what the fuck?

2016
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:19,400
Why?

2017
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,760
Um, and just generally being terrible and inusense

2018
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,840
and the police are just kind of letting

2019
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:25,480
shit slide.

2020
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,200
They don't give a fuck.

2021
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:27,800
Um, which sucks.

2022
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,040
They really need the mongrel mob down there

2023
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,120
to straighten things out just like they did in New Zealand.

2024
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:32,600
Hell yeah.

2025
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:34,360
But you know what?

2026
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:35,560
There is one group of people

2027
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,480
who are rising up against the truckers.

2028
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:40,680
I got contacted by one of them

2029
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,040
who sent me this little video

2030
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,000
that I'm putting in chat.

2031
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,120
Oh my God, Garfield.

2032
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:44,600
Garfield?

2033
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,640
Um, look, look at that video I just dropped.

2034
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:48,520
Yeah.

2035
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,160
Um, that's a counter-protester.

2036
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,720
Welcome to ComeZone.

2037
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:55,480
Yo.

2038
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:55,720
Yeah.

2039
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:56,360
Yo.

2040
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:56,600
Yo.

2041
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:57,800
Yo.

2042
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:58,040
Wait.

2043
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:58,520
Hello.

2044
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,480
Is that on the news?

2045
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:02,200
All right.

2046
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,800
So what you're watching is not the news.

2047
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,800
It's some kind of like pro-trucker,

2048
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,240
like a live stream event.

2049
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:07,640
Right.

2050
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,720
Um, apparently there's a bunch of us going around

2051
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,760
and they're letting people call in to give their support

2052
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,680
and then a whole bunch of people are calling in

2053
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:17,080
and just playing welcome to the ComeZone on full blast

2054
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,640
to fuck them over.

2055
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:20,520
That's hilarious.

2056
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:21,960
And it's great.

2057
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,160
I support them.

2058
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,760
Like you have my official blessing.

2059
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,640
Fuck these truckers.

2060
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,440
They suck.

2061
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,720
That's pretty lit.

2062
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,080
These truckers are fuckers.

2063
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,520
These are mothered.

2064
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,920
Actually, they don't have moms.

2065
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:33,720
They got nothing.

2066
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,320
They should, uh, what did I see?

2067
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:38,360
I saw, I saw, uh, Don.

2068
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,920
It's not one Twitter account.

2069
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:43,400
I saw Don something said like,

2070
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:47,560
we need to, we need to confiscate these truckers' trucks

2071
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:50,920
and like donate the proceeds to vaccine research.

2072
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,480
So that we can, so that finally the vaccines

2073
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,840
will have less side effects.

2074
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:57,720
And then everyone will be happy.

2075
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:58,200
I don't know.

2076
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,960
Get those trucks, crush them into tiny little cubes

2077
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:06,440
and, and, and put that into vaccines.

2078
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,800
Squish it into, like, ring it out and take all the vaccines.

2079
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:12,520
If they didn't want, and then when you get injected,

2080
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,960
you'll become Optimus Prime.

2081
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,440
If they didn't want people to protest.

2082
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,960
If you get injected, you'll become a trucker.

2083
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,200
If they didn't want people to protest the vaccines,

2084
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,040
they shouldn't have put 5G in them.

2085
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,720
Well, I'm sorry.

2086
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:25,720
I don't know what they were expecting.

2087
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,680
Oh, a friend that believes in all of that.

2088
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,280
They shouldn't have, they shouldn't have.

2089
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,320
Age people.

2090
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:37,800
That is, that is what age people look like.

2091
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,960
I mean, they're right.

2092
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:40,520
It's true.

2093
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,560
It's just a fact.

2094
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,760
I love those gifts so much.

2095
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,040
It's great.

2096
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,520
These people.

2097
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,920
Are they from, are they from like a Dr. Seuss

2098
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,280
interactive video game?

2099
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:53,960
These are from, I don't know, there's a little clip art.

2100
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:55,800
They're from something.

2101
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,960
See, this is, they're probably from some, like, software.

2102
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,760
It's like, it's just like a reader rabbit bullshit.

2103
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:04,360
This is like a really good example of the frame rate being good.

2104
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:04,600
Yeah.

2105
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,320
More frames would not improve this at all.

2106
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:08,760
Sator the Barricade, son.

2107
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,600
Quick, someone take, someone take those little gifts and make them,

2108
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,680
uh, I'm having frames per second.

2109
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:21,080
Yeah, yeah, interpolate, AI interpolation.

2110
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:24,360
Disgusting.

2111
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,760
I like that little tappy feet.

2112
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,640
I love this.

2113
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,240
Like shifting around their weight.

2114
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,080
Well, let me see if I can do it.

2115
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:35,240
The more it, there's actually like more frames than you would think on this,

2116
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,800
this P, like his foot, his foot goes through like a dozen different positions.

2117
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,360
I know, right?

2118
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:42,840
Damn.

2119
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,920
They put more effort into it than they probably need.

2120
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,200
P for effort.

2121
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:46,680
Yeah.

2122
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:48,840
That's a P for effort.

2123
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:51,320
And it's still like five frames a second pathetic.

2124
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,880
I can't, I can't get off to this.

2125
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:54,840
I need it to be smooth.

2126
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:55,800
That's me.

2127
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,680
I need it to be smooth.

2128
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:57,320
G-I-B-E.

2129
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:00,920
Every time I'm on rule 34 and I see like,

2130
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:04,280
Oh, this thing's an animation and I click on it and then I see that it's like interpolated

2131
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:07,720
and these just just disgusting, like blurry, like smeared frames,

2132
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,560
like every other second, I just want to vomit.

2133
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:11,080
Yeah.

2134
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:11,640
How dare they.

2135
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,280
I knew people were going to do that to my animations eventually too.

2136
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,400
That's why I'm going to do it for them.

2137
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:16,920
I just want to vomit, but instead I come.

2138
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:17,480
I can do it right.

2139
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,720
That's very flippin' cool.

2140
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:23,080
It is.

2141
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:23,880
Yeah, that is for you.

2142
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,680
The animation smearing like high frame rate stuff is like,

2143
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:33,880
it's like a, it's like a way to like fuck with the video in the same way that like,

2144
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:41,800
what is it called when like a video file holds on a frame while it seems to be moving in the

2145
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:42,280
background?

2146
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:44,280
No, you're like a P frame that's called data mashing.

2147
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:45,880
Data mashing.

2148
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:53,080
You could use that as like a data mashing-esque fuckery thing to make something deliberately

2149
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:53,880
look weird.

2150
01:45:53,880 --> 01:46:02,600
Okay, I saw, I saw a tweet fairly recently that was about like, it was, it was like,

2151
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:09,000
you know, it was like soyjack versus Chad, but the soyjack was all like warped and looked shitty

2152
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,360
and it was like, don't use like 3D model, don't like trace 3D models for your drawings.

2153
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:20,120
And the other one was like, a well-constructed anatomical drawing of a head and it was like,

2154
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,760
uses 3D models for their drawing.

2155
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,920
And it really annoyed me.

2156
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,520
Did you, did you see this?

2157
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,960
I think I've seen that.

2158
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,000
I don't think I've seen it.

2159
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:29,640
Can you find it?

2160
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:32,840
Yeah, uh, yeah.

2161
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:38,680
It's, it's just sort of like, don't, don't, uh, trace 3D models and the one on the right.

2162
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:42,440
It's like tracing a 3D model with the yes face things like I did anyway.

2163
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:47,080
The implication is like, if you don't use, if you don't trace a 3D model and your drawing

2164
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:50,760
will just be bad and you can't, you can't draw without it.

2165
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:56,840
I think the implication more in a, in a, in a meme format like that is that, um,

2166
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:01,080
you say that these are the rules, but I'm breaking them and it's fine.

2167
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:01,960
I'm okay with it.

2168
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:07,080
It's not that it's bad to not use 3D models, but that it's fine to use 3D models.

2169
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:12,760
Yeah, like there's probably like people who will like, oh, using 3D models is cheating

2170
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,240
and it's like, it's just a fucking tool like anything else.

2171
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:15,720
Go for it.

2172
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,440
Yeah, I'm, I'm fine with that.

2173
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:22,360
Like I don't mind, I don't begrudge anyone their, their method or whatever.

2174
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:25,080
But I do think that like, I don't know.

2175
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:31,480
I think it was annoyed by the tone to be like, I've, I've, okay.

2176
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,360
Intended or not.

2177
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,920
Ben, Ben saw the meme and he's like, this is about me.

2178
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:37,480
Intended or not.

2179
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,440
I feel like the implication is like, your drawings are worse for not doing this.

2180
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,280
And I was like, no, it's not.

2181
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:48,840
Ben, you are the big artist, not retweeting little artists.

2182
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,680
Why would you be proud?

2183
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:57,480
Why, why would you be proud that you can't draw without using a 3D, without tracing a 3D reference?

2184
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:01,160
And then I, okay, I, I, then I went and I saw this person's art and like,

2185
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,360
they, their, their art is like, they do like headshots.

2186
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:09,000
They do like close up headshots of, of characters and like, you know, all they do,

2187
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,200
they use like a big anime head shape, just, just the basic head, no features or anything,

2188
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:17,000
just the shape of the head and the neck and the shoulders.

2189
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,320
And it's like, why not simply learn how to draw a circle?

2190
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:22,680
Like that's it.

2191
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,200
Like it's just a circle with a chin.

2192
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:29,560
Like there's, they, they barely even, they, I don't even see what they need the model for.

2193
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:34,920
It was a, it was so, these are, these are experts, experts.

2194
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:38,200
I mean, it's, it's, it's, I mean, they're, they're fine.

2195
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:42,120
Like their, their stuff is good and fine and, and, and, and all right.

2196
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:45,880
I just, I don't even see, I don't even see the point.

2197
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:50,360
Let me see the point of, uh, I'm trying, I'm scrolling through their feed right now,

2198
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:54,520
trying to find like, I'm assuming that it just helps remove guesswork early on,

2199
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,120
so they can get into the groove faster.

2200
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:56,760
Here, here.

2201
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,040
That's probably like the main purpose.

2202
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:04,200
Their, their work definitely has like a bit of a, like, you can tell quite clearly that

2203
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:07,720
they're using a very similar skull for all these heads.

2204
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:08,520
Yeah. Here, here, watch it.

2205
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:09,240
Watch this video.

2206
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:14,360
It shows them starting from the model and it's like, all you would need to do is just

2207
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,240
learn how to draw that shi, that head shape, right?

2208
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:21,720
And if you knew how to draw that shape, you wouldn't even, you wouldn't even need the model anymore.

2209
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:23,800
Honestly, I agree.

2210
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:27,240
Like I feel like the model is really like not even necessary for this.

2211
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:28,600
I really, I really, yeah.

2212
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:33,320
I don't even think it's, like, the purpose of a model is like to help with like a complex pose

2213
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:37,560
or if it's like a lot of foreshortening and like, you know, like a wide angle lens sort of thing.

2214
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:42,040
A complex pose, like, like, like a, a, I don't know, a baseball guy, like in mid-throw,

2215
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:43,880
it's like, well, what, what does that pose look like?

2216
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:47,800
Use a, use a reference, trace a reference to get the pose right.

2217
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,680
Because it's complicated.

2218
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,280
This is not, this is not complicated.

2219
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,120
You know?

2220
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:53,880
It's always good.

2221
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:56,760
So it seems like, like, not the time to use it.

2222
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:00,360
Like, I feel like that's like, this is like the easy stuff.

2223
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,600
They're getting a bit of same face going on.

2224
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:02,920
Yeah.

2225
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,520
Because of it, I feel like.

2226
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:04,680
Yeah.

2227
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:05,800
Maybe about two.

2228
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:06,120
A bit.

2229
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:12,440
The, the, the, the inaccuracy of human beings is what all art is based on.

2230
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:15,560
If it could be made by computers perfectly accurately,

2231
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:17,640
then what the hell is the point of us doing it?

2232
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:18,440
Yeah.

2233
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:22,040
Like, like the, no, that this is exactly that, but that's just sort of the feeling.

2234
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:23,880
Like these look fine, I guess.

2235
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,200
I just, I just, they look good.

2236
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:31,880
I just didn't like the, I didn't like the, the like, well, I can do this because I,

2237
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,800
I can do this because I use a 3D model.

2238
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,920
It's like, you can do what?

2239
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,360
You can, you can do what exactly?

2240
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:38,120
Leave me alone.

2241
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:39,000
Stop bullying me.

2242
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:41,560
Stop bullying me for not being like.

2243
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,960
Ben, you know, full well, they're just mad at,

2244
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,600
like they're just responding to like certain like annoying people

2245
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,360
and their comments or some shit.

2246
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:48,760
Yeah.

2247
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:50,360
And making fun of them, not you.

2248
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:54,760
I know it's, it's, yeah, it's about, it's about something.

2249
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:59,000
It's about some context that I'm like not privy to.

2250
01:50:59,000 --> 01:50:59,480
You're right.

2251
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,320
Someone says like, oh, that's not real art.

2252
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:05,160
That's not real art if you use a model.

2253
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:06,760
Yeah.

2254
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:08,120
And they're right.

2255
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:08,920
There are people like that.

2256
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:09,480
And they're right.

2257
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,880
Oh, so that it is about you.

2258
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:17,480
If you use a computer, if you use a computer, it's not a drawing.

2259
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:19,640
There's this channel.

2260
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:20,760
In my opinion.

2261
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,280
There's this channel on, um, it's from.

2262
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:25,560
Ben admits that he's not an artist.

2263
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:25,960
Finally.

2264
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,000
It's from Spain.

2265
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,520
And he's like, he only like criticizes artists and says like,

2266
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:34,440
oh yeah, Bob Ross is not a real artist because he just knows how to paint landscapes.

2267
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,280
I don't know how to do portrait.

2268
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:37,320
He's like, fuck you.

2269
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,360
Fuck off.

2270
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:41,880
When has Bob Ross ever drawn like a huge milky kid?

2271
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:42,680
What did I see?

2272
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:43,240
You know what?

2273
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:48,360
I saw some, I saw some video of a guy, some crypto shell being like,

2274
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,400
yo, NFT is the future.

2275
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,400
And then he has like a little interview with another guy.

2276
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:57,160
And the other guy is like, finally, you know, like, finally, you know,

2277
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,080
creators are now empowered.

2278
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:03,560
Creators will finally start creating digital artwork.

2279
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:11,320
Yeah.

2280
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:17,560
And then he qualified it with like, and then he qualified it with like,

2281
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:22,200
I mean, I mean, like, you know, like master artists, like, like real, like real artists.

2282
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:28,200
I guess the implication is like, sure, like shitty, like shitty artists use,

2283
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,320
would make digital artists.

2284
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:34,840
But now, now that NFTs are a thing, real artists will make digital artwork.

2285
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,240
And this is, and this is going to be a game changer.

2286
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:41,640
The Epes will just steal the Mona Lisa and sell it online.

2287
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:47,960
There's a weird sect of like, tech enthusiastic people who are,

2288
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:55,000
I could only imagine, like, learned about the, the email was a thing like last year.

2289
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:57,480
Like they're so stupid.

2290
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,240
They're so out of the loop on everything.

2291
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:00,600
They're like fine, they're like fine.

2292
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:04,120
People who like see the metaverse and like, whoa, you can be online?

2293
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:04,600
Like, yeah.

2294
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:04,760
Yeah.

2295
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,320
Like these people have never watched serial experiments lane,

2296
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,840
which warned us about the metaverse.

2297
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,320
And you don't see me to understand.

2298
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:12,280
Understand.

2299
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:25,800
I think it's like, it's like finance people that are like,

2300
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,360
account that are like career accountants.

2301
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:30,680
You like, these people are big nerds.

2302
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,400
You would think they'd be online, but they're not that kind of nerd.

2303
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,800
They're like some weirdos.

2304
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:41,080
They have, they have the real picture on their LinkedIn of the photograph of a,

2305
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:43,800
like a professional photography and they smiling.

2306
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:44,600
Not anymore.

2307
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:45,560
And now they got an eight.

2308
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,840
Then they're like, now they've got an eight because it's the future.

2309
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:49,400
Because it's worth it.

2310
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:51,240
We don't need to look like human beings.

2311
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:51,800
Because it's worth.

2312
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,080
We can have digital computers.

2313
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:54,280
Computers can make art.

2314
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:57,800
I thought they were just used to like, look at the stocks numbers really fast.

2315
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:58,120
Okay.

2316
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:03,800
So I just Google Garfield NFTs and I made an amazing discovery.

2317
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,720
It's like, oh God.

2318
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:06,760
Is it Garfield Eats?

2319
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:08,280
No, no, no, no.

2320
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,720
There's these like cards.

2321
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,800
They're just different kinds of Garfield.

2322
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:14,520
Why is it so small?

2323
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:15,720
Why, why so small?

2324
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:23,000
Who's, who's, is this like an actual NFT thing?

2325
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:23,480
I don't know.

2326
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,520
It just found it on Google.

2327
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,560
That is pretty funny.

2328
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:31,880
Some, somebody's, somebody's, somebody's been inspired.

2329
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,680
Bonefield.

2330
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,120
It's funny unless it's real.

2331
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:39,880
This is better than every other fucking NFT collection I've ever seen, TBH.

2332
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:42,280
If it is an NFT, it might not even be an NFT.

2333
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,000
It might not just be someone making like horror Garfields.

2334
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:50,200
I would have to assume someone just stole someone else's art and put like a border around it.

2335
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:52,920
I mean, it's all the same stuff.

2336
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:56,360
If this, if this is what NFTs are like, then I guess I'll,

2337
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,560
maybe I should jump in.

2338
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:58,200
Maybe I should.

2339
01:54:58,680 --> 01:54:59,000
Okay.

2340
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,960
These are from a post on Reddit from r slash.

2341
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,840
I'm sorry, John.

2342
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:03,560
Oh God.

2343
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:05,560
And the title is Garfield Cards.

2344
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,400
Please no NFT talk in the comments.

2345
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,680
I'm really tired of hearing it.

2346
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,840
Sorry, guys.

2347
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,120
No wonder the art's good.

2348
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,080
It's not an NFT.

2349
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:15,400
That's funny.

2350
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,160
Oh, did you guys know that like the eight,

2351
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:21,400
I'm pretty sure the eight person was a commissioned artist.

2352
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,000
He wasn't told what the art was for.

2353
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:23,560
And so.

2354
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,080
Really?

2355
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,080
Yeah, but I think I heard that.

2356
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:27,560
I'm not sure.

2357
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:30,120
I saw a picture of her.

2358
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:30,360
Yeah.

2359
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,800
She's like a sexy lady.

2360
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:34,760
Yeah.

2361
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:35,400
How dare she?

2362
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,480
How dare she be sexy at all?

2363
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:40,440
It's a problem for me that she looks the way she does.

2364
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:42,920
I don't like it.

2365
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:43,640
I agree.

2366
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:45,000
I guess what you're talking about.

2367
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:50,040
The NFT lady, the one who's supposed to be the monkeys.

2368
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:50,120
Oh.

2369
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:50,680
The apes.

2370
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:51,480
Yeah, she's just a person.

2371
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:52,200
She's a pretty lady.

2372
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:53,480
Yeah.

2373
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,920
But I just, that's the thing I heard.

2374
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,520
I'm not sure if that's true, but it's true.

2375
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,680
No, she's ugly on the inside because of the NFTs.

2376
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,800
I don't think, okay, but I guess she, I mean, I don't know.

2377
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,600
Did she not know what the apes were going to be used for?

2378
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,600
She was just someone that someone hired?

2379
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:15,240
Yes, from what I heard, from what I heard, she was commissioned to draw the NFTs

2380
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:19,080
without being told.

2381
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:22,280
But they're, okay, okay, but they're, but they're not drawn, right?

2382
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:26,280
They're like assembled from, you know, the template.

2383
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,400
Yeah, they're randomized.

2384
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:30,840
I mean, she had, she drew the assets, obviously.

2385
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:31,720
Yeah.

2386
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:32,680
Yeah.

2387
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:37,560
Well, I mean, I guess, I guess it makes sense.

2388
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:40,440
I mean, before they, before they blew up, like how would you even know?

2389
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:45,000
Even if someone told you what they were, you'd be like, okay.

2390
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:46,840
Oh yeah, no, she didn't.

2391
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:49,640
Did she see like any of the fucking millions of dollars?

2392
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:52,680
This was back in the beginning when NFTs were first.

2393
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:58,040
So I found, I looked up, I literally just looked up NFT lady, monkey lady.

2394
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:01,560
And it's like, NFT lady, monkey lady.

2395
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:09,160
I feel, I feel extremely sure that they, she does not see any like profit sharing from the

2396
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:09,560
Yeah.

2397
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,400
She created the artwork after connecting with a creative, creative agent,

2398
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,920
Doug Nicole Munds, who came across her portfolio.

2399
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:24,440
And they basically, like, this is like, they, they had to like draw these assets.

2400
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:29,880
They just, they just wanted an ape that's like kind of jaded inside of life,

2401
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:33,560
but has all the money and time in the world and hangs out in a mental bar, in a metal bar,

2402
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,240
apparently, that was their instructions.

2403
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,200
And hangs out in a metal bar?

2404
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,000
Yeah.

2405
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,200
She was the lead artist behind the original collection.

2406
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:45,320
Whereas other artists took care of the ape traits and environments,

2407
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:49,560
put a whimsical settings, the base structure and the character ape was all her thing.

2408
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:54,360
She expressed sadness that despite the popularity of the multimillion dollar ape,

2409
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:56,680
not many people know that she's made them.

2410
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,960
And yeah, she didn't even, she didn't even get, um,

2411
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:01,400
Yeah.

2412
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:02,520
Yeah.

2413
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,400
She didn't even get credit.

2414
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:07,000
I'm sad, but I'm not being harassed by all the people who rightfully hate NFTs.

2415
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:07,720
No, no, no.

2416
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:12,520
However, however, comma, she's dropped her debut NFT series under her own name.

2417
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,360
I bet she was paid like a few, I bet she was paid like a few thousand dollars.

2418
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:16,680
Yeah.

2419
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,040
Yeah.

2420
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:19,720
She's got her own NFT.

2421
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:21,400
She's, she's not, she's not good.

2422
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:22,200
She's got her own NFT.

2423
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,880
She dropped her own NFT series.

2424
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:24,440
Yeah.

2425
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:24,840
Okay.

2426
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,160
Okay.

2427
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:26,760
She deserves to miss out then.

2428
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:27,880
Of course she does.

2429
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:31,960
I mean, I think she deserves to miss out because I think people should be paid

2430
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:34,600
for the labor that they, that you know, that they do.

2431
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:39,560
However, comma, I think that she shouldn't, communism.

2432
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,760
You know, you know, you know, Seatull, your principles, I agree with them.

2433
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:46,280
Wait, people should get paid for their work.

2434
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:48,120
What?

2435
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,760
What have I been doing hating the PCB all these years?

2436
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:59,800
It was where this is your exposure.

2437
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,080
We're finally showing you.

2438
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:01,720
This is it.

2439
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:05,800
You've been building up credit for the, for, for two years now.

2440
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:07,480
And now you're finally catching it in.

2441
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:09,160
Yes.

2442
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,520
Finally after 70 years.

2443
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,560
A Stereos coconut liked my, liked my tweet.

2444
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,880
Not, not even a good tweet.

2445
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,240
Not even a, not even a funny tweet, not a popular tweet.

2446
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:22,840
This tweet got like four likes.

2447
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:24,280
Sorry.

2448
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:24,520
Seven.

2449
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:25,640
One of them was him.

2450
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,080
It was, it was one of them was him.

2451
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:28,040
It's just a reply.

2452
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:32,600
It's just a reply to someone posting about the, uh, oh God, what's,

2453
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,560
fuck, what's her name?

2454
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:37,480
The, the lady, Mallory, Mallory Eudicious.

2455
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:43,240
Oh, the, the lady who made the comic with shoplifting new guy.

2456
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:47,480
I just, I just, I just made an angry reply to someone posted about the,

2457
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:49,160
the, the, the shoplifting comic.

2458
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,120
And I just made a reply.

2459
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:53,560
It's being like, I hate, I hate people that are mad about this.

2460
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,720
No, no joke.

2461
01:59:55,720 --> 02:00:00,200
No, nothing, nothing, but, but, but, uh, a Stereo saw it and was like, I agree.

2462
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,200
I also hate these people.

2463
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:07,880
Me and, me and, me and the, me and a Stereos were, we're like peas in a pot.

2464
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:16,280
I gotta say, in all my years of hating PCP, the worst, the, the, the most hardest

2465
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:19,320
to edit was the, the Wonderbird guy.

2466
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,080
It was just so annoying.

2467
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:23,160
Oh yeah.

2468
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:25,400
He just sounds like an insane person.

2469
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:26,520
He sucks so much.

2470
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:27,800
He's so boring.

2471
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,480
He's so boring.

2472
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:34,600
It just the entire time it sounded like he was just like on the verge of like

2473
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,280
snapping and like screaming.

2474
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:40,920
He just sounded like he was just like on edge, like an angry.

2475
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:41,720
I didn't understand.

2476
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:44,760
That guy is neither wonderful nor weird.

2477
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:45,240
He had.

2478
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:47,000
I don't know.

2479
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,920
He had a way of speaking like he was always on the verge of getting to the point.

2480
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:52,920
I don't know.

2481
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:56,440
He's like he constantly sounds like he's about, he's about to get to the point

2482
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:00,440
and say something important, but he never does.

2483
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:03,320
It's not real.

2484
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:04,760
The point doesn't exist.

2485
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:07,480
Hey, we've been going for like a couple of hours.

2486
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,920
Do you want to get a voice mask or anything?

2487
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,520
What are you, what are you, what are you in a hurry or something?

2488
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:20,280
I have, look, it's not like I vaguely, I vaguely remember Eleazar complaining every

2489
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:22,200
single time these, these podcasts.

2490
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:25,640
Eleazar has to put all of these Garfield images in the episode.

2491
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:26,680
So much editing Eleazar.

2492
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,240
Now we'll see.

2493
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,240
So this is the 300 episode.

2494
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:32,120
This is 300.

2495
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:33,240
Yeah, do we have 300?

2496
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,160
All right.

2497
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:37,160
I have some, I have, I have another topic.

2498
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:39,160
I said the AI thing was a two pronged topic.

2499
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,360
Here's part two.

2500
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:41,800
AI voice generation.

2501
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:45,480
Someone called in the last PCP after I left because I listened to it.

2502
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:48,920
They had a Nate AI voice.

2503
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,800
They have a bunch of them.

2504
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:51,480
They made a Dr. Wolf one.

2505
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:52,920
They've done all the ponies.

2506
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:58,360
I want to know who that person is because let me tell you, when I edited the PCP,

2507
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:02,120
you know, I eventually went back and deleted all the files because they were taking up

2508
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:07,000
literally like 150 gigabytes or like a terabyte on my computer or some shit.

2509
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:07,800
Yeah.

2510
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:12,760
But I kept all of Nate's audio that I had cleaned up because expressly for the purpose

2511
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:19,800
of an AI, if you want 10 hours of crisp, clean, Nate audio and wave format that is completely

2512
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:23,400
unfettered by like YouTube compression and there's no one else talking.

2513
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,000
It's just Nate by himself.

2514
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,560
I can give you like 10 hours worth of training data and you can make that AI sound really good.

2515
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:30,360
Oh no.

2516
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:37,160
I will give it to you and then we will really have Nate returns on the PCP title will be correct.

2517
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:38,280
The perfect Nate.

2518
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,840
I don't know if I have to ask you to like

2519
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:42,280
We can build a new Nate.

2520
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:42,920
The voices.

2521
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:43,560
A better Nate.

2522
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,320
Maybe a voicemail is where she fucks Nate.

2523
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:46,520
You can build a new Nate.

2524
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:53,160
This Nate will give spew communist propaganda.

2525
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:54,680
I see you always manage to.

2526
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:57,880
I bet a foster should know how to have a weird socialism.

2527
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:02,120
Weird socialism.

2528
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:05,480
I just think that I just think that communism is like weirdly utilitarian.

2529
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:06,680
I don't know why he doesn't see it.

2530
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:15,240
Oh, Nate had a Nate had a Oki on the on the last.

2531
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,240
What's what's it called?

2532
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:17,960
Gamer zone.

2533
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,440
So I like I like I like Oki.

2534
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:23,240
Me and Oki have talked on Twitter a little bit.

2535
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:23,880
Oki's good.

2536
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,240
I forget that Nate still makes content.

2537
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,040
He just makes the gamer zone.

2538
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:35,080
It's like content but with funny people who aren't tricksy.

2539
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:39,800
This is this is not really a I can't it's not Nate's.

2540
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,320
This isn't Nate's fault exactly.

2541
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:45,400
But it's funny that like people on Kiwi Farms like love Nate.

2542
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:49,880
Like Kiwi Farms people when they talk about the PCP.

2543
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:52,760
There was one post recently that was really funny because it was like

2544
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:56,440
just like he didn't even go into specifics.

2545
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,280
He just was like, man, it's funny.

2546
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:03,560
It's funny just how far all the PCP all the PCP have just fallen into complete

2547
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:06,440
ruin and disrepair and disreputability.

2548
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:10,680
And except Nate, except Nate, obviously, like Nate's Nate has

2549
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:15,640
Nate has obviously been fine and and kept his his head out of the muck or whatever.

2550
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:19,480
And I just don't know how you can how you can read that.

2551
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:22,840
I don't know how that's your reading of the situation that he's like Nate hasn't

2552
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:27,160
been putting out content really like regularly for like two years.

2553
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:31,880
How can you have a sense going full since going full time is output is dropped.

2554
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:35,160
Yeah, I mean, that's what Sean's constantly shitting on him,

2555
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:39,720
which is why I don't understand why Michelle thought he was going to spicy salt her.

2556
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:42,680
Um, yeah, I don't know.

2557
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,720
Sorry, spicy salts Nate, not spicy salt her.

2558
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:51,640
She was afraid that would be stolen by well to spicy salts.

2559
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:58,040
Well, I mean, the the analog would be if you spicy salted Nate,

2560
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:00,360
that would mean you tried to kidnap Michelle, right?

2561
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:02,600
Oh, I thought if you spicy.

2562
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:04,200
Okay, then you did just spicy salt.

2563
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,760
Someone is to attempt to kidnap their wife.

2564
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:10,200
Okay, but it would never show.

2565
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:13,080
I was trying to spicy salt Michelle wouldn't he be trying to kid that.

2566
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:15,480
Well, Trixie also didn't get married.

2567
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:15,800
Never.

2568
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:16,920
Nevertheless, she called.

2569
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,560
She said she said she said wife.

2570
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:23,240
Same as she said, like she bought a house when she merely rented it.

2571
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:27,240
This comes this comes up occasionally.

2572
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:33,480
Crack, crack occasionally complains that and he's right to do so that like,

2573
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,920
Trixie would just use the wrong word.

2574
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:38,280
She would just describe things wrong in a way that is basically lying,

2575
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:43,000
but like in a way that you're like, I don't know if if she knows that she's wrong

2576
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,120
or if she's just dumb and doesn't understand that these things are different.

2577
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:48,360
Things like renting a house versus buying a house.

2578
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,760
She said she bought bought a house when she rented one.

2579
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:51,800
They're like, they're not the same.

2580
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:55,640
And like, I genuinely don't know if she knows these two things are different.

2581
02:05:56,200 --> 02:06:00,600
Calling May her wife when she was a young saying, you know, that's not that's a little

2582
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,400
less of a thing.

2583
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,920
I guess, I guess.

2584
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:05,000
Did you know, you know, this this is funny.

2585
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:09,800
May messaged me the other day or a few weeks ago.

2586
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:10,920
Oh my God.

2587
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:12,200
She meant she meant.

2588
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,200
Okay, I call I call me.

2589
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,600
I openly call May a Nazi on Twitter.

2590
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:19,480
Like I add her and I say like, fuck you, Nazi.

2591
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:19,880
Die.

2592
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:20,040
Right.

2593
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:23,320
Like I say stuff like I say stuff like that to her and I mean it.

2594
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:24,440
And I absolutely mean it.

2595
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:25,240
And it's not a joke.

2596
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:30,200
And then she but she sees me like post mean things about Trixie.

2597
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:33,880
And then she messaged me to be like, Ben, I appreciate you so much.

2598
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,960
Like, I like this made my day, Ben.

2599
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:39,560
I love that I'm like, she doesn't have any standards.

2600
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:41,560
Yeah, she doesn't have any like a true Nazi.

2601
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:43,240
She doesn't have any standards.

2602
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:44,680
She's not even like offended.

2603
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:45,880
She just likes you.

2604
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:48,920
She likes that you hate the person that she like that she doesn't like.

2605
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:49,320
That's it.

2606
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:50,120
It's true.

2607
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:51,000
That's it.

2608
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:53,080
That's all there is to it.

2609
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:56,680
It's exactly like that guy I was arguing with in the YouTube comments

2610
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:00,680
of that one guy who claimed that Stone Toss was and smiling friends when he isn't.

2611
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:04,360
Yeah, because most of the comments were rightfully complaining.

2612
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:05,880
Like one that's not Stone Toss.

2613
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,840
Also, he's a Nazi.

2614
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:07,880
I don't think they'd put him in.

2615
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:13,720
And there were like two or three people who were like, no, he's not a Nazi.

2616
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:14,520
Why would you think that?

2617
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:15,800
He's never done anything like that.

2618
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,520
He said he said he said he's not one.

2619
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:19,640
So he's not one.

2620
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:26,840
Yeah, he said that he wasn't in Germany in like the 1940s and that all the Holocaust

2621
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:29,800
and now stuff is true, which is actually how he responded.

2622
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,880
He said, yeah, yeah, all the stuff I'm saying is true, actually.

2623
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:32,760
Yeah, yeah, literally.

2624
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:33,400
That's just defense.

2625
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:37,160
He's like, I can't be a Nazi if the Holocaust actually didn't happen.

2626
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,680
Like that's just fucking different.

2627
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:42,840
And he's like, oh, and also like I like crypto.

2628
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:43,160
You know what?

2629
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:44,680
Nazis don't like crypto.

2630
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,080
Yeah.

2631
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:48,120
He's like, dude, you're just a Nazi and a crypto bro.

2632
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:49,240
You're too bad things now.

2633
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:50,680
Equally bad things.

2634
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:52,680
Equally, equally bad.

2635
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:53,640
Yeah.

2636
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:56,600
But the person I was arguing with, like I went through the trouble again,

2637
02:07:56,600 --> 02:08:02,200
another huge YouTube comment where I like listed 20 of his comics with the dates and

2638
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:05,400
explained exactly all of the Nazi messaging, all of the Holocaust denial.

2639
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:10,600
How do you look at the one about like, you know, the one with like the the pie graph

2640
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,080
with like the 2% of the Jewish population?

2641
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:13,640
Yeah, yeah.

2642
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:14,760
How do you look at that?

2643
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:16,120
How do you explain that?

2644
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:18,120
If it's not, if it's not not, it's just not.

2645
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:23,240
The implication is that Jews aren't white people, which is a very common Nazi thing

2646
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:25,560
because they they need an excuse to kill them or some shit.

2647
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:27,640
Whoopie Goldberg needs to learn that.

2648
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:32,840
Okay, look, I'm sorry I'm being so hard on Whoopie this week.

2649
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:37,640
Yeah, I left this huge comment detailing every little thing all the times that he's like

2650
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:41,880
shown scientists like proving that, you know, people of color are dumber and then like,

2651
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:47,240
oh, but the cowardly leftists are too afraid to admit the real science that black people are dumb.

2652
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:48,760
I know he's done that shit.

2653
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:54,760
And I listed all these things and the guy like responded by like saying,

2654
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:57,240
those things aren't even wrong.

2655
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:58,840
Also, the Nazis aren't that bad.

2656
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:01,080
Did you know the allies sided with communists?

2657
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:01,320
Yeah.

2658
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:03,240
So I'm like, okay.

2659
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:04,680
So you just admitted he was a Nazi.

2660
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:06,360
That's how it always boils down.

2661
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:07,720
It always comes down to that.

2662
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:10,200
If you get into the weeds, that's it always comes.

2663
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:11,480
It always shakes out that way.

2664
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:14,440
Can you give a comment for a key screenshot that and have Ellie say.

2665
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:17,160
I have I have the video got fucking deleted.

2666
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:19,800
The guy deleted his own video probably because of a comment section.

2667
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:22,600
And also because they probably realized, yeah, it's not a stone toss difference.

2668
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:24,360
So the video have screenshots.

2669
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:29,960
So the video was about how stone toss is in smiling friends, even though he's not.

2670
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:30,840
Okay.

2671
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:36,360
So the video was called like like internet like references in smiling friends and it showed

2672
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:39,320
a bunch of examples and it showed a picture of a grease puddle on the floor and said,

2673
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:42,120
look, it's a reference to smiling friends is just one of many examples.

2674
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:43,720
You mean it's not a reference.

2675
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,640
It looks nothing like stone toss.

2676
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:47,080
It's just, oh, let me see.

2677
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:48,440
I could find a picture of the grease puddle.

2678
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:49,000
Hold on.

2679
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:49,240
Yeah.

2680
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:52,760
And then it shows the screenshots of the comment so we can all see it.

2681
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:56,040
Is a grease puddle a stone toss thing?

2682
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:56,680
I don't even know.

2683
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:57,640
It's not.

2684
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:57,960
It has a face.

2685
02:09:57,960 --> 02:10:01,240
They think that they it has a face and they think that it's the cost of face.

2686
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:03,560
It ascribes the the lip the over.

2687
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:05,160
Oh, sure.

2688
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:09,640
That this grease puddle had like it's sort of like it's sort of like a blur has that.

2689
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:10,280
Yeah.

2690
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:10,600
Yeah.

2691
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,360
It's like because the Simpsons never existed.

2692
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:13,800
Oh, yeah.

2693
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:16,120
The Simpsons and Futurama and all that.

2694
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:19,480
I mean, what what else could that be but a stone toss reference?

2695
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:20,840
Clearly.

2696
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:21,240
All right.

2697
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:22,040
Oh, I have.

2698
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:23,160
Oh, let me find the comment.

2699
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:28,040
It's so funny that he just in the end just admitted that he is an Aussie and that's why

2700
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:29,080
he's defending stone toss.

2701
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:33,080
Here it is.

2702
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:38,280
Let me copy that and show me, show me, show me.

2703
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:38,680
There you go.

2704
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,320
Show me, show me, show me.

2705
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:39,880
That's like the end.

2706
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:41,240
That's like the very end of the discussion.

2707
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:43,160
Do that trick.

2708
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:45,160
The one that makes me scream.

2709
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:47,640
She said doesn't calling them.

2710
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:48,200
Do you have a little screen?

2711
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:48,440
Shut up.

2712
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:49,800
You're all those things.

2713
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,960
All those things are demonstrably true.

2714
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:56,600
Just calling it Nazi propaganda doesn't mean that it's not true, dude.

2715
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:00,040
Nazis aren't even all that bad.

2716
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:01,160
Just not even.

2717
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:01,800
Oh, my God.

2718
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,000
I thought you were paraphrasing.

2719
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,280
I thought you were paraphrasing.

2720
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,280
Nazis aren't even bad.

2721
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:07,560
That's disgusting, he did it.

2722
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:09,800
Good old Hazen.

2723
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:13,560
Nazis aren't even bad lucks here in the comment section.

2724
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:16,280
Good for him.

2725
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:16,840
Good for him.

2726
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:20,520
Living, sticking to his principles.

2727
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:24,920
All I wanted to say about that was I said something.

2728
02:11:24,920 --> 02:11:25,800
It was a few weeks ago.

2729
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:32,360
I just made a tricksy tweet and the day after I called her a Nazi may message DM me to be like,

2730
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:33,720
Ben, I appreciate you.

2731
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,400
Thank you so much for doing this.

2732
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,520
And I said, thanks.

2733
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:39,800
And then she told me, did you know, did you know tricksy used to cry,

2734
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:44,200
used to literally like cry tears when I, when I would say like,

2735
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:45,960
we need to take care of the taxes?

2736
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:50,040
Like instead of, like instead of doing, doing her taxes,

2737
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:51,400
tricksy would just cry.

2738
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:53,960
And I was like, lol, that, that sounds about right.

2739
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:55,480
That doesn't surprise me at all.

2740
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,840
But thanks for confirming.

2741
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,680
Thanks for confirming what I already assumed to be true.

2742
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:04,680
Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick.

2743
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:07,080
The one that makes you be Nazi.

2744
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:09,320
Die, die.

2745
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:11,640
Die, die.

2746
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:14,600
All those things are demonstrably true.

2747
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:17,160
Calling them Nazi doesn't make them any less real.

2748
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:26,440
And it has to be stated, the things I listed were Holocaust denial,

2749
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:30,200
the JQ, the great replacement, race, realism, anti-Semitism,

2750
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:32,360
and right supremacist pseudo-science.

2751
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:34,520
Even admits that the pseudo-science is true.

2752
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:38,360
Calling them Nazi doesn't make those things not real though.

2753
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:40,760
I love it.

2754
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:41,560
I love it.

2755
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,600
It's so fucked.

2756
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:47,720
I can't believe, I can't believe smiling friends, I don't even need the final word.

2757
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:50,600
I can't believe smiling friends promotes Holocaust denial,

2758
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,960
the JQ, the great replacement, race, realism, anti-Semitism

2759
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:55,560
and white supremacist pseudo-science.

2760
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:56,440
That's so fucked up.

2761
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:00,760
Doesn't the smiling friends guy do NFTs?

2762
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:05,320
He did some like very early on and then never mentioned NFTs again.

2763
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,160
Oh, did he?

2764
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:07,640
Okay.

2765
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:10,360
No, it was just free of him, I think.

2766
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:12,440
It was just like free little animated GIFs.

2767
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:15,400
Well, all right, okay, nice.

2768
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:19,720
Show's good though, I liked it.

2769
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:22,280
I have, you know, I tried to watch it, I googled it,

2770
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:25,800
trying to find some site that had it for free to watch

2771
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:27,080
and I couldn't find it and I gave up.

2772
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,960
You can watch my first two episodes for free on Adult Swim

2773
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:34,600
and I can link you a little funny zip file with the rest of the episodes if you want.

2774
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:36,520
It wanted me to like sign up for an account,

2775
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:38,280
I didn't want to make an account on Adult Swim.

2776
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:40,600
Wait, I didn't even have to make an account.

2777
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:40,840
No?

2778
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:41,960
Did you already have an account?

2779
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:43,560
I wasn't even allowed on the site.

2780
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:44,440
Because I was a child.

2781
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:50,680
No, because I was swimming or maybe because I wasn't swimming.

2782
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:55,720
I mean, I can just give you, like, I have a media fire link

2783
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:59,000
that I uploaded myself with all the episodes except episode one,

2784
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:02,200
which should be available for free somewhere.

2785
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:04,360
Isn't that the pilot?

2786
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:05,880
Yeah, the pilot.

2787
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:07,880
I thought it was just, wasn't it even on the YouTube for free?

2788
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:08,360
I don't remember.

2789
02:14:09,160 --> 02:14:11,080
They put it on YouTube, that's how...

2790
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:14,840
I don't know why, I googled it and I didn't see any result,

2791
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:17,880
I didn't immediately find results that showed me it and I was like,

2792
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:21,000
ah, I'll just go watch Mind Killer instead.

2793
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:24,840
I'll just go watch Mind Sweeper.

2794
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,960
No regrets.

2795
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:30,920
No, why Mind Sweeper when you can play Wordle?

2796
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:33,080
Yeah.

2797
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:34,440
Wordle's the new Mind Sweeper.

2798
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:42,120
Because Wordle is only fun due to luck.

2799
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:44,040
I found a...

2800
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:45,320
Like it's easy to do.

2801
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:47,480
It's easy to do, but like whether or not you have

2802
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:52,200
a fun time is due to like the luck of your guesses versus what the word is.

2803
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,120
Wordle basically solves itself.

2804
02:14:56,200 --> 02:15:00,360
Wordle, I think Wordle is designed to make you think you're smart when you're not.

2805
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:06,120
You think you're solving a puzzle, but actually the letters are eliminating themselves.

2806
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,120
I guess that's good puzzle design.

2807
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:11,800
Good game design.

2808
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:21,080
There's some smartness going on if you can think of the word with the information you have,

2809
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:23,640
but not when it starts off, you have no information.

2810
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:27,480
I use a Scrabble dictionary, so I don't think there's not even any skill involved.

2811
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:29,880
I don't even have to know words.

2812
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:34,200
Feels like cheating.

2813
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:35,480
I don't even speak English.

2814
02:15:35,480 --> 02:15:36,920
Feels like cheating, but it's not.

2815
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,640
I should play on a hard mode.

2816
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,800
It should switch to hard mode.

2817
02:15:42,680 --> 02:15:44,040
Yeah, you got to switch to hard mode.

2818
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:47,800
I mean, I pretty much already play on a hard mode already.

2819
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:51,800
Playing on like when you can just do whatever on each thing.

2820
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:55,080
You just do two words that have a bunch of like common letters in them.

2821
02:15:55,880 --> 02:15:58,920
You get too much information and it's like, oh, it's obviously this.

2822
02:15:58,920 --> 02:15:59,720
That's right.

2823
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:02,920
Well, but I want to win though, but I don't want to lose.

2824
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:03,720
You can't win.

2825
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:06,280
The only way to win is to get extremely lucky on the first guess.

2826
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:07,320
Are you winning, Ben?

2827
02:16:10,600 --> 02:16:13,320
Yeah, because it's some playing on easy mode.

2828
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:17,000
I use the same starting word every single time, audio,

2829
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,320
and eventually it'll be Ryan.

2830
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:20,200
I use aches.

2831
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:23,080
Wait, aches?

2832
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,440
A-C-H-E-S.

2833
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:30,760
I use a different word every time.

2834
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:35,000
If I think of a funny word, I'll use a different one.

2835
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:37,320
I wanted to start yesterday.

2836
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:39,000
I wanted to start with the word think.

2837
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:43,400
I wanted to start with the word think, and I'm like, no, I'll do audio first.

2838
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:45,720
And then it only got me like one letter.

2839
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:47,960
And I'm like, okay, well, that letter is in think.

2840
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:49,160
So I'll just type think anyway.

2841
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,160
And then think gave me way more results.

2842
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,400
And then I got it the next try.

2843
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:55,800
I could have gotten it in two if I just started with think.

2844
02:16:56,520 --> 02:17:01,000
Do you think of like the common ways that letters group up

2845
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,800
to form parts of words like T-H and S-H?

2846
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:04,680
Somebody.

2847
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:07,320
And Q-U and like things.

2848
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:07,720
Somebody.

2849
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:14,280
I usually go for like there or not there, but like maybe there with an I-E-I-R.

2850
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:17,800
Somebody somewhere has gotten it in one.

2851
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:19,880
Yeah.

2852
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:21,080
Munchie got in one.

2853
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:21,320
What?

2854
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:21,800
Whoa, really?

2855
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:23,880
Munchie got in one really early on.

2856
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:24,680
He was like, wait, really?

2857
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:28,280
Now every everything will be like less satisfying for now.

2858
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:28,840
Yeah, why?

2859
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:29,480
Yeah, that's it.

2860
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:31,320
You're done.

2861
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:34,120
You beat wordle when you get it in one.

2862
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:35,080
You don't have to play anymore.

2863
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:35,560
You're free.

2864
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:38,040
Then they show up at your house and give you a medal.

2865
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:40,760
They give you a word.

2866
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:42,040
And then that's when he quit the PZP.

2867
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:44,040
He's like, you know, I already accomplished my life.

2868
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:44,760
I don't need to be here.

2869
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:49,400
Because he had a vision of him winning wordle.

2870
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:49,960
Exactly.

2871
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:51,640
And it like in years in the future.

2872
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:56,760
Hayao Miyazaki comes to your house and gives you a congressional medal of honor

2873
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:57,880
and gives you the purple heart.

2874
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:59,160
I don't know why it's him.

2875
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:00,760
What are the what's the mistake?

2876
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:03,160
Does Ohio have five letters?

2877
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:06,680
H-A-Y-A-O?

2878
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:08,120
Hayao?

2879
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,720
Because I must.

2880
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:12,280
Ohio.

2881
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:12,840
Ohio.

2882
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:13,480
Because I must.

2883
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:17,480
Do you see my you see my Simpsons?

2884
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:18,680
You see my Simpsons comic?

2885
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:20,440
The what?

2886
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:21,480
Yeah, you retweeted it.

2887
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:22,440
I retweeted some.

2888
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:27,240
I think Cheesy Manfredo, I think like remembered it or someone someone like

2889
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:31,960
remembered that I drew that Simpsons comic playing like three years ago

2890
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:34,760
and like liked it and retweeted it and I was like hey that was pretty good.

2891
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:39,480
I should it was the best thing I ever made and it's all been downhill from there.

2892
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:42,600
Yeah, let me let me find it.

2893
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:49,480
It's it's almost like it's okay remember when I used to make comics?

2894
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:51,960
When I used to draw stuff.

2895
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:53,560
Ben same predicted the Simpsons.

2896
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:56,200
Oh my god, this is great.

2897
02:18:56,200 --> 02:18:57,000
I love this.

2898
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,200
I think it's pretty funny.

2899
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,120
I think it's pretty funny.

2900
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:01,640
It's probably the funniest thing I ever made.

2901
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,320
Well, look, the image appeared.

2902
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:06,280
He's drinking CC lemon.

2903
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:10,280
I love CC lemon over there.

2904
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:11,240
I've never had it.

2905
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:14,040
I just know that it had like Simpsons branding.

2906
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,160
I guess it's lemonade.

2907
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:19,000
I don't know.

2908
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:24,040
It's constructively criticizing lemons.

2909
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:28,040
They could they could they could be better.

2910
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,200
They could they could be doing a better job, frankly.

2911
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:35,640
That's what the lemons say to you when you drink it.

2912
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:40,600
Constructive criticism lemon.

2913
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:44,920
I don't know.

2914
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:49,160
Lol, Japan.

2915
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,280
Japan sure is wacky.

2916
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:52,120
Wow, it's so funny.

2917
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:53,720
I love Japan period.

2918
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:56,360
I do love Japan period.

2919
02:19:58,120 --> 02:19:58,520
I don't know.

2920
02:19:58,520 --> 02:19:59,240
You guys want to go?

2921
02:19:59,240 --> 02:19:59,880
You guys want to start?

2922
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:01,240
I love Edo period.

2923
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:03,560
voicemails or Japan?

2924
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:06,200
Yeah, voicemails.

2925
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,080
All right, voicemails.

2926
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:10,600
We have two two fucking many of them.

2927
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:13,000
Oh my god.

2928
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:13,720
I can't wait.

2929
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:14,440
I can't wait.

2930
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:17,320
Is it people saying 300 related things?

2931
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:17,960
I don't know.

2932
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:20,280
We didn't even say this is Sparta.

2933
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:22,440
That was my big idea and I forgot.

2934
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:22,760
Say it.

2935
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:23,000
Say it.

2936
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:27,000
I know there is there is actually like not too late.

2937
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:27,480
It's too late.

2938
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:28,360
The moment is past.

2939
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:29,800
Hold on.

2940
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:31,640
You just reminded me.

2941
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:32,600
Microtopics.

2942
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:35,240
I have like 11 YouTube channels actually.

2943
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:36,440
Yeah.

2944
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:37,480
Wow.

2945
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:39,480
And all of them,

2946
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:42,040
almost all of them have like seen success at some point.

2947
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:43,560
Randomly.

2948
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:46,360
Oh, I need to find this one.

2949
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:49,000
I don't.

2950
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:49,320
I know.

2951
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:52,280
I only I think I know three of them.

2952
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:53,960
You have that.

2953
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:54,760
Yeah, I have that.

2954
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:56,040
There's a pony audio one.

2955
02:20:57,160 --> 02:20:59,480
Yeah, pony audio one.

2956
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:01,720
Didn't you have one that was like a pony audio drama?

2957
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:03,160
Yes, I did.

2958
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:03,960
Yeah.

2959
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:05,880
So.

2960
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:07,240
So I know three of your channel.

2961
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:08,600
Yeah.

2962
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:09,000
So I.

2963
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:09,240
All right.

2964
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:10,200
So there's a blooming fall.

2965
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:11,480
There's a blooming fall after dark,

2966
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:14,040
which used to be called Demis Studios.

2967
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:18,840
It was an old ship post channel that made like really bad videos

2968
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:21,160
and promoted conspiracy theories as a joke.

2969
02:21:21,160 --> 02:21:21,800
My favorite.

2970
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:24,920
And then I rebranded it when it got popular.

2971
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,160
There's Nightfall Studios,

2972
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:30,680
which also used to be called a blooming fall that has like 60k subscribers.

2973
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:32,040
There's Nightfalls Radio,

2974
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:33,560
which has the audio drama.

2975
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:33,800
Yeah.

2976
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,040
There's a blooming fall plays,

2977
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:36,840
which is a gaming channel.

2978
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:38,440
I had a video blog there as well.

2979
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:39,560
Actually, let me mention that.

2980
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:42,520
So yeah, the the Mrs.

2981
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:47,640
Spartiffing reminded me of this video on one of a fucking random channel I made in like 2009.

2982
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:49,240
Dragon Master Pivot.

2983
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:54,680
Um, this video got 100,000 views randomly on that like 29.

2984
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:56,200
29 subscribers.

2985
02:21:57,480 --> 02:21:57,800
Yeah.

2986
02:21:57,800 --> 02:21:59,000
I it's the only video.

2987
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:00,840
Okay.

2988
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:02,440
So back in like 2008,

2989
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:04,600
I was like super obsessed with like 13 years ago.

2990
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:07,800
Did YouTube even exist 13 years ago?

2991
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:10,360
It usually has been around since 2005.

2992
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:10,920
Oh, dear.

2993
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:15,160
Um, it's been around for like 17 years.

2994
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:16,600
Okay.

2995
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:16,920
Yes.

2996
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:18,600
Yes.

2997
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:19,080
Oh my god.

2998
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:19,800
That's crazy.

2999
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:20,360
Whatever.

3000
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:24,360
But anyways, I made like a free side channels because I was like,

3001
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,120
I want to create the Aragon series.

3002
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:30,440
I want to animate the entire all the Aragon books in pivot animation.

3003
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:34,200
I'm going to do it all by myself and I'm going to have a YouTube channel for each book.

3004
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:37,160
Actually, no, that's unrelated.

3005
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:42,440
But like, I'm like going to animate the Aragon books and I'm going to have,

3006
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:44,600
I created a special YouTube channel for each.

3007
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:48,440
Um, so there's, there's, there's like the Aragon book one, Aragon book two,

3008
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:49,080
Aragon book three.

3009
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:50,520
So I was free YouTube channels,

3010
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:54,600
but I also want to pretend that I have fans who like love me and like simp for me.

3011
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:57,640
So I'm going to create free extra channels for the free channels

3012
02:22:57,640 --> 02:22:59,160
and we're going to pretend that we're collabing,

3013
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:01,320
but it's actually just me collabing with myself.

3014
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:02,840
And that was Dragon Master Pivot.

3015
02:23:04,040 --> 02:23:05,400
Word of the Senior and a few others.

3016
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:08,840
So I created six YouTube channels just for this project

3017
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:10,360
and free of him would just fake people.

3018
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:12,520
And this is one of the fake people and this

3019
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:16,520
animation is an animation that this fake person they made up

3020
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:18,760
created to enter one of my competitions,

3021
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:20,200
to create an animation about that.

3022
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:24,920
So this is you pretending to be someone else making a cartoon

3023
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:28,760
to enter my contest that you made?

3024
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:30,920
Yes.

3025
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:36,040
And, and so that's like six YouTube channels

3026
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:38,200
by itself.

3027
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:40,200
And then I have like six other ones now.

3028
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:44,440
But yeah, when you said this is Sparta, Sparta, I got reminded of that.

3029
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:48,920
Do you ever see Double Cast, Minerva Double Cast?

3030
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:52,600
The Misccribe video?

3031
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:53,640
Do you know what I'm talking about?

3032
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:55,720
No.

3033
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:56,600
We had, we had.

3034
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:00,120
Yeah, we had Double Cast.

3035
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:02,040
What's your channel name?

3036
02:24:04,360 --> 02:24:04,680
Wall.

3037
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:06,520
Hold on.

3038
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:12,280
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, Duh, Double Cast with a five.

3039
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:15,640
Is it just called Double Cast?

3040
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:19,320
Eldina, Eldina Double Cast, the video about Misccribe.

3041
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:21,720
It's this, it's this story about

3042
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:26,600
a true story of this lady who like rose to become one

3043
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:31,800
of the most powerful Harry Potter fanfic writers and community mods.

3044
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:36,360
Of all time, basically by like creating basically her,

3045
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:45,480
her tactic was to make fake accounts pretending to be like Christian like moral guardians

3046
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:52,560
who were there to like defend Harry Potter fanfic from like sin and then as these people

3047
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:59,040
she would make lists of like bad like like don't read these authors because they're sinful

3048
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:03,960
and then she would put herself on these lists and then people would be like oh my god I

3067
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:25,320
guitar hero but it's free it's for the PC it's better it has a whole bunch of features that

3068
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:29,920
original guitar hero games didn't it's really fun and you just download it and you make custom

3069
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:36,080
songs and it's good is it called clone hero because it's a clone of guitar hero it is literally

3070
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:43,760
just a clone like it uses some of the same code but a guy was caught cheating a guy called

3071
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:49,400
shmui he was he was too good at the game and he was like posting accomplishments that were like

3072
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:55,560
inhuman and it turned out that he was faking them and he got caught earlier this month and what I

3073
02:27:55,560 --> 02:28:03,240
did is the day I found out I posted a video of me doing one of his fake accomplishments but like

3074
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:10,560
really fake is that you yeah that's me in the second video and my video surpassed the original

3075
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:17,800
in views that he had faked as of yesterday are you faking this or is this real it's real

3076
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:22,600
that second link I posted like give it a watch it's just a minute long this is real real live

3077
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:28,680
there's nothing fake about it that is you I recognize you are you are you are swimming goggles

3078
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:38,600
those are gamer goggles those are gamer goggles I don't I don't really know I don't really know

3079
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:53,920
what to make of what I'm seeing here you play with your teeth

3080
02:28:53,920 --> 02:29:21,480
ordinary people Jimmy Hendrix created people this video

3081
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:37,960
good good good video that's a great note to end on thank you everyone for the PCP 300 episode

02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:44,840
goodbye PCP just realized my audio has been fucked this entire time I hope it's better now oh well

3083
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:54,480
we got Craig we got Craig all right should we start voicemails okay let's let me just all

3084
02:29:54,480 --> 02:30:02,600
right let's not let's not dilly-dally too much here the first one is hold on the first one is

3085
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:13,640
called message on crypto three two one go okay on that on that crypto chat from last step I think

3086
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:21,920
majorly your points kind of stand but the thing is there is one major issue that I see with your

3087
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:32,160
guys's view of it and that is that you think that crypto is a investment and my opinion it's not

3088
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:38,600
to be I mean it's in the name it's cryptocurrency and not a crypto investment that's meant to be

3089
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:43,520
used kind of like you use cash yeah that's what it's meant to be and it doesn't function that way

3090
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:48,120
because people only use it as an investment because that's all it's a meal or something and you do

3091
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:55,400
it through crypto and I think that's like a major thing that a lot of people don't really get no

3092
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:01,160
no similar kind of deal like I get that that's what it's supposed to be mainly it doesn't the

3093
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:06,200
problem is that it doesn't work as currency because it's so inefficient I have just meant to be used

3094
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:14,680
like it costs me $80 to move $60 worth of tether out of my wallet you know it's worthless stuff

3095
02:31:14,680 --> 02:31:21,760
like that with the blockchain it's all public right there are cryptos that are better at doing

3096
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:28,680
that this guy likes crypto for example tomorrow it's got this signature thing we're basically five

3097
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:34,400
people sign the transaction and then it goes through so you can't really tell which of those

3098
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:42,720
five people were actually quite surprised that someone just sent an unironic like so crypto

3099
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:48,720
good actually one of five people send this transaction and you don't know who jeez when I

3100
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:52,720
send a transaction through visa it's not fucking public record for anyone to look at isn't that great

3101
02:31:53,520 --> 02:32:00,240
like yeah only like the bank or visa card holder like usually sees that so I you're supposed to

3102
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:05,280
like a currency but it's worse in every way than I have I have dabbled like having all your

3103
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:10,320
transaction public is a good thing I don't understand I have I have dabbled in it yeah

3104
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:15,520
that's true also I have I have dabbled in it enough and everything I have learned an experience

3105
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:21,440
that way tells me like oh this is this sucks this is I would never I would never use this

3106
02:32:21,440 --> 02:32:28,080
this could never be like a thing that I would like use you know in the real world for anything

3107
02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:34,720
it's simply you know you know the only gas fees man it's insane imagine you gotta spend a hundred

3108
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:40,720
fucking dollars every time you make any transaction at all unbelievable did you see like a year ago

3109
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:45,440
like there there was like I saw this being posted around like a bunch of like twitter threads

3110
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:52,960
of um people like just linking to child porn and being like send me like one dollar's worth of

3111
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:58,080
bitcoin and you can access um people were just posting this shit publicly on twitter and I'm

3112
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:03,600
like wow what how do you think the crypto market is so wonderful how do they how can they do that

3113
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:12,960
and be free citizens I don't fucking know does that work like I like the thing is I it was like

3114
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:16,480
it was like a year ago I saw just a bunch of posts people were sharing them like going look at this

3115
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:22,080
shit it's fucked up and like yeah and like there were tweets like you could like look at the tweet

3116
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:27,520
and it like wasn't deleted by twitter and it's like what the fuck how is this allowed um but

3117
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:31,440
great question you know I saw like 10 or 20 of those and that's more of when I've seen genuine

3118
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:38,240
products added like advertised using crypto so I guess they found the market crypto is for

3119
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:43,120
illegal thing crypto is such a it's so reputable it's for illegal things you know when you want to

3120
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:47,600
buy it's for illegal things that's like the only thing yeah that's what we're child for is illegal

3121
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:52,480
things the the the reason NFTs are hot is because it's like oh finally there's something not illegal

3122
02:33:52,480 --> 02:34:03,440
we can buy yeah the the only um the the unwieldiness of of like of the transactions and like like

3123
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:08,240
gas fees and stuff are just they're just they're just they're totally prohibitive they'll they'll

3124
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:13,440
simply never it's an issue that can never be overcome and can never it's it's simply can't

3125
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:21,040
be used for what it was sort of maybe meant to be used for as in money I don't know you know

3126
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:24,560
there are also there are also communities like in America and around the world that are being

3127
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:29,360
destroyed because the electricity price is locally skyrocketing because there's some fucking crypto

3128
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:34,480
mine nearby right and that's using up so much energy but they have to jack up the price and then

3129
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:40,880
regular people who are like poor can't fucking afford it um well you know they rise up those

3130
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:44,880
people should have invested those people should have invested in crypto and then they wouldn't

3131
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:48,640
be if they took personal responsibility they would have invested already yeah

3132
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:55,040
the problem is the responsibility of seeing into the future to know when everything rises and falls

3133
02:34:55,040 --> 02:35:00,000
responsibility if you didn't want your art to be stolen after you died and minted into an NFT

3134
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,560
you should have made it an NFT you should have minted idiot if you didn't want your art to be

3135
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:09,520
stolen you should have just made it an NFT already and you shouldn't have died you should have lived

3136
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:19,120
long enough to like that's an NFT bro thank you somebody I don't understand people who like

3137
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:25,120
NFTs because I can't separate them from the concept of theft anymore it's not I'll be honest

3138
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:31,840
I'll be honest I don't I saw I saw one person the only I saw one person who was like posting some

3139
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:37,280
NFT shit and it's all it's all people that have financial stake this one person posted an article

3140
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:43,760
that was like here how how I how I succeeded with my NFT project and it was like their their their

3141
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:48,560
project was it was like you know it was one of these shitty like asset uh you know mix and mix

3142
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:54,720
and match uh uh what's the word it was one of those dress up game icons yeah what's what's the word

3143
02:35:54,720 --> 02:36:01,120
for uh for like the the character creator pig pig crew yeah it's a pig crew avatar it was it was

3144
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:05,520
it was it looked like shit it was ducks it was a little cartoon ducks and it was like I had a

3145
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:10,320
successful NFT launch like here's how I did it everyone an article about it and I responded

3146
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:16,240
with a single word trash and they they blocked me um I felt great I felt great I felt great

3147
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:27,120
about him because he spoke the truth yeah um I loved it uh but I guess I'm thankful that like I

3148
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:32,960
don't see I don't I feel I feel like the tide is turning I feel like public opinion has has

3149
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:39,200
come down pretty heavily on like nobody likes this shit I mean it's all the bad things it's theft

3150
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:47,360
it's does nothing for anyone everyone is only used to speculate uh it it's bad for the environment

3151
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:52,560
and it's ugly there's nothing positive about it I I mean you know you're not you don't get the art

3152
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:57,680
you just get a receipt that's it's you get a receipt for the URL as people can change and I

3153
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:04,080
I mean the URL can die yeah I I just want people to change I want someone to hack into them

3154
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:08,400
and change all the URLs to a link to um Rick Astley's never gonna give you up there's

3155
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:15,600
to a rick roll there should rick roll plenty of there's been like loads and loads of examples of

3156
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:22,800
people's NFTs being hacked and stolen because they're just yep they're not actually secure at all

3157
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:31,440
they're not as secure as they they imagine it's much easier to not worry about owning a PNG

3158
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:42,320
in that way because you just it's not valuable nobody cares about the only reason the only reason

3159
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:48,080
they care about it is because of its uniqueness and that uniqueness does not actually exist because

3160
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:54,240
it's so easily stealable even in NFTs you just remember I mean literally nobody can stop you

3161
02:37:54,240 --> 02:38:01,200
literally there's no value for anyone literally the point of it is to say I spent $200,000 on a

3162
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:07,280
worthless PNG of an ape like it's that's that's the point of it uh no no the the apes must have value

3163
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:11,040
the apes must have value so the value can keep going up so everyone succeeds the second you

3164
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:15,760
start talking shit you're gonna make us all fail we have to all believe that this is good and right

3165
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:21,600
and we're going to make money otherwise it will the point is not to say that you've spent $200,000

3166
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:27,760
the point is to convince people that you actually did that so that they can spend money and then

3167
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:34,480
you can like get like money from people being tricked it's just it's well yeah it's to say I

3168
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:40,880
spent $200,000 on an ape and I don't regret it and number and line go up and also I made some new

3169
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:44,880
apes that you can get and you can be like me if you buy my apes

3170
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:52,640
or ducks or whatever. Can we make this episode on NFTs? Can we make this episode on the blockchain?

3171
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:57,200
You know what I think probably I mean Saber Sharks YouTube channel is an NFT

3172
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:04,800
someone minted it someone minted it without his permission yeah like just just the channel itself

3173
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:11,600
that's awesome holy that's awful that's really bad good for him you know good for him I'm proud

3174
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:16,800
in a way but it also means absolutely nothing it's really funny I wonder what the ramification

3175
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:25,280
I wonder what the ramifications of uh of minting uh the uh the asterisk or suck series would be oh

3176
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:31,840
my god Ben you should do it you should do it it's all fake don't encourage him oh my god yeah

3177
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:37,120
what if I did Ben there's one way to find out because you know you know I'm referencing that

3178
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:41,680
just Trixie said that she tweeted the what would the ramifications of minting the asterisk war

3179
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:54,240
sucks series be I what if I just minted it yes it's a funny joke but please it's not funny if you

3180
02:39:54,240 --> 02:40:01,040
actually do it if you actually do it it becomes stupid I don't even know how I don't even know

3181
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:05,600
how one well minting it would probably cost you more money than like you'd actually it would probably

3182
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:10,800
it costs like a hundred bucks right to like mint artist overwhelmingly lose money on NFTs like

3183
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:17,440
most of them will sell for like 15 bucks yeah like like the average sale is like 300 but that's

3184
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:22,400
only because of like the few whales who spent like 60 million dollars yeah you know yeah but like if

3185
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:27,360
you look at if you look at the mean sale it's like 15 if you're if you're a famous if you're famous

3186
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:32,880
already if you have that social capital or whatever and you have a famous person who will buy it off

3187
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:36,400
you and like you both like we can nudge and like you know that you're doing this just to inflate the

various speedruns to making ramble videos about various different types of topics

3332
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:12,160
this is what i'd say

3333
02:58:22,240 --> 02:58:24,160
this is just a medley

3334
02:58:28,160 --> 02:58:30,160
it's a good decision i hate music

3335
02:58:30,960 --> 02:58:36,560
bang bang max is having made sure she was dead

3336
02:58:40,640 --> 02:58:45,280
you never heard maxville silver hammer wait is that like a past murderer wait is it actually

3337
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:50,320
the the whole song is just about a guy killing a bunch of people with his hammer i i guess i have

3338
02:58:50,320 --> 02:58:56,800
never actually listened to the song and and the rest of the beat was hated it really

3339
02:58:56,800 --> 02:59:01,760
palma carney wrote it and everyone hated it except him is that where is it about i

3340
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:06,320
thought the song was about dwarf fortress because silver is the best material to make

3341
02:59:06,320 --> 02:59:12,800
hammers out of because it's the heaviest and deals the most damage uh that's not true because dwarf

3342
02:59:12,800 --> 02:59:19,600
fortress did not exist no it is no it's true gold's gold's heavy even silver minecraft facts told

3343
02:59:19,600 --> 02:59:28,080
me this uh in i think though i in i know that in dwarf fortress steel steel is the best metal to

3344
02:59:28,080 --> 02:59:35,280
make like blades out of but silver is the best metal to make clubs and and hammers out of uh

3345
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:40,800
because i think it is heavier than it's maybe it's heavier than gold or maybe like the softness

3346
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:46,080
of the gold makes it worse in some other way i don't remember wait there's no silver in minecraft

Lamp oil.

3368
03:01:57,800 --> 03:01:58,800
Rope.

3369
03:01:58,800 --> 03:01:59,800
Bombs.

3370
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:00,800
You want it?

3371
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:03,060
It's yours, my friend.

3372
03:02:03,060 --> 03:02:04,520
As long as you have enough room.

3373
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:05,520
You win.

3374
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:06,520
That's really good.

3375
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:07,520
Sorry, Link.

3376
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:08,520
I can't give credit.

3377
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:09,520
Come back when you're a little richer.

3378
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:10,520
That was pretty good.

3379
03:02:10,520 --> 03:02:11,520
Bombs.

3380
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:12,520
That's the only entry.

3381
03:02:12,520 --> 03:02:13,520
That's pretty good.

3382
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:18,520
That's pretty good.

3383
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:19,520
That's by default.

3384
03:02:19,520 --> 03:02:20,520
Rope.

3385
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:21,520
Why would you want to buy bombs?

3386
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:22,520
What are you, a terrorist?

3387
03:02:22,520 --> 03:02:23,520
Because you can blow up things.

3388
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:24,520
That's terrorism.

3389
03:02:24,520 --> 03:02:29,520
No, I'm going to buy TNT in Minecraft.

3390
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:30,520
See?

3391
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:31,520
It's legal.

3392
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:32,520
Excuse me, princess.

3393
03:02:32,520 --> 03:02:33,520
Why would you want to buy silver?

3394
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:39,520
What are you going to make of hammers and kill people with them?

3395
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:42,160
Next voicemail is a vocaru.

3396
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:49,160
It's called PCP Not Even Once, 3, 2, 1, go.

3397
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:51,160
Cool.

3398
03:02:51,160 --> 03:02:52,160
Yeah.

3399
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:53,160
Really?

3400
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:58,160
Bang, bang, maximum.

3401
03:02:58,160 --> 03:03:03,160
I fell down and hurt my knee.

3402
03:03:03,160 --> 03:03:08,160
It's all okay with PCP.

3403
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:18,160
Is this the episode intro?

3404
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:19,160
Yep, this is the intro.

3405
03:03:19,160 --> 03:03:20,160
This is the episode.

3406
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:21,160
Yeah.

3407
03:03:21,160 --> 03:03:24,160
Bambi nimble, keep me quick.

3408
03:03:24,160 --> 03:03:26,160
He's pretty long gone.

3409
03:03:26,160 --> 03:03:28,160
I don't get why.

3410
03:03:28,160 --> 03:03:31,160
I get sick.

3411
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:36,160
PCP.

3412
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:41,160
PCP.

3413
03:03:41,160 --> 03:03:44,160
PCP.

3414
03:03:44,160 --> 03:03:46,160
Is this going to end?

3415
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:48,160
It's two minutes of this, huh?

3416
03:03:48,160 --> 03:03:52,160
Yeah.

3417
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:54,160
Yeah.

3418
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:55,160
Yeah.

3419
03:03:55,160 --> 03:03:57,160
Oh, fuck.

3420
03:03:57,160 --> 03:04:02,160
I'm going to fucking withdraws.

3421
03:04:02,160 --> 03:04:03,160
Oh, god.

3422
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:04,160
Oh, fuck.

3423
03:04:04,160 --> 03:04:08,160
I've got to put that given benefit of occasional guests right into my veins.

3424
03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:09,160
Oh, god.

3425
03:04:09,160 --> 03:04:13,160
Oh, fuck.

3426
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:18,160
PCP.

3427
03:04:18,160 --> 03:04:23,160
PCP.

3428
03:04:23,160 --> 03:04:28,160
PCP.

3429
03:04:28,160 --> 03:04:33,160
PCP.

3430
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:35,160
PCP.

3431
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:36,160
Yes.

3432
03:04:36,160 --> 03:04:37,160
Yes.

3433
03:04:37,160 --> 03:04:38,160
Oh, fucking god.

3434
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:39,160
Yes.

3435
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:40,160
It's in my veins right now.

3436
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:41,160
Oh, it's so good.

3437
03:04:41,160 --> 03:04:42,160
Oh, fuck.

3438
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:43,160
I feel so fucking good.

3439
03:04:43,160 --> 03:04:44,160
Just show me straight up my veins.

3440
03:04:44,160 --> 03:04:45,160
My veins.

3441
03:04:45,160 --> 03:04:46,160
Oh, they're fucking bulging.

3442
03:04:46,160 --> 03:04:47,160
My veins are bulging.

3443
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:48,160
They're biting.

3444
03:04:48,160 --> 03:04:49,160
Oh, my god.

3445
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:50,160
Oh, fuck.

3446
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:51,160
Yes.

3447
03:04:51,160 --> 03:04:56,160
That guy really do be true.

3448
03:04:56,160 --> 03:04:59,160
It do be like that, though.

3449
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:00,160
Yes.

3450
03:05:00,160 --> 03:05:01,160
Wow.

3451
03:05:01,160 --> 03:05:03,160
The happy 300 episodes.

3452
03:05:03,160 --> 03:05:07,160
Here's to at least one more.

3453
03:05:07,160 --> 03:05:08,160
That'd be cool.

3454
03:05:08,160 --> 03:05:09,160
One more.

3455
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:12,160
We'll have 300 episodes.

3456
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:13,160
That was great.

3457
03:05:13,160 --> 03:05:18,160
That deserves a voice grail, I think.

3458
03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:19,160
Sure.

3459
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:20,160
Why not?

3460
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:29,160
I think that was another one from Mutsu Dusty Dumps.

3461
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:30,160
Tokyo Man.

3462
03:05:30,160 --> 03:05:33,160
Maybe there should be a different thing.

3463
03:05:33,160 --> 03:05:34,160
Tokyo Guy should be.

3464
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:42,160
That guy definitely deserves grail, a status by this point.

3465
03:05:42,160 --> 03:05:44,160
I said his name last time.

3466
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:46,160
PCP greatest hits.

3467
03:05:46,160 --> 03:05:48,160
He should release an album.

3468
03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:54,160
He should release an album on Bandcamp of all his PCP voicemails.

3469
03:05:54,160 --> 03:05:55,160
Unironically, yes.

3470
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:57,160
Dude, I should do that with Floss Tapes Archive.

3471
03:05:57,160 --> 03:05:58,160
Make it a bank.

3472
03:05:58,160 --> 03:05:59,160
Yeah, sure.

3473
03:05:59,160 --> 03:06:00,160
Yes.

3474
03:06:00,160 --> 03:06:01,160
Yeah.

3475
03:06:01,160 --> 03:06:02,160
Why on God's name?

3476
03:06:02,160 --> 03:06:03,160
Unironically.

3477
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:07,160
There's no reason not to.

3478
03:06:07,160 --> 03:06:10,160
Okay, next one is, I've got to find it here.

3479
03:06:10,160 --> 03:06:13,160
It's called Boston Question Mark.

3480
03:06:13,160 --> 03:06:15,160
Three, two, one, go.

3481
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:20,160
I'm going to Boston in a couple of weeks for the School Psychologist Convention.

3482
03:06:20,160 --> 03:06:24,160
It's in like, I don't know, Central Boston at the Heinz Convention Center.

3483
03:06:24,160 --> 03:06:26,160
I mean, I don't know where that is in Boston.

3484
03:06:26,160 --> 03:06:28,160
I don't know anything about Boston.

3485
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:29,160
That's what I'm asking.

3486
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:32,160
What are some things I can do along there?

3487
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:33,160
Jesus.

3488
03:06:33,160 --> 03:06:34,160
Wrap up warm.

3489
03:06:34,160 --> 03:06:35,160
Yes.

3490
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:42,160
Some things to do in Boston that are good and don't suck.

3491
03:06:42,160 --> 03:06:44,160
Ride the T.

3492
03:06:44,160 --> 03:06:46,160
Travel from A to B.

3493
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:47,160
That's it.

3494
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:49,160
That's my favorite thing about Boston is the T.

3495
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:51,160
So just ride it.

3496
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:52,160
There's restaurants?

3497
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:55,160
I mean, when I was in Boston, I was mostly just hanging out.

3498
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:58,160
We went to restaurants and I played Pokemon Go.

3499
03:06:58,160 --> 03:06:59,160
Yeah.

3500
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:00,160
It was fun.

3501
03:07:00,160 --> 03:07:02,160
I don't know about things to do.

3502
03:07:02,160 --> 03:07:10,160
I don't know if there's anything that I'd be like, oh, you got to check out the such-and-such

3503
03:07:10,160 --> 03:07:12,160
museum or whatever.

3504
03:07:12,160 --> 03:07:14,160
I don't know.

3505
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:15,160
I don't.

3506
03:07:15,160 --> 03:07:16,160
I don't know.

3507
03:07:16,160 --> 03:07:18,160
I just live here, man.

3508
03:07:18,160 --> 03:07:21,160
I don't do shit.

3509
03:07:21,160 --> 03:07:23,160
I feel dumb.

3510
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:26,160
I feel like I should have some.

3511
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:28,160
One good thing.

3512
03:07:28,160 --> 03:07:31,160
One interesting neat thing.

3513
03:07:31,160 --> 03:07:32,160
That's cool.

3514
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:34,160
But I can't.

3515
03:07:34,160 --> 03:07:36,160
There's nothing.

3516
03:07:36,160 --> 03:07:40,160
Gabe, was there anything that you thought was cool when you were here?

3517
03:07:40,160 --> 03:07:44,160
I mean, I generally like the vibe of the place.

3518
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:46,160
It's got cool architecture and roads.

3519
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:48,160
It's not like a grid city.

3520
03:07:48,160 --> 03:07:50,160
Just ride the T.

3521
03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:53,160
Just get on the T and just go wherever it takes you.

3522
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:55,160
Don't even sweat it.

3523
03:07:55,160 --> 03:07:57,160
Don't even worry about where you end up.

3524
03:07:57,160 --> 03:08:04,160
Just get right from the end of the green line all the way to the end of the red line to the end of the blue line.

3525
03:08:04,160 --> 03:08:06,160
Dude, red line is so cool.

3526
03:08:06,160 --> 03:08:08,160
Seven years.

3527
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:10,160
Hand drawn.

3528
03:08:10,160 --> 03:08:12,160
All right.

3529
03:08:12,160 --> 03:08:14,160
Next one is...

3530
03:08:14,160 --> 03:08:16,160
I don't know what this is.

3531
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:18,160
Hold on.

3532
03:08:18,160 --> 03:08:22,160
Is that the URL?

3533
03:08:22,160 --> 03:08:23,160
Yeah.

3534
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:24,160
Okay.

3535
03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:28,160
This is a blog post from Blogspot called

3536
03:08:28,160 --> 03:08:31,160
The Truth in its Essence

3537
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:34,160
about my debut book.

3538
03:08:34,160 --> 03:08:36,160
Do you carry a secret?

3539
03:08:36,160 --> 03:08:40,160
Here's a synopsis about do you carry a secret and fear to let it out.

3540
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:42,160
Veena Schecker.

3541
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:49,160
I am a practicing optometrist in India with over 25 years of experience in the field.

3542
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:51,160
I don't...

3543
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:52,160
Okay.

3544
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:54,160
Cool. Yes.

3545
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:56,160
Is there a joke hidden in here?

3546
03:08:56,160 --> 03:08:58,160
I don't know.

3547
03:08:58,160 --> 03:09:00,160
I'm not looking for it.

3548
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:03,160
Veena Schecker is a fan of the PCP.

3549
03:09:03,160 --> 03:09:05,160
She's promoting her book.

3550
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:07,160
And you know what?

3551
03:09:07,160 --> 03:09:10,160
I'll give you a song called Deck and Schecker for you to listen to.

3552
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:13,160
Veena, I'm proud of you.

3553
03:09:13,160 --> 03:09:15,160
You did it.

3554
03:09:15,160 --> 03:09:17,160
They said it couldn't be done.

3555
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:20,160
Deck and Schecker, what is this?

3556
03:09:20,160 --> 03:09:23,160
It's just a song by Infected Mushroom.

3557
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:26,160
I've seen the word Schecker twice in my life now.

3558
03:09:26,160 --> 03:09:30,160
First here and now this person's surname.

3559
03:09:30,160 --> 03:09:32,160
Oh, my head.

3560
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:34,160
It's a weird album cover.

3561
03:09:34,160 --> 03:09:36,160
My head is pounding.

3562
03:09:36,160 --> 03:09:38,160
You drew that album art.

3563
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:40,160
Somehow my hangover is getting worse.

3564
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:44,160
Somehow it is getting...

3565
03:09:44,160 --> 03:09:48,160
It is only progressing and becoming worse as time goes on.

3566
03:09:48,160 --> 03:09:49,160
Next.

3567
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:51,160
How many fingers am I holding?

3568
03:09:51,160 --> 03:09:53,160
What time is it?

3569
03:09:53,160 --> 03:09:55,160
I can't tell.

3570
03:09:55,160 --> 03:09:58,160
It's 1.25 p.m.

3571
03:09:58,160 --> 03:10:01,160
Oh, it's 4.25 a.m.

3572
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:04,160
Maybe I feel sick.

3573
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:06,160
Maybe it's not a hangover.

3574
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:08,160
Maybe it's that I broke keto.

3575
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:11,160
Maybe it's that I stopped being keto, even though I already wasn't.

3576
03:10:11,160 --> 03:10:13,160
Maybe that's why I'm full of poison.

3577
03:10:13,160 --> 03:10:16,160
I'm full of poisonous carbs, causing deadly inflammation.

3578
03:10:16,160 --> 03:10:19,160
You really couldn't make such a mistake.

3579
03:10:19,160 --> 03:10:21,160
I ate a couple of french fries.

3580
03:10:21,160 --> 03:10:24,160
I had a couple of french fries someone gave me yesterday.

3581
03:10:25,160 --> 03:10:28,160
I was already drinking beer, so why not?

3582
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:30,160
Why are you drinking beer?

3583
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:32,160
I have been so clean.

3584
03:10:32,160 --> 03:10:34,160
I have been two straight weeks.

3585
03:10:34,160 --> 03:10:36,160
Feeding socially.

3586
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:40,160
Two straight weeks of extremely scrupulous calorie counting.

3587
03:10:40,160 --> 03:10:42,160
I deserved it.

3588
03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:45,160
Now I deserve this hangover.

3589
03:10:45,160 --> 03:10:47,160
Whatever.

3590
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:48,160
Shut up.

3591
03:10:48,160 --> 03:10:50,160
Next voicemail is

3592
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:52,160
for Cybershell with Love.

3593
03:10:52,160 --> 03:10:54,160
3, 2, 1, go.

3594
03:10:54,160 --> 03:10:56,160
Cybershell, I hope you're on for this one.

3595
03:11:00,160 --> 03:11:02,160
If only he were here.

3596
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:04,160
If only.

3597
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:06,160
We'll pass it on.

3598
03:11:06,160 --> 03:11:08,160
Yeah, we'll let him know.

3599
03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:10,160
We'll just tag him.

3600
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:14,160
Hi, here's a special message for that guy who just left that voicemail.

3601
03:11:14,160 --> 03:11:16,160
Sorry it wasn't on this episode,

3602
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:20,160
but it was just on that 5 and a half hour long episode that came out less than a month ago.

3603
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:22,160
So just listen to that one again.

3604
03:11:22,160 --> 03:11:24,160
Next one is called

3605
03:11:24,160 --> 03:11:27,160
Come Eat Duck with Wong Chung.

3606
03:11:27,160 --> 03:11:30,160
Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.

3607
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:45,160
Wong Chung goes back.

3608
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:47,160
You like to say,

3609
03:11:47,160 --> 03:11:49,160
why don't you come to China with me?

3610
03:11:49,160 --> 03:11:51,160
We can both catch corona

3611
03:11:51,160 --> 03:11:53,160
and eat duck together.

3612
03:11:53,160 --> 03:11:55,160
I like duck.

3613
03:11:55,160 --> 03:11:57,160
Duck is good.

3614
03:11:57,160 --> 03:11:59,160
Duck is good.

3615
03:11:59,160 --> 03:12:03,160
I just got reminded that one character is supposed to come back on the 300 episode.

3616
03:12:03,160 --> 03:12:05,160
Which character?

3617
03:12:05,160 --> 03:12:07,160
I guess we'll see.

3618
03:12:07,160 --> 03:12:09,160
Wait, what?

3619
03:12:09,160 --> 03:12:11,160
Spoilers?

3620
03:12:11,160 --> 03:12:13,160
Alright, next one is called

3621
03:12:13,160 --> 03:12:17,160
I hope Riley is on.

3622
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:19,160
Posting it now.

3623
03:12:19,160 --> 03:12:23,160
Okay, 3, 2, 1, go.

3624
03:12:23,160 --> 03:12:25,160
Okay.

3625
03:12:25,160 --> 03:12:27,160
I'm sorry, he's not on.

3626
03:12:27,160 --> 03:12:29,160
Maybe next time.

3627
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:31,160
He quit Yig.

3628
03:12:31,160 --> 03:12:33,160
He quit Yig. We'll never hear from him again.

3629
03:12:33,160 --> 03:12:35,160
Wait, really?

3630
03:12:35,160 --> 03:12:37,160
He did.

3631
03:12:37,160 --> 03:12:41,160
He just cancelled and he's taken Yig out of his profile,

3632
03:12:41,160 --> 03:12:43,160
his Twitter bio.

3633
03:12:43,160 --> 03:12:45,160
That's funny.

3634
03:12:45,160 --> 03:12:47,160
Is there an RB yet?

3635
03:12:47,160 --> 03:12:49,160
The PCP lasted longer than Voidcasers.

3636
03:12:49,160 --> 03:12:51,160
That's true.

3637
03:12:51,160 --> 03:12:53,160
We'll miss him.

3638
03:12:53,160 --> 03:12:55,160
We'll miss that boy.

3639
03:12:55,160 --> 03:12:57,160
Is there an RB yet?

3640
03:12:59,160 --> 03:13:03,160
He's moving back to the defunct one in his dad's yard.

3641
03:13:03,160 --> 03:13:05,160
One assumes.

3642
03:13:05,160 --> 03:13:07,160
Next one is called

3643
03:13:07,160 --> 03:13:13,160
Come With Comrades, 3, 2, 1, go.

3644
03:13:13,160 --> 03:13:15,160
Hello, comrades.

3645
03:13:15,160 --> 03:13:17,160
Nikola is back.

3646
03:13:17,160 --> 03:13:19,160
We have offer for you.

3647
03:13:19,160 --> 03:13:23,160
Would you like to come invade Ukraine with Nikola and other comrades?

3648
03:13:23,160 --> 03:13:25,160
Yes.

3649
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:27,160
Sounds good, yeah.

3650
03:13:27,160 --> 03:13:29,160
Thanks.

3651
03:13:29,160 --> 03:13:33,160
Ukraine has always had a similar name to the UK.

3652
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:35,160
I think it's time for them to die.

3653
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:37,160
I think it's time.

3654
03:13:37,160 --> 03:13:39,160
Ukraine.

3655
03:13:39,160 --> 03:13:41,160
That's not in Ukraine.

3656
03:13:41,160 --> 03:13:43,160
You just want to kill mage, Gabe.

3657
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:45,160
You've always just wanted to kill mage.

3658
03:13:45,160 --> 03:13:47,160
No, it's not true.

3659
03:13:47,160 --> 03:13:49,160
It's not true.

3660
03:13:49,160 --> 03:13:53,160
It's Brexit because I will break her legs.

3661
03:13:53,160 --> 03:13:57,160
Ukraine is next to Poland, I think,

3662
03:13:57,160 --> 03:13:59,160
and so is Lithuania more or less,

3663
03:13:59,160 --> 03:14:01,160
so I'm pretty sure they're the same.

3664
03:14:01,160 --> 03:14:03,160
They're different plays.

3665
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:05,160
Adjacent to refuse is refuse.

3666
03:14:05,160 --> 03:14:09,160
She went to the Ukraine for the weekend

3667
03:14:09,160 --> 03:14:11,160
exactly when you went to destroy it.

3668
03:14:11,160 --> 03:14:15,160
I swear, I don't want to kill mage or break her legs.

3669
03:14:15,160 --> 03:14:17,160
This is my pledge.

3670
03:14:17,160 --> 03:14:19,160
Didn't she go to Ukraine

3671
03:14:19,160 --> 03:14:25,160
for some kind of weird health therapy camp

3672
03:14:25,160 --> 03:14:33,160
to prevent her gallbladder surgery or something?

3673
03:14:33,160 --> 03:14:37,160
She got the gallbladder removed.

3674
03:14:37,160 --> 03:14:39,160
She did get her gallbladder removed,

3675
03:14:39,160 --> 03:14:41,160
but before that she went for a long time

3676
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:45,160
to some kind of crystal healing health camp

3677
03:14:45,160 --> 03:14:47,160
in the UK.

3678
03:14:47,160 --> 03:14:51,160
I think she just wanted to see a lot of the purple

3679
03:14:51,160 --> 03:14:53,160
that was there.

3680
03:14:53,160 --> 03:14:55,160
She made up the health stuff

3681
03:14:55,160 --> 03:14:57,160
just to see some purple.

3682
03:14:57,160 --> 03:15:01,160
I think that's probably true.

3683
03:15:01,160 --> 03:15:03,160
Good old mage.

3684
03:15:03,160 --> 03:15:09,160
How come we never get no mage, no watch in the comments?

3685
03:15:09,160 --> 03:15:11,160
Because mage doesn't deserve this podcast.

3686
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:13,160
Mage just hangs out on her Discord

3687
03:15:13,160 --> 03:15:15,160
and is cool and people talk to her.

3688
03:15:15,160 --> 03:15:17,160
Yeah.

3689
03:15:17,160 --> 03:15:19,160
They watch her live stream.

3690
03:15:19,160 --> 03:15:21,160
Do you actually?

3691
03:15:21,160 --> 03:15:23,160
That's Rem Kochmar?

3692
03:15:23,160 --> 03:15:25,160
Yeah, Rem Kochmar.

3693
03:15:25,160 --> 03:15:27,160
Yeah, I watch one of them.

3694
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:29,160
She does the VTuber thing pretty well.

3695
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,160
She even sounds like a VTuber.

3696
03:15:31,160 --> 03:15:33,160
She learns to talk like them.

3697
03:15:33,160 --> 03:15:37,160
She's always had a nice voice.

3698
03:15:37,160 --> 03:15:39,160
I guess it's a logical thing.

3699
03:15:39,160 --> 03:15:41,160
She sounds like a little crazy character.

3700
03:15:41,160 --> 03:15:43,160
It's like she doesn't sound like herself.

3701
03:15:43,160 --> 03:15:45,160
She just sounds like a character ever so slightly.

3702
03:15:45,160 --> 03:15:47,160
You can tell it's her,

3703
03:15:47,160 --> 03:15:49,160
but she talks just a little differently

3704
03:15:49,160 --> 03:15:51,160
than she would on the PCP and it's interesting.

3705
03:15:51,160 --> 03:15:53,160
Huh.

3706
03:15:53,160 --> 03:15:57,160
I guess given her skill set,

3707
03:15:57,160 --> 03:15:59,160
VTubing makes a lot of sense.

3708
03:15:59,160 --> 03:16:01,160
Now that I think about it.

3709
03:16:01,160 --> 03:16:05,160
She's like a natural conclusion.

3710
03:16:05,160 --> 03:16:09,160
She has a pretty voice.

3711
03:16:09,160 --> 03:16:11,160
She's good at drawing.

3712
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:15,160
All her art is like she would draw like,

3713
03:16:15,160 --> 03:16:17,160
she's doing like,

3714
03:16:17,160 --> 03:16:19,160
what's the word I'm looking for?

3715
03:16:19,160 --> 03:16:21,160
Animated.

3716
03:16:21,160 --> 03:16:23,160
Kind of like static character art.

3717
03:16:23,160 --> 03:16:25,160
Illustrations?

3718
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:27,160
Yeah, she's like character illustration.

3719
03:16:27,160 --> 03:16:29,160
And so like, I don't know.

3720
03:16:29,160 --> 03:16:31,160
I guess VTubing is a pretty natural

3721
03:16:31,160 --> 03:16:33,160
convergence of those two things.

3722
03:16:33,160 --> 03:16:35,160
But I haven't seen any of it.

3723
03:16:35,160 --> 03:16:37,160
That's interesting.

3724
03:16:37,160 --> 03:16:39,160
It's really good.

3725
03:16:39,160 --> 03:16:41,160
Yeah.

3726
03:16:41,160 --> 03:16:43,160
I wonder, I would just want to know

3727
03:16:43,160 --> 03:16:45,160
if Roshmar is related to Remlazar.

3728
03:16:45,160 --> 03:16:47,160
Remlazar, yeah.

3729
03:16:47,160 --> 03:16:49,160
You know what I'm talking about?

3730
03:16:49,160 --> 03:16:51,160
Yes.

3731
03:16:51,160 --> 03:16:53,160
Red letter media? Okay.

3732
03:16:53,160 --> 03:16:55,160
Is Remlazar related to Eliazar?

3733
03:16:55,160 --> 03:16:57,160
Yeah, basically.

3734
03:16:57,160 --> 03:16:59,160
You tell me.

3735
03:16:59,160 --> 03:17:01,160
I'm connecting the dots here.

3736
03:17:01,160 --> 03:17:03,160
Next one is,

3737
03:17:03,160 --> 03:17:05,160
it's called,

3738
03:17:05,160 --> 03:17:07,160
wait, we didn't listen to the last one.

3739
03:17:07,160 --> 03:17:09,160
Sorry, the last one is called.

3740
03:17:09,160 --> 03:17:11,160
There's no reason to do that.

3741
03:17:11,160 --> 03:17:13,160
The last one is called Digi Bro.

3742
03:17:13,160 --> 03:17:15,160
No, we got to listen to it.

3743
03:17:15,160 --> 03:17:17,160
Three, two, one, go.

3744
03:17:17,160 --> 03:17:19,160
Yeah.

3745
03:17:19,160 --> 03:17:21,160
I told you.

3746
03:17:21,160 --> 03:17:23,160
Eliazar cut that out.

3747
03:17:23,160 --> 03:17:25,160
Eliazar? Eliazar?

3748
03:17:25,160 --> 03:17:27,160
Yeah.

3749
03:17:27,160 --> 03:17:29,160
Eliazar? I just did an even better burp.

3750
03:17:29,160 --> 03:17:31,160
Enjoy yourself.

3751
03:17:31,160 --> 03:17:33,160
I've been burping this whole podcast.

3752
03:17:33,160 --> 03:17:35,160
There's nothing special about it.

3753
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:37,160
You're a baby, Ben. I know.

3754
03:17:37,160 --> 03:17:39,160
I spit up a little bit.

3755
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:41,160
I spit up a little bit.

3756
03:17:41,160 --> 03:17:43,160
When I burp, it will puke a little bit.

3757
03:17:43,160 --> 03:17:45,160
That's okay.

3758
03:17:45,160 --> 03:17:47,160
Next voicemail is called

3759
03:17:47,160 --> 03:17:49,160
nose. Three, two, one, go.

3760
03:17:53,160 --> 03:17:55,160
Why?

3761
03:17:55,160 --> 03:17:57,160
Why send this?

3762
03:17:57,160 --> 03:17:59,160
They just like breathe with their nose.

3763
03:17:59,160 --> 03:18:01,160
Why make this?

3764
03:18:01,160 --> 03:18:03,160
Why make this?

3765
03:18:03,160 --> 03:18:05,160
Why do this?

3766
03:18:05,160 --> 03:18:07,160
Next voicemail is called OVA.

3767
03:18:07,160 --> 03:18:09,160
Three, two, one, go.

3768
03:18:09,160 --> 03:18:11,160
So when's the OVA

3769
03:18:11,160 --> 03:18:13,160
supposed to release?

3770
03:18:13,160 --> 03:18:15,160
Yeah.

3771
03:18:15,160 --> 03:18:17,160
Last time.

3772
03:18:17,160 --> 03:18:19,160
Yeah.

3773
03:18:19,160 --> 03:18:21,160
The answer is the footage.

3774
03:18:21,160 --> 03:18:23,160
Nate has the footage.

3775
03:18:23,160 --> 03:18:25,160
I said they're working on it.

3776
03:18:25,160 --> 03:18:27,160
So I don't know.

3777
03:18:27,160 --> 03:18:29,160
I asked him

3778
03:18:29,160 --> 03:18:31,160
not long ago.

3779
03:18:31,160 --> 03:18:33,160
He told me.

3780
03:18:33,160 --> 03:18:35,160
He told me at Christmas

3781
03:18:35,160 --> 03:18:37,160
that he was going to make it before

3782
03:18:37,160 --> 03:18:39,160
he was going to make the

3783
03:18:39,160 --> 03:18:41,160
not the OVA, but the

3784
03:18:41,160 --> 03:18:43,160
Brad Garling House

3785
03:18:43,160 --> 03:18:45,160
music video.

3786
03:18:45,160 --> 03:18:47,160
He said it wouldn't take him long.

3787
03:18:47,160 --> 03:18:49,160
He was going to take a day and do that before New Year's.

3788
03:18:49,160 --> 03:18:51,160
He didn't do it, but I asked him again

3789
03:18:51,160 --> 03:18:53,160
like a week ago or something

3790
03:18:53,160 --> 03:18:55,160
and he said, okay.

3791
03:18:55,160 --> 03:18:57,160
I told him, you know,

3792
03:18:57,160 --> 03:18:59,160
Kaiju has taken up

3793
03:18:59,160 --> 03:19:01,160
the dojin job.

3794
03:19:01,160 --> 03:19:03,160
And so that's only a few weeks away.

3795
03:19:03,160 --> 03:19:05,160
And I told him like,

3796
03:19:05,160 --> 03:19:07,160
Nate, I would really,

3797
03:19:07,160 --> 03:19:09,160
it would be really good if we could have

3798
03:19:09,160 --> 03:19:11,160
the Brad Garling House music video

3799
03:19:11,160 --> 03:19:13,160
and the OVA

3800
03:19:13,160 --> 03:19:15,160
at the same time as that.

3801
03:19:15,160 --> 03:19:17,160
So can we have that in a few weeks?

3802
03:19:17,160 --> 03:19:19,160
And he said, yes, he'll do it.

3803
03:19:19,160 --> 03:19:21,160
So supposedly he's going to do it.

3804
03:19:21,160 --> 03:19:23,160
Have you ever heard of this little thing called

3805
03:19:23,160 --> 03:19:25,160
personal fucking responsibility?

3806
03:19:25,160 --> 03:19:27,160
Right, exactly.

3807
03:19:27,160 --> 03:19:29,160
Yeah.

3808
03:19:29,160 --> 03:19:31,160
If Nate doesn't deliver on time,

3809
03:19:31,160 --> 03:19:33,160
just message him and be like, God, Nate,

3810
03:19:33,160 --> 03:19:35,160
it's not being such a tricksy.

3811
03:19:35,160 --> 03:19:37,160
I mean, it's too late to deliver on time,

3812
03:19:37,160 --> 03:19:39,160
anything, but I mean,

3813
03:19:39,160 --> 03:19:41,160
it's...

3814
03:19:41,160 --> 03:19:43,160
I'm sure he intends to do it.

3815
03:19:43,160 --> 03:19:45,160
I just,

3816
03:19:45,160 --> 03:19:47,160
I hope he does.

3817
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:49,160
I hope I don't have to hound him

3818
03:19:49,160 --> 03:19:51,160
too many times.

3819
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:53,160
Because he says he'll do it.

3820
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:55,160
And I,

3821
03:19:55,160 --> 03:19:57,160
even as of recently,

3822
03:19:57,160 --> 03:19:59,160
I said, are you going to do it?

3823
03:19:59,160 --> 03:20:01,160
And he said, yes, I will do it

3824
03:20:01,160 --> 03:20:03,160
soon.

3825
03:20:03,160 --> 03:20:05,160
So, you know,

3826
03:20:05,160 --> 03:20:07,160
I don't know.

3827
03:20:07,160 --> 03:20:09,160
Next voicemail is called...

3828
03:20:09,160 --> 03:20:11,160
What is it?

3829
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:13,160
That was OVA.

3830
03:20:13,160 --> 03:20:15,160
Next voicemail is called sorry.

3831
03:20:15,160 --> 03:20:17,160
Here it is.

3832
03:20:17,160 --> 03:20:19,160
Okay, three, two, one, go.

3833
03:20:21,160 --> 03:20:23,160
Why?

3834
03:20:23,160 --> 03:20:25,160
God, not number one. Why?

3835
03:20:26,160 --> 03:20:29,160
This voicemail just wants the voicemail segment to end.

3836
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:31,160
The voicemail segment's died.

3837
03:20:31,160 --> 03:20:33,160
It reminds me of song one.

3838
03:20:33,160 --> 03:20:35,160
Trying to communicate. I'm going to breathe with my nose

3839
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:37,160
until I make a smoke signal.

3840
03:20:37,160 --> 03:20:39,160
Why do this to me?

3841
03:20:39,160 --> 03:20:41,160
Why would you hurt me like this?

3842
03:20:41,160 --> 03:20:43,160
What did I do to you

3843
03:20:43,160 --> 03:20:45,160
to deserve this treatment?

3844
03:20:45,160 --> 03:20:47,160
What did we do then?

3845
03:20:47,160 --> 03:20:49,160
Next voicemail is called

3846
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:51,160
what have I done?

3847
03:20:51,160 --> 03:20:53,160
Three, two, one, go.

3848
03:20:53,160 --> 03:20:55,160
The same guy.

3849
03:20:55,160 --> 03:20:57,160
Why would you click on it?

3850
03:21:01,160 --> 03:21:03,160
So quiet.

3851
03:21:03,160 --> 03:21:05,160
That was pretty good.

3852
03:21:05,160 --> 03:21:07,160
I guess.

3853
03:21:07,160 --> 03:21:09,160
The loud what have I done.

3854
03:21:09,160 --> 03:21:11,160
I could do something.

3855
03:21:11,160 --> 03:21:13,160
Okay, next one is...

3856
03:21:13,160 --> 03:21:15,160
Okay, it's just a question. It's a text question.

3857
03:21:15,160 --> 03:21:17,160
It's Riley Bird Mint.

3858
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:19,160
Where did these people come from?

3859
03:21:19,160 --> 03:21:21,160
Answer their dick show people.

3860
03:21:21,160 --> 03:21:23,160
I don't know.

3861
03:21:23,160 --> 03:21:25,160
Next one is...

3862
03:21:25,160 --> 03:21:27,160
What did you see?

3863
03:21:27,160 --> 03:21:29,160
When two people love each other.

3864
03:21:29,160 --> 03:21:31,160
They met a burning dick.

3865
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:33,160
That's the answer.

3866
03:21:33,160 --> 03:21:35,160
Next one is called...

3867
03:21:35,160 --> 03:21:37,160
Oh god, okay.

3868
03:21:37,160 --> 03:21:39,160
X zero.

3869
03:21:39,160 --> 03:21:41,160
The hour of reprisal.

3870
03:21:41,160 --> 03:21:43,160
This is what it's all been building to.

3871
03:21:43,160 --> 03:21:45,160
Okay.

3872
03:21:45,160 --> 03:21:47,160
Three, two, one, go.

3873
03:21:47,160 --> 03:21:49,160
He...

3874
03:21:49,160 --> 03:21:51,160
Has...

3875
03:21:51,160 --> 03:21:53,160
Come... Jesus.

3876
03:21:53,160 --> 03:21:55,160
I knew it.

3877
03:21:55,160 --> 03:21:57,160
Hello.

3878
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:59,160
Hi, Samurai-sama.

3879
03:21:59,160 --> 03:22:01,160
You expect...

3880
03:22:01,160 --> 03:22:03,160
Anybody else?

3881
03:22:03,160 --> 03:22:05,160
Fuck off.

3882
03:22:05,160 --> 03:22:07,160
Samurai-sama.

3883
03:22:07,160 --> 03:22:09,160
Come to say...

3884
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:11,160
Two things.

3885
03:22:11,160 --> 03:22:13,160
Number one.

3886
03:22:13,160 --> 03:22:15,160
Fuck off.

3887
03:22:15,160 --> 03:22:17,160
That's right.

3888
03:22:17,160 --> 03:22:19,160
And number two.

3889
03:22:19,160 --> 03:22:23,160
Episode 300.

3890
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:25,160
Episode 300.

3891
03:22:25,160 --> 03:22:27,160
I know, right?

3892
03:22:27,160 --> 03:22:29,160
What the fuck?

3893
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:31,160
I know, right?

3894
03:22:31,160 --> 03:22:33,160
Yeah. That's probably true.

3895
03:22:47,160 --> 03:22:49,160
Yeah.

3896
03:22:49,160 --> 03:22:51,160
That's probably true.

3897
03:22:57,160 --> 03:22:59,160
Right.

3898
03:22:59,160 --> 03:23:02,160
Okay. Until next time.

3899
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:04,160
Goodbye.

3900
03:23:04,160 --> 03:23:06,160
Love you, Samurai.

3901
03:23:06,160 --> 03:23:08,160
I knew he was going to come back.

3902
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:10,160
He's right.

3903
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:12,160
I just...

3904
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:13,160
I accept it.

3905
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:16,160
I accept. 300 episodes is cringe.

3906
03:23:16,160 --> 03:23:18,160
There's just no getting around it.

3907
03:23:18,160 --> 03:23:20,160
Curingy.

3908
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:22,160
Fuck off.

3909
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:25,160
What do you even want to become Curingy?

3910
03:23:25,160 --> 03:23:27,160
Okay.

3911
03:23:27,160 --> 03:23:29,160
Lovely to hear.

3912
03:23:29,160 --> 03:23:32,160
Lovely to hear from the Samurai again.

3913
03:23:32,160 --> 03:23:34,160
Okay.

3914
03:23:35,160 --> 03:23:39,160
The procrastinator's podcast political compass.

3915
03:23:39,160 --> 03:23:41,160
Me too.

3916
03:23:41,160 --> 03:23:43,160
Oh, hey. They placed me pretty accurately.

3917
03:23:45,160 --> 03:23:49,160
They actually put me pretty accurate to where my actual political compass is.

3918
03:23:49,160 --> 03:23:52,160
That's Fidium C or Kimster?

3919
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:54,160
That's...

3920
03:23:54,160 --> 03:23:56,160
That's Fidium C.

3921
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:58,160
Okay.

3922
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:00,160
No, that's Fidium C with the beard.

3923
03:24:00,160 --> 03:24:04,160
The Wonder Bread guy is up there.

3924
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:08,160
Why am I authoritarian left?

3925
03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:10,160
Why is Cheesy authoritarian left?

3926
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:12,160
Why is Kazzy authoritarian left?

3927
03:24:12,160 --> 03:24:14,160
I don't know if this makes any sense.

3928
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:17,160
Cheesy is authoritarian left because he holds a gun to begata's head

3929
03:24:17,160 --> 03:24:22,160
and he says you're going to redistribute the retweets around.

3930
03:24:22,160 --> 03:24:25,160
And God bless him for it.

3931
03:24:25,160 --> 03:24:28,160
What's the second with Megaman supposed to be?

3932
03:24:28,160 --> 03:24:32,160
Oh, that's to Snaker.

3933
03:24:32,160 --> 03:24:37,160
That's from the animation of Meta Knight on his period that I heard about.

3934
03:24:37,160 --> 03:24:41,160
Uh, no.

3935
03:24:41,160 --> 03:24:47,160
Who is that red blob on the right?

3936
03:24:47,160 --> 03:24:49,160
Oh, it's Shreddit.

3937
03:24:49,160 --> 03:24:51,160
Yeah, it's Shreddit.

3938
03:24:51,160 --> 03:24:53,160
Uh, I don't know.

3939
03:24:53,160 --> 03:24:55,160
This is silly.

3940
03:24:55,160 --> 03:24:57,160
I don't know if I have anything to say about it.

3941
03:24:57,160 --> 03:25:05,160
It's sort of in the right ballpark, but with all alignment charts

3942
03:25:05,160 --> 03:25:10,160
that have a fixed number of spaces but way too many people,

3943
03:25:10,160 --> 03:25:13,160
they can't actually fit them properly.

3944
03:25:13,160 --> 03:25:16,160
Why is Maryweather far left?

3945
03:25:16,160 --> 03:25:18,160
What's the explanation for that?

3946
03:25:18,160 --> 03:25:21,160
Has Maryweather been on the podcast? I just missed that.

3947
03:25:21,160 --> 03:25:23,160
Yeah, he's been on like three times.

3948
03:25:23,160 --> 03:25:25,160
He's been on at least twice.

3949
03:25:25,160 --> 03:25:27,160
Once as a VTuber.

3950
03:25:27,160 --> 03:25:29,160
That's right. That's right.

3951
03:25:29,160 --> 03:25:31,160
Marydog.

3952
03:25:31,160 --> 03:25:33,160
What was the editing process like?

3953
03:25:33,160 --> 03:25:36,160
Did they just give you like a green screen footage to put on at Eleazar?

3954
03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:37,160
Yep.

3955
03:25:37,160 --> 03:25:39,160
Yep, exactly.

3956
03:25:39,160 --> 03:25:41,160
There's unhoxtable right leading.

3957
03:25:41,160 --> 03:25:43,160
I don't think so.

3958
03:25:43,160 --> 03:25:47,160
I think at a certain point, I'll put the people roughly where I know they are

3959
03:25:47,160 --> 03:25:49,160
and for everyone else, I just have to find room.

3960
03:25:49,160 --> 03:25:53,160
Because they can't overlap us with how I've set it up.

3961
03:25:53,160 --> 03:25:55,160
Yeah, exactly.

3962
03:25:55,160 --> 03:25:57,160
They're just going out their ass, I guess.

3963
03:25:57,160 --> 03:26:03,160
Victor is a big right-leaning centrist.

3964
03:26:03,160 --> 03:26:05,160
Davoo.

3965
03:26:05,160 --> 03:26:10,160
I guess Davoo has moved left a bit.

3966
03:26:10,160 --> 03:26:14,160
Davoo finally realized that Trump bad like a few months ago.

3967
03:26:14,160 --> 03:26:16,160
Good for her.

3968
03:26:16,160 --> 03:26:18,160
Congratulations.

3969
03:26:18,160 --> 03:26:22,160
Did you not know that he's trying to do a coup?

3970
03:26:22,160 --> 03:26:24,160
She, I don't know.

3971
03:26:24,160 --> 03:26:27,160
She saw some, she made some stupid posts about it.

3972
03:26:27,160 --> 03:26:29,160
Like who cares?

3973
03:26:29,160 --> 03:26:31,160
I mean, orange meant bad.

3974
03:26:31,160 --> 03:26:34,160
How hard is it to understand?

3975
03:26:34,160 --> 03:26:36,160
It was like earlier this year.

3976
03:26:36,160 --> 03:26:41,160
It might have been before the insurrection or whatever you want to call it.

3977
03:26:41,160 --> 03:26:44,160
No, it was, I don't know.

3978
03:26:44,160 --> 03:26:49,160
She made like seven tweets about it in a row.

3979
03:26:49,160 --> 03:26:50,160
It was a big thread.

3980
03:26:50,160 --> 03:26:51,160
It was just like rambling.

3981
03:26:51,160 --> 03:26:52,160
I don't even remember what the point was.

3982
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:54,160
Orange meant bad.

3983
03:26:54,160 --> 03:26:55,160
Orange meant bad.

3984
03:26:55,160 --> 03:26:57,160
Orange got good.

3985
03:26:57,160 --> 03:26:59,160
Yes, orange cat is good.

3986
03:26:59,160 --> 03:27:01,160
I don't know.

3987
03:27:01,160 --> 03:27:05,160
I don't know what to think about the use of my picture in this is.

3988
03:27:05,160 --> 03:27:09,160
Because on the one hand, it doesn't look like me anymore.

3989
03:27:09,160 --> 03:27:13,160
But it is one of the better facial hairstyles I had.

3990
03:27:13,160 --> 03:27:16,160
I do think that was like people like that.

3991
03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:21,160
What about the starfish beard from those early Patreon videos you made?

3992
03:27:21,160 --> 03:27:22,160
That was stupid.

3993
03:27:22,160 --> 03:27:26,160
That was me having too much and being like silly.

3994
03:27:26,160 --> 03:27:29,160
I'm glad I don't have the beard feeling on my face.

3995
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:32,160
I guess it does look good though.

3996
03:27:32,160 --> 03:27:34,160
I just thought it was really funny.

3997
03:27:34,160 --> 03:27:39,160
I remember I showed my sister, my older sister, your videos and we were laughing so much.

3998
03:27:39,160 --> 03:27:41,160
We laughed at you.

3999
03:27:41,160 --> 03:27:43,160
We laughed at your spam.

4000
03:27:43,160 --> 03:27:45,160
We thought you were just a real funny bean.

4001
03:27:45,160 --> 03:27:48,160
And then you'll never guess what this person looks like.

4002
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:52,160
And I pulled up those videos and we were just like, oh my God, giga-chad energy.

4003
03:27:52,160 --> 03:27:53,160
Holy fuck.

4004
03:27:53,160 --> 03:27:54,160
We loved it.

4005
03:27:54,160 --> 03:27:56,160
We loved the crazy hair.

4006
03:27:56,160 --> 03:27:58,160
It was so good.

4007
03:27:58,160 --> 03:28:02,160
You did not look like I envisioned you.

4008
03:28:02,160 --> 03:28:08,160
When I first heard your voice, Gib, I envisioned a person much different.

4009
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:13,160
I envisioned like a chubby Swedish guy.

4010
03:28:13,160 --> 03:28:18,160
Like a big chubby blonde guy is what I thought you looked like.

4011
03:28:18,160 --> 03:28:20,160
I don't know why.

4012
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:21,160
I don't know why.

4013
03:28:21,160 --> 03:28:22,160
I don't know.

4014
03:28:22,160 --> 03:28:23,160
That's weird.

4015
03:28:23,160 --> 03:28:24,160
Do I have a voice?

4016
03:28:24,160 --> 03:28:25,160
Of course they look like this.

4017
03:28:25,160 --> 03:28:26,160
I don't know.

4018
03:28:26,160 --> 03:28:28,160
Or did I have a voice?

4019
03:28:28,160 --> 03:28:30,160
I can't imagine why you would think that.

4020
03:28:30,160 --> 03:28:31,160
I don't know.

4021
03:28:31,160 --> 03:28:33,160
I also don't know why.

4022
03:28:33,160 --> 03:28:34,160
You just sounded like you do now.

4023
03:28:34,160 --> 03:28:36,160
Just a little more British.

4024
03:28:36,160 --> 03:28:38,160
Basically.

4025
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:43,160
I guess you'll never know where Cittor and I are placed.

4026
03:28:43,160 --> 03:28:44,160
You got to place yourself.

4027
03:28:44,160 --> 03:28:45,160
You got to place yourself.

4028
03:28:45,160 --> 03:28:46,160
No, no, no.

4029
03:28:46,160 --> 03:28:47,160
No one will learn.

4030
03:28:47,160 --> 03:28:50,160
There's only a few spots left and they're mostly on the- they're all on the right.

4031
03:28:50,160 --> 03:28:51,160
You've got to go somewhere.

4032
03:28:51,160 --> 03:28:52,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4033
03:28:52,160 --> 03:28:53,160
There's only- yep.

4034
03:28:53,160 --> 03:28:54,160
You're locked in.

4035
03:28:54,160 --> 03:28:55,160
Sorry.

4036
03:28:55,160 --> 03:28:56,160
No, you just can't.

4037
03:28:56,160 --> 03:28:59,160
Elisa only believes in peace and love.

4038
03:28:59,160 --> 03:29:01,160
And I for one agree.

4039
03:29:01,160 --> 03:29:02,160
Not.

4040
03:29:02,160 --> 03:29:08,160
I for one believe that good things are good and bad things are bad.

4041
03:29:08,160 --> 03:29:10,160
I believe in peace and love.

4042
03:29:10,160 --> 03:29:12,160
Accepts what it's been saying.

4043
03:29:12,160 --> 03:29:18,160
My politics are that we should support good things and oppose bad things.

4044
03:29:18,160 --> 03:29:20,160
What the fuck?

4045
03:29:20,160 --> 03:29:21,160
Controversial.

4046
03:29:21,160 --> 03:29:24,160
Next one is called, remember Paul Joseph Watson?

4047
03:29:24,160 --> 03:29:25,160
No.

4048
03:29:25,160 --> 03:29:28,160
Three, two, one, go.

4049
03:29:28,160 --> 03:29:34,160
Yo, remember when Paul Joseph Watson said, conservativeism is the new counterculture?

4050
03:29:34,160 --> 03:29:35,160
Yeah.

4051
03:29:35,160 --> 03:29:36,160
And I believe them.

4052
03:29:36,160 --> 03:29:37,160
How cringe was that?

4053
03:29:37,160 --> 03:29:38,160
Pretty funny.

4054
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:39,160
That's pretty cringe.

4055
03:29:39,160 --> 03:29:42,160
I only know Paul Joseph Watson.

4056
03:29:42,160 --> 03:29:43,160
He wasn't the only one.

4057
03:29:43,160 --> 03:29:44,160
He wasn't the only one.

4058
03:29:44,160 --> 03:29:45,160
Reaction videos.

4059
03:29:45,160 --> 03:29:46,160
He wasn't the only one to say that.

4060
03:29:46,160 --> 03:29:50,160
His services are against like near-lib, but like it's not like counterculture because

4061
03:29:50,160 --> 03:29:52,160
it's also like the backbone of the dominant culture.

4062
03:29:52,160 --> 03:29:57,160
Everything the current culture is built upon, it has like conservative undertones.

4063
03:29:57,160 --> 03:30:06,160
There's really nothing less punk rock than like being like we should like make gay marriage

4064
03:30:06,160 --> 03:30:07,160
illegal.

4065
03:30:07,160 --> 03:30:10,160
We should keep the status quo.

4066
03:30:10,160 --> 03:30:12,160
People should have less rights.

4067
03:30:12,160 --> 03:30:16,160
Women should have more of their bodies.

4068
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:19,160
Let me show you my political alignment.

4069
03:30:19,160 --> 03:30:20,160
It's this game.

4070
03:30:20,160 --> 03:30:22,160
This gives my political alignment.

4071
03:30:22,160 --> 03:30:23,160
Is that Ringo?

4072
03:30:23,160 --> 03:30:24,160
That's Ringo.

4073
03:30:24,160 --> 03:30:26,160
Look at him.

4074
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:27,160
Ringo star.

4075
03:30:27,160 --> 03:30:28,160
Look at him.

4076
03:30:28,160 --> 03:30:32,160
Now, here's a guy who lived long enough to become cringe.

4077
03:30:32,160 --> 03:30:34,160
I guess he was always cringe, actually.

4078
03:30:34,160 --> 03:30:35,160
Nah, he was never cringe.

4079
03:30:35,160 --> 03:30:36,160
Shut the fuck up.

4080
03:30:36,160 --> 03:30:37,160
Ringo?

4081
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:39,160
Nobody likes Ringo.

4082
03:30:39,160 --> 03:30:40,160
Shut up.

4083
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:43,160
Underrated Best Beatle.

4084
03:30:43,160 --> 03:30:48,160
Patrick Star from SpongeBob saying, Ringo randomly.

4085
03:30:48,160 --> 03:30:52,160
I don't know what episode it was and it's haunted me for like five years.

4086
03:30:52,160 --> 03:30:55,160
I just had this memory and I don't know what episode it's from and I don't want to watch

4087
03:30:55,160 --> 03:30:56,160
it.

4088
03:30:56,160 --> 03:30:57,160
Someone tell me.

4089
03:30:57,160 --> 03:30:59,160
Why would you ever watch SpongeBob?

4090
03:30:59,160 --> 03:31:01,160
Did Patrick Star say Ringo?

4091
03:31:01,160 --> 03:31:02,160
SpongeBob is good.

4092
03:31:02,160 --> 03:31:03,160
It's a love SpongeBob.

4093
03:31:03,160 --> 03:31:04,160
What do you say?

4094
03:31:04,160 --> 03:31:07,160
Once upon a time, been people with children?

4095
03:31:07,160 --> 03:31:08,160
False.

4096
03:31:08,160 --> 03:31:11,160
Dude, the original free season of SpongeBob, hold up.

4097
03:31:11,160 --> 03:31:16,160
It's still really fucking funny, but the rest is meh.

4098
03:31:16,160 --> 03:31:21,160
The next one is a vocaru.

4099
03:31:21,160 --> 03:31:22,160
What's it called?

4100
03:31:22,160 --> 03:31:23,160
I don't know.

4101
03:31:23,160 --> 03:31:24,160
Three, two, one, go.

4102
03:31:24,160 --> 03:31:32,160
It's time for Ben Sings the Ripes of the Week.

4103
03:31:32,160 --> 03:31:33,160
Pretty good.

4104
03:31:33,160 --> 03:31:34,160
Pretty good jingle.

4105
03:31:34,160 --> 03:31:35,160
I'd use it.

4106
03:31:35,160 --> 03:31:37,160
I'd use it for a segment.

4107
03:31:37,160 --> 03:31:40,160
I didn't have any gripes this week other than that I aim hungover.

4108
03:31:40,160 --> 03:31:41,160
That's my gripe for the week.

4109
03:31:41,160 --> 03:31:44,160
Your gripe is that you drank alcohol and you shouldn't have.

4110
03:31:44,160 --> 03:31:46,160
You should have had the tap water.

4111
03:31:46,160 --> 03:31:52,160
I simply should have drank the tap water, but I didn't want people to know that I am immortal.

4112
03:31:52,160 --> 03:31:54,160
You didn't want the brain parasites.

4113
03:31:54,160 --> 03:31:55,160
No.

4114
03:31:55,160 --> 03:31:57,160
I didn't want the fluoride.

4115
03:31:57,160 --> 03:31:59,160
I didn't want to control my mind through the fluoride.

4116
03:31:59,160 --> 03:32:00,160
Fluoride.

4117
03:32:00,160 --> 03:32:02,160
They put fucking chlorine in America.

4118
03:32:02,160 --> 03:32:03,160
It's really gross.

4119
03:32:03,160 --> 03:32:04,160
Chlorine?

4120
03:32:04,160 --> 03:32:09,160
At least, at least, unless it's just a Texas thing.

4121
03:32:09,160 --> 03:32:10,160
The water here tastes like chlorine.

4122
03:32:10,160 --> 03:32:12,160
It tastes like pool water and it smells too.

4123
03:32:12,160 --> 03:32:16,160
When you take a shower, it smells like the fucking pool.

4124
03:32:16,160 --> 03:32:18,160
Mine doesn't smell like that.

4125
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:21,160
I guess you got fluoride and we got chlorine.

4126
03:32:21,160 --> 03:32:22,160
I prefer fluoride.

4127
03:32:22,160 --> 03:32:27,160
It doesn't stink and you can't taste it nearly as much anyway.

4128
03:32:27,160 --> 03:32:31,160
I mean, no, I can't taste the fluoride.

4129
03:32:31,160 --> 03:32:33,160
Here's something.

4130
03:32:33,160 --> 03:32:34,160
What is this?

4131
03:32:34,160 --> 03:32:35,160
Good thumbnail.

4132
03:32:35,160 --> 03:32:40,160
I saw this thumbnail and title combination and it made me laugh for some reason, wanted to share.

4133
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:43,160
Agitation in the Hairless Chimp Group.

4134
03:32:43,160 --> 03:32:48,160
It took me a moment to realize that is actually a Hairless Chimp.

4135
03:32:48,160 --> 03:32:51,160
It's noisy again at the chimp enclosure.

4136
03:32:51,160 --> 03:32:54,160
They're getting introduced to the remaining chimps.

4137
03:32:54,160 --> 03:32:57,160
These guys are, they're so ripped.

4138
03:32:57,160 --> 03:32:59,160
It's just because of the lack of hair.

4139
03:32:59,160 --> 03:33:03,160
They're usually ripped, but this guy is so fucking jacked.

4140
03:33:04,160 --> 03:33:06,160
I'm not on Twitter and I don't use Twitter.

4141
03:33:06,160 --> 03:33:09,160
And every time someone mentions Twitter, this is what I imagine.

4142
03:33:09,160 --> 03:33:12,160
Agitation in the Hairless Chimp Group.

4143
03:33:12,160 --> 03:33:14,160
Getting agitated.

4144
03:33:14,160 --> 03:33:15,160
That's me.

4145
03:33:15,160 --> 03:33:16,160
I'm getting agitated.

4146
03:33:16,160 --> 03:33:18,160
I'm a Hairless Chimp getting agitated.

4147
03:33:18,160 --> 03:33:21,160
Dude, the Hairless Chimp Group is like a great name for a band.

4148
03:33:21,160 --> 03:33:22,160
Yeah.

4149
03:33:22,160 --> 03:33:24,160
All right.

4150
03:33:24,160 --> 03:33:25,160
Good stuff.

4151
03:33:25,160 --> 03:33:26,160
Good stuff, I guess.

4152
03:33:26,160 --> 03:33:34,160
Next one is called Addressing the Future of Kyle and Funny Man in Space.

4153
03:33:34,160 --> 03:33:37,160
Three, two, one, go.

4154
03:33:39,160 --> 03:33:40,160
Hello.

4155
03:33:40,160 --> 03:33:44,160
This is me, Mr. Funny Man from The Iconic Show,

4156
03:33:44,160 --> 03:33:46,160
Kyle and Funny Man in Space.

4157
03:33:46,160 --> 03:33:47,160
Yes.

4158
03:33:47,160 --> 03:33:49,160
I love Kyle and Funny Man.

4159
03:33:49,160 --> 03:33:52,160
I'm just here to address the future of Kyle and Funny Man.

4160
03:33:52,160 --> 03:33:53,160
I love content.

4161
03:33:53,160 --> 03:33:56,160
I've been getting a lot of comments from people.

4162
03:33:56,160 --> 03:33:57,160
I love intellectual crap.

4163
03:33:57,160 --> 03:33:59,160
They're saying the show is too dark.

4164
03:33:59,160 --> 03:34:04,160
The people on the PCP podcast last episode, they said,

4165
03:34:04,160 --> 03:34:07,160
they started crying, they started shitting themselves.

4166
03:34:07,160 --> 03:34:11,160
They, you know, a lot of people have said they're suffering from depression now,

4167
03:34:11,160 --> 03:34:15,160
anxiety, my full disorder, or any...

4168
03:34:15,160 --> 03:34:17,160
Irritable bowel syndrome.

4169
03:34:17,160 --> 03:34:19,160
How dare you not make me shit myself?

4170
03:34:19,160 --> 03:34:23,160
The crazy argument that Kyle and Funny Man did,

4171
03:34:23,160 --> 03:34:27,160
as well as that time when Funny Man actually killed the man with a gun.

4172
03:34:27,160 --> 03:34:29,160
So we hear you.

4173
03:34:29,160 --> 03:34:31,160
The show has been getting a bit too dark.

4174
03:34:31,160 --> 03:34:36,160
So we're going to course correct with the next episode.

4175
03:34:36,160 --> 03:34:39,160
Get excited for that.

4176
03:34:39,160 --> 03:34:43,160
It's going to be the mid-season finale,

4177
03:34:43,160 --> 03:34:45,160
and it's probably going to be like five minutes.

4178
03:34:45,160 --> 03:34:47,160
So get excited for next week.

4179
03:34:47,160 --> 03:34:52,160
I guess we'll have to have more than 300 episodes.

4180
03:34:52,160 --> 03:34:54,160
Yes.

4181
03:34:54,160 --> 03:34:59,160
You know what I like about this is that it's a character from the show

4182
03:34:59,160 --> 03:35:01,160
giving a press conference.

4183
03:35:01,160 --> 03:35:03,160
Is that Funny Man?

4184
03:35:03,160 --> 03:35:05,160
That was Funny Man.

4185
03:35:05,160 --> 03:35:08,160
Well, I didn't laugh for once.

4186
03:35:08,160 --> 03:35:10,160
You're not supposed to...

4187
03:35:10,160 --> 03:35:12,160
This is serious business.

4188
03:35:12,160 --> 03:35:15,160
We're talking about the future of the IP.

4189
03:35:15,160 --> 03:35:16,160
IP?

4190
03:35:16,160 --> 03:35:18,160
There's money on the line.

4191
03:35:18,160 --> 03:35:20,160
That's funny.

4192
03:35:20,160 --> 03:35:22,160
You know what? It is funny.

4193
03:35:22,160 --> 03:35:25,160
Funny Man, you did it again.

4194
03:35:25,160 --> 03:35:28,160
Another masterpiece.

4195
03:35:28,160 --> 03:35:30,160
He really is the funniest man ever.

4196
03:35:30,160 --> 03:35:35,160
Yeah, that mad man.

4197
03:35:35,160 --> 03:35:38,160
Next voicemail.

4198
03:35:38,160 --> 03:35:39,160
Where is this?

4199
03:35:39,160 --> 03:35:44,160
Okay, the next one is called both Imgir and Voice.

4200
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:47,160
So here's the voice clip,

4201
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:57,160
and here's the Imgir link for the accompanying image, I guess.

4202
03:35:57,160 --> 03:35:59,160
Okay, oh god.

4203
03:35:59,160 --> 03:36:05,160
All right, let's give it a listen in three, two, one, go.

4204
03:36:05,160 --> 03:36:07,160
Attention, attention.

4205
03:36:07,160 --> 03:36:11,160

4206
03:36:11,160 --> 03:36:13,160
No need to mute it.

4207
03:36:13,160 --> 03:36:15,160
Thank you for your attention.

4208
03:36:15,160 --> 03:36:18,160
Hello there, this is me, Jay.

4209
03:36:18,160 --> 03:36:21,160
You might remember me, you might not,

4210
03:36:21,160 --> 03:36:26,160
but you will remember to repost my card book.

4211
03:36:26,160 --> 03:36:28,160
Or else...

4212
03:36:28,160 --> 03:36:30,160
I will mint it.

4213
03:36:30,160 --> 03:36:31,160
I'm having...

4214
03:36:31,160 --> 03:36:32,160
I will mint it all.

4215
03:36:32,160 --> 03:36:35,160
Slime and punishment, blue face,

4216
03:36:35,160 --> 03:36:38,160
even then does what itself,

4217
03:36:38,160 --> 03:36:41,160
and then when the climate change comes,

4218
03:36:41,160 --> 03:36:43,160
and humanity ends,

4219
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:45,160
everyone will remember,

4220
03:36:45,160 --> 03:36:53,160
when same as the Imgir of the...

4221
03:36:53,160 --> 03:36:56,160
Having a little trouble understanding...

4222
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:58,160
Yeah, I understand one word from that.

4223
03:36:58,160 --> 03:37:01,160
I heard Slime and Punishment, and Harbinger.

4224
03:37:01,160 --> 03:37:05,160
Ben St. the Imgir of Dave.

4225
03:37:05,160 --> 03:37:06,160
Notice that.

4226
03:37:06,160 --> 03:37:07,160
Like in Phantom, that's the...

4227
03:37:07,160 --> 03:37:09,160
Yeah, I was about to say.

4228
03:37:09,160 --> 03:37:11,160
I like that they're being crucified.

4229
03:37:11,160 --> 03:37:13,160
That makes me smile.

4230
03:37:13,160 --> 03:37:15,160
Hard voicemail, but the image is great, I love it.

4231
03:37:15,160 --> 03:37:16,160
Yeah.

4232
03:37:16,160 --> 03:37:19,160
The image is very good.

4233
03:37:19,160 --> 03:37:23,160
Ben will make the blue race.

4234
03:37:23,160 --> 03:37:24,160
Is that Slime?

4235
03:37:24,160 --> 03:37:26,160
Is that like an ocean of Slime behind them?

4236
03:37:26,160 --> 03:37:27,160
Looks like it.

4237
03:37:27,160 --> 03:37:29,160
I'm gonna say it is, yeah.

4238
03:37:29,160 --> 03:37:31,160
It's kinda now.

4239
03:37:32,160 --> 03:37:33,160
What?

4240
03:37:33,160 --> 03:37:34,160
What?

4241
03:37:34,160 --> 03:37:35,160
What?

4242
03:37:35,160 --> 03:37:36,160
What?

4243
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:38,160
Okay, next voicemail.

4244
03:37:38,160 --> 03:37:39,160
There it is.

4245
03:37:39,160 --> 03:37:42,160
It's called...

4246
03:37:42,160 --> 03:37:44,160
Backwards Message.

4247
03:37:44,160 --> 03:37:46,160
Three, two, one, go.

4248
03:37:46,160 --> 03:37:50,160
Erklaas kak yezee tnees neb.

4249
03:37:50,160 --> 03:37:55,160
Skak nekas knyal ya tnees neb.

4250
03:37:55,160 --> 03:37:58,160
Ze amin nyam.

4251
03:37:58,160 --> 03:38:00,160
Sounds like oblivion.

4252
03:38:00,160 --> 03:38:01,160
Definitely oblivion.

4253
03:38:01,160 --> 03:38:03,160
I wonder why it sounds like me.

4254
03:38:04,160 --> 03:38:05,160
Oblivion.

4255
03:38:05,160 --> 03:38:06,160
Let's see the next voicemail.

4256
03:38:06,160 --> 03:38:08,160
Do you want to translate for us?

4257
03:38:08,160 --> 03:38:10,160
The next voicemail.

4258
03:38:10,160 --> 03:38:12,160
Just do the next one.

4259
03:38:12,160 --> 03:38:14,160
How many more are out there?

4260
03:38:14,160 --> 03:38:16,160
We're on the last page.

4261
03:38:16,160 --> 03:38:20,160
There's only maybe 10 or 15 left?

4262
03:38:20,160 --> 03:38:21,160
10.

4263
03:38:21,160 --> 03:38:24,160
Yeah, we kinda got a lot this week.

4264
03:38:24,160 --> 03:38:27,160
Oblivion, I never told you how much I love

4265
03:38:27,160 --> 03:38:30,160
when I was editing the episode and the fucking...

4266
03:38:30,160 --> 03:38:32,160
Oh, put the baby in a blender.

4267
03:38:32,160 --> 03:38:34,160
The fucking stuff.

4268
03:38:34,160 --> 03:38:36,160
Oh, put the baby in a blender.

4269
03:38:36,160 --> 03:38:38,160
The baby in a blender.

4270
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:40,160
No, you want to.

4271
03:38:40,160 --> 03:38:42,160
You need to.

4272
03:38:42,160 --> 03:38:46,160
The next one is called...

4273
03:38:46,160 --> 03:38:49,160
S-A-G-S-M-S-D-R-O-C-C-A-B.

4274
03:38:49,160 --> 03:38:51,160
Three, two, one, go.

4275
03:38:51,160 --> 03:38:55,160
My name is Ben St.

4276
03:38:55,160 --> 03:38:58,160
I like sucking cock.

4277
03:38:58,160 --> 03:38:59,160
No!

4278
03:38:59,160 --> 03:39:02,160
Ben St. is a cock sucker.

4279
03:39:02,160 --> 03:39:07,160
How did you get this secret recording of me saying that?

4280
03:39:07,160 --> 03:39:10,160
I knew that the word cock was in there

4281
03:39:10,160 --> 03:39:13,160
because it sounds the same in backwards.

4282
03:39:13,160 --> 03:39:14,160
Yeah, cock.

4283
03:39:14,160 --> 03:39:16,160
I was struggling to say cock backwards,

4284
03:39:16,160 --> 03:39:18,160
and then I realized just say cock.

4285
03:39:18,160 --> 03:39:20,160
Yeah.

4286
03:39:23,160 --> 03:39:24,160
Yeah, I really did.

4287
03:39:24,160 --> 03:39:27,160
I really did say it backwards and then reverse it.

4288
03:39:27,160 --> 03:39:30,160
It was a little fun, but if you do it one syllable at a time,

4289
03:39:30,160 --> 03:39:31,160
it's easy.

4290
03:39:31,160 --> 03:39:32,160
You can't...

4291
03:39:32,160 --> 03:39:35,160
It's not like Yvonne at Nia's.

4292
03:39:35,160 --> 03:39:36,160
You can't just read.

4293
03:39:36,160 --> 03:39:40,160
You can't just write it backwards and then read it phonetically.

4294
03:39:40,160 --> 03:39:42,160
What I did is I recorded myself saying it,

4295
03:39:42,160 --> 03:39:44,160
and then I reversed the recording,

4296
03:39:44,160 --> 03:39:46,160
listened to each syllable,

4297
03:39:46,160 --> 03:39:48,160
every two syllables one at a time,

4298
03:39:48,160 --> 03:39:50,160
and just recorded myself just saying those parts

4299
03:39:50,160 --> 03:39:51,160
and putting them together.

4300
03:39:51,160 --> 03:39:52,160
That makes sense.

4301
03:39:52,160 --> 03:39:54,160
Think that's what I did in 10 minutes.

4302
03:39:54,160 --> 03:39:55,160
For Twin Peaks.

4303
03:39:55,160 --> 03:39:56,160
Yeah.

4304
03:39:56,160 --> 03:39:58,160
Yeah, Twin Peaks did that.

4305
03:39:58,160 --> 03:39:59,160
Wait, wait.

4306
03:39:59,160 --> 03:40:01,160
Didn't you retire?

4307
03:40:01,160 --> 03:40:03,160
This took me like 10 minutes to see it all.

4308
03:40:03,160 --> 03:40:04,160
It was fine.

4309
03:40:04,160 --> 03:40:06,160
10 minutes.

4310
03:40:06,160 --> 03:40:09,160
Who has time for that?

4311
03:40:09,160 --> 03:40:12,160
I need satanic messaging is so important.

4312
03:40:12,160 --> 03:40:15,160
Yeah, in your music, not in the PCK.

4313
03:40:15,160 --> 03:40:16,160
Nothing more satanic than Ben saying,

4314
03:40:16,160 --> 03:40:19,160
suckin' a big cock, dude.

4315
03:40:19,160 --> 03:40:22,160
I like the medium size.

4316
03:40:22,160 --> 03:40:25,160
Regular cock, please.

4317
03:40:25,160 --> 03:40:27,160
Next average.

4318
03:40:27,160 --> 03:40:30,160
I wanted to sit right on top of that bell curve.

4319
03:40:30,160 --> 03:40:35,160
Ben, that's my cock you're describing right now.

4320
03:40:35,160 --> 03:40:38,160
It's most cock.

4321
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:40,160
Exactly six inches.

4322
03:40:40,160 --> 03:40:41,160
Wait a minute.

4323
03:40:41,160 --> 03:40:42,160
No more, no less.

4324
03:40:42,160 --> 03:40:45,160
I'm average.

4325
03:40:45,160 --> 03:40:47,160
Next voicemail is called,

4326
03:40:47,160 --> 03:40:50,160
Newer fan wants lore, please.

4327
03:40:50,160 --> 03:40:52,160
Three, two, one, go.

4328
03:40:52,160 --> 03:40:55,160
So inspired by last week's

4329
03:40:55,160 --> 03:40:58,160
newer PCP fan asking about

4330
03:40:58,160 --> 03:41:00,160
Prince Isolation asking about

4331
03:41:00,160 --> 03:41:02,160
Colt Corona, Hilarious.

4332
03:41:02,160 --> 03:41:06,160
Questions about lore as a newer PCP fan myself.

4333
03:41:06,160 --> 03:41:09,160
So I'm a fan of the comic,

4334
03:41:09,160 --> 03:41:12,160
Slam and Punishment, I think it's good.

4335
03:41:12,160 --> 03:41:14,160
And I get pretty much everything that's going on there.

4336
03:41:14,160 --> 03:41:18,160
With the exception of strawberry milk.

4337
03:41:18,160 --> 03:41:20,160
Who is strawberry milk?

4338
03:41:20,160 --> 03:41:22,160
What's the deal with strawberry milk?

4339
03:41:22,160 --> 03:41:24,160
What is strawberry milk?

4340
03:41:24,160 --> 03:41:28,160
Give me some lore on that dragon looking boy.

4341
03:41:28,160 --> 03:41:30,160
Sure, fair.

4342
03:41:30,160 --> 03:41:36,160
Strawberry milk was Munchie's MLP Sona.

4343
03:41:36,160 --> 03:41:38,160
Use a dragon.

4344
03:41:38,160 --> 03:41:39,160
Yeah, that's it.

4345
03:41:39,160 --> 03:41:40,160
It was cool.

4346
03:41:40,160 --> 03:41:42,160
I had Phantom horn, Nate had keg standard,

4347
03:41:42,160 --> 03:41:44,160
Munchie had strawberry milk.

4348
03:41:44,160 --> 03:41:46,160
He never made any videos with strawberry milk,

4349
03:41:46,160 --> 03:41:51,160
although he is in the RFCK episodes

4350
03:41:51,160 --> 03:41:53,160
where we talk about brony shit.

4351
03:41:53,160 --> 03:41:55,160
Phantom and strawberry.

4352
03:41:55,160 --> 03:41:57,160
So he's kind of...

4353
03:41:57,160 --> 03:41:59,160
He's also kind of RFCK.

4354
03:41:59,160 --> 03:42:03,160
Didn't he make strawberry milk for something like that?

4355
03:42:03,160 --> 03:42:05,160
No, he had strawberry milk.

4356
03:42:05,160 --> 03:42:07,160
Strawberry milk was his Sona even back in

4357
03:42:07,160 --> 03:42:10,160
at BronyCon, back in the day.

4358
03:42:10,160 --> 03:42:13,160
I saw some doodles of him.

4359
03:42:13,160 --> 03:42:17,160
He looks like Spike the Dragon plus Steven Universe.

4360
03:42:17,160 --> 03:42:19,160
Basically.

4361
03:42:19,160 --> 03:42:21,160
Yeah.

4362
03:42:21,160 --> 03:42:24,160
I made him big.

4363
03:42:24,160 --> 03:42:26,160
Because, I don't know.

4364
03:42:26,160 --> 03:42:28,160
He changed the design.

4365
03:42:28,160 --> 03:42:31,160
Originally, he looked much more like Spike the Dragon,

4366
03:42:31,160 --> 03:42:34,160
but I think he changed the design to be taller.

4367
03:42:34,160 --> 03:42:36,160
So this is the redesign version.

4368
03:42:36,160 --> 03:42:39,160
My version of strawberry milk is not faithful.

4369
03:42:39,160 --> 03:42:42,160
I basically fucked up and I wrote him wrong.

4370
03:42:42,160 --> 03:42:44,160
My version is not faithful.

4371
03:42:44,160 --> 03:42:46,160
The real strawberry milk is just a rapist

4372
03:42:46,160 --> 03:42:48,160
and a sexual predator.

4373
03:42:48,160 --> 03:42:51,160
It's just kind of like a funny bro who likes sex.

4374
03:42:51,160 --> 03:42:55,160
I soften the character a lot.

4375
03:42:55,160 --> 03:42:57,160
Munchie hates sex.

4376
03:42:57,160 --> 03:43:01,160
Yeah, Munchie hates sex, but strawberry milk

4377
03:43:01,160 --> 03:43:04,160
likes it to a criminal degree.

4378
03:43:04,160 --> 03:43:06,160
It's canon.

4379
03:43:06,160 --> 03:43:08,160
It's canon.

4380
03:43:08,160 --> 03:43:11,160
But not in Slime's Munchie.

4381
03:43:11,160 --> 03:43:13,160
Pledge to the PCP.

4382
03:43:13,160 --> 03:43:16,160
Listen to the fucking Five Nights at Freddy's versus...

4383
03:43:16,160 --> 03:43:18,160
Chucky Cheese.

4384
03:43:18,160 --> 03:43:20,160
Chucky Cheese.

4385
03:43:20,160 --> 03:43:22,160
Munchie's 20-minute long rant in that thing

4386
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:24,160
is one of my favorite things ever.

4387
03:43:24,160 --> 03:43:26,160
Oh my god.

4388
03:43:26,160 --> 03:43:30,160
Do you want to know a funny story about that?

4389
03:43:30,160 --> 03:43:32,160
You know what?

4390
03:43:32,160 --> 03:43:35,160
My then-girlfriend was on that bonus episode.

4391
03:43:35,160 --> 03:43:38,160
And she was really excited to just talk genuinely

4392
03:43:38,160 --> 03:43:40,160
about Chucky Cheese.

4393
03:43:40,160 --> 03:43:42,160
And she was mad.

4394
03:43:42,160 --> 03:43:44,160
She was angry afterwards.

4395
03:43:44,160 --> 03:43:48,160
She was angry that Munchie had talked too much.

4396
03:43:48,160 --> 03:43:52,160
I wanted to explain the history of Chucky Cheese

4397
03:43:52,160 --> 03:43:54,160
because I watched a documentary about it.

4398
03:43:54,160 --> 03:43:56,160
She was mad for a while.

4399
03:43:56,160 --> 03:43:58,160
She did get to explain it.

4400
03:43:58,160 --> 03:44:00,160
She explained it very well and it was interesting.

4401
03:44:00,160 --> 03:44:02,160
She did, but she was still mad.

4402
03:44:02,160 --> 03:44:04,160
I thought she did a good job.

4403
03:44:04,160 --> 03:44:06,160
She was mad.

4404
03:44:06,160 --> 03:44:08,160
She succeeded though.

4405
03:44:08,160 --> 03:44:10,160
I learned a lot and I thought it was cool stuff.

4406
03:44:10,160 --> 03:44:12,160
She was so shallow by Munchie.

4407
03:44:12,160 --> 03:44:14,160
I thought it was funny.

4408
03:44:14,160 --> 03:44:16,160
She did not appreciate it.

4409
03:44:16,160 --> 03:44:18,160
You know what?

4410
03:44:18,160 --> 03:44:20,160
There's a reason things didn't work out between us.

4411
03:44:20,160 --> 03:44:22,160
I'm going to fucking...

4412
03:44:22,160 --> 03:44:24,160
One day, one of my goals before I die

4413
03:44:24,160 --> 03:44:26,160
is to animate that rant.

4414
03:44:26,160 --> 03:44:28,160
I just have to do it.

4415
03:44:28,160 --> 03:44:30,160
It's so good.

4416
03:44:30,160 --> 03:44:32,160
400 episodes.

4417
03:44:32,160 --> 03:44:34,160
I remember in the moment

4418
03:44:34,160 --> 03:44:36,160
thinking that the rant was pretty funny

4419
03:44:36,160 --> 03:44:38,160
but also being very uncomfortable

4420
03:44:38,160 --> 03:44:40,160
because I could tell she was starting to see.

4421
03:44:40,160 --> 03:44:42,160
She was sitting right next to me

4422
03:44:42,160 --> 03:44:44,160
and I was like, oh, no.

4423
03:44:44,160 --> 03:44:46,160
Oh, dear.

4424
03:44:46,160 --> 03:44:48,160
I don't know what to do about this.

4425
03:44:48,160 --> 03:44:50,160
Oh, no.

4426
03:44:50,160 --> 03:44:52,160
Yeah.

4427
03:44:52,160 --> 03:44:54,160
I kind of remember what happened.

4428
03:44:54,160 --> 03:44:56,160
I think I was losing my breath laughing.

4429
03:44:56,160 --> 03:44:58,160
I remember him launching into

4430
03:44:58,160 --> 03:45:00,160
this diet ride.

4431
03:45:00,160 --> 03:45:02,160
This huge thing.

4432
03:45:02,160 --> 03:45:04,160
It just went on.

4433
03:45:04,160 --> 03:45:06,160
It just kept going.

4434
03:45:06,160 --> 03:45:08,160
Munchie's rant about the alternate world history

4435
03:45:08,160 --> 03:45:10,160
of the atomic bomb landing on a mouse

4436
03:45:10,160 --> 03:45:12,160
and creating the ultimate Adonis

4437
03:45:12,160 --> 03:45:14,160
who is the crust of the earth itself.

4438
03:45:14,160 --> 03:45:16,160
That is almost on the level

4439
03:45:16,160 --> 03:45:18,160
of the story that I told in English class

4440
03:45:18,160 --> 03:45:20,160
for my speech.

4441
03:45:20,160 --> 03:45:22,160
Oh, the one that was just steamed hams.

4442
03:45:22,160 --> 03:45:24,160
No, not the steamed hams.

4443
03:45:24,160 --> 03:45:26,160
It's just a speech about time travel

4444
03:45:26,160 --> 03:45:28,160
and the dinosaur is being wiped out

4445
03:45:28,160 --> 03:45:30,160
by these free-legged creatures.

4446
03:45:30,160 --> 03:45:32,160
Chuck E. Cheese is my godfather.

4447
03:45:32,160 --> 03:45:34,160
He's my father, but we call him a god.

4448
03:45:34,160 --> 03:45:36,160
Somebody should...

4449
03:45:36,160 --> 03:45:38,160
Look into his eyes. There is no lust.

4450
03:45:38,160 --> 03:45:40,160
That was so good.

4451
03:45:40,160 --> 03:45:42,160
Man, yeah.

4452
03:45:42,160 --> 03:45:44,160
I haven't thought about that in a while, but that was great.

4453
03:45:44,160 --> 03:45:46,160
Pledge to the PCP Patreon.

4454
03:45:46,160 --> 03:45:48,160
Bonus episodes.

4455
03:45:48,160 --> 03:45:50,160
He's my father, but he's so powerful

4456
03:45:50,160 --> 03:45:52,160
we call him a god.

4457
03:45:52,160 --> 03:45:54,160
It's amazing.

4458
03:45:54,160 --> 03:45:56,160
Honestly, I don't...

4459
03:45:56,160 --> 03:45:58,160
I forget most of the details.

4460
03:45:58,160 --> 03:46:00,160
I could go back and listen and refresh myself.

4461
03:46:02,160 --> 03:46:04,160
It's fucking funny.

4462
03:46:04,160 --> 03:46:06,160
I have a condensed version of the rant

4463
03:46:06,160 --> 03:46:08,160
where I cut out all the fluff

4464
03:46:08,160 --> 03:46:10,160
and cut out as much of Jackie as I could.

4465
03:46:12,160 --> 03:46:14,160
Alright, next voicemail.

4466
03:46:14,160 --> 03:46:16,160
It's called...

4467
03:46:16,160 --> 03:46:18,160
It's just called voicemail.

4468
03:46:18,160 --> 03:46:20,160
There it is.

4469
03:46:20,160 --> 03:46:22,160
Three, two, one, go.

4470
03:46:26,160 --> 03:46:28,160
Perfect.

4471
03:46:30,160 --> 03:46:32,160
A lot of just bodily sounds today.

4472
03:46:32,160 --> 03:46:34,160
A lot of burps.

4473
03:46:34,160 --> 03:46:36,160
This one's really...

4474
03:46:36,160 --> 03:46:38,160
These are not mine.

4475
03:46:38,160 --> 03:46:40,160
That is not mine.

4476
03:46:40,160 --> 03:46:42,160
That sounds like your...

4477
03:46:42,160 --> 03:46:44,160
This is because I'm the only fucking person

4478
03:46:44,160 --> 03:46:46,160
who puts a rasp in my voice sometimes.

4479
03:46:46,160 --> 03:46:48,160
You hear any rasp when you think it's me.

4480
03:46:48,160 --> 03:46:50,160
He just can't quit.

4481
03:46:50,160 --> 03:46:52,160
He said he wouldn't do it anymore,

4482
03:46:52,160 --> 03:46:54,160
but he can't break the habit

4483
03:46:54,160 --> 03:46:56,160
and now he just calls the voicemail

4484
03:46:56,160 --> 03:46:58,160
and just sits on the phone

4485
03:46:58,160 --> 03:47:00,160
and just breathing into the microphone.

4486
03:47:00,160 --> 03:47:02,160
I hear all the time.

4487
03:47:02,160 --> 03:47:04,160
When you thought it's over,

4488
03:47:04,160 --> 03:47:06,160
there was the force in everything.

4489
03:47:06,160 --> 03:47:08,160
I'm not even posting most of them.

4490
03:47:08,160 --> 03:47:10,160
I've cut out so many of them that are just oblivion falls.

4491
03:47:10,160 --> 03:47:12,160
Heavy breathing.

4492
03:47:12,160 --> 03:47:14,160
Hold on, let me try and go...

4493
03:47:14,160 --> 03:47:16,160
It's exactly the same.

4494
03:47:16,160 --> 03:47:18,160
It is.

4495
03:47:18,160 --> 03:47:20,160
It's the same. It's a match. We have a match.

4496
03:47:20,160 --> 03:47:22,160
Computer enhanced.

4497
03:47:22,160 --> 03:47:24,160
That one generally wasn't me

4498
03:47:24,160 --> 03:47:26,160
about what I was saying.

4499
03:47:26,160 --> 03:47:28,160
It's over.

4500
03:47:28,160 --> 03:47:30,160
It's as easy as a broadcast.

4501
03:47:30,160 --> 03:47:32,160
Sorry.

4502
03:47:32,160 --> 03:47:34,160
Your time in the League of Natefuckers.

4503
03:47:34,160 --> 03:47:36,160
You've been forcibly expelled from the League of Natefuckers.

4504
03:47:36,160 --> 03:47:38,160
No, I built that with my own hands.

4505
03:47:38,160 --> 03:47:40,160
No, you've been usurped.

4506
03:47:40,160 --> 03:47:42,160
You're fired. You're destroyed.

4507
03:47:42,160 --> 03:47:44,160
I mean, the League is cutting off your payments.

4508
03:47:44,160 --> 03:47:46,160
The next voicemail

4509
03:47:46,160 --> 03:47:48,160
is called Trixie.

4510
03:47:48,160 --> 03:47:50,160
Three, two, one, go.

4511
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:54,160
It just doesn't quit.

4512
03:47:54,160 --> 03:47:56,160
They just won't quit.

4513
03:47:56,160 --> 03:47:58,160
Next voicemail

4514
03:47:58,160 --> 03:48:00,160
is called

4515
03:48:00,160 --> 03:48:02,160
3, 2, 1, go.

4516
03:48:02,160 --> 03:48:04,160
I don't know what this is.

4517
03:48:04,160 --> 03:48:06,160
Attack on Titan?

4518
03:48:08,160 --> 03:48:10,160
It's what?

4519
03:48:10,160 --> 03:48:12,160
It's what?

4520
03:48:12,160 --> 03:48:14,160
Just it's.

4521
03:48:14,160 --> 03:48:16,160
Attack on Titan is...

4522
03:48:16,160 --> 03:48:18,160
Wait, there's another one.

4523
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:20,160
This one is also called

4524
03:48:20,160 --> 03:48:22,160
3, 2, 1, go.

4525
03:48:22,160 --> 03:48:24,160
Good.

4526
03:48:24,160 --> 03:48:26,160
No, bad.

4527
03:48:26,160 --> 03:48:28,160
Okay.

4528
03:48:28,160 --> 03:48:30,160
People were saying I should...

4529
03:48:30,160 --> 03:48:32,160
I've heard that Attack on Titan gets bad.

4530
03:48:32,160 --> 03:48:34,160
A couple people on Twitter were telling me

4531
03:48:34,160 --> 03:48:36,160
no, it's actually fine

4532
03:48:36,160 --> 03:48:38,160
and you should read it and maybe I will

4533
03:48:38,160 --> 03:48:40,160
read it at some point.

4534
03:48:40,160 --> 03:48:42,160
Dude, there's just some fucking great

4535
03:48:42,160 --> 03:48:44,160
art every so often.

4536
03:48:44,160 --> 03:48:46,160
Some giant funny skeleton creatures

4537
03:48:46,160 --> 03:48:48,160
that are cool.

4538
03:48:48,160 --> 03:48:50,160
Yeah.

4539
03:48:50,160 --> 03:48:52,160
I mean, I like that it

4540
03:48:52,160 --> 03:48:54,160
has an ending.

4541
03:48:54,160 --> 03:48:56,160
The fact that it has an ending makes me

4542
03:48:56,160 --> 03:48:58,160
like, I appreciate that. I should finish it

4543
03:48:58,160 --> 03:49:00,160
just in honor of the fact that it had the courage

4544
03:49:00,160 --> 03:49:02,160
to end. Good for it.

4545
03:49:02,160 --> 03:49:04,160
I appreciate it.

4546
03:49:04,160 --> 03:49:06,160
Next one is called

4547
03:49:06,160 --> 03:49:08,160
OPM

4548
03:49:08,160 --> 03:49:10,160
is 13 years old, by the way.

4549
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:12,160
3, 2, 1, go.

4550
03:49:14,160 --> 03:49:16,160
One punch man has become shit, too.

4551
03:49:16,160 --> 03:49:18,160
Don't read the manga

4552
03:49:18,160 --> 03:49:20,160
even though it looks awesome.

4553
03:49:20,160 --> 03:49:22,160
You read it anyway to look at the pictures.

4554
03:49:22,160 --> 03:49:24,160
Look at the pretty pictures

4555
03:49:24,160 --> 03:49:26,160
and read the webcomic for the awesome story.

4556
03:49:26,160 --> 03:49:28,160
That's what I've heard from my friend Fade

4557
03:49:28,160 --> 03:49:30,160
all up.

4558
03:49:30,160 --> 03:49:32,160
The manga

4559
03:49:34,160 --> 03:49:36,160
with the nice art

4560
03:49:36,160 --> 03:49:38,160
started adding on all this stuff

4561
03:49:38,160 --> 03:49:40,160
like a tournament arc and a bunch of other shit

4562
03:49:40,160 --> 03:49:42,160
that apparently is just really boring

4563
03:49:42,160 --> 03:49:44,160
shown and stuff apparently.

4564
03:49:44,160 --> 03:49:46,160
That's really dumb.

4565
03:49:46,160 --> 03:49:48,160
That's what I've heard.

4566
03:49:48,160 --> 03:49:50,160
I don't like it. I feel like the point of it

4567
03:49:50,160 --> 03:49:52,160
should have been to adapt

4568
03:49:52,160 --> 03:49:54,160
one's story.

4569
03:49:54,160 --> 03:49:56,160
I've totally lost patience

4570
03:49:56,160 --> 03:49:58,160
with tropes

4571
03:49:58,160 --> 03:50:00,160
like that.

4572
03:50:00,160 --> 03:50:02,160
Tropes.

4573
03:50:02,160 --> 03:50:04,160
Fucking tropes.

4574
03:50:04,160 --> 03:50:06,160
The tournament arc is like every single

4575
03:50:06,160 --> 03:50:08,160
thing has it. I've seen it.

4576
03:50:08,160 --> 03:50:10,160
It's the laziest way to make

4577
03:50:10,160 --> 03:50:12,160
fights happen.

4578
03:50:12,160 --> 03:50:14,160
You could totally make a good

4579
03:50:14,160 --> 03:50:16,160
tournament arc in a good way.

4580
03:50:16,160 --> 03:50:18,160
Tournament arcs are only good

4581
03:50:18,160 --> 03:50:20,160
in D&D where you're the DM

4582
03:50:20,160 --> 03:50:22,160
and you don't want to have

4583
03:50:22,160 --> 03:50:24,160
to do any work.

4584
03:50:24,160 --> 03:50:26,160
That's where they...

4585
03:50:26,160 --> 03:50:28,160
I want a story where there's a tournament

4586
03:50:28,160 --> 03:50:30,160
going on and the characters in the

4587
03:50:30,160 --> 03:50:32,160
show they go and watch it

4588
03:50:32,160 --> 03:50:34,160
and they're in the crowd. It's like, oh fuck

4589
03:50:34,160 --> 03:50:36,160
well that was fun. Let's go home.

4590
03:50:36,160 --> 03:50:38,160
I can't believe it's still

4591
03:50:38,160 --> 03:50:40,160
going after 13 years.

4592
03:50:40,160 --> 03:50:42,160
Where does that...

4593
03:50:42,160 --> 03:50:44,160
I don't have to read it to find out, but where does

4594
03:50:44,160 --> 03:50:46,160
that story go?

4595
03:50:46,160 --> 03:50:48,160
I can't even imagine.

4596
03:50:48,160 --> 03:50:50,160
The theme is that it's one punch

4597
03:50:50,160 --> 03:50:52,160
and he doesn't care

4598
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:54,160
about life.

4599
03:50:54,160 --> 03:50:56,160
He doesn't care about combat

4600
03:50:56,160 --> 03:50:58,160
but he's really good at it. He cares about

4601
03:50:58,160 --> 03:51:00,160
other things.

4602
03:51:00,160 --> 03:51:02,160
That doesn't really have a concrete

4603
03:51:02,160 --> 03:51:04,160
ending

4604
03:51:04,160 --> 03:51:06,160
unless he stops

4605
03:51:06,160 --> 03:51:08,160
punching.

4606
03:51:08,160 --> 03:51:10,160
I read the part where the

4607
03:51:10,160 --> 03:51:12,160
alien comes

4608
03:51:12,160 --> 03:51:14,160
because he's seeking

4609
03:51:14,160 --> 03:51:16,160
the most powerful opponent or whatever.

4610
03:51:16,160 --> 03:51:18,160
He's the most powerful alien.

4611
03:51:18,160 --> 03:51:20,160
That's what I read up to.

4612
03:51:20,160 --> 03:51:22,160
And I felt thematically

4613
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:24,160
that was like, yep, this is the thematic

4614
03:51:24,160 --> 03:51:26,160
conclusion to this whole

4615
03:51:26,160 --> 03:51:28,160
conceit of this story.

4616
03:51:28,160 --> 03:51:30,160
Makes sense. And that's where season one ends

4617
03:51:30,160 --> 03:51:32,160
which is the season with the really good animation

4618
03:51:32,160 --> 03:51:34,160
that's worth watching IMO.

4619
03:51:34,160 --> 03:51:36,160
So I can't even...

4620
03:51:36,160 --> 03:51:38,160
I can't even imagine where it goes in there

4621
03:51:38,160 --> 03:51:40,160
and I guess I shouldn't write it off without

4622
03:51:40,160 --> 03:51:42,160
reading it. I don't know, maybe it's so good.

4623
03:51:42,160 --> 03:51:44,160
His arm gets cut off and he can't punch

4624
03:51:44,160 --> 03:51:46,160
so he becomes one kick man.

4625
03:51:46,160 --> 03:51:48,160
No, he gets...

4626
03:51:48,160 --> 03:51:50,160
Everything removed except one finger

4627
03:51:50,160 --> 03:51:52,160
and one arm and he's one flick man.

4628
03:51:52,160 --> 03:51:54,160
He loses an arm

4629
03:51:54,160 --> 03:51:56,160
so he becomes literally one punch man

4630
03:51:56,160 --> 03:51:58,160
because he's...

4631
03:51:58,160 --> 03:52:00,160
He can only punch once.

4632
03:52:00,160 --> 03:52:02,160
Then he becomes fruit tropical punch man.

4633
03:52:04,160 --> 03:52:06,160
Hawaiian punch man.

4634
03:52:06,160 --> 03:52:08,160
Maybe he meets the red, like that guy

4635
03:52:08,160 --> 03:52:10,160
you know, the guy with the red hat

4636
03:52:10,160 --> 03:52:12,160
or whatever, or is it a snail?

4637
03:52:12,160 --> 03:52:14,160
No, the Hawaiian punch guy.

4638
03:52:14,160 --> 03:52:16,160
I don't know who he is.

4639
03:52:16,160 --> 03:52:18,160
The guy who punches people.

4640
03:52:18,160 --> 03:52:20,160
Uh, hold on.

4641
03:52:20,160 --> 03:52:22,160
Oh, I just finished another

4642
03:52:22,160 --> 03:52:24,160
in-between session from animations.

4643
03:52:24,160 --> 03:52:26,160
I've been working on this whole thing and I just finished. Hell yeah.

4644
03:52:26,160 --> 03:52:28,160
Here, here, here.

4645
03:52:28,160 --> 03:52:30,160
This...

4646
03:52:30,160 --> 03:52:32,160
This fucking guy

4647
03:52:32,160 --> 03:52:34,160
who...

4648
03:52:34,160 --> 03:52:36,160
I don't even know what he's supposed to be.

4649
03:52:36,160 --> 03:52:38,160
That's a cool hat.

4650
03:52:38,160 --> 03:52:40,160
You know this guy?

4651
03:52:40,160 --> 03:52:42,160
I think it's a hat.

4652
03:52:42,160 --> 03:52:44,160
This guy looks like he doesn't follow the rules.

4653
03:52:44,160 --> 03:52:46,160
I don't trust him.

4654
03:52:46,160 --> 03:52:48,160
There's seven kinds of fruit in Hawaiian punch.

4655
03:52:48,160 --> 03:52:50,160
Dude.

4656
03:52:50,160 --> 03:52:52,160
This guy's drunky.

4657
03:52:52,160 --> 03:52:54,160
He asks you, do you want a Hawaiian punch?

4658
03:52:54,160 --> 03:52:56,160
And then you say, hell yeah.

4659
03:52:56,160 --> 03:52:58,160
And then he slugs you.

4660
03:52:58,160 --> 03:53:00,160
He should be wearing a punch.

4661
03:53:00,160 --> 03:53:02,160
He beats the shit out of you.

4662
03:53:02,160 --> 03:53:04,160
That's his thing.

4663
03:53:04,160 --> 03:53:06,160
He should be wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

4664
03:53:06,160 --> 03:53:08,160
Wait a minute. Okay.

4665
03:53:08,160 --> 03:53:10,160
Okay, check this out.

4666
03:53:10,160 --> 03:53:12,160
This showed up in my search results.

4667
03:53:12,160 --> 03:53:14,160
Somebody else made the joke.

4668
03:53:14,160 --> 03:53:16,160
Somebody else made the same joke.

4669
03:53:16,160 --> 03:53:18,160
Oh.

4670
03:53:18,160 --> 03:53:20,160
Nothing's original then.

4671
03:53:20,160 --> 03:53:22,160
No, nothing new under the sun.

4672
03:53:24,160 --> 03:53:26,160
Alright, next voicemail is...

4673
03:53:26,160 --> 03:53:28,160
I think I already...

4674
03:53:28,160 --> 03:53:30,160
No, this is what it's called.

4675
03:53:30,160 --> 03:53:32,160
How is no one abusing this every week for fun?

4676
03:53:32,160 --> 03:53:34,160
Three, two, one, go.

4677
03:53:34,160 --> 03:53:36,160
What is this fucking system?

4678
03:53:36,160 --> 03:53:38,160
Can I just send a hundred voicemails right now?

4679
03:53:38,160 --> 03:53:40,160
Yeah.

4680
03:53:40,160 --> 03:53:42,160
I could send one every ten seconds.

4681
03:53:42,160 --> 03:53:44,160
I could send one every ten seconds.

4682
03:53:44,160 --> 03:53:46,160
For the rest of time.

4683
03:53:46,160 --> 03:53:48,160
It has been abused.

4684
03:53:48,160 --> 03:53:50,160
Sometime.

4685
03:53:50,160 --> 03:53:52,160
We're constantly being abused.

4686
03:53:52,160 --> 03:53:54,160
Dude, I abused the fuck out of the system

4687
03:53:54,160 --> 03:53:56,160
with the pig episode.

4688
03:53:56,160 --> 03:53:58,160
My god.

4689
03:53:58,160 --> 03:54:00,160
I got that up.

4690
03:54:00,160 --> 03:54:02,160
I ruined Ben's day.

4691
03:54:02,160 --> 03:54:04,160
I hated that episode.

4692
03:54:04,160 --> 03:54:06,160
I really, really hated it.

4693
03:54:06,160 --> 03:54:08,160
You have no idea how much

4694
03:54:08,160 --> 03:54:10,160
I was laughing listening to that episode

4695
03:54:10,160 --> 03:54:12,160
and how much I got you.

4696
03:54:12,160 --> 03:54:14,160
When I did that,

4697
03:54:14,160 --> 03:54:16,160
I just wanted to make fun of pig squealing.

4698
03:54:16,160 --> 03:54:18,160
It's a vocal method

4699
03:54:18,160 --> 03:54:20,160
in death metal.

4700
03:54:20,160 --> 03:54:22,160
Pig squealing needs to be taken down a peg.

4701
03:54:22,160 --> 03:54:24,160
It's been too high on the floor.

4702
03:54:24,160 --> 03:54:26,160
It does.

4703
03:54:26,160 --> 03:54:28,160
I didn't even do it anymore.

4704
03:54:28,160 --> 03:54:30,160
I somehow did it that one time.

4705
03:54:30,160 --> 03:54:32,160
Yeah, it was me. That was my voice.

4706
03:54:32,160 --> 03:54:34,160
I did the pig squealing noises.

4707
03:54:34,160 --> 03:54:36,160
Then I'm like, this sounds terrible.

4708
03:54:36,160 --> 03:54:38,160
What should I do with it?

4709
03:54:38,160 --> 03:54:40,160
How could I make this a voicemail?

4710
03:54:40,160 --> 03:54:42,160
I thought about it.

4711
03:54:42,160 --> 03:54:44,160
I have so many old voicemails from way back.

4712
03:54:44,160 --> 03:54:46,160
What if I just grab some of those?

4713
03:54:46,160 --> 03:54:48,160
What if I just put them in unexpectedly?

4714
03:54:48,160 --> 03:54:50,160
It's a different person every time,

4715
03:54:50,160 --> 03:54:52,160
so Ben will never expect it and he will just get jump-scared.

4716
03:54:52,160 --> 03:54:54,160
That's exactly what happens.

4717
03:54:54,160 --> 03:54:56,160
It got even better than that,

4718
03:54:56,160 --> 03:54:58,160
because I knew that Ben would eventually become wise.

4719
03:54:58,160 --> 03:55:00,160
He'd eventually realize early on,

4720
03:55:00,160 --> 03:55:02,160
wait, this person sounds like they're talking about Nate

4721
03:55:02,160 --> 03:55:04,160
or some shit from years ago.

4722
03:55:04,160 --> 03:55:06,160
Then what I did is,

4723
03:55:06,160 --> 03:55:08,160
I'll throw in a bunch of false flags.

4724
03:55:08,160 --> 03:55:10,160
I'll do three ones with the pig.

4725
03:55:10,160 --> 03:55:12,160
I'll throw in four false flags,

4726
03:55:12,160 --> 03:55:14,160
and then I'll throw in the other three.

4727
03:55:14,160 --> 03:55:16,160
The very first false flag I put in

4728
03:55:16,160 --> 03:55:18,160
was the first time you said,

4729
03:55:18,160 --> 03:55:20,160
it's the pig, isn't it?

4730
03:55:20,160 --> 03:55:22,160
And then it wasn't.

4731
03:55:22,160 --> 03:55:24,160
It was perfectly down to where you would

4732
03:55:24,160 --> 03:55:26,160
be bamboozled,

4733
03:55:26,160 --> 03:55:28,160
and then you got so fucking mad, too.

4734
03:55:28,160 --> 03:55:30,160
I think so much listening to it.

4735
03:55:30,160 --> 03:55:32,160
Mastermind.

4736
03:55:32,160 --> 03:55:34,160
I'm just like a mouse

4737
03:55:34,160 --> 03:55:36,160
running through your maze.

4738
03:55:40,160 --> 03:55:42,160
It was so fucked.

4739
03:55:42,160 --> 03:55:44,160
That is fucked.

4740
03:55:44,160 --> 03:55:46,160
I did my fake British accent

4741
03:55:46,160 --> 03:55:48,160
and Ben's like, that sounds like oblivion

4742
03:55:48,160 --> 03:55:50,160
and gib the British one.

4743
03:55:50,160 --> 03:55:52,160
No, it's too British.

4744
03:55:58,160 --> 03:56:00,160
Alright, next voicemail

4745
03:56:00,160 --> 03:56:02,160
is called 30s.

4746
03:56:02,160 --> 03:56:04,160
Three, two, one, go.

4747
03:56:04,160 --> 03:56:06,160
Oh my god, I'm leaving a voicemail

4748
03:56:06,160 --> 03:56:08,160
on the 300th episode of the PCP.

4749
03:56:08,160 --> 03:56:10,160
That's right.

4750
03:56:10,160 --> 03:56:12,160
It's all I ever wanted.

4751
03:56:12,160 --> 03:56:14,160
Same.

4752
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:16,160
This voicemail has been brought to you

4753
03:56:16,160 --> 03:56:18,160
by your 30s.

4754
03:56:18,160 --> 03:56:20,160
I'm down hill from here.

4755
03:56:20,160 --> 03:56:22,160
Woo!

4756
03:56:22,160 --> 03:56:24,160
I'm happy

4757
03:56:24,160 --> 03:56:26,160
that I am not

4758
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:28,160
I'm happy that I am not

4759
03:56:28,160 --> 03:56:30,160
one of these people

4760
03:56:30,160 --> 03:56:32,160
who has suffered

4761
03:56:32,160 --> 03:56:34,160
any kind of like horrible debilitation.

4762
03:56:34,160 --> 03:56:36,160
Some people are like,

4763
03:56:36,160 --> 03:56:38,160
you get 30 and then you just are in pain all the time

4764
03:56:38,160 --> 03:56:40,160
and everything starts to

4765
03:56:40,160 --> 03:56:42,160
fail. And I'm like, well,

4766
03:56:42,160 --> 03:56:44,160
it hasn't happened for me yet, so I guess

4767
03:56:44,160 --> 03:56:46,160
I'm should be pretty happy

4768
03:56:46,160 --> 03:56:48,160
about that.

4769
03:56:48,160 --> 03:56:50,160
It started hamming for me

4770
03:56:50,160 --> 03:56:52,160
in my early 20s with my fucking back.

4771
03:56:52,160 --> 03:56:54,160
This is what I get

4772
03:56:54,160 --> 03:56:56,160
for not getting drunk and hungover.

4773
03:56:56,160 --> 03:56:58,160
That's right.

4774
03:56:58,160 --> 03:57:00,160
It's good for you.

4775
03:57:00,160 --> 03:57:02,160
Yeah, it gives you exercise, makes you get out more

4776
03:57:02,160 --> 03:57:04,160
so you're not stuck sitting in a chair working constantly

4777
03:57:04,160 --> 03:57:06,160
hurting your back.

4778
03:57:06,160 --> 03:57:08,160
I still do that.

4779
03:57:08,160 --> 03:57:10,160
I still do that.

4780
03:57:10,160 --> 03:57:12,160
Okay, next one is called

4781
03:57:12,160 --> 03:57:14,160
The Chew Dynasty.

4782
03:57:14,160 --> 03:57:16,160
3, 2, 1,

4783
03:57:16,160 --> 03:57:18,160
go.

4784
03:57:22,160 --> 03:57:24,160
Nice beat.

4785
03:57:26,160 --> 03:57:28,160
There's lots of things you could imagine this being.

4786
03:57:32,160 --> 03:57:34,160
Just imagine like a little ant beatboxing.

4787
03:57:34,160 --> 03:57:36,160
Is this just going to keep going like this?

4788
03:57:40,160 --> 03:57:42,160
I'm not mentioning a little mouse

4789
03:57:42,160 --> 03:57:44,160
like you in the beatboxing.

4790
03:57:44,160 --> 03:57:46,160
I wanted to cut off and be like,

4791
03:57:46,160 --> 03:57:48,160
okay, cool. Anyway, what do you think of the new Pokemon game?

4792
03:57:58,160 --> 03:58:00,160
Just giggling at weird noises.

4793
03:58:02,160 --> 03:58:04,160
This is the procrastinator's experience.

4794
03:58:04,160 --> 03:58:06,160
He's really going for it.

4795
03:58:12,160 --> 03:58:14,160
He's really going for it.

4796
03:58:16,160 --> 03:58:18,160
He's really going to do a whole minute of this.

4797
03:58:18,160 --> 03:58:20,160
Okay.

4798
03:58:20,160 --> 03:58:22,160
Nice. Good luck.

4799
03:58:26,160 --> 03:58:28,160
Okay.

4800
03:58:28,160 --> 03:58:30,160
Is that Peter Gorfin?

4801
03:58:30,160 --> 03:58:32,160
Yeah.

4802
03:58:32,160 --> 03:58:34,160
Peter.

4803
03:58:34,160 --> 03:58:36,160
Peter.

4804
03:58:36,160 --> 03:58:38,160
You're a Peterphile.

4805
03:58:38,160 --> 03:58:40,160
Hey, Peter, I'm married to you.

4806
03:58:40,160 --> 03:58:42,160
That makes me a Peterphile.

4807
03:58:42,160 --> 03:58:44,160
They had to have made that joke.

4808
03:58:44,160 --> 03:58:46,160
I can't be the first one to make that joke.

4809
03:58:46,160 --> 03:58:48,160
A water potter?

4810
03:58:48,160 --> 03:58:50,160
This reminded me of that time when I was sus.

4811
03:58:54,160 --> 03:58:56,160
Next voicemail

4812
03:58:56,160 --> 03:58:58,160
is called...

4813
03:58:58,160 --> 03:59:00,160
Well, there's an image.

4814
03:59:00,160 --> 03:59:02,160
There's an image to go with it.

4815
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:04,160
Let's see.

4816
03:59:04,160 --> 03:59:06,160
I'll post it. I don't know.

4817
03:59:08,160 --> 03:59:10,160
I feel like I've hit a point

4818
03:59:10,160 --> 03:59:12,160
where I've deduced all I can deduce.

4819
03:59:12,160 --> 03:59:14,160
Ben saying

4820
03:59:14,160 --> 03:59:16,160
PCP bonus episode number 43

4821
03:59:16,160 --> 03:59:18,160
at 23.

4822
03:59:18,160 --> 03:59:20,160
Okay.

4823
03:59:20,160 --> 03:59:22,160
Alright, this is from the bonus episode

4824
03:59:22,160 --> 03:59:24,160
where I was learning...

4825
03:59:24,160 --> 03:59:26,160
Gib was teaching me how to play Minesweeper.

4826
03:59:26,160 --> 03:59:28,160
I was learning.

4827
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:30,160
I was in the process of learning.

4828
03:59:30,160 --> 03:59:32,160
That episode was so frustrating

4829
03:59:32,160 --> 03:59:34,160
to edit.

4830
03:59:34,160 --> 03:59:36,160
I'm sure it was.

4831
03:59:36,160 --> 03:59:38,160
If you know how to play.

4832
03:59:38,160 --> 03:59:40,160
I figured it out, though.

4833
03:59:40,160 --> 03:59:42,160
I figured it out.

4834
03:59:42,160 --> 03:59:44,160
I figured out how to do it.

4835
03:59:44,160 --> 03:59:46,160
I taught you how.

4836
03:59:46,160 --> 03:59:48,160
Well, yes.

4837
03:59:48,160 --> 03:59:50,160
With your help, I figured it out and I did it.

4838
03:59:50,160 --> 03:59:52,160
You can watch me expand my mind

4839
03:59:52,160 --> 03:59:54,160
in real time.

4840
03:59:54,160 --> 03:59:56,160
I'd love that episode.

4841
03:59:56,160 --> 03:59:58,160
I don't know if it was as bombastic

4842
03:59:58,160 --> 04:00:00,160
as

4843
04:00:00,160 --> 04:00:02,160
Munchie's

4844
04:00:02,160 --> 04:00:04,160
the

4845
04:00:04,160 --> 04:00:06,160
Chuck E. Cheese ramp.

4846
04:00:06,160 --> 04:00:08,160
You know how you can change the world

4847
04:00:08,160 --> 04:00:10,160
in Wordle by just changing the date

4848
04:00:10,160 --> 04:00:12,160
in your PC?

4849
04:00:12,160 --> 04:00:14,160
You could make a Wordle...

4850
04:00:14,160 --> 04:00:16,160
That was a voicemail last time.

4851
04:00:16,160 --> 04:00:18,160
You could make a Wordle competition.

4852
04:00:18,160 --> 04:00:20,160
When you finish a word, you just change the date.

4853
04:00:20,160 --> 04:00:22,160
Whoever does

4854
04:00:22,160 --> 04:00:24,160
the Wordle faster

4855
04:00:24,160 --> 04:00:26,160
wins.

4856
04:00:26,160 --> 04:00:28,160
But then I won't be able to do Wordle

4857
04:00:28,160 --> 04:00:30,160
for 10 days.

4858
04:00:30,160 --> 04:00:32,160
You'll be clean.

4859
04:00:32,160 --> 04:00:34,160
I think you would want

4860
04:00:34,160 --> 04:00:36,160
to do it in the least guesses.

4861
04:00:36,160 --> 04:00:38,160
I think you would take 10 Wordles

4862
04:00:38,160 --> 04:00:40,160
and be like, who can do

4863
04:00:40,160 --> 04:00:42,160
these 10 Wordles in the least

4864
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:44,160
total guesses?

4865
04:00:44,160 --> 04:00:46,160
There are other sites that

4866
04:00:46,160 --> 04:00:48,160
do the same thing as Wordle,

4867
04:00:48,160 --> 04:00:50,160
but it's not one per day.

4868
04:00:50,160 --> 04:00:52,160
It's not Wordle.

4869
04:00:52,160 --> 04:00:54,160
You need the IP.

4870
04:00:54,160 --> 04:00:56,160
You need the IP.

4871
04:00:56,160 --> 04:00:58,160
Yeah, it's all about that IP.

4872
04:00:58,160 --> 04:01:00,160
Anyway, let's listen to this voicemail.

4873
04:01:00,160 --> 04:01:02,160
Three, two, one, go.

4874
04:01:02,160 --> 04:01:04,160
Ho, ho, ho!

4875
04:01:04,160 --> 04:01:06,160
I am the

4876
04:01:06,160 --> 04:01:08,160
mind-sweeper deity!

4877
04:01:08,160 --> 04:01:10,160
And I think that you are

4878
04:01:10,160 --> 04:01:12,160
bad at the game!

4879
04:01:12,160 --> 04:01:14,160
Ho, ho, ho!

4880
04:01:14,160 --> 04:01:16,160
Why is the mind-sweeper deity a goat?

4881
04:01:16,160 --> 04:01:18,160
It's a goat woman.

4882
04:01:18,160 --> 04:01:20,160
Maybe?

4883
04:01:20,160 --> 04:01:22,160
Um, is it

4884
04:01:22,160 --> 04:01:24,160
Toriel?

4885
04:01:24,160 --> 04:01:26,160
June.

4886
04:01:26,160 --> 04:01:28,160
Sex question mark?

4887
04:01:28,160 --> 04:01:30,160
Sex?

4888
04:01:30,160 --> 04:01:32,160
Yes.

4889
04:01:32,160 --> 04:01:34,160
No, I'm good at the game now.

4890
04:01:34,160 --> 04:01:36,160
I learned it.

4891
04:01:36,160 --> 04:01:38,160
Next voicemail is called a quick question.

4892
04:01:38,160 --> 04:01:40,160
There it is.

4893
04:01:40,160 --> 04:01:42,160
Okay, we're almost done, by the way.

4894
04:01:42,160 --> 04:01:44,160
We got three more.

4895
04:01:44,160 --> 04:01:46,160
Three, two, one, go.

4896
04:01:46,160 --> 04:01:48,160
Funniest compliment you ever got.

4897
04:01:48,160 --> 04:01:50,160
Go.

4898
04:01:50,160 --> 04:01:52,160
Funniest compliment?

4899
04:01:52,160 --> 04:01:54,160
Funniest compliment?

4900
04:01:54,160 --> 04:01:56,160
Someone said I was really...

4901
04:01:56,160 --> 04:01:58,160
They really liked that skitser girl

4902
04:01:58,160 --> 04:02:00,160
once on a pro and on episode.

4903
04:02:00,160 --> 04:02:02,160
And you know what?

4904
04:02:02,160 --> 04:02:04,160
They really liked that skitser girl.

4905
04:02:04,160 --> 04:02:06,160
Yeah.

4906
04:02:06,160 --> 04:02:08,160
Wait, I actually

4907
04:02:08,160 --> 04:02:10,160
do know the funniest compliment I got.

4908
04:02:10,160 --> 04:02:12,160
Let me find it.

4909
04:02:12,160 --> 04:02:14,160
The funniest compliment I ever got is

4910
04:02:14,160 --> 04:02:16,160
kiss you then kiss Paul McCartney.

4911
04:02:18,160 --> 04:02:20,160
That's pretty good.

4912
04:02:20,160 --> 04:02:22,160
I don't know if I can think of

4913
04:02:22,160 --> 04:02:24,160
like a funny, like a compliment

4914
04:02:24,160 --> 04:02:26,160
that was funny somehow.

4915
04:02:26,160 --> 04:02:28,160
I can think of compliments that were like

4916
04:02:28,160 --> 04:02:30,160
upsetting to me because it's like

4917
04:02:30,160 --> 04:02:32,160
a trait that I didn't want to have.

4918
04:02:32,160 --> 04:02:34,160
And that they liked.

4919
04:02:34,160 --> 04:02:36,160
God, I can't, I can't...

4920
04:02:36,160 --> 04:02:38,160
I can't think of any compliments

4921
04:02:38,160 --> 04:02:40,160
I got on that one.

4922
04:02:40,160 --> 04:02:42,160
It's my cat. Does that help?

4923
04:02:42,160 --> 04:02:44,160
Almost as cute.

4924
04:02:44,160 --> 04:02:46,160
I would never imply that anyone is

4925
04:02:46,160 --> 04:02:48,160
actually as cute as my pet cat.

4926
04:02:48,160 --> 04:02:50,160
My cats are very cute.

4927
04:02:50,160 --> 04:02:52,160
Almost.

4928
04:02:52,160 --> 04:02:54,160
That's a pretty high bar.

4929
04:02:54,160 --> 04:02:56,160
I don't know if the compliment itself is funny

4930
04:02:56,160 --> 04:02:58,160
but it's from a funny person

4931
04:02:58,160 --> 04:03:00,160
because they've tracked me down

4932
04:03:00,160 --> 04:03:02,160
on the PCP, on the draw cast,

4933
04:03:02,160 --> 04:03:04,160
other places in the left comments like these.

4934
04:03:04,160 --> 04:03:06,160
I love Oblivionfall.

4935
04:03:06,160 --> 04:03:08,160
I wish they were mine.

4936
04:03:08,160 --> 04:03:10,160
They will be mine.

4937
04:03:12,160 --> 04:03:14,160
Oblivion, I think that's called a stalker.

4938
04:03:16,160 --> 04:03:18,160
Look, if they're an adult female,

4939
04:03:18,160 --> 04:03:20,160
like maybe...

4940
04:03:20,160 --> 04:03:22,160
I wish they were mine.

4941
04:03:22,160 --> 04:03:24,160
Like a bro.

4942
04:03:24,160 --> 04:03:26,160
Like a conglomerate.

4943
04:03:26,160 --> 04:03:28,160
God, I can't think of anything. Sorry.

4944
04:03:28,160 --> 04:03:30,160
I only get sincere compliments

4945
04:03:30,160 --> 04:03:32,160
that are good because I'm

4946
04:03:32,160 --> 04:03:34,160
so cool.

4947
04:03:34,160 --> 04:03:36,160
I did um...

4948
04:03:36,160 --> 04:03:38,160
I don't know if it's...

4949
04:03:38,160 --> 04:03:40,160
I did win... This is bizarre.

4950
04:03:40,160 --> 04:03:42,160
I did win Best Dressed

4951
04:03:42,160 --> 04:03:44,160
in my high school yearbook

4952
04:03:44,160 --> 04:03:46,160
in my graduating class.

4953
04:03:48,160 --> 04:03:50,160
Show up in nothing but slime.

4954
04:03:50,160 --> 04:03:52,160
They could see all your junk.

4955
04:03:52,160 --> 04:03:54,160
I'm stupid. I just wore suits.

4956
04:03:54,160 --> 04:03:56,160
I just wore suits all the time.

4957
04:03:56,160 --> 04:03:58,160
Why?

4958
04:03:58,160 --> 04:04:00,160
It's like a quirky affectation

4959
04:04:00,160 --> 04:04:02,160
that I did to be funny.

4960
04:04:02,160 --> 04:04:04,160
I just wore suits to school every day.

4961
04:04:04,160 --> 04:04:06,160
That's so quirky.

4962
04:04:06,160 --> 04:04:08,160
And they won Best Dressed.

4963
04:04:08,160 --> 04:04:10,160
Yeah.

4964
04:04:10,160 --> 04:04:12,160
I wasn't actually well-dressed.

4965
04:04:12,160 --> 04:04:14,160
I just had some suits and I wore them.

4966
04:04:14,160 --> 04:04:16,160
There were other guys who actually...

4967
04:04:16,160 --> 04:04:18,160
There was one guy, I remember,

4968
04:04:18,160 --> 04:04:20,160
who was actually well-dressed.

4969
04:04:20,160 --> 04:04:22,160
He wore a sweater vest

4970
04:04:22,160 --> 04:04:24,160
and buttoned down polo shirt combinations.

4971
04:04:24,160 --> 04:04:26,160
He was actually a well-dressed guy.

4972
04:04:26,160 --> 04:04:28,160
And that guy should have won.

4973
04:04:28,160 --> 04:04:30,160
But because I was not

4974
04:04:30,160 --> 04:04:32,160
better dressed, I was more dressed.

4975
04:04:32,160 --> 04:04:34,160
It was like how in the Oscars

4976
04:04:34,160 --> 04:04:36,160
you don't really get an award for best editing.

4977
04:04:36,160 --> 04:04:38,160
You get an award for most editing.

4978
04:04:38,160 --> 04:04:40,160
Like the flashiest editing wins.

4979
04:04:40,160 --> 04:04:42,160
It's why people like the high-framing anime.

4980
04:04:42,160 --> 04:04:44,160
It's not about the animation being good.

4981
04:04:44,160 --> 04:04:46,160
It's about just having lots of it.

4982
04:04:46,160 --> 04:04:48,160
Yeah. My stupid jokes

4983
04:04:48,160 --> 04:04:50,160
wear a suit every day gimmick.

4984
04:04:50,160 --> 04:04:52,160
Attracted more attention than this guy.

4985
04:04:52,160 --> 04:04:54,160
This guy's sweater vest.

4986
04:04:54,160 --> 04:04:56,160
And so I defeated him.

4987
04:04:56,160 --> 04:04:58,160
And I taught him a valuable lesson.

4988
04:04:58,160 --> 04:05:00,160
No matter what you do in life,

4989
04:05:00,160 --> 04:05:02,160
it'll never be good enough.

4990
04:05:02,160 --> 04:05:04,160
And you'll never be rewarded for...

4991
04:05:04,160 --> 04:05:06,160
Right. You'll never get your due.

4992
04:05:06,160 --> 04:05:08,160
You have to...

4993
04:05:08,160 --> 04:05:10,160
You gotta be a piece of shit.

4994
04:05:10,160 --> 04:05:12,160
You gotta be a piece of shit if you want to win.

4995
04:05:12,160 --> 04:05:14,160
But stay hydrated.

4996
04:05:16,160 --> 04:05:18,160
Yeah. Always stay hydrated.

4997
04:05:18,160 --> 04:05:20,160
Okay. We got two more.

4998
04:05:20,160 --> 04:05:22,160
The PCP logo is actually good.

4999
04:05:22,160 --> 04:05:24,160
It's actually just an image.

5000
04:05:26,160 --> 04:05:28,160
From afar, the new PCP logo

5001
04:05:28,160 --> 04:05:30,160
actually looks pretty good.

5002
04:05:30,160 --> 04:05:32,160
Oh yeah. That fucked up one

5003
04:05:32,160 --> 04:05:34,160
last time. Well, everything looks good from afar.

5004
04:05:36,160 --> 04:05:40,160
Everything looks perfect from far away.

5005
04:05:40,160 --> 04:05:42,160
Yeah.

5006
04:05:42,160 --> 04:05:44,160
If you can't see it very well, it actually looks pretty good.

5007
04:05:44,160 --> 04:05:46,160
Uh...

5008
04:05:46,160 --> 04:05:48,160
It's true, I guess.

5009
04:05:48,160 --> 04:05:50,160
Okay. Last one.

5010
04:05:50,160 --> 04:05:52,160
My girlfriend read something.

5011
04:05:52,160 --> 04:05:54,160
Three, two, one, go.

5012
04:05:54,160 --> 04:05:56,160
PCP.

5013
04:05:56,160 --> 04:05:58,160
I just wanted to say happy 300 episode.

5014
04:05:58,160 --> 04:06:00,160
Thank you. If I made it in time

5015
04:06:00,160 --> 04:06:02,160
and if not happy 300

5016
04:06:02,160 --> 04:06:04,160
and one, that's also a cool number.

5017
04:06:06,160 --> 04:06:08,160
So I was on vacation

5018
04:06:08,160 --> 04:06:10,160
with my girlfriend last week

5019
04:06:10,160 --> 04:06:12,160
and I brought my road to Radcon

5020
04:06:12,160 --> 04:06:14,160
which finally arrived because Ben

5021
04:06:14,160 --> 04:06:16,160
learned how to write the number three.

5022
04:06:16,160 --> 04:06:18,160
We should all be really proud of him.

5023
04:06:18,160 --> 04:06:20,160
I mis-addressed this guy's own book and she said,

5024
04:06:20,160 --> 04:06:22,160
what is this? And I tried to explain

5025
04:06:22,160 --> 04:06:24,160
it's a book written by some podcast people

5026
04:06:24,160 --> 04:06:26,160
I listened to.

5027
04:06:26,160 --> 04:06:28,160
And she said, okay, I'm going to read it.

5028
04:06:28,160 --> 04:06:30,160
I don't want to know what you're into.

5029
04:06:30,160 --> 04:06:32,160
So she started reading it

5030
04:06:32,160 --> 04:06:34,160
and she said, what the fuck is this garbage?

5031
04:06:34,160 --> 04:06:36,160
They broke up.

5032
04:06:36,160 --> 04:06:38,160
Okay, but she read...

5033
04:06:38,160 --> 04:06:40,160
She started at the beginning, so she was reading

5034
04:06:40,160 --> 04:06:42,160
Trixie's chapters, so that's not on me.

5035
04:06:42,160 --> 04:06:44,160
Uh...

5036
04:06:44,160 --> 04:06:46,160
If she wanted to know what it is,

5037
04:06:46,160 --> 04:06:48,160
the book explains what it is on the back.

5038
04:06:48,160 --> 04:06:50,160
You can just read the back of the book and it says.

5039
04:06:50,160 --> 04:06:52,160
So I think she just can't read

5040
04:06:52,160 --> 04:06:54,160
because if she could she would have known.

5041
04:06:54,160 --> 04:06:56,160
There's a full explanation.

5042
04:06:56,160 --> 04:06:58,160
Right there, so.

5043
04:07:02,160 --> 04:07:04,160
RotoradCon is very funny

5044
04:07:04,160 --> 04:07:06,160
and it has called Corona in it.

5045
04:07:06,160 --> 04:07:08,160
And it explains the origin

5046
04:07:08,160 --> 04:07:10,160
of the coronavirus.

5047
04:07:10,160 --> 04:07:12,160
I've said too much. I've spoiled everything.

5048
04:07:12,160 --> 04:07:14,160
The front cover is really cool.

5049
04:07:14,160 --> 04:07:16,160
We are the reason people are dying.

5050
04:07:16,160 --> 04:07:18,160
And yes, the front cover by Michi

5051
04:07:18,160 --> 04:07:20,160
is awesome, of course.

5052
04:07:20,160 --> 04:07:22,160
She's so good.

5053
04:07:22,160 --> 04:07:24,160
Actually, I don't know if they're a girl.

5054
04:07:24,160 --> 04:07:26,160
I don't know.

5055
04:07:26,160 --> 04:07:28,160
I just... I assume Michi's a girl

5056
04:07:28,160 --> 04:07:30,160
because Michi sounds like a girl name.

5057
04:07:30,160 --> 04:07:32,160
Because I knew a girl named Michi.

5058
04:07:32,160 --> 04:07:34,160
Or who went by Michi.

5059
04:07:34,160 --> 04:07:36,160
But I actually have no idea.

5060
04:07:36,160 --> 04:07:38,160
Okay, that's the last voicemail.

5061
04:07:38,160 --> 04:07:40,160
We're done.

5062
04:07:40,160 --> 04:07:42,160
We've been going for what, is this like four hours now?

5063
04:07:42,160 --> 04:07:44,160
Yes.

5064
04:07:44,160 --> 04:07:46,160
Four in a bit.

5065
04:07:46,160 --> 04:07:48,160
Lol.

5066
04:07:48,160 --> 04:07:50,160
I'm going back to bed now.

5067
04:07:50,160 --> 04:07:52,160
I need to go eat.

5068
04:07:52,160 --> 04:07:54,160
I need to go back to bed.

5069
04:07:54,160 --> 04:07:56,160
An hour ago, I wanted nothing more than to go...

5070
04:07:56,160 --> 04:07:58,160
You know what? I'm over my hangover. I feel better.

5071
04:07:58,160 --> 04:08:00,160
I feel fine.

5072
04:08:00,160 --> 04:08:02,160
I felt so shit this whole time.

5073
04:08:02,160 --> 04:08:04,160
But now I feel okay.

5074
04:08:04,160 --> 04:08:06,160
I've been invigorating.

5075
04:08:06,160 --> 04:08:08,160
I have work in two hours.

5076
04:08:08,160 --> 04:08:10,160
I have to go to a concert in like four hours.

5077
04:08:10,160 --> 04:08:12,160
We're great.

5078
04:08:12,160 --> 04:08:14,160
It was fun being on that.

5079
04:08:14,160 --> 04:08:16,160
It was a good...

5080
04:08:16,160 --> 04:08:18,160
You know what?

5081
04:08:18,160 --> 04:08:20,160
I would wake up at 1am

5082
04:08:20,160 --> 04:08:22,160
and do this podcast again.

5083
04:08:22,160 --> 04:08:24,160
Sorry about your

5084
04:08:24,160 --> 04:08:26,160
geographical handicap.

5085
04:08:26,160 --> 04:08:28,160
Sorry that the mail doesn't go

5086
04:08:28,160 --> 04:08:30,160
to your god forsaken country.

5087
04:08:30,160 --> 04:08:32,160
I only wish I didn't have work today.

5088
04:08:32,160 --> 04:08:34,160
If I didn't have work today, this would not be a problem.

5089
04:08:34,160 --> 04:08:36,160
But I do have work today.

5090
04:08:36,160 --> 04:08:38,160
So it's mildly inconvenient.

5091
04:08:38,160 --> 04:08:40,160
Just tell your boss.

5092
04:08:40,160 --> 04:08:42,160
Just like drag yourself into work.

5093
04:08:42,160 --> 04:08:44,160
Un-shaven and un-camped.

5094
04:08:44,160 --> 04:08:46,160
And you'd be like...

5095
04:08:46,160 --> 04:08:48,160
And show them RotoradCon.

5096
04:08:48,160 --> 04:08:50,160
Wait, what the hell happened to you?

5097
04:08:50,160 --> 04:08:52,160
And you'll say I was on a

5098
04:08:52,160 --> 04:08:54,160
podcast.

5099
04:08:54,160 --> 04:08:56,160
Ben, no.

5100
04:08:56,160 --> 04:08:58,160
I'm a cleaner

5101
04:08:58,160 --> 04:09:00,160
and I'm the only employee right now.

5102
04:09:00,160 --> 04:09:02,160
I have to get the work done

5103
04:09:02,160 --> 04:09:04,160
before the building's open.

5104
04:09:04,160 --> 04:09:06,160
And I'm the only one who can do it.

5105
04:09:06,160 --> 04:09:08,160
Are you like a DeVoo window cleaner?

5106
04:09:08,160 --> 04:09:10,160
No, worse.

5107
04:09:10,160 --> 04:09:12,160
I'm a whole building cleaner.

5108
04:09:12,160 --> 04:09:14,160
Oh.

5109
04:09:14,160 --> 04:09:16,160
Oh.

5110
04:09:16,160 --> 04:09:18,160
Which includes windows.

5111
04:09:18,160 --> 04:09:20,160
Oh, so you're better than DeVoo.

5112
04:09:22,160 --> 04:09:24,160
I kept vacuum.

5113
04:09:24,160 --> 04:09:26,160
I wipe things down.

5114
04:09:26,160 --> 04:09:28,160
I have to clean the gym

5115
04:09:28,160 --> 04:09:30,160
today.

5116
04:09:30,160 --> 04:09:32,160
It's gonna be fun.

5117
04:09:32,160 --> 04:09:34,160
Okay, sweaty.

5118
04:09:34,160 --> 04:09:36,160
Leave them a note

5119
04:09:36,160 --> 04:09:38,160
on the bench press that says,

5120
04:09:38,160 --> 04:09:40,160
okay, sweaty.

5121
04:09:42,160 --> 04:09:44,160
I don't know if I can get away with

5122
04:09:44,160 --> 04:09:46,160
that passing person.

5123
04:09:46,160 --> 04:09:48,160
After you wipe their salt stains

5124
04:09:48,160 --> 04:09:50,160
off the pads

5125
04:09:50,160 --> 04:09:52,160
or whatever.

5126
04:09:52,160 --> 04:09:54,160
I feel like it uses the machines to wipe

5127
04:09:54,160 --> 04:09:56,160
any touch points down.

5128
04:09:56,160 --> 04:09:58,160
And we got any last words before we conclude today?

5129
04:09:58,160 --> 04:10:00,160
Good night.

5130
04:10:00,160 --> 04:10:02,160
I think I'm good.

5131
04:10:02,160 --> 04:10:04,160
Peace and love.

5132
04:10:04,160 --> 04:10:06,160
Peace and love.

5133
04:10:06,160 --> 04:10:08,160
Patreon.com

5134
04:10:08,160 --> 04:10:10,160
Is it the procrastinators?

5135
04:10:10,160 --> 04:10:12,160
Oh my god.

5136
04:10:12,160 --> 04:10:14,160
It's Patreon.com

5137
04:10:14,160 --> 04:10:16,160
forward slash the drawcast.

5138
04:10:16,160 --> 04:10:18,160
We have bonus episodes up.

5139
04:10:18,160 --> 04:10:20,160
Extended episodes up.

5140
04:10:20,160 --> 04:10:22,160
Go give us some money, baby.

5141
04:10:22,160 --> 04:10:24,160
Yeah.

5142
04:10:24,160 --> 04:10:26,160
You still don't know how the URL is.

5143
04:10:26,160 --> 04:10:28,160
I don't like the PCP.

5144
04:10:28,160 --> 04:10:30,160
We all pay our guests to be on when the Patreon

5145
04:10:30,160 --> 04:10:32,160
earns enough.

5146
04:10:32,160 --> 04:10:34,160
And we also

5147
04:10:34,160 --> 04:10:36,160
already pay our editor.

5148
04:10:36,160 --> 04:10:38,160
And we keep that up to date.

5149
04:10:38,160 --> 04:10:40,160
We pay for the work he does.

5150
04:10:40,160 --> 04:10:42,160
How does that feel?

5151
04:10:42,160 --> 04:10:44,160
It's Nate's fault.

5152
04:10:44,160 --> 04:10:46,160
Nate's in charge of the finance.

5153
04:10:46,160 --> 04:10:48,160
Personal responsibility.

5154
04:10:48,160 --> 04:10:50,160
Ben, you're the host.

5155
04:10:50,160 --> 04:10:52,160
Personal fucking responsibility.

5156
04:10:52,160 --> 04:10:54,160
Okay, I guess that's it.

5157
04:10:54,160 --> 04:10:56,160
I guess that's the end.

5158
04:10:56,160 --> 04:10:58,160
Okay, bye.

5159
04:10:58,160 --> 04:11:00,160
Check out the fucking February.

5160
04:11:02,160 --> 04:11:04,160
And 300.

5161
04:11:04,160 --> 04:11:06,160
300 episodes.

5162
04:11:06,160 --> 04:11:08,160
Bye-bye.

5163
04:11:08,160 --> 04:11:10,160
Peace and love.

5164
04:11:36,160 --> 04:11:38,160
I am a stupid.

5165
04:11:38,160 --> 04:11:40,160
I've got a deadline.

5166
04:11:40,160 --> 04:11:42,160
Don't want to do it.
