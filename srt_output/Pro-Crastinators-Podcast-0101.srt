00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,340
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,340
First one back from Radcon, boys!

3
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:50,900
I am the best guy ever, and we're joined by Mr. Munchy.

4
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,100
Give me the chocolate.

5
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Ben Saint is here.

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,500
Yes, Nate. Mr. Munchy is Munchy's father's name.

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:08,740
No, he has an unrelated name. Munchy is, you know, and Hippocrit is here as well.

8
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,340
I'm a nice guy to everyone, but myself.

9
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,460
And a special guest, Mr. Double Munchy, Munchy's father.

10
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,900
Hello everyone, it's me, Mr. Munchy. This is Double Munchy.

11
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Munchy, I supplied the chocolate. That's why my son is so fast, because I have the bat chocolate right before me.

12
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:38,900
I am into forest feeding. That's my soul cake. No penetration, no any sex-only chocolate.

13
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Well, there he is. Thanks for joining us, Double Munchy.

14
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,900
Let's give him a big round of applause.

15
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Thanks for being here. Thanks for stopping by.

16
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Alright, enough retardation. What's the topic here? Define it. What's going on? Tell us.

17
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,900
Alright, here you go, everybody. The topic today is why being nice sucks.

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Why being nice is reprehensible behavior that you should not partake in.

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,900
But, Nate, what is the word nice mean? Like, does it mean something with army vets? Is it some sort of pension plan?

20
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
Is there something to do with these?

21
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Let me tell you that that's right. That's a very nice thing.

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:24,900
Here we go. Nice. Adjective. Nice. An adjective used to describe someone with exceptional skill in a certain area.

23
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,900
The term is never used pejoratively or sarcastically.

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,900
And here's the example. My man is real nice on the microphone.

25
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Stop. Stop. That is the worst possible joke.

26
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,900
Here's another one. Nice. This one has a bunch of definitions.

27
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,900
You're going to like this.

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
I doubt it very much.

29
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't know where this, like, talented thing is coming from. I mean, I guess it's sort of...

30
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Number one, talented.

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,900
Number two, an interjection similar to saying word when you are in agreement with what someone just said or you approve of what they said.

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Wait.

33
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Number three, high on marijuana.

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,900
These are the worst fucking jokes.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,900
There's another one that says nice, something you say to the guy you don't want to fuck.

36
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Like, hey, you're a real nice guy, dot, dot, dot, but pregnant pause in my non-pregnant vulva.

37
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
Mmm.

38
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Well, this is a literal catastrophe.

39
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,900
This is terrible. There are literally no good definitions of the word nice.

40
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
I don't think any of these captured.

41
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
Here's my definition of the word nice.

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Nice is nice, but it's not great. That's what I think.

43
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,900
You know what? Actually, there is one more. That is pretty accurate.

44
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Here's like a longer definition. This one's like kind of okay.

45
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:01,900
Used by men to describe all women in an off-handed way when expressing their real opinions will cause them great troubles.

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:10,900
For example, they could be under threat of being slapped or dumped by their girlfriends or getting punched and kicked into a pile by their buddies.

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
Oh my God, this is terrible. These are all bad.

48
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Punched or kicked into a pile by their buddies.

49
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
By their buddy? Like, what?

50
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Hey man, what?

51
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
You don't fucking talk that way about a lady.

52
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,900
Roundhouse kick into the pile like the rest of the misogynist.

53
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,900
I've got a bag full of misogynists that I'm gonna stuff you into.

54
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:35,900
If one of my friends ever comes up to me and starts telling me that I'm not treating my GF enough like a queen, we're gonna have some problems.

55
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
He's gonna knock you into a pile.

56
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,900
Okay guys, we have to do it. We have to deviate from our God canon here.

57
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
I come up with our own definition.

58
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
We cannot do it.

59
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,900
We must. Like, below this is number six.

60
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
The plan is all we have.

61
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
Number one, skillful.

62
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Number two, high.

63
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,900
Why is high? Why?

64
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
Why was high on there a few times?

65
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,900
Why is like weed related to the word nice in any way?

66
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
What?

67
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
I think we're behind the times guys.

68
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
I think we're obsolete.

69
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Number seven, nice. Aesthetically pleasing.

70
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
That's like kind of...

71
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
That's sort of specific.

72
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Nice is a very vague term.

73
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
According to Google search.

74
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Nice is an adjective mean pleasant, agreeable, satisfactory.

75
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Well, there you go.

76
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,900
Maybe we should use Google instead of...

77
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Maybe we should Bing it guys.

78
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Maybe we should Bing it.

79
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
We really should be Bing it.

80
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
That's the solution here.

81
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
What a fucking clusterfuck.

82
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Defining nice has been the greatest clusterfuck in all PCB history.

83
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
You know what I'll bet?

84
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
I'll bet there's some like...

85
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
Child's play. Baby shit.

86
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,900
Trying to find out what the word nice means impossible.

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Hey, what's that website that has like...

88
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
It's always like how to blank,

89
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,900
and then there'll be a bunch of steps with like really ugly drawings.

90
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Rimezone.org?

91
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
No, no, no.

92
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Let's go on wiki how and look up how to be nice.

94
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Yeah, okay.

95
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Let's see what we got.

96
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
I hate this.

97
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
This is not nice right now.

98
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I'm gonna give an abbreviator.

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
Number one, smile.

100
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Number two, acknowledge other people.

101
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Number three, be a good listener.

102
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Number four, be courteous, polite, and helpful.

103
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
You're welcome. Thank you.

104
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Let me just amend that to include trustworthy, loyal,

105
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,

106
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.

107
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
To my scouts.

108
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Number five, practice empathy.

109
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
Ooh, I don't know about that one.

110
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
I'm gonna have to crush that one.

111
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Look at this picture of Nate,

112
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
best guy ever being empathetic.

113
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
I'm fucking blind.

114
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
I am blind in this situation.

115
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
He had to...

116
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
He's losing his sight.

117
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
He had to develop a new sense.

118
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
A new sense to help him navigate the world.

119
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
And that sense was empathetic.

120
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
What you're actually describing here is Mr. Clean

121
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
being nice to me post blindness

122
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
because it's the other guy asking for help

123
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
or asking if this blind man needs help.

124
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,900
You're not only blind, you're actually like hobbling.

125
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
That's not a walking stick.

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
That is a crutch you're holding.

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
My legs have been destroyed.

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
This evolves into monsters 2.0.

129
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
We could be not spending all our time on WikiHow.

130
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
We spent eight minutes trying to find out

131
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
what the word fucking nice means.

132
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
We have to get back on track here.

133
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Pleasant.

134
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Pleasant is really what it means.

135
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Allow me to have the floor.

136
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Allow me to have the micro pass.

137
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Wait, wait, wait. First, I just want to say

138
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
that I don't think anything in the world bothers me

139
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
as much as the drawings on WikiHow.

140
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
They're very...

141
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
It's worse than that.

142
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
The kind of feeling I get

143
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
looking at WikiHow.

144
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
It's kind of like how when you see furry art

145
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
that's really furry and it's like,

146
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
it's got that furry feeling about it.

147
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
WikiHow is the same.

148
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
The dial of Mario's turned to maximum for way past

149
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
the legal amount.

150
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
The drawings on WikiHow is kind of similar

151
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
to my problems with being nice in general.

152
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
It's kind of just like basic.

153
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
It's kind of boring.

154
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
It's kind of uninteresting and surface level.

155
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
That leads into my...

156
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
I want to have the first word here.

157
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
This topic is

158
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
vile and embarrassing.

159
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
This topic literally

160
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
makes me feel like

161
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
sad that I live in a world

162
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
and I live in a group

163
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
where this topic can be seen as

164
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
okay to be. I can't believe it's real.

165
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
I cannot believe

166
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
that we are such a fucking

167
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
pretentious, sanctimonious, conceded

168
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
group that the topic

169
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
why being nice sucks

170
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
is treated with any sort of respect

171
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,900
whatsoever. It's embarrassing

172
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
and frankly, I think this is the worst topic.

173
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Not like a mom...

174
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Did you not suggest this topic?

175
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
This is the worst topic because it just shows

176
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
a look into our souls

177
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
and how dirty and broken we are.

178
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
In times, don't treat the PCP like their idols.

179
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
We are broken individuals

180
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
but that cannot be resonated

181
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
any higher than it is

182
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
right now with the topic

183
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
why being nice sucks. This proves

184
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
that none of us have love or

185
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
deserve love and we should be shot

186
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
immediately if you see us in the streets.

187
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Any of us.

188
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Was this not your suggestion?

189
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Yeah.

190
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Oh my god.

191
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
It was

192
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
but only because I hated it so much

193
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
that it was on the docket.

194
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Fair enough. Listen

195
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
the reason why it is

196
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,900
perfectly reasonable to bring up this

197
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
topic is because just like Ben

198
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
everyone out there isn't using their brain

199
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
properly when they think about the world.

200
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Tell me more.

201
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
Being nice is the most

202
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
shameful

203
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
course of action

204
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
that one can take in their life.

205
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Listen, listen.

206
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
This is going to come down to the

207
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
topic of like nice guys for me.

208
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
That's what it boils down to.

209
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Nice girls and anybody. Nice guys

210
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
finish last.

211
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
It is the most quoted

212
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
phrase in human history for a reason

213
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
and it's because it's so true.

214
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
Everyone understands this on an

215
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
instinctual biological level.

216
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Being nice is a mistake

217
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
across the board.

218
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
Never apologize for who you are.

219
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
I have to take my wheelchair.

220
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Never apologize for what you need.

221
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
I feel like I'm on

222
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
both sides of this because like

223
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
I understand that

224
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
yeah nice guys finish last

225
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
for a reason it's true but

226
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
I like being nice.

227
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,900
I like being wholesome and good

228
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
and doing good things for people.

229
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
Well, no.

230
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
The thing is

231
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
there's no pressure here.

232
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
This can be overdone and I think

233
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
that's what nice guys finish last

234
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
means because if a nice guy has nothing

235
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
but being nice they will not

236
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
get very far. They have to be cool as well.

237
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Hold on. I'm sure this

238
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
realistically doesn't need to be said because

239
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
we can all imagine what Nate's position is.

240
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
We already know it in our mind but

241
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
obviously you're going to come down hard

242
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
on being nice because that's just the kind of guy you are.

243
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
So please explain your relationship

244
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
with being nice and having warmth

245
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
and loving. Let me blackpill everybody

246
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
as I do all the time on being nice.

247
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Listen, being nice is a fucking

248
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
scheme to make you subservient

249
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
to the rest of the world. It is a literal

250
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
trick. Don't do it.

251
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
Don't fucking do it. Okay, here's the real deal.

252
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Let's say you're a guy and you're

253
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
just like a 16-year-old guy

254
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
and you want a girlfriend. How do you

255
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
get the girlfriend? Yeah,

256
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
it makes out for life my brothers but

257
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
putting that aside, let's say this is your goal.

258
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
You don't get there by

259
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
just going around and being pleasant.

260
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
You get it by just doing the things

261
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
that you want to do in life and then people

262
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
gravitate to your animal

263
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
like sexuality and bags.

264
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
It's already like, the argument

265
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
here is not that niceness

266
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
is bad. It's just that it is not

267
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
a substitute for a real personality.

268
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
It is not a personality type in

269
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
itself. That's the thing though. It's just a set of

270
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
like, you know,

271
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
give people the benefit of the doubt.

272
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Don't die on

273
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
every single hill of every argument

274
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
you have. It's just

275
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
like a code of

276
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
don't be a dick and it's not a personality

277
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
that you can astrive yourself

278
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
and if you try to, you will finish last

279
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
because that's not real.

280
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
I have a personal

281
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,900
history. I definitely have personal issues

282
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
when it comes to niceness because my

283
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
childhood, I

284
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
did the whole being a nice guy thing

285
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
and it did not work out and I deeply

286
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,900
resent the people who kind of

287
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
implied that that was the right way to go.

288
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900
If I instead

289
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,900
be a nice boy, you'll get what you want.

290
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Not true.

291
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
The idea that

292
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
the word nice has been boiled down to

293
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
just specifically being a nice guy

294
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
is very narrow

295
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
but that's fine.

296
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
In relation to nice guys

297
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
I completely agree that

298
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,900
you shouldn't just be like a nice guy

299
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,900
because that

300
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
just makes you a weirdo asshole

301
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
but I really don't

302
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
like why is being nice

303
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
bad exactly?

304
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Why don't you want to be nice and just

305
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
live your life as a nice person

306
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
and be a good nice person?

307
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
On a conceptual level

308
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
there is nothing wrong with being nice.

309
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
If you've got two guys

310
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
let's say you've got like

311
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
when I think of nice guys, I think of this

312
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
I heard a long time ago

313
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
and it was like if you've got

314
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
a girl who's attracted to two guys

315
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
and one is like a normal guy

316
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
first of all let me say slut

317
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
but continue.

318
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Exactly.

319
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Who is a woman going to be attracted to?

320
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
A really attractive guy

321
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
who is also nice

322
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
but this guy is like

323
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
rich, he's really fun to be around

324
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
he's exciting but then he's also really nice

325
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
and he treats her well

326
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,900
obviously that's literally the dream guy

327
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
but as opposed to

328
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
some average looking guy

329
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,900
but he's not quote unquote a nice guy

330
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
he's a little more rebellious.

331
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,900
The girl is going to be interested

332
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
in the guy who's got everything going on

333
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
and is also nice

334
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
because niceness in itself is not actually

335
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
a bad thing but

336
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
what it comes down to for me

337
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
and I know this is a personal thing

338
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
it's that when you're nice as your identity

339
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
I know that's what you were talking about before

340
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
and I think we're all in agreement on this

341
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
but it's when you use niceness as your

342
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,900
attractive trait and it's like I'm nice

343
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,900
therefore I deserve good things to happen

344
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
and as I was told to believe

345
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,900
earlier in my life

346
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
so I have big negative implications with it

347
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
I feel like there's layers

348
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
of being nice

349
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
where it's like nice as like a vague

350
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
like you know say please and thank you

351
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
but then there's like niceness in terms of

352
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
like you are

353
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
unconfrontational

354
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,900
you don't take a stance on any issue

355
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
all I'm saying is

356
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
if you don't hit

357
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
if you don't hit your significant other

358
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
she'll never know how good it is

359
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
when you're not hitting her

360
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
that's what I'm saying

361
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
this is retardation

362
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
all these blanket statements

363
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
about like what will

364
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,900
a girl like just a girl

365
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
that you've whipped up in your mind

366
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
what will she pick

367
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
guys don't need to be nice to each other

368
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,900
niceness is useless between men

369
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
it doesn't matter

370
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
you know exactly what it means

371
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
it means that we care about what each other can offer

372
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
on like a

373
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,900
yeah that's you Nate

374
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I want to be nice to people

375
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
it's just a basic human instinct

376
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
to be nice to the people that you care about

377
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
this is where it comes down to

378
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
you being Nate

379
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
this is a Nate being Nate thing

380
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
if you're talking about like

381
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Nate we were being nice to each other in the chat yesterday

382
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
and it was nice

383
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
did you notice Ben

384
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
you may not have noticed

385
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
I did not comment

386
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
yesterday we were all

387
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
I was saying like guys

388
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
okay I won't talk about what it was

389
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
but I specifically did not comment

390
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
in a positive way

391
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
and I almost commented like yeah I'm not gonna be a pussy

392
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
and like join this conversation

393
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,900
you were in there being

394
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
all sad about some shit

395
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
and then the rest of us were like

396
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
yeah we are also kinda sad about the shit

397
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
and the rest of us were like oh no it's fine

398
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
we're all gonna be fine

399
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
thank god that Nate

400
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
I'm not stooped to the level of being like

401
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
yeah you guys are okay too

402
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
yeah I maintained my frame

403
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
and that's why I smash the puss

404
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
on the daily

405
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
the problem here is just

406
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
it's a different point of perspective

407
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
it's a different world view

408
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
you see like us

409
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
well I'll speak for myself

410
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
I value

411
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
being nice I value human connection

412
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
I value

413
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
living my life to its fullest

414
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
I value

415
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
classical ideals

416
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
and I like when the world

417
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
is happy I like

418
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
when I am happy I like

419
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
good things and that's why I like being nice

420
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
because it is an unequivocal

421
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
good thing in almost

422
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
every context whatsoever

423
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
we can get to unconditional love I agree

424
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
that's not a Morley's town thing to do

425
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
but that's a 0.1%

426
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
there's not a whole lot

427
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
of real unconditional love

428
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
and most of it is just

429
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
people being nice to one of the people having

430
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
good emotional

431
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
connections with one another

432
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
and there's literally no reason to say that it's bad

433
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,900
there's literally no reason other

434
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
than to just sound sanctimonious

435
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
and be pretentious and put on air

436
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
and make yourself sound like you're

437
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
on your moille hygrim there's no reason

438
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
well that's what you're saying coming from your perspective

439
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
but that's not a full picture

440
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
like some people are emotionally manipulated by other people

441
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
and it is their nicest that allows them

442
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
to bend over to like

443
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
do what they're told and it's not always a good thing

444
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
you gotta watch out for that

445
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
the majority of people are just nice to one another

446
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
and they're not being manipulated or tricked

447
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
to do their unbelievable

448
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
stupidity of how the door

449
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
opened for such strangers

450
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
almost everyone is being manipulated

451
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
by someone in their life

452
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
in a deep way

453
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
that's what I would argue

454
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
you know someone? I didn't hear the first part of that

455
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
well I'm just yeah I think most

456
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
people are like everyone who's dating someone

457
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
is to some degree being manipulated by

458
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
that person it's just how it works

459
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
it doesn't mean it's negative or even a bad thing

460
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
but they are using

461
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
their emotions and the expectation

462
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
that the other person should be nice to them

463
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
these are like control mechanisms

464
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
we use over each other via society

465
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
and niceness is us

466
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
I'm not even saying it's insidious

467
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I'm just saying that's just how people work

468
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
we're already seeing that this is sort of like

469
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Nate wants to talk about Starfleet

470
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
we've got to stop this

471
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
we've got to crush it right now

472
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
I would like to talk about how empathy is good

473
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
and there's not enough of it

474
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
we've already done empathy

475
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
I totally agree that it's good though

476
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
what was our conclusion?

477
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
did we like empathy? did we not like it?

478
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
I'm still on the fence personally

479
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,900
let me just say that I actually think empathy is great

480
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
but I think that's totally different from niceness

481
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
I think they are too distinct

482
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,900
I think niceness is vague enough that it includes lots of things

483
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
and you are like

484
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
focusing on the sexual

485
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
the sexual courting aspect

486
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
of a nice guy

487
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
that is all you're thinking about

488
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
what can I say my dude

489
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
I always got pussy on the mind

490
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
yeah

491
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
we're sending you to jail now

492
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
the very first PC prisoner

493
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
right now

494
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
yes lock me up

495
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
it's gonna be dangerous for these ladies on the street

496
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
I am

497
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,900
the PC ratess

498
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
I think we can do an entire episode

499
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
on relationships but just related to

500
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
being nice real quick here

501
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
I am of the opinion that

502
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
you can just be a normal person

503
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
and like Nate said I completely agree

504
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
just live your life and eventually

505
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
people will come to you

506
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,900
that have similar interests

507
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
and are of similar mindsets

508
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
that just makes sense

509
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
this has nothing to do with that

510
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,900
well obviously

511
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
if you are a nice person

512
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
you will attract other nice people

513
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,900
or people are trying to manipulate you

514
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm just saying

515
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
this whole courting

516
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
via measuring

517
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
does girls

518
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
do all girls want this nice person

519
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
or do all girls want someone

520
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
who is vaguely edgier

521
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
do all girls want someone who is rich and powerful

522
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
I just think it's unhelpful

523
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
it's better

524
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
I think if someone says that

525
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
they don't want that they're lying

526
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
you can probably draw some like

527
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
broad generalities

528
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
in what like certain demographics

529
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
want

530
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
I agree

531
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
I don't think it's very helpful

532
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
especially people who are listening to this podcast

533
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
who are like abnormal

534
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
no no no the people who listen to this podcast

535
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
are like teenage boys

536
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
and they need to hear this shit

537
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,900
we have adults

538
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
there are adults in the audience

539
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
I pray

540
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
I know they're there

541
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
I don't think that they should be listening to us

542
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
I don't think we're good influences

543
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
I disagree completely

544
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm the best influence

545
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
I basically

546
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
when I come out here

547
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
I'm speaking to like young Nate

548
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
I'm trying to fix the mistakes

549
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
that young Nate made in anybody who's listening

550
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
and I want them to be aware of the lessons I've learned

551
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
well Nate if you didn't make those mistakes

552
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
you wouldn't have become Nate

553
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
but that's

554
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
not necessarily a good thing

555
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
like if I could be the same

556
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
did we agree on that

557
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I mean I'm a deeply broken individual

558
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
and I'm totally aware of that

559
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
and if I could make someone have the same

560
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
guerrilla mindset that I have now

561
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
hang on hang on if you're a totally broken individual

562
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
how do we know what you're saying is a good advice

563
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
because it is intellectually

564
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
and logically sound

565
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
that's why

566
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
I don't know

567
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
this is a paradox

568
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
no it is not a paradox

569
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,900
just literally take my arguments and analyze them for flaws

570
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
if you don't find any then they're fine

571
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,900
if there are flaws then they are not fine

572
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
please do this to all my arguments all the time

573
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
and I will do it to everyone else's

574
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I think most of the time

575
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
when you present an argument before the court here

576
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
most of the time

577
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
it's not exactly that there is

578
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
like a plot hole

579
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
it's just that

580
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
the point of view you're coming from

581
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
and your conclusions

582
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
most of the time I don't think

583
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
are anything that should be allowed

584
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
in society

585
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
well fuck you

586
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
it's your base assumptions

587
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
I think

588
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
that are a sticking point sometimes

589
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
not the actual logical argument

590
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
itself

591
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
the main difference that we're coming at here is

592
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
when I think about being nice

593
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
we focus in on like the relationship

594
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
aspects of niceness

595
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
whereas you guys are looking at it from a slightly broader context

596
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
we are looking at it from the cowards perspective

597
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
that's right

598
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
the blue-pilled cuck perspective

599
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
that's right

600
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
I think if we were being nice right now

601
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
we would be agreeing with you and be saying

602
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
exactly

603
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
I don't want you to be nice

604
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
maybe

605
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
obviously niceness

606
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
niceness 24-7 is not good

607
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
but any emotion

608
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
or any state of mind 100% 24-7

609
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,900
is not a good idea

610
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
over intelligence and anything is not a good idea

611
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
but for the basic

612
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
majority of all human interaction

613
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
niceness is the way to go

614
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
the one distinction I would make

615
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
there is that I would put niceness

616
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
below like being true to yourself

617
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,900
always

618
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
it's like always a lower priority

619
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
but I would give

620
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
what a grill name

621
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
it's examples of

622
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
when you can be nice and what you would do

623
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
and why

624
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
you're walking through a door

625
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,900
the person behind you

626
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
you know there's someone behind you

627
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
are you going to hold the door open

628
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
or are you going to hope that they push

629
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
forward and do it themselves

630
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
I'll tell you what I do

631
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
I analyze how far behind me the person is

632
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
and determine if it is worth my time

633
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
to hold the door open for them

634
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
but I'll tell you this

635
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
so you're being emotionally manipulated

636
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
to an insane stream of people behind you

637
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
to waste your time

638
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
I am emotionally manipulating them

639
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
by giving them a positive

640
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
conditioning view of me

641
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
by doing something nice for them

642
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
knowing that it could pay off in the future

643
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
I'm making an investment here

644
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
that's what I'm doing

645
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
I don't disagree that being nice to people

646
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
that you want them to like you

647
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
is like a thing that people do

648
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
the only thing is that I'm more blackpilled

649
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
that's why we do the things we do

650
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
I know that we're all just manipulating each other all the time

651
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,900
but you just call it being nice

652
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
I would say it's emotional manipulation

653
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,900
that's the only difference here

654
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
I don't disagree

655
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
I don't think about it as manipulation

656
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,900
in like a day to day

657
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
maybe I'll do a good thing

658
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
I'll do a nice thing to this person

659
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,900
maybe it'll be good for them

660
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
maybe it'll make somebody laugh today

661
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
maybe I'll increase

662
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
the happiness of the world

663
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
by like a certain amount

664
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
if we take the sort of vague

665
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
definition of manipulation

666
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
to just be like manipulation

667
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
the sense that you change things

668
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
to make certain outcomes appear

669
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
then literally every single action

670
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,900
that any human takes is manipulation

671
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,900
but I think there is an obvious social

672
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
what's the word

673
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
definition of the word manipulation

674
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
to be something

675
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
where you are intentionally tricking someone

676
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
to do something

677
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,900
that's kind of how I think about it

678
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
as I go about my life

679
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
so you think even in the situations

680
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
where you could just say

681
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
manipulation in the sense that

682
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
I'm changing words

683
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
I'm changing

684
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
ideas in my mind

685
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
to be words that people will like

686
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
a form of tricking and not just manipulation

687
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
since I'm changing

688
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
in a way, yes

689
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
the fact that you, Munchie, don't go out

690
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
and act as crazy as you do

691
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
when you're out in public

692
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,900
I would argue is like the same thing

693
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
as me like choosing to hold up

694
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,900
in doors for people who are nearby

695
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,900
because like you don't want the societal ramifications

696
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,900
the thing about it

697
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,900
all is that words are

698
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
terrible, I want to do a whole podcast

699
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
about language because

700
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
fuck language it sucks, it doesn't work

701
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
nobody uses it right

702
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
but like the fact that Nate is taking the word manipulation

703
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
and is applying it to all these

704
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
things and saying yes this is manipulation

705
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
when in my mind and the minds of most people

706
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
manipulation is a

707
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
by definition a negative

708
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
thing that you do not want to be doing

709
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
if you say I manipulate people

710
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,900
that gives like this connotation

711
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
of like oh here's a bad person

712
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
he thinks he's literally evil

713
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
and he likes it

714
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
that's the feeling the word manipulation gets

715
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
even if it technically doesn't mean that

716
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,900
it's just

717
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,900
language sucks and this is why

718
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,900
I like to be edgy, okay but listen

719
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
I have prepared a statement

720
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
of exactly how I am in real life

721
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
alright here's my statement

722
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
I'm on the PCP

723
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
my name is Nate Bestman

724
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
I'm 27 years old

725
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
I believe in taking care of myself

726
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
eat a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine

727
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
in the morning

728
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,900
I record the procrastinator's podcast

729
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
and if I have time

730
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
I record a bonus episode

731
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,900
I can do almost two now

732
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
after I finish recording the

733
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
podcast

734
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
blah blah blah blah I do all the stuff

735
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
I go to my workout I do a 3x3 blah blah blah

736
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
who cares okay here's the end

737
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
there is an idea of a best guy ever

738
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
some kind of abstraction

739
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
but there is no real Nate

740
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
only an entity something illusory

741
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
and though I can hide my cold gaze

742
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours

743
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
and maybe you can even sense

744
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
our lifestyles are probably comparable

745
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900
I simply am not

746
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
there

747
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
I fucking love that movie

748
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
I watched it again like two days ago

749
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
American Psycho is the greatest movie

750
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
I literally idolized Patrick Babin

751
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,900
he is my hero in every aspect

752
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
I don't know

753
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
I don't agree because I feel manipulated by you right now

754
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
well that is an emotional response

755
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
and I would urge you to crush those feelings

756
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
I feel really manipulated

757
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
by your speech there to laugh

758
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
you literally are

759
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
you literally have been manipulated

760
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
that's right that's exactly right

761
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
I'm being manipulated by everyone around me

762
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
that's how it is

763
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
look I'm sorry that

764
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I phrase things differently than most people

765
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,900
but that is how it is

766
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
that is how it is in real life

767
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
okay okay

768
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
I can understand using the word manipulation

769
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
I can get behind just like you know

770
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
it being a word meaning change

771
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
but how is it deceit

772
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
how are you deceiving me

773
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
well I guess the only way

774
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
to argue that is deceit is to not do it

775
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
because like it was just

776
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
something that you wanted to do

777
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,900
but to do it specifically to achieve an intended outcome

778
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
I guess is the difference there

779
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
let me look up what the word deceit means

780
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
but even that's like not bad

781
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
there must be some lying here

782
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
I don't even think there's a distinction because like

783
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
why is it morally better to do stuff just because you want to

784
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
as opposed to achieve a certain outcome

785
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
there is no moral distinction there in my mind

786
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
I don't think so either

787
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
that's not what I'm saying

788
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
okay deceit

789
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,900
it's actually a practice of deceiving some

790
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
okay this uses the word deceiving hold on

791
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,900
well that's a fucked up definition

792
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
fucking

793
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
I continue talking while I find this

794
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
well you know what I honestly don't care about any of this

795
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
I wanted to get my American psycho joke in and I did it

796
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
so we can

797
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
I'm just saying that

798
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
doing things because you want to

799
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
in like and

800
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
doing something that you want to

801
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,900
that is not against laws

802
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
or against social convention

803
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,900
no reason to frame it as a trick

804
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
or like you are doing

805
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,900
something wrong

806
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
like like like deceiving people

807
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
okay yeah the implication

808
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
is that it's like

809
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
it's like abnormal and like not human

810
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
it's the thing humans would not do otherwise

811
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
I have a

812
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,900
I have a thought about this what if

813
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
you know

814
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
that like I don't know tell let's say telling

815
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
jokes like let's say you know

816
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
that like going out in public and telling jokes

817
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,900
gets a good reaction and people like it

818
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
you are not naturally

819
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
inclined to tell jokes

820
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
but you learn that like oh people

821
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
really like it when I tell jokes so I'm going to go out

822
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
to a party I'm going to tell jokes be the life of the party

823
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
everyone really likes it

824
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
is that is that deceitful

825
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
for you to go out and do that

826
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
because you know that it's

827
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
what people want even if it's not like what you were

828
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
quote unquote naturally inclined to do

829
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
an excellent question Ben

830
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
and it reminds me of the exact

831
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
same thing can be applied to like

832
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
I mean when people hear about like for example

833
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,900
pickup artists for just people

834
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
who go out and really try

835
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
to like meet women and like entertain them

836
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
and completely consensually like

837
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
get them to sleep with them by being fun

838
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
and entertaining yeah people have a reaction

839
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
to that like something bad is happening

840
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
there yeah but literally

841
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
what is the issue and it's exactly what you just said

842
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
like the whole that making people laugh to make people like

843
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
you it is the exact same thing

844
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
and I would argue that there is no

845
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
like I don't know why anyone would even say

846
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
that there's a problem with such a thing

847
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
I would argue that those people are better

848
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
than the people who are naturally inclined

849
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,900
I think it would be a little fucked up

850
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
I don't know

851
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I mean this person who's

852
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
going out and telling jokes

853
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,900
I mean are they tricking you

854
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
like is by acting a certain way

855
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
that they have like made themselves act

856
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
because they know people like it is that a trick

857
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
because it's not like because they didn't use

858
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,900
to do that or because they didn't

859
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
because they're only doing it to get

860
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,900
a specific outcome

861
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,900
what is not a trick

862
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
is there anything in the world that is not a trick

863
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
the reason we got

864
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,900
onto this like line of thinking is that we were

865
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,900
trying to determine if being nice

866
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
is a bad thing or not and if

867
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
this all if all of this stuff that we're doing

868
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
is like manipulating and deceiving

869
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
but it's also totally normal and everyone

870
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,900
does it is not bad

871
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,900
what are we talking about

872
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
we're just kind of

873
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,900
why is nice is bad

874
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
nice is bad because it's what cucks do

875
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
that's why that's why just don't get cuck

876
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
look at this guy saying the cuck

877
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
well don't people

878
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,900
don't people like nice people

879
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
they like to use them

880
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
this is off topic

881
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
this is off topic but going slightly back to

882
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,900
pick up artists I completely agree with you Nate

883
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
like the way you've described pick up artists

884
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
it is indeed like who could fault that

885
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
just people being nice

886
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,900
and consensually having sex with women

887
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
or you know men whatever

888
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
like there's any such thing

889
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
I feel like

890
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,900
what's the

891
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,900
I feel like pick up artists go

892
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
have the same problem that I guess

893
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,900
this is kind of not related

894
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,900
but like feminists have where it's like

895
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,900
sure like the core ideal of like

896
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,900
I want women to be equal

897
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
sure who can agree with that but in

898
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
practice who can agree with that not

899
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
fuck yeah

900
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
that's true don't take that out

901
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
amplify that

902
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
do

903
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
but it's just like sure

904
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
these ideals if you want to define those groups of that

905
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
like who like that's just a good

906
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
thing people want that

907
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
but in practice a lot of people

908
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
that's not all people think about

909
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
when they hear the term pick up artists or

910
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
feminists they think of all of the pick up

911
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
artists or feminists that they've seen who are not nice

912
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,900
people even pick up artists

913
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,900
that I rather like like there's this one guy

914
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
who calls himself Tyler Durden

915
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
or Tyler RSD after the guy from

916
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
fucking Fight Club like even

917
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
he well you know what honestly

918
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
it might not have actually been him so take his name out of it maybe

919
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
he's in a relay but I have heard some pick up guys

920
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
who like promote the stuff or like teach

921
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
it say like that it's okay to like

922
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
lie about like who you are

923
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
and like I get the argument there because

924
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
like you're just like ooh it's all fun like crazy

925
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
night out and you're just giving like a fun experience

926
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900
to people but that's always kind of rub me

927
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
the wrong way and I don't like

928
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
that stuff so again all that

929
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
stuff like you're absolutely right labels

930
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
are bad fuck the labels I'm just

931
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
I'm using it a shorthand which is unfortunate

932
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
because it will give these kind of you know connotations

933
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
I was having our say about this the other day

934
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
we're like like I

935
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
again it's all about labels and

936
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
when you say like you know

937
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
you just want to go out and have sex which is fine

938
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
not a bad thing that's fine

939
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
but there is obviously a pick up artist culture

940
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
and I don't I don't know that

941
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
culture like backhand I don't

942
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
really know what's going on I've seen

943
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
movies or pick up artists or like bad people and I know

944
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Nate who you know who's a bad person

945
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
it was a nice person no it's a nice person

946
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,900
so yeah you know I don't

947
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,900
really know what the fuck's going on I'm just saying that like I don't

948
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
think it's unreasonable that people have a semi

949
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
bad interpretation of pick up artists

950
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,900
people can have based on the fact of

951
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,900
what I know about the culture which is limited

952
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
I mean I mean there's there's good ones

953
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
and bad ones and you know

954
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
your your opinion of the whole thing is

955
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
going to be like which you've had experience

956
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,900
with I don't even consider

957
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
myself really relate to the community I just

958
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
I was there and learn

959
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
some stuff and then you know like

960
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,900
moved on with my life because I hate labels

961
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
anyway um but anyway

962
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
let's get the fuck out of here let's

963
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
let's get back to why

964
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
why nice is tell me

965
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,900
why niceness is good what's there to like

966
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,900
there's nothing people like it like if

967
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
okay here's an argument if people

968
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
think that you are nice

969
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
then they will like you more and

970
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
and they will probably seek

971
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,900
out your company more yes

972
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
and that's pretty great

973
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
universal some people like think I

974
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
he's just nice I want to fucking

975
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
freak

976
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
freak some people

977
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
like the streets

978
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,900
that's kind of me that's kind of me

979
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
yeah yeah I feel that

980
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,900
but like like it can be kind of boring

981
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
but it is just nice if you know

982
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,900
if you know that someone is

983
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
is cool but like in person

984
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,900
say there's like an internet person

985
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,900
and they're like wacky and edgy and cool

986
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
and stuff well here's one but in

987
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,900
person they're like it then

988
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,900
nice to hang out with and they're not like abrasive

989
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,900
and shouting at you all the time

990
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,900
I mean I'm not I'm not really trying to show this

991
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,900
the obvious is more complicated this but like Joseph

992
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Anderson making all his like millions of long

993
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,900
ass videos about video games

994
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
like they're all like just very similar like synopsis

995
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
and they go over shit and if he likes

996
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,900
or doesn't like it or whatever but then you got

997
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Matthew Matosis who they you know they say that

998
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,900
like Joseph Anderson is like Matthew Matosis

999
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
2.0 but then he's like bargain

1000
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Matthew Matosis well that's what I'm saying

1001
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,900
because he comes up with the Sonic Dreams

1002
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
collection video that's like what the fuck

1003
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
is this Jesus Christ yeah and like that's

1004
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
like the coolest video ever that's got so

1005
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
much more personality and it's like you know

1006
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
who this guy is because he's playing this

1007
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
kind of game I think about

1008
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
I think about Joseph Anderson Matthew Matosis

1009
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
all the time and how and how obsessed

1010
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
and how obsessed maybe

1011
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
yeah it's weird it's weird how much I think

1012
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
about it like how I'll take

1013
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
a Joseph Anderson video and I'll be like

1014
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,900
okay well this kid this is slaked my lust

1015
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,900
for the time being but but like

1016
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
it doesn't it doesn't give me that deep

1017
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
soul satisfaction that Matthew

1018
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Matosis stuff

1019
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
you need your fix you just need your fix

1020
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
really long video game analysis

1021
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
they are good

1022
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
where does where does Noah

1023
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Caldwell lie on this?

1024
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
Noah Caldwell is like

1025
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,900
God it's like

1026
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
where was the angry Leo Game Nerd

1027
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Noah Caldwell he's like

1028
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
is he worse?

1029
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
it's like if you want a version of Matthew Matosis

1030
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
or Joseph Anderson who doesn't

1031
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
make any sense

1032
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
okay

1033
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
Noah will just he'll just go off about like

1034
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
I don't know I actually listen to like his travel blogs

1035
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
the other day I listened for like four hours

1036
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,900
just him talking about like driving up the west coast

1037
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,900
I was like uh yeah

1038
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,900
is Noah Caldwell Gervais a nice guy?

1039
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
is he a nice person? Absolutely

1040
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
I mean I can tell he looks

1041
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,900
he looks like he's uh on the

1042
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
soylent diet

1043
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
I got no hatred for the guy

1044
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
he seems fine he's a big boy

1045
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,900
he's a large man he could crush me

1046
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm thinking of like in terms of at a party

1047
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,900
if someone you know you're just talking to people

1048
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
and somebody is just sort of like

1049
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
they're kind of boring but they're

1050
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,900
polite I think when you think

1051
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,900
of like the person who was not abrasive

1052
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,900
but was also boring you think of them as

1053
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
the nice person and you forget about them

1054
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
but if somebody is like

1055
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
they're really interesting and they're also polite

1056
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
you think oh that guy's a great guy

1057
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,900
it's just a different word people use

1058
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,900
they say great instead of nice even though

1059
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
the level of politeness the level of like

1060
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
um what do you call it

1061
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,900
manners or something like

1062
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
there's the same amount of stuff it's really just

1063
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,900
uh like

1064
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
added on to what sort of person they are

1065
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
and how cool they are if they're you know

1066
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,900
a polite person who is cool

1067
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,900
they're great and if they're a polite person

1068
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
who is not cool they're nice

1069
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
I have an anecdote that I would like to say

1070
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
from my real life

1071
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,900
where okay okay as I'm sure

1072
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
even the audience knows I hang around

1073
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
mostly freaks and geeks and assholes

1074
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
I'm in the PCP

1075
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,900
I hang around mostly

1076
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
who are her sardonic or sarcastic

1077
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
and who are you know vaguely edgy

1078
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
and it's great that's the kind of

1079
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
people who I want to be around I like

1080
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
uh biting comedy

1081
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
I like biting people I like

1082
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
to consume flash

1083
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900
yeah exactly

1084
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
yeah right

1085
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
feed me chocolate yummy

1086
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
um but there's this one person

1087
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
who I know in real life who is the exact opposite

1088
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
of this he's just a nice

1089
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
wholesome kid

1090
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
and I don't think

1091
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,900
he's my best friend I don't think

1092
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
like like we like

1093
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
we uh we're just we're just sort of

1094
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
uh good friends

1095
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,900
and I'll go to him sometimes and

1096
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
he'll be talking about how he likes like you know

1097
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
the newest Marvel movie and you know

1098
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,900
all that kind of shit

1099
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,900
I'll be non-long like yeah sure

1100
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,900
it's just a lot of saccharine stuff

1101
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900
but it's nice he is a nice person

1102
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900

uh the biting uh

1106
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
sarcasm and irony and

1107
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,900
uh insincerity of uh

1108
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
my time here on the internet

1109
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
so it's nice to have people in your life

1110
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,900
just genuine people you can just

1111
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
rely on to uh you know

bring some life back in your life

1113
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
are you talking about your Mewtwo?

1114
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
yes I'm talking about my Mewtwo

1115
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
thank you Hippo

1116
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,900
my Mewtwo

1117
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
from Pokemon Go, thank you

1118
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
I would like

1119
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
like I know that

1120
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,900
we in the PCP are like

1121
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
edgy and stuff but I feel like

1122
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
we are nice in the in the sense that we know

1123
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
each other well enough that we will not

1124
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,900
cross lines we will be like

1125
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
sarcastic but all of us can take that level

1126
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
of sarcasm and we all know how much

1127
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,900
you know everyone can take sure

1128
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
so like we know each other we will be like

1129
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
uh you know joking

1130
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,900
around like insulting each other

1131
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
and it's not like fake completely

1132
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
but it's like at a level that you know

1133
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
all of us can can understand

1134
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,900
that it's not really like a

1135
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
like a like a spiteful sort of like

1136
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
actual attack and

1137
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
and that's what I still feel

1138
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
of that as being nice

1139
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
because it's like it's just being friendly

1140
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
and chummy and it's like technically

1141
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
you put that the same words

1142
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
in a different in a different

1143
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
context it would be like horrible but like

1144
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
because we're okay with it it's

1145
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,900
nice and it's normal we talked about this a little bit

1146
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
in the friendship episode the the the one we did

1147
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,900
at Radcon and like

1148
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,900
I think this comes up sometimes

1149
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
and I again I do think we have a slightly

1150
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
different perspective on it even

1151
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
within our group whereas like I don't

1152
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
really see I think

1153
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
there's two things going on when you're like in a friendship

1154
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
you want to be generally pleasant because like

1155
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,900
you don't want to be you know overly

1156
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
rough on like your friends and like make them

1157
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,900
make like like their experience of hanging out with you

1158
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,900
like just generally negative obviously

1159
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
you don't want to do that but like at the same time

1160
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,900
you don't want to like like

1161
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,900
I feel like the people in your life

1162
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
who can really like challenge you

1163
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
that you will actually like listen to

1164
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
and like respect their opinions of for

1165
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
me it's mostly my friends

1166
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
like I expect my friends to be the ones

1167
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
to like because like the person you're dating

1168
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
like again not to be rude or

1169
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
anything it's just like when you're dating someone

1170
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
they've got an incentive to like not piss you off

1171
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,900
and like make sure everything's going smooth

1172
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,900
and I don't really trust their opinion on

1173
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
anything

1174
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,900
I don't know if they're inherent qualities

1175
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
and you seem to be like they are

1176
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,900
they are just part of the relationship

1177
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
I think they will

1178
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
exist inherently to various degrees

1179
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,900
I do think they are basically inherent

1180
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,900
maybe some people can squash them and make them really really tiny

1181
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
but there's always going to be

1182
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,900
an incentive to just like be nice

1183
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,900
to for example the person you're dating

1184
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,900
but that's in any relationship right

1185
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,900
yeah it's with friendships as well

1186
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,900
like we have incentive to not like ruin

1187
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,900
our friendships because

1188
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,900
then we wouldn't have any friends

1189
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,900
you're not wrong God knows I don't tell all the criticisms

1190
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,900
to you guys that I could

1191
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
like if we were like

1192
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
super critical at each other all the time

1193
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
we would all be econ and it would be

1194
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,900
even more

1195
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,900
I guess I would just argue that with friends

1196
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
I feel I find it's like a little easier

1197
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,900
to be more like roughly honest

1198
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,900
with like with them as opposed to like

1199
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,900
the person you're dating

1200
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,900
I don't think that's necessarily a reflection of all relationships

1201
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,900
well obviously it's not going to be

1202
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,900
literally all I'm talking about a general trend here

1203
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,900
but okay whatever doesn't matter

1204
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,900
for me personally

1205
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
I just want to say I don't know econ

1206
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,900
I just hear things I don't hate him

1207
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,900
shout out to econ

1208
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
I still haven't gone on my hot sauce

1209
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,900
which is fine

1210
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,900
who? okay moving on

1211
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
literally who

1212
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,900
I don't know I pretty much said

1213
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,900
all I wanted to say on this particular subject I think

1214
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,900
I think people get where I'm coming from

1215
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,900
like I come at this whole thing from the idea of like

1216
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,900
I see like being nice

1217
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
as like

1218
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,900
a boring trait

1219
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,900
that is like some it's

1220
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,900
being nice is nice once you're already

1221
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
like in a relationship and like you already

1222
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,900
know people but like niceness

1223
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,900
doesn't like grab attention it doesn't make you

1224
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,900
stand out it doesn't really help

1225
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,900
you achieve major steps

1226
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,900
forward in your life but I don't think it's

1227
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,900
sustaining but I don't think it hurts anything

1228
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,900
it's not a large positive factor

1229
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,900
but it is indeed a positive factor

1230
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
you enjoy

1231
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,900
well not you

1232
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,900
you but like you know the general populist

1233
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,900
would probably enjoy someone who is nice

1234
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
to someone who is not nice

1235
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
in most cases

1236
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,900
the real thing is like getting a balance between

1237
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,900
being nice and being real

1238
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,900
if somebody is nice all the time

1239
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,900
to the point where you can't tell when they're

1240
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
actually being sincere about their niceness

1241
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,900
well isn't that interesting

1242
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,900
you can be critical and still be nice

1243
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,900
and you are not nice

1244
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,900
well it's true but like say somebody is like

1245
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,900
saying oh my videos suck

1246
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
and then somebody goes up to them saying

1247
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
no they're not but in reality they actually

1248
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
it's the interesting thing you're setting a dichotomy between

1249
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
like honesty and niceness

1250
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,900
which is kind of I mean I guess there's just

1251
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
like raw realness

1252
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,900
like here's my one like

1253
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,900
black pill thing that I had

1254
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,900
in my brain

1255
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
is that um

1256
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,900
I almost forgot it

1257
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,900
oh I did forget it

1258
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,900
dark dark souls

1259
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,900
you went hollow

1260
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,900
is this podcast the dark souls of the bcp

1261
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,900
it is

1262
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,900
it really is

1263
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,900
I'll think of it

1264
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
to record and I'm sure to listen to

1265
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
yeah really

1266
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,900
oh yeah yeah I got it

1267
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,900
being nice sometimes is just

1268
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,900
cowardly because

1269
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
you want

1270
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,900
if somebody is upset

1271
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,900
or like they are like

1272
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,900
potentially going to be upset if you get too real

1273
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,900
with them and you are not nice to them

1274
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,900
either by

1275
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
not saying anything or being nice

1276
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,900
to sort of like placate them

1277
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
is cowardly because all you're doing

1278
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
is preventing yourself

1279
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
from being upset that they are upset

1280
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,900
that's right totally true

1281
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,900
I'm not proposing

1282
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,900
that you have to be nice 100%

1283
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,900
of the time I never have

1284
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,900
and I even

1285
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,900
there are a lot of cases where being nice is a completely terrible idea

1286
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,900
again to like placate your friends

1287
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,900
make them just feel that they are secure

1288
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,900
and bad things you know

1289
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,900
like if their videos suck you should probably tell them

1290
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,900
but there are different ways

1291
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,900
to go about that and I feel like this word nice just comes through

1292
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,900
you can say hey your

1293
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,900
views suck now lol

1294
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,900
wins rayman 2

1295
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,900
as I've heard

1296
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,900
every day

1297
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,900
your friend

1298
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,900
disgasher but great to deal with that dude

1299
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,900
you know munchie

1300
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,900
or you just be like hey I noticed your videos are like this lately

1301
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,900
can we please get some more

1302
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
magenta filters

1303
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,900
I think that really helped

1304
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,900
you know what I'm happy to concede munchie

1305
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,900
that I come into this thing

1306
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,900
extremely biased just

1307
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,900
against the word nice

1308
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,900
it's like it's my daemon

1309
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,900
it is my daemon that I grew up with

1310
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,900
and now I just despise it across the board

1311
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,900
but really the right way

1312
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,900
my daemon

1313
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,900
this is the same old english

1314
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,900
like amber spyglass

1315
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,900
yeah that's right

1316
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,900
my british daemon daemon

1317
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
that's what it is

1318
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,900
no daemons are weird

1319
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
only the

1320
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,900
suck

1321
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,900
your bus

1322
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,900
I just want to talk about my favorite works

1323
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,900
of young adult fiction guys

1324
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,900
Percy Jackson

1325
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,900
ok shut up

1326
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,900
what I was going to say was

1327
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,900
I am definitely wrong in that I am

1328
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,900
way too black and white

1329
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
take that clip right there

1330
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,900
delete that from the podcast

1331
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,900
I'm definitely way too

1332
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,900
personally biased and the correct way to go

1333
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,900
is exactly what you guys have been saying

1334
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,900
with like your more nuanced interpretation

1335
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
and like subjective and like

1336
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
case by case basis usage of being nice

1337
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
because it obviously makes sense a lot of the time

1338
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,900
and I just kind of hate it

1339
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,900
just in a biased emotional way

1340
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,900
which is wrong

1341
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,900
I'm definitely ready to give you some leeway here

1342
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,900
because it was really eye opening

1343
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,900
when we were talking about how like

1344
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,900
with the french episode like about love

1345
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,900
where definitions for

1346
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,900
words have to be very exact

1347
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,900
for you

1348
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,900
which I don't think is really wrong

1349
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,900
and a lot of words are really vague

1350
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,900
and that is a problem

1351
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,900
but I think that like you can usually

1352
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,900
ascertain the general definition

1353
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,900
of most things

1354
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,900
I can't wait to do the language episode

1355
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,900
because I utterly despise

1356
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,900
that fuzziness that exists inherently

1357
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,900
in the usage of these words

1358
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,900
I hate it so much

1359
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,900
I think it is probably the biggest problem

1360
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,900
that we are of the modern age

1361
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,900
but we'll talk about that later on

1362
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,900
I would like to do the episode

1363
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
that sounds nice

1364
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,900
nice is nice

1365
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,900
debunked, niceness debunked

1366
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,900
God, removed from real life

1367
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,900
never more shall be seen

1368
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,900
if you want to be a nice guy

1369
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,900
you can go pledge to our patreon

1370
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
yeah you don't need to be a nice guy

1371
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,900
you can be a cold calculating maniacal fiend

1372
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
to get those bonus episodes

1373
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,900
hear all the real black pill shit

1374
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,900
it's too hot for TV

1375
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,900
right now we're tricking you

1376
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,900
into doing the DCP

1377
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,900
that's what money is

1378
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,900
money is lie

1379
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,900
money is lie

1380
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,900
money is lie

1381
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,900
hashtag money is lie

1382
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,900
correct

1383
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
it's also the only objective good in this world

1384
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,900
manipulate

1385
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,900
manipulate

1386
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,900
that's my name

1387
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,900
you found it

1388
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,900
manipulate

1389
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,900
where's the L

1390
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
are we done?

1391
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,900
closing statements here

1392
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,900
we got a good question right

1393
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,900
of course I just mean done

1394
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
Ben what's your closing statement here

1395
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,900

well

1398
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
amber spyglass was definitely the best of the three

1399
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,900
you're not wrong

1400
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,900

1401
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,900

get into the patron lounge

1415
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,900
from twitter so we can get that out of the way

1416
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,900
we can wipe that shit off our shoe

1417
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,900
we can move on to the galaxy

1418
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,900
that is the questions bar

1419
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,900
here's a pretty good

1420
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,900
I don't know if I've ever read this one before

1421
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,900
there's a bunch of questions about radcon

1422
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,900
things like will you do radcon again

1423
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,900
radcon 4

1424
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,900
radcon 2 electric boogaloo the fourth one

1425
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,900
these cowards

1426
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
how dare they appreciate radcon

1427
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,900
who do they think they are

1428
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,900
they're trying to trick us into thinking

1429
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,900
that they like radcon

1430
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,900
what the fuck

1431
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,900
yeah how dare they

1432
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,900
impede

1433
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,900
impose their emotional

1434
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,900
likes and dislikes

1435
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,900
and let us know how they feel about the content

1436
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,900
that we have generated for them

1437
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,900
so as to guide our production

1438
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,900
of future content that is

1439
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,900
evil and that is core

1440
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,900
I wonder why people think

1441
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,900
this was the last one

1442
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,900
did anyone I didn't see that

1443
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
will there be another one

1444
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,900
why is that even a question

1445
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,900
maybe just because it took so long

1446
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,900
for this one to happen

1447
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,900
we did spend

1448
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,900
man it was like a whole year

1449
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,900
because radcon 1 happened and 3 or 4 months later

1450
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,900
radcon 2 happens

1451
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
it's weird to think about that now

1452
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,900
it is weird

1453
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,900
it's really just because we wanted to do it immediately

1454
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,900
and we started it

1455
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,900
the first one did not have a kickstarter

1456
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,900
the second one did

1457
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
put 2 kickstarters really close to each other

1458
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
it's because did you and Jesse just were doing

1459
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,900
their kickstarter and then that just got turned into

1460
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,900
radcon 2 so it was like a big

1461
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,900
we didn't plan that one it just kind of happened

1462
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,900
on its face

1463
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
but we are definitely going to work to make these happen

1464
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,900
certainly more often than they have

1465
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,900
I think the ideal

1466
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,900
audience don't take this as fact

1467
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,900
just the ideal thing that I think we all

1468
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,900
would like to go for is like every 6 months or so

1469
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,900
though that's probably unrealistic

1470
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,900
I think that's a good middle ground

1471
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,900
I'd sure like that if we could do that

1472
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,900
and hey maybe if radcon hq happens

1473
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,900
I mean pcphq happens

1474
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,900
that certainly changed things

1475
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,900
who knows how often we'd do it

1476
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,900
I like it to be a special thing

1477
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
it's radcon every day bro

1478
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,900
yeah

1479
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,900
hey but there's one other question

1480
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,900
I wanted to read on here

1481
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,900
this will be the actual real question

1482
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,900
from the peeps on the twitter

1483
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,900
at cultoftheyellow1 asks

1484
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,900
Nate if you had a behelit

1485
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,900
would you use that shit to sacrifice the other

1486
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,900
pcp members to transcend your humanity

1487
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,900
of course you would

1488
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,900
here's the real answer it would be

1489
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,900
morally bankrupt of me not to do it

1490
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,900
I have to do it

1491
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,900
because your lives are objectively less valuable

1492
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,900
than the good I do

1493
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
I don't blame you I would do the exact same thing

1494
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,900
in a heartbeat

1495
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
well thank you man

1496
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,900
the one problem

1497
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,900
it's a thing from berserk

1498
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,900
basically a guy uses it

1499
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,900
destroys his friends

1500
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,900
and gains ultimate power

1501
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
but see that's the problem right there

1502
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,900
the behelit chooses the things that you care about most

1503
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,900
in life and therefore the pcp is going to be

1504
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,900
fine you guys won't be hurt at all

1505
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,900
dab dab dab

1506
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,900
fucking destroy

1507
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,900
that's good for me

1508
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,900
are you saying that the behelit just wouldn't

1509
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,900
oh wait you don't even like it

1510
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,900
that's what I'm saying

1511
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,900
but Nate this means that the behelit

1512
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,900
will stop

1513
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,900
starfleet from ever happening

1514
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,900
nooo

1515
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,900
I don't know how

1516
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,900
I think the behelit would like make starfleet

1517
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
happen but kill like the problem is though

1518
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,900
I'm so blackpilled I don't care about nothing man

1519
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,900
I don't care about nothing who can even take

1520
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,900
only a true cynic can wield the behelit

1521
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,900
it would just take your sunglasses

1522
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,900
nooo

1523
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,900
you could never wear sunglasses you'd live forever

1524
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,900
but you could never wear sunglasses again

1525
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,900
that would be devastating and action giraffe would die

1526
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,900
no fuck

1527
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,900
the camino would be erased from existence

1528
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,900
if I had

1529
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,900
the ballet t.a

1530
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,900
I would wish for all the chocolate

1531
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,900
in the world

1532
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
I'm so hungry

1533
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,900

I like this new character munchy

1536
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,900
I'm so hungry

1537
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,900
I only need the yummiest

1538
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900

1544
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,900
questions from the patron lounge

1545
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,900
from the patron lounge

1546
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,900
Cicero do you guys think

1547
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,900
competition like like cap like

1548
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,900
proper noun competition is a good

1549
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,900
or bad thing

1550
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,900
lay does it help you improve faster

1551
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
is it handling your improvement and creativity

1552
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,900
competition is always good

1553
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,900
competition is great

1554
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,900
read bakuman

1555
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
well yeah it's not always good

1556
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,900
it's like very good

1557
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
in the worst case scenario

1558
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
competition that is like too steep

1559
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,900
can make you discouraged because you're like well I'm never

1560
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,900
gonna be as good as these guys

1561
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,900
yeah uneven competition

1562
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,900
is usually bad but like

1563
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,900
if you're in an even playing field

1564
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,900
well okay it depends on what he means

1565
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,900
like does it mean like literal like trophies

1566
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,900
like this is a professional sports competition

1567
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,900
or does he just mean like

1568
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,900
rivalrys between friends to see who can

1569
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,900
I mean it sounds like in the case of us

1570
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,900
he means like just for example like the

1571
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,900
quote-unquote rival between

1572
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,900
competition because like

1573
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,900
like capitalism depends on you know

1574
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,900
you know what kind of competition would really

1575
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
improve my life as if patreon had some

1576
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,900
fucking competition damn right what same with

1577
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,900
YouTube same with okay I was just thinking about

1578
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,900
this like Michelle has YouTube

1579
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,900
read and like how

1580
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,900
many millions of times is everyone said like

1581
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,900
God I wish I could like close my phone

1582
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
and still have YouTube play so I could like

1583
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,900
save the battery life and stuff like that

1584
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,900
function already exists and it's only

1585
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,900
for YouTube red people

1586
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,900
so like you so you have to pay money

1587
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,900
for it but so like the reason competition

1588
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,900
is good like we need a YouTube competitor so that

1589
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,900
there's another app that does the exact same thing as

1590
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
YouTube so that like they that other

1591
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,900
company can give away that service for free

1592
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,900
so that YouTube is pressured to make it

1593
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,900
available to everyone that is how we get better

1594
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,900
stuff through competition forcing

1595
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,900
like the market to evolve and like

1596
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,900
you know all these things get cheaper and more accessible

1597
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,900
and they have to innovate and stuff

1598
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
already yeah YouTube

1599
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
I mean definitely that would help

1600
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,900
YouTube get better quicker

1601
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,900
I'm sure that they really

1602
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,900
want to try and find ways to make

1603
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,900
this everything they do

1604
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,900
much cheaper to

1605
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,900
to do because I have how expensive it is

1606
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,900
to host video so like

1607
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,900
I don't think I'm gonna stop until they're actually

1608
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,900
making like big money and then they can just

1609
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,900
rest on their laurels I mean

1610
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,900
but if they had competition I mean

1611
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,900
it would be good definitely

1612
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
the specific kind of like feature stuff

1613
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,900
like everyone wants this YouTube red feature

1614
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
and I really think the reason why it's

1615
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,900
not available to the public that it's like gated

1616
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,900
behind stuff is because no one is

1617
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,900
offering that service at like a lower

1618
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,900
price or or even for free

1619
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,900
and like the reason that like smart

1620
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,900
phones are like now accessible is because

1621
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,900
like everybody started making smart phones and it

1622
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,900
has driven the price down so now it's like affordable

1623
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,900
for the average person and stuff

1624
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,900
otherwise you'd have like one if only one

1625
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,900
company like owned like smart phone

1626
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,900
technology like they could just

1627
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
you know price that should up crazy high

1628
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
however they wanted to and everyone would want it

1629
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
but it's cuz you know we've got the competition

1630
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,900
to one like fucking iPhones and the androids

1631
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,900
and stuff you already kind of got that with

1632
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,900
iPhones like well yeah

1633
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,900
just live one like

1634
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,900
if they're an iPhone they will never even

1635
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
think about getting an Android

1636
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,900
true true they will pay

1637
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
all the money because like

1638
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,900
yeah I mean it is a slightly different service

1639
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
like iPhones just like work automatically

1640
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
and they don't take the kind of like they kind of lock

1641
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,900
shit down so you can't fuck it up which decreases

1642
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,900
freedom for people who like want to mess with their

1643
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,900
phones and stuff but I mean whatever you

1644
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,900
get the idea but for competition like among

1645
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,900
us as like creators I think it's generally

I haven't thought about my YouTube in a

1667
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,900
while but I am like creeping up to

1668
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,900
10k I could probably hit 10k

1669
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,900
without that much trouble if I like put my

1670
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,900
mind to it

1671
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,900

1674
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,900
oh you know what the lecture is gonna

1675
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,900
yeah the lecture is gonna blow that shit out of the water

1676
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,900
now Ben will be above me

1677
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,900
but I have a couple of video things that I

1678
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,900
have kind of been meaning to do at some point

1679
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,900
and like I could

1680
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,900
I could just do those

1681
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,900
maybe after the lecture comes out and I could start getting

1682
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,900
more hits I'll like put out

1683
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,900
some more of that

1684
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,900

1685
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,900

I could forgive that

1721
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,900
it was just bad

1722
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,900
I could never forgive someone

1723
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,900
for something like

1724
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,900
something like um

1725
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,900
probably like

1726
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,900
telling people what I've done

1727
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,900
like like

1728
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,900
ruining my reputation or something

1729
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,900
yeah yeah yeah

1730
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,900

1731
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,900
at all

1732
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,900
that's pretty high

1733
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,900
that's pretty high uh just like

1734
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,900
me

1735
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,900
I

1736
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,900
that's a doing weed I could never forgive you

1737
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,900
for doing weed anyone

1738
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,900
I'm not too far off from that pal

1739
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,900
I'm not too far off from that

1740
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,900
in real life

1741
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,900
I believe you man if you do weed

1742
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,900
my perception of you will always be

1743
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,900
colored that is not a joke

1744
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,900
colored green and we know

1745
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,900
much too fond of the colors so

1746
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,900
you know um

1747
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,900
I'm trying to think I mean you know like

1748
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,900
I'd be very deeply upset

1749
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,900
possibly forever if someone like

1750
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,900
like fucked with

1751
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,900
my relationship in some way you know

1752
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,900
like fucked my girl like that would

1753
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,900
definitely upset me in a massive way

1754
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
um you know that'd be

1755
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,900
bad that'd be real bad and that's where

1756
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,900
my mind goes first because I'm a deeply insecure man

1757
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
about my my my sex life

1758
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
and that's why I'm obsessed with it and have

1759
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,900
deep rooted fears related to it all the time

1760
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,900
uh so yeah you know

1761
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,900
things relate to that yeah

1762
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,900
I mean I feel like

1763
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,900
that would be I feel like it would be

1764
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,900
something like that it's just I haven't had

1765
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,900
like one of those things

1766
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,900
happened to me yet like I've

1767
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,900
gotten mad at people and I've been like oh

1768
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,900
you know what I'll never forgive you but then

1769
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,900
I'm like it doesn't actually matter that much

1770
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,900
yeah that's really I think that's really what it is though

1771
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
like if I was dating someone and they really

1772
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,900
like cheated on me and like a deeply humiliating

1773
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,900
and fucked up way that would

1774
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,900
definitely be one of the worst things I think

1775
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,900
outside of like fucking like mutilating

1776
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,900
me locking me in a sex dungeon and like

1777
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,900
torturing me for the rest of my life like that'd be pretty bad

1778
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,900
well are you saying you don't want to be in a sex dungeon

1779
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,900
well let's say a non-sex dungeon

1780
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,900
I'm allowed to know sex

1781
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,900
now that's a nightmare

1782
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,900
it's like like

1783
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,900
prepare to be locked in a dungeon for the rest of your life

1784
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,900
and tortured a sex dungeon

1785
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,900
no no

1786
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,900
yeah great

1787
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,900
I feel like in a perfect world

1788
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,900
in a perfect world

1789
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,900
I would be able to forgive

1790
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,900
really anything

1791
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,900
I wouldn't like to forgive you

1792
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,900
because a lot of the time

1793
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,900
when you have like rage in you about a person

1794
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,900
all it does is like make your own life

1795
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,900
kind of annoying

1796
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,900
whenever you think about that person you go

1797
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,900
you twitch and you like

1798
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,900
and you squeeze your hand like Arthur

1799
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,900
I would rather

1800
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,900
just be able to just think about it

1801
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,900
fuck

1802
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,900
yeah I'm with you Gib

1803
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,900
I have a Buddhist saying about that

1804
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,900
it's like

1805
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,900
you're a foreign language class bin

1806
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,900
it's like

1807
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,900
no anger like holding on to anger

1808
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,900
and like hoping for revenge

1809
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,900
is like holding on to a hot coal

1810
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,900
hoping that you will throw it at your enemy

1811
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,900
you know

1812
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,900
yeah that is good

1813
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,900
but it hurts you in the meantime

1814
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,900
I've got another excellent quote

1815
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,900
fear leads to anger

1816
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,900
anger leads to hate

1817
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,900
hate leads to suffering

1818
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,900
get out of here Yoda from the prequels

1819
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,900
um

1820
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,900
I don't like the prequels

1821
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
they'll never forgive them

1822
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
well said

1823
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,900
here's something

1824
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,900
if you watch Star Wars

1825
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,900
do not try to be my friend

1826
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,900
it will only lead to you

1827
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,900
being six feet under the fucking ground

1828
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,900
I feel the same way

1829
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
Star Wars is not something

1830
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,900
that I want to invite into my life

1831
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,900
yeah agreed

1832
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,900
agreed

1833
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,900
here's the question I want to read

1834
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,900
I've been wanting to comment on this

1835
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,900
in some public way for a while now

1836
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,900
Jalen Harris asks

1837
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
who started the sunglasses meme

1838
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,900
Nate or Digi

1839
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,900
I'd be happy to hear your guys' opinions on this

1840
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,900
but we all know the little man named keg standard

1841
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,900
started a particular sunglasses meme

1842
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
long before any of this shit began

1843
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,900
and since the start

1844
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,900
since the start of best guy ever

1845
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,900
sunglasses have been a defining characteristic

1846
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,900
of the channel

1847
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,900
and I think that was before Digi ever started doing sunglasses things

1848
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,900
I wish Digi was here to comment

1849
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,900
I'd like to hear his opinion

1850
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,900
did you request that keg have the shutter shades

1851
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,900
or did I give him them

1852
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,900
I don't remember

1853
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,900
I think that might have been my

1854
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,900
I think I might have gone and been like hey what if he had some shutter shades

1855
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,900
I'm happy to give you credit

1856
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,900
for coming up with some shutter shades

1857
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,900
and

1858
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,900
things were never the same

1859
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,900
I really think that I came up with those

1860
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,900
I really think that I suggested those

1861
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,900
I was really into Kanye at the time

1862
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,900
and I specifically said like Kanye shades

1863
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,900
I'm not sure

1864
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,900
I could believe that maybe you suggested it

1865
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,900
but in either case

1866
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,900
especially in their modern

1867
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,900
incarnation of the PCP

1868
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,900
even if that's true though

1869
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,900
how far back does the Digi sunglasses meme go

1870
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,900
because best guy ever

1871
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,900
is immediately defined

1872
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,900
by the sunglasses of the guy

1873
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,900
that was right out of the gate

1874
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,900
and I would say that was significantly before Digi started his sunglasses thing

1875
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,900
I give myself full credit

1876
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,900
when did Digi start the sunglasses

1877
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,900
I don't even know

1878
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,900
you know what

1879
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,900
maybe Jesse

1880
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,900
because he wore sunglasses in Tony videos

1881
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,900
that's not a fine characteristic of Jesse

1882
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,900
okay

1883
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,900
you know what I hate

1884
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,900
you know what I hate the fact that so many of you guys

1885
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
wear sunglasses is that

1886
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,900
it means that I can never wear them

1887
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,900
because then I would be like oh you too

1888
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,900
you as well

1889
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,900
just a bunch of sunglasses dudes

1890
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,900
okay but I will say that currently

1891
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,900
I am the most consistent sunglasses guy

1892
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,900
it's like my thing

1893
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,900
it's like my thing now

1894
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,900
Digi's thing too he's always turned off the sunglasses

1895
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,900
Digi fucking stole it from me

1896
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,900
a race trader

1897
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,900
I'm inclined to

1898
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,900
don't you fucking say it

1899
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,900
I think you did say it

1900
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,900
I think you did do it first

1901
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,900
damn right

1902
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,900
yeah fuck it die

1903
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,900
there you go

1904
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,900
and it's over

1905
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,900
okay next question what do we got

1906
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,900
O2Miraseu

1907
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,900
what is the biggest missed opportunity at Radcon

1908
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,900
not recording the fucking

1909
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,900
clusterpunk fashion runway

1910
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,900
I spent 140 dollars

1911
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,900
on that shit

1912
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,900
you were talking about it before

1913
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,900
and the whole time and it just didn't happen

1914
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,900
is it a missed

1915
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,900
opportunity or is it like a fucked

1916
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,900
opportunity because we

1917
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,900
what do you mean

1918
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,900
we just had too much stuff booked

1919
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,900
we would have done it if we had the time

1920
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,900
it's not like we forgot about it

1921
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,900
real talk if we had schedule

1922
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,900
we got a ton done we deserve like no criticism

1923
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,900
for the amount of stuff that was produced at Radcon

1924
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,900
but if we had worked better

1925
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,900
we could have produced more stuff

1926
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,900
it was on the fucking schedule

1927
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,900
it was on the schedule

1928
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,900
we didn't fucking stick to the schedule for shit

1929
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,900
we tried

1930
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,900
I made it in the hopes we'd stick to it but we did not

1931
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,900
and you know like

1932
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,900
I mean I was there to make sure I got my shit done

1933
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,900
and I did you know it was

1934
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,900
same I got the stuff that I needed

1935
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,900
to get done the clusterpunk fashion runway

1936
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,900
was supposed to be like a PCP thing but I

1937
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,900
it would have been cool

1938
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,900
you know what

1939
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,900
put a fucking feather in that one

1940
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,900
and save it because we could do it again

1941
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,900
someday and you know what tbh

1942
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,900
like because digi didn't know about it

1943
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,900
like digi would have been the only person that could

1944
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,900
have rivaled me I mean that is true

1945
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,900
so like

1946
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,900
it was sort of a fledgling idea that needed

1947
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,900
a little bit more expanding and like

1948
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900
being like we're doing it now everyone signed up

1949
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,900
I gotta get svelte

1950
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,900
I gotta get svelte for next Radcon

1951
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,900
so I can not look like a fucking fat piece of shit

1952
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,900
on the clusterpunk fashion run

1953
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,900
oh Jackie just got me okay Nate

1954
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,900
you know about um you know my pink chucks

1955
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,900
that are like

1956
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,900
fucking faded shit and falling apart

1957
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,900
he got me some new ones they are there neon

1958
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,900
they are vibrant day glow pink chucks

1959
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,900
and they are they are coming

1960
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,900
on the on the fashion runway

1961
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,900
I want this I want everyone

1962
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,900
to like for radcon for everyone to bring

1963
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,900
their fucking a game and bring the most

1964
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,900
we'll see if you see I don't even know

1965
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,900
I had to prepare anything I guess I just didn't consider

1966
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,900
myself part of it

1967
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,900
you don't have to be yeah I know I know

1968
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,900
the only problem with me is that

1969
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,900
suitcase space

1970
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,900
like I just managed

1971
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,900
to get everything that I brought to radcon

1972
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,900
well you could bring a second suitcase

1973
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,900
and check it we could budget for it

1974
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,900
like full of stuff one outfit

1975
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,900
it's I don't know

1976
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,900
well would one outfit really take up that much space

1977
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,900
in your suitcase I mean I don't know

1978
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,900
I feel like these are solvable issues but

1979
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,900
we can worry about that later

1980
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,900
I have one

1981
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,900
this was one for their history books

1982
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,900
I am sad the one the only thing

1983
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,900
I am personally really sad didn't

1984
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,900
get made at radcon was I really wanted to do

1985
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
otaku workouts with digi

1986
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,900
I really wanted to do another workout video

1987
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,900
which we did not I didn't know that was on the

1988
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,900
docket like did you came up to me as like

1989
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,900
Nate I wanted to blah blah blah all this stuff that I don't care

1990
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
about but then he was like but otaku workouts

1991
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,900
I'm like yeah that sounds fun

1992
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,900
but we just did that time

1993
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,900
okay not a missed opportunity

1994
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,900
per se but kind of

1995
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,900
is that I do regret not

1996
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,900
being on art apologies

1997
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,900
which I am greatly looking

1998
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,900
forward to listening to

1999
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,900
I wanted to be on that well after I saw

2000
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,900
like the behind the scenes footage

2001
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,900
of digi and also

2002
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,900
like that behind the scenes

2003
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,900
like clip of him like filming you

2004
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
and Tom

2005
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,900
like drawing your respective comics

2006
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,900
just silently was really cool

2007
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,900
oh by the way I should have been there

2008
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,900
here's a little message to all the backers we have already

2009
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,900
amassed a ton

2010
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,900
a huge amount of backer content

2011
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,900
it's unreal it's fucking unbelievable

2012
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,900
we're talking like 20

2013
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,900
videos already exist and one of them

2014
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,900
was like 45 minutes

2015
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,900
gib and digi killed it with the amount of

2016
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,900
shit they made and there's more

2017
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
I won't go into it

2018
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,900
but we're not going to release it until more content

2019
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,900
is out because it's got spoilers

2020
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,900
I swear to god like 75%

2021
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,900
of the entire time at

2022
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,900
radcon like not having sleeping

2023
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,900
was recorded like there was a camera on

2024
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,900
somewhere in the house thanks to gib

2025
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,900
thanks to gib and digi for like fucking filming

2026
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,900
a bunch of shit there are two

2027
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,900
other ones one of me and digi

2028
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,900
were writing a skit for project

2029
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,900
awesomeness that was great

2030
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,900
and we just didn't have time to

2031
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,900
record it properly and

2032
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,900
and also this is not

2033
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,900
really a missed opportunity because it didn't

2034
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,900
fact happen but I'm kind of anxious

2035
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,900
of the result been

2036
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,900
the referee's cop killers me maker

2037
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,900
was great but the actual like we sports

2038
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,900
resort was really bad

2039
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,900
yeah um

2040
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,900
uh oh

2041
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,900
it's okay

2042
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,900
overall I liked it like I'm not

2043
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,900
well the game was bad but I don't think

2044
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,900
the the recording was bad

2045
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,900
I think the record

2046
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,900
I have an idea of how I want to fix it which will

2047
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,900
really fit in with referee's cop killers but I'll

2048
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,900
let you after the show so you don't

2049
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,900
okay okay word fucked up

2050
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,900
oh should we should we make it like a statement

2051
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,900
on whether the stuff will be available

2052
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,900
to people at some

2053
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,900
point oh yeah we don't

2054
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,900
have a plan for it but we plan on making it available

2055
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,900
some way to people afterward so we will

2056
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,900
get back to you if you didn't back radcon

2057
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,900
do not panic even though you should feel ashamed of yourself

2058
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,900
yeah but they're

2059
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,900
probably will be a way to get it so don't

2060
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,900
forget it'll be jacked the fuck

2061
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,900
up though it'll be twisted you will

2062
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,900
you will regret your decisions

2063
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,900
sphincter directly

2064
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,900
indeed indeed uh

2065
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,900
says what future technology you must excited for

2066
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,900
auto automatic cars

2067
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,900
bro self drive cars auto

2068
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,900
self erotic asphyxiation

2069
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,900
looking forward to that in a big way

2070
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,900
um self

2071
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,900
self

2072
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,900
fucking sex dolls

2073
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,900
so basically

2074
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,900
what is wrong with all of you

2075
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,900
with all the fucking freaks

2076
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,900
right now

2077
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,900
you know having a sex doll is great but it's such a

2078
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,900
time commitment but now you have a doll that will

2079
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,900
fuck itself so you don't have to

2080
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,900
I want aeroplanes

2081
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,900
to become like incredibly

2082
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,900
fuel efficient so that they're super cheap

2083
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,900
and I can fly all over the world

2084
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,900
yeah

2085
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,900
that's fairly likely to happen

2086
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,900
that's my new answer

2087
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,900
okay

2088
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,900
I didn't really care about living abroad at all

2089
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,900
until like I just thought about it for a second

2090
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,900
about how being in the EU

2091
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,900
I could just like live in

2092
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,900
like London or something like maybe not anymore

2093
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,900
but I could like live in

2094
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,900
like Paris or something

2095
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,900
and I could just like walk

2096
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,900
well not walk but I could just like go to Germany

2097
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,900
or I could just like go to Spain

2098
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,900
and then it's not gonna be very nice

2099
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,900
I would like to do that

2100
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,900
maybe not a radcon but just specifically

2101
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,900
a Gibbon Munchie Hangout

2102
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,900
I want to go to Europe someday

2103
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,900
that will happen I guarantee it

2104
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,900
we could pokemon go all over the world

2105
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,900
hey man radcon 4 London

2106
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,900
I'm just saying it would be pretty good

2107
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,900
yes it would be pretty good and also very expensive

2108
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,900
radcon 5 Japan

2109
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,900
and radcon 5 Japan I love this idea

2110
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,900
of doing the next one in London and the fifth one

2111
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,900
in Japan in Tokyo

2112
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,900
radcon Japan is the worst fucking idea I've ever

2113
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,900
no you don't know that

2114
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,900
you don't know shit how fucking sick would it be

2115
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,900
I don't think radcon Japan would work

2116
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,900
as a radcon I think it would work as a

2117
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,900
let's all go to Japan and be anime

2118
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,900
it would be so hard

2119
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,900
don't speak Japanese

2120
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,900
I have lived in Japan for months

2121
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,900
and it is a place that is designed

2122
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,900
that you don't need to know Japanese to survive

2123
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,900
I have been there I know the place

2124
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,900
most big cities you can ask for help

2125
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,900
and people will speak

2126
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,900
the reason it's kind of a weird idea

2127
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,900
is because radcon is about

2128
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,900
making content together

2129
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,900
rather than hanging out in a city

2130
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,900
well not every radcon has to be exactly the same

2131
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,900
as long as we pitch it with the honest

2132
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,900
this is what it's going to be

2133
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,900
we would probably call London and Japan

2134
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,900
different things than radcon then

2135
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,900
no because radcon implies

2136
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,900
like we're getting together to make a bunch of content

2137
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,900
and you'll see it soon

2138
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,900
but something like that would be

2139
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,900
we go to an expensive city and live in a hotel

2140
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,900
and then we have like a fun time

2141
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,900
and we could

2142
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,900
literally just get an Airbnb

2143
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,900
who cares it's fine

2144
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,900
why can't it be both

2145
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,900
well the reason it can't be both

2146
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,900
is really just

2147
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,900
there's no point going to such a place

2148
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,900
if we're going to stay in one place and record

2149
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,900
and not actually go out

2150
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,900
literally go out and do stuff for a day or two

2151
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,900
out of like the 10 days or whatever

2152
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,900
how expensive is it to live like

2153
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,900
just in Japan

2154
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,900
and it is fair

2155
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,900
do they have airbnbs in Japan

2156
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,900
I don't know but we could look into it

2157
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,900
alright there's no need to like fucking break

2158
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,900
the fucking thing down I'm just saying it be cool

2159
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,900
radcon 5 right now

2160
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,900
agree it would be cool

2161
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,900
do you agree alright

2162
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,900
thank you

2163
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,900
catch a farfetched

2164
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,900
there you go

2165
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,900
radcon 5 the quest for farfetched

2166
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,900
that's what it is

2167
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,900
that's the one

2168
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,900
we don't have to get them

2169
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,900
we have to transfer them

2170
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,900
radcon exclusively

2171
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,900
for pokemon go

2172
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,900
exclusively no other content available

2173
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,900
oh my god

2174
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,900
two more questions

2175
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,900
chip in the francs

2176
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
similar question

2177
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,900
what's a mundane everyday miracle

2178
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,900
that you noticed and recognized

2179
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,900
this is a really interesting one

2180
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,900
yeah magnets

2181
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,900
an everyday miracle

2182
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,900
I mean just being alive

2183
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,900
period

2184
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,900
okay

2185
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,900
what do you say is a miracle

2186
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,900
is that just like for us to interpret in any way we want

2187
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
I think so yeah

2188
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,900
I get hung up on the word miracle

2189
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,900
only because if people say that life is a miracle

2190
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,900
we can exactly trace back why life exists

2191
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,900
so what do we mean

2192
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,900
think about like Dr. Manhattan

2193
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,900
talking about how like

2194
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,900
a spectacularly unlikely event

2195
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,900
is a miracle

2196
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,900
by that definition being alive

2197
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,900
is definitely one

2198
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,900
I mean to me when I think

2199
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,900
miracle I think like

2200
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,900
not necessarily something that doesn't happen

2201
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,900
but something that I don't see a lot

2202
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,900
and it's just like really like oh yeah

2203
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,900
okay and for me

2204
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,900
that would be like a sunrise

2205
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,900
it's like Jesus walked

2206
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,900
on water but in Kirby I can just run

2207
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,900
across water so like there's an everyday miracle

2208
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,900
like I was just playing Kirby so

2209
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,900
there it is

2210
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,900
it's just an everyday miracle

2211
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,900
I think he's using the definition of miracle

2212
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,900
which is not really a miracle

2213
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,900
like the ICP version of miracle

2214
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,900
something that you really like

2215
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,900
when it happens

2216
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,900
there's like oh thank god

2217
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,900
the electricity works

2218
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,900
what a fucking miracle

2219
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,900
I think video games are an amazing

2220
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,900
everyday miracle that I absolutely love

2221
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,900
and I'm so thankful and the internet I guess

2222
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,900
but I'm gonna go with video games

2223
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,900
that's perfect because that's like

2224
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,900
god we evolved in the way

2225
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,900
that allows us humans to create

2226
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,900
video games like what a miracle

2227
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,900
I was gonna say

2228
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,900
when somebody that I know

2229
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,900
never followed me before

2230
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,900
just leaves a nice comment and says I'm subscribing

2231
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,900
that's a nice thing

2232
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,900
that doesn't happen very often but when it does

2233
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,900
it's like yeah I can do it

2234
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,900
because of this

2235
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,900
do you have an everyday miracle?

2236
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,900
um

2237
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,900
when someone goes to patreon.com

2238
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,900
slash fantasy

2239
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,900
I already said being alive

2240
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,900
yeah

2241
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,900
being dead

2242
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,900
the two sides of the same coin

2243
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,900
um

2244
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,900
the oculus rift

2245
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,900
the oculus rift

2246
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,900
the ability of the fact that I can enter cyberspace

2247
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,900
at um at any time

2248
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,900
yeah that's good

2249
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,900
the fact that you were able to

2250
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,900
successful kickstarter

2251
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,900
that's an opportunity

2252
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,900
the fact that the pcp exists

2253
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,900
and is real and I'm a part of it

2254
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,900
aww

2255
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,900
and then it makes things possible

2256
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,900
the fact that I could do this kickstarter

2257
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,900
which by the way the vapers books just

2258
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,900
arrived this morning

2259
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,900
ohhh yeah

2260
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,900
that's exciting

2261
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,900
and the oculus rift is the stretch goal

2262
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,900
and then I actually hit the stretch goal

2263
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,900
and then the radcon can happen

2264
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,900
and you know we get to do all this cool stuff

2265
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,900
the fact that we got the t-bap stretch goal

2266
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,900
in fucking radcon 3

2267
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,900
is an everyday miracle

2268
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,900
not even everyday

2269
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,900
that's like a

2270
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,900
shock

2271
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,900
that was a perfect segue into my segue

2272
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,900
you want to know what my everyday miracle is?

2273
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,900
segues

2274
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,900
here's a new question for you

2275
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,900
do you guys have a childhood dream that you've successfully fulfilled

2276
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,900
being in the pcp

2277
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,900
well being in the horseshoe crew

2278
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,900
really but

2279
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,900
well that's great

2280
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,900
you're still in your childhood

2281
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,900
so you're fulfilling that dream right now

2282
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,900
exactly

2283
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,900
excuse me yummies I'm such a little baby boy

2284
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,900
don't you want me to be big

2285
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,900
and strong

2286
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,900
I need my yummy chocolate

2287
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,900
I don't want you getting any bigger or stronger

2288
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,900
yeah that would be a danger to us all

2289
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,900
I guess if I get any bigger

2290
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,900
or any stronger

2291
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,900
it would be a serious threat to not

2292
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,900
it would be like

2293
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,900
in the animatrix when that guy

2294
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,900
literally became more physically strong

2295
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,900
and fast at running

2296
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,900
that was able to be handled by the matrix

2297
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,900
and he shattered out of it

2298
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,900
what the fuck

2299
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,900
sounds like my life

2300
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,900
that's literally it

2301
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,900
with your resting heartbeat clipping the microphone of real life

2302
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,900
every moment

2303
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,900
pretty good

2304
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,900
this was fine

2305
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,900
oh by the way I just want to say

2306
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,900
another missed opportunity at radcon 3

2307
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,900
doing the oculus rift

2308
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,900
yeah I brought it

2309
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,900
and I brought my graphics card

2310
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,900
and it didn't seem like

2311
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,900
it didn't seem like it was going to work

2312
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,900
we burned it out lighting at night too much

2313
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,900
Tom said that it might have worked on his laptop

2314
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,900
but we kind of ran out of time

2315
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,900
and didn't get to like give it a shot

2316
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,900
so that was a shame

2317
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,900
oh well next time

2318
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,900
actually in everyday miracles my computer didn't

2319
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,900
break it radcon

2320
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,900
it was really fucking

2321
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,900
I mean well I'm jealous because my computer

2322
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,900
did break it radcon

2323
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,900
and now my laptop keyboard doesn't work

2324
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,900
so it's all

2325
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,900
it's a fucking brick now

2326
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,900
shoutouts to my laptop who did basically everything

2327
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,900
your laptop killed it dude

2328
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,900
