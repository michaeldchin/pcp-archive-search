1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
It's extra credits, right?

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,080
It's that song, it's the beginning of extra credits.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,120
This is The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,000
Wasn't that just like a Mario song?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh yeah.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Wait, it's a remix.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a...

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
When I was...

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a...

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, I was thinking of, hmm, how does some other show start?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,560
Oh yeah, that one song.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Who are you?

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,560
I'm Ben Saint.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,560
The show has begun.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,560
I'm Digi and we have special guest, Gamer's Tavern with us.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Gamer's Tavern.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,560
Say what you like about pedophiles.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,560
At least they drive slowly through school zones.

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Oh my god.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Oh, that's fucking hilarious.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,560
That's a good one.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Yeah, that's great.

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,560
The first time I ever experienced being...

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
I think I've heard you say that.

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560
I think...

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,560
I was in this...

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
I was writing home...

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,560
This guy, a senior at my school who could drive.

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,560
When I was a junior, I think, lived in my neighborhood.

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
It was like, yo, I'll drive you home, dog.

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
And I was like, sick.

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
And he fucking...

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
When you say a senior, do you mean a senior citizen?

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
No, a student.

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
A student at my school who was a senior

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
and showed off how cool he was and had a car

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
but could not...

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Like, obviously too nervous to talk to any girls

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,560
except for this one who was secretly a girl

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
all along a sleeper agent.

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
But he wouldn't have known that at the time.

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
So he was driving me home,

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,560
listening to Kobe to Cambria,

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,560
trying to drive fast through a fucking school zone

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
and gets pulled over.

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
And we had to sit there for like half an hour.

48
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
And that's when I learned that when you get pulled over,

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,560
it takes fucking forever.

50
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Getting all your shit run up.

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I've experienced it many times myself

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,560
from speeding in the highway.

53
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,560
I think they make you wait on purpose.

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
I think so too.

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,560
I think they deliberately take their time to fuck with you.

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
I always drive like a couple of miles below the speed limit

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,560
because I'm terrified of being pulled over.

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Well, you will never get pulled over then.

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
So you won't have to waste half an hour

60
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,560
and owe the government a bunch of money like I do.

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,560
You can get pulled over for driving too slow.

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Well, two miles under is not too slow.

63
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Two miles under is not too slow.

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Two miles under is not too slow.

65
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
They'll think...

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Just like five miles over is not too fast.

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,560
That's true.

68
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm a leadfoot.

69
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I am prone to creeping up

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
in the speed to be...

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Honestly, it's probably a good thing that I don't drive

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,560
because I'm not very good at it.

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,560
I've gotten really good at driving,

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,560
but the better you get at driving,

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
the more insane your driving feels under observation.

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,560
As you get more comfortable with it,

77
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
so then you start to be like,

78
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
oh, well, I know I can do this.

79
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Then you're like, Jesus Christ, did I just do that?

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I'm not very good at it either, but I do it.

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
That sounds like hubris.

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
My mom drives like a psycho.

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
She's never been in an accident.

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
She's been driving for like 45 years,

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
and whenever I'm riding with her,

86
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
I'm just like, I mean, it feels wrong,

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
but it looks like a movie.

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
It looks like baby driver or something, you know?

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
My dad is a pretty good driver.

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
He does a thing.

91
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,560
He is pretty annoying because he really likes cars.

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
He's into them.

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,560
So he will flip the clutch

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,560
and rotate the shaft

95
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
and open all flaps and drag fins

96
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
and put the pedal to the metal

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
and go like...

98
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
And it's uncomfortable,

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
and everyone else in the car is uncomfortable.

100
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Why is this happening?

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,560
And my dad is just smugly satisfied.

102
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
I have a car that can do this.

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
It sucks.

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
You can only drive that fast

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
if you know what you're doing

106
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
and you're really good at it.

107
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
That's why I drive kind of slow.

108
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
He can parallel park like nobody I've ever been.

109
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I'm assuming this is not the van

110
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,560
that was later purchased by Nate for a dollar.

111
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
No, not so much.

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
That Nate still to this day drives

113
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,560
and has no air conditioning,

114
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
no music.

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
It's funny.

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
I forget.

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
The old gold Honda Odyssey.

118
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
It's a minivan.

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
That brings back so many memories.

120
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,560
That was the car of my childhood.

121
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
That was the car of Nate's adulthood.

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,560
What was this story about again?

123
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Well, it's just a Nate...

124
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,560
My parents had this gold minivan

125
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
and like sold it to my brother

126
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
when he moved or something.

127
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Or maybe gave it to him, I don't know.

128
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Well, he sold it to him for a dollar.

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Your dad sold it to Nate for one dollar.

130
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
That's right. He sold it for one dollar.

131
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Bullshit.

132
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Was it literally one dollar?

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
I don't know. It worked some kind of deal.

134
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Yes, for one dollar.

135
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Well, it's just like Nate didn't want to get it for free.

136
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
So he was like, okay, well, then give me a dollar.

137
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
So stupid.

138
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
That's what happens when you live your life

139
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
That does sound like I understand.

140
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I just always picture it as this moment in my mind

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,560
where he hands over the dollar

142
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
and they're both looking at each other

143
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
and that like, ah, you know, like anime,

144
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,560
like dramatic scene, you know, like big panel,

145
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,560
like half page spread both of them

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
as the dollar goes from one hand to the other.

147
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,560
I learned the word for that thing in anime

148
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
where like it frees frames

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
and it becomes like a painting.

150
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
It's called a harmony.

151
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I heard another word for it

152
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
that was named after like the guy who invented it,

153
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
but I don't remember what the name was.

154
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,560
His name is Shichiro Kobayashi.

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,560
No, it started with a U.

156
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I don't know, whatever.

157
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Maybe it was named after the director,

158
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Osamu Dazaki,

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,560
because he's like the director who was known for doing it.

160
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
I don't know, I saw a tweet.

161
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
I know Osamu,

162
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
but he's not the one that did 9-11.

163
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Oh my god.

164
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Please, please spare me.

165
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Brett.

166
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Gamers Tavern, you're a fucking cad.

167
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
You're a ham.

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
You ever tell you that?

169
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
No, that's the first time I heard that.

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Well, it's true.

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Oh god, what were you talking about?

172
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
The minivan.

173
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Digi was talking about something,

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,560
but then you went on a tangent about cars.

175
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
We pretty much did the intro

176
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
and then like just seven minutes of just it went.

177
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
And now we're in heaven.

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
That's what happened.

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Did either of you have a topic

180
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
you wanted to bring at the top of the show today?

181
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
No.

182
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Well, I kind of wanted to talk about something.

183
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I don't know if you would find it interesting

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
or your audience would find it interesting,

185
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,560
but wanted to talk about how I came to know the PCP.

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Okay.

187
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Yeah, please.

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Everyone's got a different story about this.

189
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Well, I'll be interested hearing your side

190
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
and I can present my side of it.

191
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Sure.

192
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
So who should go first?

193
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,560
I'll say, I think the way that I...

194
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Man, I always forget how I found out about you.

195
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
How I found out about you, Gamers Tavern.

196
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Was it Jesse?

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
I just remembered Jesse.

198
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Or was it someone else?

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Yeah, Jesse just stumbled upon the channel

200
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
and like posted it and was just like,

201
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
this is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
And then Hippo was like,

203
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
this is also the funniest thing I've ever seen.

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
And then they both like contacted him

205
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,560
relatively soon after that, I think, right?

206
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Gamers Tavern, you are...

207
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I'm surprised it wasn't Hippo.

208
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Your stuff seems like so, so much up Hippo's...

209
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
I mean, I keep calling you Hippo.

210
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
I don't know why I've fallen back to calling Gibb Hippo.

211
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,560
You see so much Gibb's alley.

212
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Yeah.

213
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
I always do it too.

214
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I think you have a similar sense of humor.

215
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Sometimes.

216
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
Yep, so that's what happened.

217
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
I guess it was Jesse.

218
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
I think I make the mistake because

219
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
I just really loved the Hippo Crit channel.

220
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
And like, I always...

221
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I was so insistent on trying to call her Hippo Crit

222
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,560
to promote the Hippo Crit channel.

223
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,560
But now that's dead, so there's no reason to do that anymore.

224
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
But it still lives on in my brain.

225
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Well, I...

226
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,560
That's how I originally knew Hippo as Hippo.

227
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,560
But then I found out later that

228
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,560
she goes by Gibbentech, right?

229
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
That was the original name.

230
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
That was her name as a pony reviewer.

231
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Yeah, I saw some comments on some of my stuff under that name

232
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,560
and it took me a while to realize it was the same person.

233
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
And those comments go real far back.

234
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I think they go all the way back to 2013.

235
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,560
So I guess Hippo knew about me for quite a while or given.

236
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,560
I just remember the two, like Jesse and Gibbentech,

237
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
talking about your channel all the time

238
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
because they would just quote the puns and stuff.

239
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
But that's very flattering.

240
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Yeah, it's infectious.

241
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
It's infectious.

242
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,560
You start thinking that way after a while.

243
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I try to do a gamer's tavern impression sometimes,

244
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
but I'm always embarrassed because I can't do it.

245
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
It's the voice.

246
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,560
He's got that thick, full voice that really

247
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,560
draws out the most in the monotone of the joke delivery,

248
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
which makes it great.

249
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Well, it's kind of harder to do it live

250
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,560
because I can't cut out any laughter like I can in the videos.

251
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,560
I thought you were going to say silences.

252
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Yeah, I can't do that either.

253
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,560
I love that you literally are laughing at your own puns

254
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
as you record those things.

255
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
That is really great.

256
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
That's funny.

257
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
That's a lot actually.

258
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,560
That tends to happen when you try to do comedy.

259
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Sometimes you have the line in your head

260
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,560
and you laugh at it before you say it.

261
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Oh yeah, that's fair.

262
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
And it can be difficult sometimes to get through it.

263
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I guess that's why stand-ups have to,

264
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
they have to thoroughly practice their set

265
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,560
to make sure that they are over the jokes

266
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,560
before they go on stage.

267
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Do you guys hear that?

268
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Do you keep hearing that beep sound?

269
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
A few moments later.

270
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Okay, mystery solved.

271
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,560
That's going to be in the recording?

272
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,560
No, Eleazar, put that in the bonus.

273
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Put this on the bonus episode.

274
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Put it in the secret blooper reel.

275
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Gonna have a pretty big bonus.

276
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
But keep me saying, put it in the blooper reel

277
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,560
so that they know that they've got a patreon.com

278
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
slash procrastinator.

279
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
That's like a bonus in your paycheck, right?

280
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Yeah, actually.

281
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,560
The more we cut, the more we make.

282
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,560
It's one-to-one.

283
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Who's fucking crunching?

284
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Who's fucking crunching?

285
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Who is that?

286
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Who's fucking crunching, dude?

287
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,560
I'm crunching a trisket right now, dude.

288
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm crunching so fucking hard.

289
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
I'm masticating, dude.

290
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm making a fine paste out of the breadstuffs

291
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,560
of this wheat snack.

292
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I had a craving for triscuits yesterday.

293
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
It's reduced fat triscuits.

294
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,560
You know why? Because they taste exactly the same.

295
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Yeah, reduced fat.

296
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Reduced fat triscuits.

297
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
They already have like four.

298
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
They have like two grams of fat in them anyway.

299
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
So it's just down to one.

300
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Same shit.

301
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Remember Ben said he wanted to do that once?

302
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Who did?

303
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
You did.

304
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
He said he wanted to crunch.

305
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
To reduce fat?

306
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,560
No, you wanted to open an episode by crunching.

307
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,560
We had a whole bonus episode that was nothing but crunching.

308
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Oh, what a nightmare.

309
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Were you on that one?

310
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
No, I would have probably killed myself if I had been.

311
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
It was the whole gimmick.

312
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,560
I think we went for like an hour and it was just,

313
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,560
you couldn't talk unless you had food.

314
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
It was so bad.

315
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
It sounds like a good time.

316
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
All of our episodes are like that.

317
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,560
All of our bonus episodes are a fucking blur.

318
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Do you know about them?

319
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Do you know the latest one we did?

320
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,560
And I'll tell you this, not to advertise it,

321
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
but because I think you would find it funny.

322
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Our last bonus episode was a commentary track for our first episode,

323
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,560
where it's us like listening to the first episode

324
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
and commentating on it as we go.

325
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,560
And you're supposed to play it and the first PCP episode at the same time.

326
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,560
So you have them synced up and you can hear our live reaction to it as it goes.

327
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
I think I saw you tweet that, but I wasn't sure what you were commentating.

328
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Maybe I did.

329
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,560
I saw it that it was a commentary track.

330
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
We actually have to do another one of those.

331
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Yeah, I was just thinking like, is that the most recent one?

332
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
That felt like it was a while ago.

333
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,560
No, we recorded that just over a month ago.

334
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
So we just have to do another one before the end of this month.

335
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,560
It's just that I went across America and back in that time,

336
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
so it feels like a long time passed.

337
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Have you talked about that on the show?

338
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,560
I have not really talked about it on the PCP, no.

339
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
You want to talk about your fucking cross-country trip?

340
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah, I'm editing the documentary of it right now,

341
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,560
and it'll probably be out probably before this.

342
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,560
But I'll advertise it and explain it,

343
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,560
because it's a very gonzo documentary.

344
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Basically, the three people who have come to live in my house,

345
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,560
named Ari, Riley, and Mint,

346
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,560
basically we were initially all just going to do a tour similar to this one.

347
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Crack in a gridlock.

348
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Crack in a summit gridlock for this one.

349
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Basically, these three people came to stay at my house temporarily

350
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,560
with the ambition of all of us doing a tour together.

351
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,560
And then after my previous relationship ended,

352
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I basically was like, hey, you guys just stay here

353
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,560
and we'll do stuff together until we can do tours,

354
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
and just get a fucking...

355
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,560
until we can afford to get an RV or something

356
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,560
and go on adventures all the time.

357
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,560
There was already a plan for this festival

358
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
that Dick Masterson of The Dick Show was...

359
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,560
He wanted to do his own version of Burning Man,

360
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
which got canceled this year because of COVID,

361
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,560
called Burning Dick, out in the middle of the desert in a dry lake bed.

362
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Across the lake bed from a rave, we had our own...

363
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
It was not a...

364
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Wait, like a different rave?

365
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Yeah, there was just a rave going on on the other side of the lake bed,

366
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,560
but we were...

367
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
I don't even think it ended up happening

368
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
because everything got dusted out.

369
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
When we went to this thing, it pretty much lasted a day.

370
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,560
And then the next day, there was so much dusted,

371
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
everybody's tents was getting destroyed,

372
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
so everybody packed it up and left.

373
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,560
My party had left early anyways

374
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,560
because we were just on a fucking manic adventure

375
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
and lots of drugs.

376
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Our Gonzo adventure took us from Virginia

377
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,560
down through Arkansas, which is where Riley's from,

378
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
to stay with his grandma.

379
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,560
And then we went to Dallas

380
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,560
and hung out with a mysterious organization known as The Bucket,

381
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
which...

382
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Whoa, okay, tell me about that.

383
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I can't tell you much about The Bucket.

384
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
You can tell me a little bit.

385
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
All right.

386
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Well, The Bucket is some really cool people,

387
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
really nice, really helpful,

388
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
supplied us with a lot of drugs.

389
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
And so...

390
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Okay.

391
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
We...

392
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
They're unironically extremely cool people,

393
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,560
but some of the nicest drug people I've ever met in my entire life...

394
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Are they like...

395
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Okay, are they like...

396
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Are they gonna have a bucket list?

397
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Like, imagine if Robin Hood gave you drugs.

398
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Are they a cult?

399
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,560
I mean, they can be, I guess.

400
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
I don't think so.

401
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
I don't know.

402
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
All right.

403
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
No, I'm gonna go with them.

404
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
I was hoping they were.

405
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Damn, okay, fuck.

406
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,560
But The Bucket can be whatever you want it to be, I guess.

407
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,560
So they try to have plenty of fun before they kick The Bucket, right?

408
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Exactly.

409
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Well, they're aiming to get...

410
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
That's a good way of putting it, yeah.

411
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
They're aiming to kick The Bucket.

412
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
They're aiming for that.

413
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Aiming to kick The Bucket in the most fun way possible.

414
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Let's put it that way.

415
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Right on.

416
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,560
So we hung around The Bucket for a couple days,

417
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,560
and then we got some footage of Riley walking around with a cape

418
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
being the super spreader in Dallas.

419
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah.

420
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,560
So we then went to California into the desert,

421
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,560
hung out with Dick Masterson and a bunch of guys who had a lot of guns,

422
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
and we shot a lot of guns at a mountain.

423
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I saw you shooting guns on Twitter.

424
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Yeah, I was guided into the guns.

425
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
That was scary.

426
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
I am afraid of weapons.

427
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,560
The bigger guns are so fucking heavy, I could not...

428
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
I basically fired two or three times and was like,

429
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
I can't even hold this thing anymore.

430
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
It's fucking killing my arms.

431
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,560
If anyone comes at you with a gun, you need to gun it.

432
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
That's true.

433
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
I've fired a gun one time.

434
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I think I fired at a pistol range with the Boy Scouts or whatever.

435
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I think depending on how far away the person is in most circumstances,

436
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,560
gunning it's probably a better response than trying to return fire.

437
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,560
You got a better chance of getting away.

438
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
You got to be...

439
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
It's about the spacing.

440
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Make sure you juke.

441
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
It's about the spacing, right?

442
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,560
If you're within five feet, the bad guy will get you before you pull the gun.

443
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,560
But if you're like 15, it's like 50-50, and if 30, it's like...

444
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,560
If you're five feet, you got to go straight for the nads with your leg.

445
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Just kick to the balls.

446
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Bam.

447
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Easy.

448
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
No thought.

449
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Pure instinct.

450
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Yeah, exactly.

451
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,560
So we shot some guns in the desert and then we pretty much were like,

452
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
all right, well that's all we came here to do really.

453
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,560
So then we went to Vegas for a stop.

454
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Vegas sucks.

455
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Riley loves Vegas because he's like,

456
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,560
oh, this is the last best deal of America or whatever.

457
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
That sucks so bad.

458
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Everything's overpriced.

459
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I mean, it's just that everything is a trap there.

460
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Yeah, exactly.

461
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,560
It all starts cheap and then quickly, steeply escalates,

462
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,560
and it's all built around trying to trap you in that.

463
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Vegas is cool to walk through.

464
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Don't go any building.

465
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,560
That's really all we did because we basically just dropped acid

466
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
and walked around on Fremont Street,

467
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,560
which was, it was just like too overwhelming for me.

468
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Is that the one with all the lights over it?

469
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Yeah, the big sky thing.

470
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,560
And yeah, I got too spooked too quick.

471
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
We basically just wandered around for a couple hours

472
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,560
and went back to the hotel room, then did Molly,

473
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,560
and that cured my anxiety for like two days.

474
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,560
That was pretty cool.

475
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Did I tell you about the time I did Molly?

476
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
No, you did not.

477
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I talked about it on here, but I'll say it again.

478
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Someone just offered it to me, and I was kind of drunk,

479
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
and I was like, yeah, sure, whatever.

480
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Yeah, fuck it.

481
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I don't know what this is.

482
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Great mentality.

483
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,560
What ended up happening was...

484
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
No, no, it was funny.

485
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
The guy gave it to me.

486
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
I think he gave me like a half-tablet because he was like,

487
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
I was like, yeah, I've never taken Molly before,

488
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
and he was like, I'll just give you a half-tablet then.

489
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
And I was like, cool.

490
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,560
And one of the other guys, he made like a joke about like

491
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
how it can kill you or something,

492
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
and the guy who gave it to me got real serious with that guy.

493
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
He like scolded him.

494
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
He was like, dude, no.

495
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Dude, do not tell a guy that.

496
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
He's getting high right now, and if you tell that,

497
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
it's gonna suck for him.

498
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
He was like real serious about like,

499
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
do not give this guy a bad time on my drugs,

500
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
which I respected.

501
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I appreciated it.

502
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,560
But all that happened was I walked home,

503
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,560
like babbling to my friend about some shit I don't remember.

504
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,560
And then when I got home, I thought like,

505
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,560
man, people don't connect anymore.

506
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
People don't love each other enough.

507
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Molly is a very emotionally open drug.

508
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
So I walked to my neighbor's house at like four in the morning

509
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
and started knocking on the door,

510
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
because I was like, I want to say hi.

511
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
I want to make friends with these people.

512
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Oh yeah, that's right.

513
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
You did tell me about that.

514
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
I think I remember hearing this.

515
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
And then the next day they came over and they were like,

516
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
someone was knocking on our door.

517
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Now that I've done the drug,

518
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
I understand how that happened.

519
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
I totally get it now.

520
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Yeah.

521
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Yeah.

522
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
It's a very...

523
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I don't remember where you told this story,

524
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
but I have heard it.

525
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,560
I must have listened to some previous episode, I guess.

526
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
It was of all the bad things that could happen

527
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
when you take a drug that was pretty mild,

528
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
and I think it's funny.

529
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Yeah, it is pretty funny.

530
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
So anyway.

531
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
So we went through Vegas,

532
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,560
and then from there we went to Idaho

533
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,560
because they had all come to my house from Twin Falls, Idaho,

534
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,560
from a different house they had been staying in,

535
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
and all their stuff was there.

536
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,560
But because we already had a lot of stuff with us for the trip,

537
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
we were not able to take that much of their stuff back,

538
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
which was pretty tragic.

539
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,560
But pretty much from there,

540
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,560
we just made a straight beam from...

541
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,560
We slept the night in Kansas,

542
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,560
stayed in Arkansas for another night,

543
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,560
and then went back up to Virginia.

544
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
So it was like pretty breakneck.

545
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,560
It was like two weeks of mostly nonstop driving

546
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,560
literally across the entire fucking country

547
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
in all directions.

548
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,560
I saw every biome of America.

549
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
It was pretty entertaining, honestly,

550
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
even just being in the car,

551
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,560
and just looking at how different...

552
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
That sounds fun.

553
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,560
The desert, very different vibe from the east coast,

554
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
very different vibe from the north part.

555
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
I won't say that it wouldn't get old

556
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,560
if you took the same routes over and over again,

557
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,560
but I do think taking different routes

558
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
for a while would be interesting.

559
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,560
I think people would be shocked

560
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
at how close you can probably get

561
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,560
to literally seeing all of America.

562
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
You say all of America,

563
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
but America is a huge place.

564
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
It's fucking unbelievably massive,

565
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,560
but so much of it you can see...

566
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,560
When you're in Nevada,

567
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,560
you see for fucking miles in all directions.

568
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,560
It's extremely open.

569
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,560
It's mostly fucking desert.

570
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,560
A long time ago, I went to Vegas,

571
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,560
and I didn't like it much,

572
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,560
but the one thing I really disliked about it

573
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
that kind of depressed me is that

574
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
whenever I would wake up in the morning

575
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
and looked out of the window of my hotel,

576
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,560
all I see around me is desert.

577
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
You can see where the city ends

578
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
and the desert begins,

579
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,560
and you're basically in a city

580
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,560
in the middle of a giant desert.

581
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,560
It kind of felt bleak.

582
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,560
I had the best Korean barbecue

583
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,560
of my life in Vegas,

584
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
so it's got that going for it.

585
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Wish I had gone to Korean barbecue.

586
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
We went to a place called the Heart Attack Grill,

587
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,560
where they have...

588
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,560
They will give you up to a 10-patty,

589
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
giant fucking burger

590
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,560
that's literally designed to kill you.

591
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
There have been two deaths at this restaurant,

592
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
and if you are over 350 pounds,

593
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,560
they will give you your food for free.

594
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
You have to get up on a big scale

595
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560
in front of everybody and be weighed.

596
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,560
What I did not understand about this place,

597
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,560
from the outside, it's like,

598
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,560
big food, Heart Attack, whatever.

599
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
When you get inside,

600
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,560
first of all, all the waitresses are dressed as nurses.

601
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Everything is themed around a hospital,

602
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
and it's all shame play.

603
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
If you finish your food,

604
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
then they spank you in front of everyone,

605
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
like with a paddle.

606
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,560
The whole place is some weird fetish thing.

607
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
It was bizarre.

608
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Based.

609
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
I was not into it.

610
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
I was like, okay.

611
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,560
It was fun to experience for one time,

612
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
but I was like...

613
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
If they advertise that they want you to die,

614
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,560
and you die, can't you sue them?

615
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
No, you literally are signing your life away.

616
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
They did not make a sign of waiver,

617
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
but I think it says on the door,

618
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
if you step into this restaurant,

619
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
you understand that...

620
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
I don't know how legally binding it is.

621
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
I don't want people to die in my name,

622
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
and then sue me after they're dead.

623
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,560
There literally have been multiple deaths.

624
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I would assume the family could sue

625
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
after somebody dies there.

626
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Remember Dick's last resort?

627
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Do you eat there with us at Christmas the other day?

628
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
A couple years ago?

629
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Yeah, the dirty dicks.

630
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,560
The place where they insult you?

631
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Yeah, they make fun of you the whole time.

632
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,560
That place is comparably more innocent

633
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,560
in vibe compared to this one.

634
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
I was not impressed.

635
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
They didn't hurt my feelings even a little bit,

636
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
to be perfectly honest.

637
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
They took it easy on me.

638
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
That reminds me of, I think,

639
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,560
a sketch that I think the widest kids did.

640
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
I think it was them.

641
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
It was a restaurant, and they would insult you.

642
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,560
It was a real restaurant.

643
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
I actually didn't know that was a real restaurant.

644
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
I thought that was just a skit.

645
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
It's called Dick's Last Resort.

646
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
I think it's a chain, but the one that I know

647
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
is at Faniel Hall in Boston.

648
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Oh, I haven't seen the skit, though.

649
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
I love the widest kids you know.

650
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
I used to like the widest kids you know.

651
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
I don't know if I would still like them.

652
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,560
I'm a pretty big fan of them myself.

653
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
I'm sure.

654
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Do they still exist?

655
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Do they still do stuff?

656
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Yeah.

657
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,560
I know they did something or other recently.

658
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
I don't know what it is.

659
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
They still exist, but I don't think they do the skits anymore.

660
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,560
No, they don't do that show.

661
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,560
A big part of why I campaigned so hard

662
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
for this show to be called the PCP

663
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
was because of the gallon of PCP sketch

664
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
from the widest kids.

665
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Yeah, I remember that sketch.

666
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
It's one of my favorites.

667
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Oh, yeah.

668
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I forgot about that.

670
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
I forgot about that.

671
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Go on.

672
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Go on, please.

673
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
No, you.

674
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,560
No, no, no, by all means you insist.

675
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
I insist.

676
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Oh, but no, no, I'm not sipping.

677
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,560
I wasn't done sipping my red stripe

678
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,560
at, you know, I'm not done.

679
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,560
Well, I'm not done with my summit gridlock.

680
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
You know, it's funny.

681
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,560
I think most people would be surprised to know that I'm a big

682
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,560
fan of edgy humor, you know, widest kids, you know, and stuff

683
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
like that.

684
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Yeah, I would be shocked to find out that you

685
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,560
opened the open the show with a pedophile.

686
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Yeah.

687
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Um, I think I like to.

688
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Sorry, I went to the stream, the election stream that

689
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Ben did.

690
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
That's right.

691
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,560
You were in there and towards the election night.

692
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
It was around towards the end, I think.

693
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,560
And you mentioned something strange, at least strange to me.

694
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
I told, yes.

695
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I told I told an anecdote.

696
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Hey, you told me somebody told you that the PCP ruined the

697
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,560
gamers tavern brand by making it more edgy.

698
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah, that's true.

699
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Somebody somebody did tell me that.

700
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
That's not that.

701
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I've watched the old gamers like the oldest gamers taverns

702
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
videos.

703
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,560
I remember them all having edgy jokes in them like you

704
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,560
would bounce between like these really wholesome jokes and

705
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,560
then these really edgy jokes sometimes like.

706
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Yeah.

707
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Yeah.

708
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
I think I think you're right.

709
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,560
This was not, I mean, this was not.

710
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
Yeah.

711
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Somebody told me and the reason I remembered it because I was

712
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
I was kind of like, wait, what?

713
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
I don't know.

714
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,560
I didn't agree with it, but I thought it was, I thought it was

715
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
pretty wild actually.

716
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,560
I thought it was funny because it's like somebody came up with

717
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,560
a narrative in their head and running with it.

718
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,560
So, I mean, it's not true, but it's funny.

719
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
It's cool that it was true actually because it's more

720
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,560
interesting than the truth.

721
00:30:51,560 --> 00:31:01,560
I would like to say that I ruined the gamers.

722
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
But I don't think I can.

723
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I don't think I can claim that in good conscience.

724
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Unfortunately.

725
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Hey Ben.

726
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
It's kind of a dramatic.

727
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Yeah.

728
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,560
I mean, there's not much of a brand to ruin.

729
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
I think everybody go fucking subscribe.

730
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,560
I immediately recognize the brown and brown of the gamers

731
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Tavern logo.

732
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
So I would say the brand is strong.

733
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
I can't.

734
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,560
I will say though, at least based on your discord avatar,

735
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,560
I cannot actually read the text on it.

736
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Yeah, I just, I just noticed that.

737
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
You know, I do everything myself.

738
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,560
So I don't have any graphic designers or artists.

739
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,560
So I'm not exactly very good at that kind of thing.

740
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I'm sure we can get you a hookup because there happens

741
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,560
to be fuckloads of artists in this community and podcast.

742
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,560
So if you are interested in having new artwork,

743
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
just let us know.

744
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I got it.

745
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Okay.

746
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
It's pretty unfortunate.

747
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I tried to, I tried to, I'm not logged into my YouTube.

748
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,560
So I tried to get to your show and I Google,

749
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Gamers Tavern two words and there's a different channel

750
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
called Gamers Tavern.

751
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
So then I was like, oh, no, no, it's all one word.

752
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,560
So then I searched it with, without the space.

753
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
And then two came up.

754
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,560
There's the Gamers Tavern, which is a different, different show.

755
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
And then there's yours, which is Gamers Tavern show.

756
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,560
There's a lot of Gamers Tavern out there.

757
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Mine is Gamers Tavern show.

758
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Gamers Tavern show.

759
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,560
I came up with Gamers Tavern back in 2003.

760
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
It was a website, right?

761
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Before it was a YouTube.

762
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Yeah.

763
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
The website is GamersTavern.com.

764
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah.

765
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,560
And back then there was only one other person using Gamers Tavern,

766
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,560
but now there's like 10 or 15 or 20.

767
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,560
And for some reason, all the other Gamers Taverns that exist now

768
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,560
are way more popular than I am, even though I'm the original.

769
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,560
I mean, I think there's probably, it makes sense to me.

770
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,560
It feels natural because I think there's a pretty natural

771
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,560
and broad cross-section of like, you know, aging people

772
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,560
like my age, your age, who are like late millennials

773
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,560
who are reaching the age where they're starting to like craft beer.

774
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,560
He said he started using the name in 2003.

775
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Oh yeah, but he said he's proliferating now.

776
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I don't know, I just, the appeals, there's a certain brand,

777
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,560
there's a certain brand of nerd, right, who's like into craft beer,

778
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:52,560
and they're basically just Tycho from Penny Arcade is what I'm saying.

779
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
I was a big Penny Arcade fan back then.

780
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
That kind of name would appeal to, I think.

781
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
It appeals to me.

782
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,560
I inherently hear Tavern, I think.

783
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
The ironic thing is...

784
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Yeah, exactly.

785
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
I'm saying it's an appealing aesthetic.

786
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Like, what about just a Tavern, but for gamers?

787
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Yeah, it was an aesthetic choice, but ironically, I don't drink.

788
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Is that true?

789
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Yeah.

790
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,560
You're the only one not drinking right now, I think, on the show, right?

791
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Ben?

792
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Well, I'm drinking, I'm getting high on caffeine and taurine

793
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,560
and branch chain amino acids.

794
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,560
I was hoping you were drinking, because I was thinking that if we were both...

795
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
No, not right now.

796
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,560
If we were both day drinking and being incessantly catty,

797
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,560
this show would just be the new Kathy Lee and Hoda.

798
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Have you ever watched Kathy Lee and Hoda on the Today Show?

799
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Are you familiar with this?

800
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
No.

801
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
God, no.

802
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
I don't know why.

803
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,560
I feel like I'm the only person in my entire generation

804
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
or something who's actually seen this show.

805
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Maybe I'm just...

806
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Well...

807
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
I mean, I know of the Today Show.

808
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
There's like an hour of every morning.

809
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
I mean, they don't do it anymore, I think.

810
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,560
But it was Kathy Lee, Gifford, and Hoda Catby.

811
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,560
These two ladies in their late 40s.

812
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Hoda Catby?

813
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Catby.

814
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,560
And they would just sit in chairs and get drunk

815
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
and talk over each other for an hour.

816
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,560
And sometimes it would just like...

817
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,560
If I passed out on the couch, I'd wake up and this show would be on.

818
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Oh, God, she looks like a bronze Nancy Pelosi.

819
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Sounds like top quality entertainment.

820
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I enjoyed it.

821
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,560
I mean, it's definitely a show that most of the people

822
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,560
who I've ever known would not watch, but I enjoyed it.

823
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Is this a new discovery?

824
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
No, I used to...

825
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
The show's not even on anymore.

826
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,560
It's just like I would wake up in the middle of the day

827
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
and be like, oh, Kathy Lee and Hoda.

828
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,560
It's like having a couple funny aunts who just...

829
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,560
A couple of funny wine aunts just babbling about nothing.

830
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,560
The show would be literally incoherent sometimes.

831
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,560
The level of just talking over each other and being drunk

832
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
couldn't even tell what the fuck they were saying.

833
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,560
And I was just like, this is better than regular television for me.

834
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I don't particularly care to hear what anybody is saying.

835
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
This is much funnier.

836
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,560
You should have started a YouTube channel analyzing Kathy Lee and Hoda.

837
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
That's a good idea.

838
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I don't think anybody on YouTube has ever seen it.

839
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
You should have started with that.

840
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,560
I've never brought this show up to anyone I've known

841
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
and them have any idea what I'm talking about,

842
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,560
even though it's like a show that I assume is watched by millions of people every day.

843
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
It's part of the today's show.

844
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,560
That doesn't sound like a TV show.

845
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,560
It sounds more like something you'd see on YouTube.

846
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
It was basically a podcast.

847
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,560
They literally just sat in elevated chairs at a bar table,

848
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,560
a little round table with drinks at 10 in the morning

849
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:11,560
and just obviously already have been drinking before the show

850
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
and continue drinking through the show,

851
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
sometimes getting just utterly plastered

852
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,560
and just having guests on who are like, I don't know,

853
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
celebrities from whatever show,

854
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,560
they just flirt with them and then fucking talk over them.

855
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
That's it.

856
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,560
It's a bit early to start drinking.

857
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
That's what's so great about it.

858
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,560
It's 4.18 right now, almost 4.20.

859
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
It doesn't seem early for me to be drinking,

860
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
but I only woke up like three hours ago,

861
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,560
so it is early for me to be drinking.

862
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
I am not drinking now,

863
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:50,560
but I have been drinking a lot more lately during COVID times.

864
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,560
I've been drinking a lot of sparkling wine.

865
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
I don't know why,

866
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,560
but I've started my routine on a day that I decided to say fuck it

867
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,560
as I go down to my local spirit shop

868
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
and I buy the two cheapest bottles

869
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,560
of barefoot bubbly, brute cuvée that I can find.

870
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
See now, this definitely sounds like something

871
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,560
that they would be drinking on Kathie Lee at home.

872
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,560
Yeah, it does, now that you mention it.

873
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm drinking Red Stripe, which is not the most daytime TV.

874
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,560
I can't see Kathie Lee down here on Red Stripe.

875
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
Isn't it Red Stripe?

876
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Did they have the ads with like that Jamaican guy?

877
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
The Jamaican beer.

878
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Yeah, okay.

879
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Jamaican me crazy, man.

880
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,560
And I'll just do two bottles in a day.

881
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,560
Two bottles in a day is enough that I'm pretty blasted

882
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,560
and don't remember going to sleep.

883
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
And that's what it's like.

884
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
I'm curious about this Ben,

885
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,560
because you are somebody who gets blackout drunk.

886
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Sometimes.

887
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Enough times.

888
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
More than once a year, we'll say.

889
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Oh.

890
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Oh yeah.

891
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Not even close, yeah.

892
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,560
More than once a month?

893
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Probably not that much though.

894
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
Okay, okay.

895
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
So like 10 times a year.

896
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Maybe once a month.

897
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
10 to 15, all right.

898
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
5 to 10.

899
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,560
I've only ever been blackout drunk one time

900
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
on my 21st birthday.

901
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,560
And like just like having it had happened

902
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
was so terrifying to me

903
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,560
that I've never been willing to let it happen again.

904
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Why?

905
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Was it scary to wake up and be like,

906
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I don't remember what happened?

907
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Yeah, I get that.

908
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Just to have realized that like my fate

909
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,560
was completely in the hands of the people around me

910
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,560
and that they were like fairly non-committal

911
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
and taking care of me.

912
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
You know what I mean?

913
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,560
It was like, even though it was my mom,

914
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,560
her friend Victor and our friend Marcus,

915
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
and like Marcus is just like,

916
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,560
I don't want to be the one who gets stuck

917
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
getting cried on tonight.

918
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Victor is just like,

919
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
oh, this is annoying

920
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
and I want nothing to do with any of it.

921
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
And my mom and her friend are getting high

922
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
and they're drunk as shit and they don't care.

923
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,560
So you know, and Marcus is like showing me footage

924
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
on his phone of me like crying and stuff

925
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
and my mom's telling me like,

926
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,560
oh yeah, we were talking about like buying you a hooker and shit.

927
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,560
And I was like, I'm going to go like never do this again.

928
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
It's fucked up, man.

929
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
It's fucked up.

930
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,560
I'm like, you know, I mean, it is scary.

931
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,560
When I wake up, when I wake up and I'm like,

932
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
I don't remember what happened.

933
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Yes, it's scary.

934
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
It's terrifying.

935
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
It's the nightmare.

936
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
I hate it.

937
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Yeah.

938
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
But you know, the night before,

939
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
you know, I'm like, you know,

940
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
if I drink slowly enough,

941
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,560
if I drink slowly, you know,

942
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
it's not like I can,

943
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
it's not like I can feel the transition

944
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
from normal to blackout.

945
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
It feels like a smooth transition

946
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
and I feel normal at the time.

947
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
Have you had any like,

948
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,560
a cliff night wake-ups yet?

949
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Cliff night wake-ups.

950
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Yeah, like the video,

951
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,560
cliff night, like where he's waking up.

952
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Oh, like when he wakes up next to that hell cat and angel

953
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,560
or maybe a demon wearing a human suit.

954
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,560
Just as outrageous as what transpires therein.

955
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
I had a night.

956
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
This was like years ago,

957
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,560
but I do remember I went to some party

958
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
and some guy had like,

959
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,560
some fucking guy in a tweed suit or whatever,

960
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,560
had like some whiskey that he said was like,

961
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,560
oh, this is like such value.

962
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
This is like, oh, everyone like try a shot of this.

963
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Like this is like,

964
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,560
he's just like half a shot

965
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,560
because this is like a fucking billion dollar bottle

966
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
or whatever.

967
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Like this is like a million years old,

968
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,560
aged in like ancient China or something.

969
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
And I don't know,

970
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,560
they're taking shots of that.

971
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,560
And I was probably like sneaking shots of it

972
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,560
behind his back or something.

973
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
Cause like whatever, fuck it,

974
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
it's a bottle of whiskey.

975
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,560
And I remember,

976
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
I remember like a,

977
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,560
which is like a fire in someone's backyard.

978
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
And I remember writhing around.

979
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,560
He's like, this is like a super rare whiskey

980
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
and you're like, well,

981
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,560
that means I'm going to drink as much of it

982
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
as I possibly fucking can.

983
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Oh, I should, I should get,

984
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,560
I should get as much as I can then.

985
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
Yeah.

986
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
I remember, I was,

987
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,560
I did end up on the ground in like the woods

988
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
next to their backyard,

989
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
just like vomiting.

990
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
That was bad.

991
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
That was really bad.

992
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
That's like the worst.

993
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,560
That's pretty romantic.

994
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
That was probably the worst,

995
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,560
like the worst a night of getting drunk I ever had.

996
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,560
I'm trying to remember any other fucking flip.

997
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,560
How, how much does a bee need to drink to get a buzz?

998
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
I think, okay,

999
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,560
does Jerry Seinfeld drink in the B movie?

1000
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,560
I don't know.

1001
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
I never watched the B movie.

1002
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Me either.

1003
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,560
I've only seen big Joel's B movie video

1004
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
and I've never seen the B movie,

1005
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
but that video is a masterpiece.

1006
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
Embarrassing.

1007
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,560
No, it's good.

1008
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,560
It's good.

1009
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
I promise.

1010
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Wait, fuck.

1011
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
I forgot.

1012
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
I think I was going to say something

1013
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,560
about the previous topic.

1014
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
My favorite,

1015
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,560
my favorite B movie is B movie.

1016
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Yeah, now I remember what I was going to say.

1017
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
I need another drink.

1018
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
I'm going to go get another drink.

1019
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
You know, it's,

1020
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,560
I wish I had some brute cuve.

1021
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
I would, I would,

1022
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
if I had a bottle of brute cuve,

1023
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
did you, I would,

1024
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,560
I would pop it right now.

1025
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Because we got to celebrate

1026
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
that Joe Biden is the next president

1027
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
of the United States, everybody.

1028
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
We exorcised, we did it.

1029
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,560
We restored the soul of the nation.

1030
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Nobody's clapping.

1031
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
What?

1032
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Why is nobody clapping?

1033
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
Get hype, guys.

1034
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Well, um...

1035
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,560
That was the longest fucking pause.

1036
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
I was waiting for somebody to say something.

1037
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,560
No, nobody's going to say anything.

1038
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,560
But...

1039
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,560
Nobody else is riding with Biden like me.

1040
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Yeah, I guess you're the only one.

1041
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,560
I guess it's just me.

1042
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
That's bummer.

1043
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
But uh...

1044
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,560
It's bummer.

1045
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
We have to restore the soul.

1046
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
We have to restore the soul of the nation.

1047
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Actually,

1048
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
my favorite thing about Joe Biden

1049
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,560
is something that Trump tweeted about him.

1050
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
I think,

1051
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,560
I don't remember what he was talking about,

1052
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,560
but at one point,

1053
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,560
Joe Biden wasn't making many public appearances.

1054
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,560
And then,

1055
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,560
Trump tweeted,

1056
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
Joe Biden, more like Joe Hayden.

1057
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
That is a good one.

1058
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,560
So...

1059
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,560
I don't remember that one.

1060
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,560
I feel like I would remember that one, but I don't.

1061
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,560
You know, as the pun appreciator,

1062
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,560
I had to give him

1063
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,560
a thumbs up on that one.

1064
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
Yeah.

1065
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
Hey, Gamers Tavern.

1066
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,560
You like video games,

1067
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,560
obviously.

1068
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
Do you like fighting games?

1069
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
A little bit.

1070
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I like

1071
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Smash Bros.

1072
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,560
and

1073
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,560
sometimes I play Street Fighter.

1074
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
Okay.

1075
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
And Guilty Gear.

1076
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,560
Guilty Gear is another one I really like.

1077
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Yes.

1078
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Good.

1079
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,560
Good.

1080
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
Good.

1081
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,560
That's the answer I needed,

1082
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
because

1083
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,560
Steam just is having a big fucking fighting game sale

1084
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,560
for some reason.

1085
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
And it just so happened,

1086
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,560
so there's a producer

1087
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
who I've been working with,

1088
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,560
who I know from Twitter,

1089
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,560
called

1090
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,560
David or Effie Gyros,

1091
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,560
who came to visit

1092
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
the house last weekend

1093
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,560
to do a lecture

1094
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,560
on Russell Greer,

1095
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,560
who is a guy who sues celebrities

1096
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,560
and is

1097
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
he's a fun lolcow.

1098
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
It's a pretty good lecture,

1099
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
but...

1100
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
Sounds like a stand-up.

1101
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
Indeed.

1102
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
And he

1103
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
was playing Guilty Gear

1104
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Xurred.

1105
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,560
And as I was playing,

1106
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,560
I was realizing I wanted to switch my main

1107
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,560
from Slayer

1108
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,560
to Melia Rage,

1109
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,560
who had been my backup

1110
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
up until this point.

1111
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Mostly out of a desire to cosplay as her.

1112
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
And then,

1113
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
it just so happened,

1114
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,560
as I was facing the dilemma of

1115
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,560
I don't know if I want to hook up my PS4

1116
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,560
to play

1117
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Guilty Gear Xurred Sign

1118
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
when I don't even own Revelator

1119
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,560
or X2.

1120
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,560
And then, bam,

1121
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,560
fighting games sale on Steam.

1122
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,560
So what did I do?

1123
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
I bought all the Guilty Gears,

1124
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,560
all the Blazblues,

1125
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Melty Blood, finally.

1126
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
They're sitting on my wish list for, like,

1127
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,560
six years

1128
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
and

1129
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,560
and fucking

1130
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560
the Nitro Plus fighting game

1131
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
where you can play a Saiyan or Uta.

1132
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,560
No one knows what I'm talking about anymore.

1133
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,560
No clue.

1134
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,560
Absolutely no clue.

1135
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
Well, in 2018,

1136
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,560
I built myself a new computer

1137
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,560
and around that time,

1138
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,560
I got Steam and I bought

1139
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
Guilty Gear Xurred.

1140
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
And I played it and beat all the

1141
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,560
you know, beat all the scenarios and stuff.

1142
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,560
It's pretty good.

1143
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
I agree.

1144
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,560
I was a big fan of Guilty Gear back on the PS2.

1145
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,560
My favorite was Guilty Gear X2

1146
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,560
or XX or whatever.

1147
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,560
But then I didn't

1148
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,560
keep up with the series at all until Xurred came out.

1149
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,560
I mean, that basically is the next game

1150
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,560
because it was just remakes of X2

1151
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,560
but with, like, more shit.

1152
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
Yeah.

1153
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,560
Actually, the last one I played before

1154
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,560
I stopped playing Guilty Gear for so long

1155
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
was Guilty Gear

1156
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,560
Esuka on the PS2.

1157
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,560
Yeah, that's the weird one that people don't like.

1158
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
Yeah, and it sucked.

1159
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Is that like the MOBA one?

1160
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,560
No, it was on the PS2.

1161
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
It's kind of like,

1162
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,560
they tried to make it more like Smash Brothers

1163
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
because they had, like, four players.

1164
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,560
You can play as four players

1165
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,560
and you can turn left and right.

1166
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,560
It was very weird and I didn't like it

1167
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,560
and I think everybody hated it.

1168
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
Nice.

1169
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,560
I don't know if that killed the series for a while.

1170
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
It's got mixed reviews on Steam

1171
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,560
even though it's only $2.

1172
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,560
I didn't bother with it.

1173
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,560
Yeah, I remember it being pretty bad.

1174
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,560
But Xurred is pretty good.

1175
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,560
Xurred and X2 are both fucking gods here fighting games

1176
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,560
and the Melee of Rage storyline in Xurred

1177
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,560
made me have some feels.

1178
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
So I was like, cool.

1179
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,560
I'm really bad at fighting games.

1180
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,560
I'm not amazing at them,

1181
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,560
but I'm finally getting to a level where I kind of

1182
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,560
understand the theory behind what I'm doing.

1183
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,560
I learned throughout my youth how to,

1184
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,560
I know what kind of character I can play well

1185
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,560
and how to play that type of character,

1186
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,560
but I don't really understand what I'm doing.

1187
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,560
I wouldn't be able to explain to somebody.

1188
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,560
I do a lot of jumping and going in and out.

1189
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Jumping around, going back and forth, in and out.

1190
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,560
That doesn't make any sense,

1191
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,560
but I'm starting to understand theoretically

1192
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,560
what button presses I'm actually doing.

1193
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,560
I'm not good at fighting games either,

1194
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
but I've been playing them for a long time

1195
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,560
and I feel like only just now

1196
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,560
I understand the fundamentals enough

1197
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,560
and I'm starting to get slightly better.

1198
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Good.

1199
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,560
I played, oh man,

1200
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,560
I fucking loved Street Fighter 2 Turbo

1201
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,560
on the Super Nintendo.

1202
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,560
That was like a childhood staple.

1203
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,560
Who was your main in Street Fighter 2?

1204
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,560
Jeez.

1205
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,560
I don't know.

1206
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,560
I guess I liked...

1207
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,560
I played Cammie.

1208
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,560
I didn't really have a main.

1209
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,560
I liked spamming the fist with E Honda.

1210
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,560
I liked spamming the fire spin with M Bison.

1211
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,560
My strategy to spam the Hadoken was real.

1212
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,560
No, I could never do the Hadoken.

1213
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
I was like, I was so bad,

1214
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,560
I could never do the Hadoken.

1215
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,560
That's supposed to be the easiest move to do.

1216
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,560
Well, not for me.

1217
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,560
I did Throws.

1218
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
No, I did the Sonic Boom with Gile

1219
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,560
because I knew how to do that one.

1220
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,560
I guess that's slightly easier,

1221
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,560
but it takes more time.

1222
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Yeah, so I did...

1223
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,560
It's really embarrassing to admit, actually.

1224
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,560
I couldn't do the Hadoken.

1225
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,560
I did not understand how to do...

1226
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,560
I wasn't good enough to play Ryu.

1227
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,560
I didn't understand how to do

1228
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,560
semi-circle moves and all that kind of shit

1229
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,560
until I was in my late teens.

1230
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,560
Every time I played fighting games,

1231
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,560
I was just mystified by the directional inputs

1232
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,560
because they were usually based on a joystick movement.

1233
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,560
Well, I guess I was playing N64 games on a joystick,

1234
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,560
so I don't know.

1235
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,560
Also, it would usually say punch-kick instead of A-B

1236
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,560
and shit like that,

1237
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,560
and I just didn't understand

1238
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,560
how the buttons correlated to what I was doing.

1239
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,560
It would just always be confusing enough

1240
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,560
that I would look at the command list

1241
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
and just be like, I don't get it

1242
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,560
until finally it's over, and I was like...

1243
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,560
In Guilty Gear.

1244
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,560
In Guilty Gear,

1245
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
because I was in high school when I was playing Guilty Gear,

1246
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,560
and they had the quarter-circle moves,

1247
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,560
which I understood with that man.

1248
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,560
But then there were some other moves that had like...

1249
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,560
It wasn't a quarter-circle,

1250
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
it was sort of like a zigzag.

1251
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,560
And that one, which to me was like,

1252
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,560
oh, okay, so that just means like spaz out

1253
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,560
on those two directions and hope that it works.

1254
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,560
That's the Z motion,

1255
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,560
which is I think known as a dragon punch motion.

1256
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
It's like when you do the dragon punch

1257
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,560
or the shoryuken with Ryu.

1258
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,560
The shoryuken is like,

1259
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,560
I would consider if you can teach someone

1260
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,560
how to perform the shoryuken,

1261
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,560
then you can teach them how to play fighting games.

1262
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,560
It's like just knowing exactly how to do that motion

1263
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,560
makes you understand...

1264
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,560
When I was playing Guilty Gear,

1265
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
I literally think,

1266
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,560
even though I'd been playing this game for like 10 years,

1267
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,560
and I'm fairly decent at it,

1268
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,560
I'm not sure I had ever really understood

1269
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,560
that if you press A while standing still

1270
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,560
versus holding forward, it does two different moves.

1271
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,560
Each one has a different distinct purpose,

1272
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,560
but to me, my instinct is always to be moving,

1273
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,560
to hold the character in a direction

1274
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,560
that is corresponding to the enemy,

1275
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,560
not to stand still and press a button

1276
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,560
because I happen to know that the move

1277
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
will be appropriate for this moment.

1278
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,560
Instinctively, I guide my character towards the enemy.

1279
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,560
I don't even know if I had fully comprehended

1280
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,560
that I was doing two different moves,

1281
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,560
but those are the kinds of things you need to know

1282
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,560
to play fighting games,

1283
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,560
that I think a lot of people have to fight their instincts

1284
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,560
to figure out.

1285
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,560
When I was a kid,

1286
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,560
I didn't understand how to do any of this stuff,

1287
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,560
so what I used to do was

1288
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,560
I would put my fingers on the D-pad

1289
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,560
and my thumbs on the D-pad and buttons,

1290
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,560
and I would just rotate clockwise and counterclockwise,

1291
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,560
and the moves would just come out randomly.

1292
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,560
Like you were massaging it with your thumbs,

1293
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,560
like going in circles.

1294
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Yeah, basically.

1295
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,560
Sometimes I'd win that role.

1296
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,560
It's not the worst strategy,

1297
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,560
so a lot of students just activate supers all day.

1298
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Because they never know what's coming.

1299
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,560
They never know what's coming.

1300
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,560
Yeah, nobody knows what's coming, not even I do.

1301
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,560
Yeah, exactly.

1302
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,560
In terms of like...

1303
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,560
I wouldn't say I'm good at games,

1304
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,560
but I can beat games that just require patience.

1305
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,560
Like something like Super Meat Boy,

1306
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,560
that is basically just like do it over and over again

1307
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,560
until you learn it.

1308
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,560
I'm good at that kind of thing.

1309
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,560
And I'm good at strategy games

1310
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,560
and turn-based stuff.

1311
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,560
I'm pretty good at Pokemon,

1312
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,560
and I'm pretty good at chess.

1313
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,560
For a noob who doesn't actually know

1314
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,560
the theory of the game or anything.

1315
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,560
But I'm really bad at fighting games.

1316
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,560
I'm terrible.

1317
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,560
I can't fucking do it.

1318
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,560
When you say shooters, you mean them?

1319
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,560
Obviously, I'm a champion at Slime Tassen.

1320
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Well, obviously.

1321
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,560
Obviously, everybody knows that.

1322
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,560
That's just the thing about me.

1323
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,560
I just got a message on Twitter from someone.

1324
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,560
It says,

1325
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
I don't know who this person is at all.

1326
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,560
Why are they telling me this?

1327
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,560
I guess that's what happens when...

1328
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,560
Twitter be wildin'.

1329
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,560
I guess that's what happens when you're pretty popular.

1330
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,560
Their name is Adam Jensen,

1331
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,560
which is just the name of the main character from Deus Ex.

1332
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,560
This is what a parasocial relationship is all about.

1333
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,560
I guess so.

1334
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,560
Tell you about like...

1335
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,560
Oh man, trouble at my job.

1336
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,560
I just thought it was very strange

1337
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,560
that they were messaging me

1338
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,560
and not like their mom or something.

1339
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,560
Maybe they don't have any.

1340
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Did you see the thing on Twitter?

1341
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,560
It was a new thing going around.

1342
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,560
The Asian girl saying that Poggers is racist.

1343
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,560
I have not.

1344
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,560
What is this about?

1345
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,560
Well, it's just what it sounds like.

1346
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,560
Is it Poggers British?

1347
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,560
Isn't it British Slime?

1348
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
You don't...

1349
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,560
Do you not know what Poggers is?

1350
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,560
Well, I actually do not know what Poggers is.

1351
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,560
I guess I'm about to find out.

1352
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,560
I have no idea what it is.

1353
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
You...

1354
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Poggers.

1355
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,560
When your wife's boyfriend lets you sleep past 8 p.m.

1356
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,560
That's the top definition.

1357
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
Wife's boyfriend.

1358
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,560
You have five more minutes.

1359
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Me.

1360
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,560
Poggers.

1361
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,560
Poggers, a Twitch emote that may only be seen

1362
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,560
if you have better TTV installed.

1363
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,560
I thought it was maybe a reference to Pogs.

1364
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,560
Remember Pogs?

1365
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,560
It is a reference to Pogs.

1366
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,560
I didn't know this.

1367
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,560
Yeah, it's the face.

1368
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,560
It's the face of that guy going,

1369
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,560
Oh!

1370
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,560
I see.

1371
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,560
I guess it's from...

1372
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,560
He said...

1373
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,560
I guess he was playing Pogs or something

1374
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,560
and he said he was the Pogchamp

1375
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,560
and he called himself the Pogchamp.

1376
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,560
So Poggers and Pogchamp are basically the same thing.

1377
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,560
I see.

1378
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,560
But anyway, he's an Asian guy

1379
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,560
so this thread is this girl saying like

1380
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:58,560
actually, non-POC people using Poggers

1381
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,560
in moments of non-POC joy or enthusiasm

1382
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,560
has a deep racial connotations

1383
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,560
and is extremely racist and problematic.

1384
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,560
And obviously, this attracts a huge amount of like

1385
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,560
oh my god, I can't believe this is the discourse now.

1386
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,560
I literally just thought that Poggers

1387
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,560
was like common British slang.

1388
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,560
No, no, it's Twitch slang.

1389
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,560
What British phrase am I confusing this with?

1390
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,560
Like, don't they have a word that's just like

1391
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
oh, Poggers!

1392
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,560
That's how I've been reading it the entire time.

1393
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,560
I had no idea it was like a new meme.

1394
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,560
I mean, it's not super new.

1395
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,560
It's only British if you have a top hat and a monocle.

1396
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,560
That's so fucking funny.

1397
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,560
Anyway, the post turned out to be fucking bait.

1398
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,560
It wasn't even real so I got fucking baited.

1399
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,560
I got had.

1400
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,560
Would you say you're a master baiter?

1401
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:58,560
No, I was masterly baited though, which is better

1402
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,560
by a cute Asian girl on Twitter.

1403
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,560
And I say she's cute because she had a little cartoon avatar

1404
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,560
and that's cute.

1405
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,560
That's good enough for me.

1406
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,560
And her pronouns were she, her, and she's bisexual

1407
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,560
so that's pretty hot as well.

1408
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:18,560
So I guess it was originally there was PogChamp

1409
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,560
which is the Asian dude and he's the older emote

1410
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,560
and then recently there's a Pepe the Frog version of his face

1411
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,560
which is Poggers.

1412
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:37,560
I think Poggers is just like the colloquial version of PogChamp.

1413
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Well, I'm just going by what nobody or me is telling me.

1414
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
I'm sure there's a Pepe Poggers.

1415
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,560
Well, when it comes to all the new internet lingo

1416
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,560
I'm kind of a boomer in that regard.

1417
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,560
I don't keep up with all this stuff.

1418
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:54,560
When your wife's boyfriend lets you sleep at 8 p.m.

1419
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,560
That's a pretty good joke.

1420
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,560
It's Poggers, Poggers know you only see this fucking,

1421
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,560
let me see this rare Pepe.

1422
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Rare Pepe.

1423
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,560
No, I don't know.

1424
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,560
No, I don't know.

1425
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,560
There's a Pepe for everything.

1426
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,560
I love that boy.

1427
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,560
Love that boy.

1428
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,560
He's back.

1429
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,560
We've taken him back.

1430
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,560
We've reclaimed him.

1431
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,560
He's wholesome again.

1432
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,560
Did you see the fucking shit?

1433
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,560
Listen, I'll keep talking about fucking Twitter drama

1434
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,560
until someone stops me.

1435
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,560
Did you see the thing about Movie Bob and Lindsay Ellis?

1436
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,560
No, but I might be interested.

1437
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:41,560
I know Lindsay Ellis, but I don't know Movie Bob.

1438
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,560
Gamers Tavern, Movie Bob.

1439
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,560
Oh God, I fucking...

1440
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:52,560
He's a big fat dude who talks about movies and video games.

1441
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,560
As a movie critic, I don't think he's terrible.

1442
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,560
Yeah, that's fine.

1443
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,560
I used to be a big fan of The Big Picture.

1444
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,560
There's so much more to him.

1445
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,560
There's so much more to Movie Bob than just that.

1446
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,560
The way he presents his whole personality

1447
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,560
on the outside of his videos is just arrogant

1448
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:18,560
and cunt-y about being a liberal and stuff.

1449
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,560
It's that...

1450
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:25,560
Yeah, he's a certain brand of smug liberal.

1451
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,560
He is self-described.

1452
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,560
He's salty about being bullied as a kid.

1453
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,560
He hates the people that remind him

1454
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,560
of the people that bullied him in high school.

1455
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,560
He's the big part of his fucking brand.

1456
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,560
He's very much like...

1457
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,560
Not in these words, but he's very much like

1458
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,560
fuck-poor people, they vote Trump or whatever.

1459
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,560
He's that kind of lib.

1460
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,560
He is very...

1461
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,560
I mean, didn't DeVoo used to say

1462
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,560
that he was thinking of doing a lecture on the lore of...

1463
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,560
What was that fucking...

1464
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,560
Was it The Big Picture that had the skits?

1465
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,560
On which show?

1466
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,560
I know who DeVoo is now, but I don't know what you're talking about.

1467
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,560
Movie Bob skits were on his Game Overthinker show.

1468
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,560
Yeah, Game Overthinker.

1469
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,560
I don't know.

1470
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,560
The Game Overthinker skits were like...

1471
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Fucking terrible.

1472
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
Next level embarrassing.

1473
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,560
Unbelievably fucking bad.

1474
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,560
It was so bad.

1475
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,560
And he did them for years.

1476
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,560
There's like hundreds and hundreds of them.

1477
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,560
And he just kept doing it.

1478
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,560
And I remember people telling him,

1479
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,560
like, hey, you know, I like your movie criticism,

1480
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,560
but these fucking skits are cringe and embarrassing

1481
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,560
and I hate them.

1482
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,560
And he was just like, listen,

1483
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,560
they make the...

1484
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,560
Stop telling me, they make the show better.

1485
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,560
I'm not going to take them, even if everyone hates them.

1486
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,560
I'm going to keep doing them, because I like them

1487
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,560
and I think they make the show good.

1488
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:00,560
And it's like an even worse version

1489
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,560
of a guy with a glass of stuff.

1490
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,560
How like he'll have himself in like various costumes

1491
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,560
that all play like different roles.

1492
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,560
And it's like the version of him

1493
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,560
who is like a nostalgic 90s gamer

1494
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,560
and the version of him that is like an 80s,

1495
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,560
like Grimdark edgy comic character.

1496
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,560
Yeah, I think I know.

1497
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,560
I know what you're talking about.

1498
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,560
Yeah.

1499
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,560
Okay, okay.

1500
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,560
Anyway, enough.

1501
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,560
The point is, there was something,

1502
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,560
it was this backstory.

1503
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,560
Peter Coffin, who I assume you guys don't know,

1504
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,560
but Peter Coffin is a lefty YouTuber.

1505
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,560
He's a big fucking communist.

1506
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,560
And he's kind of, people criticize and people say

1507
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,560
he's like too much of a class reductionist

1508
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,560
and he's like, no, I'm not that stupid, blah, blah, blah.

1509
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,560
So he's...

1510
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,560
So there's tension there.

1511
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,560
There's tension between him and so-called bread tube, right?

1512
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1513
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,560
And he...

1514
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,560
Peter Coffin?

1515
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,560
Okay.

1516
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,560
Does he live in a coffin?

1517
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,560
Yeah.

1518
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,560
He lives in...

1519
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,560
Sorry, go on.

1520
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,560
So he...

1521
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,560
So, and one day, he fucking snaps.

1522
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,560
He becomes the joker.

1523
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,560
He gets joker-fied.

1524
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,560
He can't take it anymore.

1525
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,560
And he's like, I'm sick and tired of these bougie libs

1526
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,560
telling people to vote for Biden.

1527
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:22,560
And he blocks all of what he perceives as bread tube, right?

1528
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,560
He blocks Big Joel, and he blocks Jack Sane,

1529
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,560
and he blocks Sean, and he blocks H-Bomber Guy,

1530
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,560
and he blocks Lindsay Ellis,

1531
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,560
and he blocks Jenny Nicholson,

1532
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,560
and he blocks Thought Slime.

1533
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,560
Thought Slime of all people.

1534
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
Unbelievable.

1535
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,560
So he does this, and everyone's like, hmm,

1536
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,560
what a fucking nerd.

1537
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,560
Everyone's like...

1538
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,560
Like, no one's like...

1539
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,560
Everyone's like, that's pretty dumb.

1540
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,560
That's pretty dumb move, like, stupid.

1541
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,560
And Lindsay Ellis makes a comment in it somewhere

1542
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,560
about how, like, he seems to think that it's a big cabal

1543
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,560
when actually it's just people that are friends with each other

1544
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,560
to talk, right?

1545
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,560
It's like...

1546
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,560
And Bob replies.

1547
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,560
Movie Bob replies like, hmm, I know, right?

1548
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,560
We're all just pals.

1549
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,560
And he posts a picture of him and Lindsay,

1550
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,560
and they're like, he's got her arm around her,

1551
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,560
and he's giving her thumbs up, and they're smiling.

1552
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,560
And Lindsay replies like, dude,

1553
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,560
this is really inappropriate and creepy.

1554
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,560
Don't post this.

1555
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,560
The fact that we took a picture together at a con years ago

1556
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,560
doesn't mean we're friends.

1557
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,560
I've soft-blocked you, like, six times,

1558
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,560
and you haven't got the hint.

1559
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,560
Please leave me alone.

1560
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,560
And Bob is utterly destroyed.

1561
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,560
It's like...

1562
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,560
It's like the greatest...

1563
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,560
It's like the most horrendous,

1564
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,560
like a second-hand embarrassment moment

1565
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,560
of the...

1566
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,560
So far of the millennium, I would say.

1567
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,560
Bob's reality shatters.

1568
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,560
He, too, like Peter Coffin before him,

1569
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,560
now must go full Joker mode

1570
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,560
and simply watch the world burn.

1571
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,560
There's nothing left for him.

1572
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,560
I don't know. This was all over the place.

1573
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,560
You guys are listening totally non-plus.

1574
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,560
This doesn't mean anything to you,

1575
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,560
but to me, this was Earth Shattering.

1576
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,560
I'm glad you had a good time.

1577
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,560
I had a great fucking time.

1578
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,560
Fucking Movie Bob.

1579
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,560
Fucking Movie Bob, man.

1580
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,560
That was a huge supporter.

1581
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,560
Also, Lindsay Ellis isn't Bread Tube. She's a fucking lib.

1582
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,560
But that's a discussion for another day.

1583
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,560
Mo was a huge supporter of enjoying

1584
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,560
the suffering and misery of others.

1585
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,560
Yeah.

1586
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,560
I think there's a word for that.

1587
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,560
I heard Bread Tube, then I started reading other comments

1588
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,560
and lost track of what was being said.

1589
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,560
It wasn't even about that.

1590
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,560
The point was about Bob is a fucking loser who got owned.

1591
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,560
I'm not surprised by that.

1592
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,560
I don't think that would happen.

1593
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,560
Bob is a loser who gets owned.

1594
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,560
I mean, it's just like, he's a big YouTuber.

1595
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,560
Like, he is.

1596
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,560
As much as people find him, he's a big YouTuber.

1597
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,560
Lindsay is a big YouTuber.

1598
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,560
And generally, these people try to maintain

1599
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,560
a sort of professional courtesy to each other.

1600
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,560
So it's like, imagine what it must take

1601
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,560
to make one of them just straight up tell the other one,

1602
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,560
like, don't even reply to my fucking posts, weirdo.

1603
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,560
Imagine how much it must have been building to come to that.

1604
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:23,560
I mean, I really do think the stereotype

1605
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:30,560
of anyone who's a guy who's way too much of an ally

1606
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:36,560
is probably because they just can't make friends

1607
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,560
or manage connections.

1608
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,560
They have to...

1609
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,560
It's like the overexertion

1610
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,560
to constantly insist upon how righteous you are.

1611
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,560
It's like, all right.

1612
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,560
Are you assuming that everyone else isn't accepting

1613
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,560
or feeling this way?

1614
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,560
I don't know.

1615
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,560
It feels like movie Bob is somebody who thinks

1616
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,560
that almost everyone in the world is evil and out to get him.

1617
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,560
And that's only the case because of the fact

1618
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,560
that he treats everybody that way.

1619
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,560
He's very...

1620
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,560
There's a tweet of his that says,

1621
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,560
like, oh, I think it was after Trump got elected.

1622
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,560
He tweeted, like, don't you ever tell me that I'm wrong

1623
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,560
to look down my nose at the rest of humanity or something.

1624
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,560
She's a race.

1625
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,560
It sounds like school shooter talks, bro.

1626
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,560
It is.

1627
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,560
For real, it is.

1628
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,560
Saying that sort of thing is cool when it's ironic.

1629
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,560
It would be funny if it was ironic.

1630
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,560
But unfortunately, it's movie Bob.

1631
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,560
You know that he can't do that.

1632
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,560
You know, I was surprised.

1633
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,560
I checked Lindsey's channel recently

1634
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,560
because I haven't seen anything from her for a while.

1635
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,560
And I was really astonished.

1636
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,560
She has, I think, over a million subscribers now.

1637
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,560
Did she cross a million?

1638
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,560
I think, I'm not sure.

1639
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,560
That's a lot of fucking subscribers.

1640
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,560
Wait, let me...

1641
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,560
Because I first found out...

1642
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,560
Back when I first found out about her,

1643
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,560
she was much, much smaller.

1644
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:18,560
Well, I mean, she was the fucking nostalgia chick, right?

1645
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,560
Yeah, that's when I first learned of her.

1646
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,560
Ben, why don't we have a million subscribers?

1647
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,560
You and I.

1648
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,560
Um...

1649
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,560
I don't...

1650
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,560
Well, I can...

1651
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,560
I mean, I can answer that question in several ways,

1652
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,560
but I do find it...

1653
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,560
I do find it interesting to see, like,

1654
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,560
who blows up and why.

1655
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,560
And, like...

1656
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,560
It seems like it's always people who...

1657
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,560
I don't know, it sounds stupid.

1658
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,560
Talk about current things when they come out.

1659
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,560
I was gonna say, it's always people who, like, you've been hearing about.

1660
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,560
I don't know, it's people that you've heard about before

1661
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,560
and you've heard about them for a long time, right?

1662
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,560
And you've heard about them over and over again.

1663
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,560
And then you finally get around to checking them out

1664
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,560
and you're like, oh, yeah, okay.

1665
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,560
They have a million...

1666
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,560
And I don't know, I feel like it happens through a combination...

1667
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,560
A combination of, like, successful algorithm usage,

1668
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,560
as well as...

1669
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,560
I mean, connections are definitely a part of it, right?

1670
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,560
Like, Lindsay is, like, a well-connected person.

1671
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,560
Yeah, but the thing is,

1672
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,560
not everybody who's been doing it for a long time

1673
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,560
gets that super popular because...

1674
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,560
Obviously.

1675
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,560
Before the Game Grumps, there used to be a ton of let's players

1676
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,560
that were kind of slightly popular,

1677
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,560
but many of them now are, like, nobodies.

1678
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,560
They have...

1679
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,560
You know, they barely have any subscribers anymore.

1680
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,560
And...

1681
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,560
I got?

1682
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,560
You know, like...

1683
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,560
I got into it.

1684
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,560
Yeah, yeah.

1685
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,560
I think one of the only old pre-Game Grumps let's players

1686
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,560
that actually managed to get over a million subscribers

1687
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,560
is Shaga Konroy.

1688
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,560
I don't know if you're familiar with him.

1689
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,560
I know of him.

1690
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,560
But most of his friends who know him and work with him,

1691
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,560
they still don't even have, like, 500,000 subscribers.

1692
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,560
And they're, like, struggling now.

1693
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,560
I mean...

1694
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,560
Is it struggling to have 500,000 subscribers?

1695
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,560
Well, some of them are as low as 200,000.

1696
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,560
I mean, you say that, but that's a lot of subscribers.

1697
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,560
Well, the view count matters more.

1698
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,560
Like, I saw...

1699
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,560
Oh, yeah.

1700
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,560
There was one let's player.

1701
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,560
I think his name is Josh Jepsen.

1702
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,560
You know, way back in 2006.

1703
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,560
He still does stuff now.

1704
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,560
His channel has 200,000 subscribers,

1705
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,560
but I think he only gets, like, 2,000 views per video.

1706
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,560
Sometimes less.

1707
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,560
It's...

1708
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,560
Yeah, it's...

1709
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,560
You know what it is?

1710
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,560
It's like a centralization thing.

1711
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,560
Like, the big people attract all the attention,

1712
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,560
and people gravitate towards the biggest people.

1713
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,560
And, yeah, it sucks up attention.

1714
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,560
I'm sure that's part of it.

1715
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,560
But it does seem a little unfair to see an old YouTuber

1716
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,560
who's been doing it for, like, 10 years,

1717
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,560
and they just never really...

1718
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,560
They never blow up.

1719
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,560
I was arguing on Twitter about this.

1720
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,560
I think it was, like, two weeks ago.

1721
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,560
Most people agreed with me, but a couple people didn't.

1722
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,560
And I said that, like...

1723
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,560
Basically, it was, like, PewDiePie.

1724
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,560
Like, in my opinion, there's almost nothing special

1725
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,560
about PewDiePie.

1726
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,560
PewDiePie is proof that, like, success is basically random.

1727
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,560
Like, yeah, he did do all the right things to succeed.

1728
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,560
He's very good-looking.

1729
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,560
Okay, okay, okay.

1730
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,560
Well, okay, when I say that it's random,

1731
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,560
it's not that I mean that, like,

1732
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,560
he has nothing going for him but succeeded anyway, no.

1733
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,560
He has things going for him.

1734
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,560
They're just pretty common things

1735
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,560
that you would think that lots of people could do.

1736
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,560
Yeah, he's pretty good-looking, he's fairly charismatic,

1737
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,560
and he, you know, posted the right way.

1738
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,560
He did the things the algorithm demanded of him, right?

1739
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,560
He did all the right things.

1740
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,560
But so do tons of people.

1741
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,560
Tons of other people have all those things

1742
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,560
that have done it the right way,

1743
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,560
but they're not PewDiePie,

1744
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,560
and there's basically no reason for it except, like,

1745
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,560
just complete random chance.

1746
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,560
I think people underestimate how important it is

1747
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,560
to just, like, have big hits and multiples of them

1748
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:42,560
because your real hit videos are so much more important

1749
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,560
than any other ones.

1750
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,560
Like, if you have a video that gets 10 million views,

1751
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,560
10 videos that get 1 million views, you know?

1752
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,560
Like, but not only that,

1753
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,560
it is more likely to continue getting views

1754
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,560
in those other ones because, like,

1755
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,560
there is kind of a snowballing effect with YouTube

1756
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,560
where, like, my biggest video,

1757
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,560
the one that has, like, 3.5 million views,

1758
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,560
continues to this day to be my best performing video

1759
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,560
month after month, like...

1760
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,560
I mean, same with me in the Sonichi lecture.

1761
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,560
Yeah, it's just the way the algorithm works.

1762
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,560
It just says, like, people already liked this,

1763
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,560
or people will like this.

1764
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,560
That's kind of the trouble of the algorithm.

1765
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,560
It just promotes what's already popular.

1766
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,560
Right.

1767
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,560
So I think with PewDiePie,

1768
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,560
like, I remember distinctly

1769
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,560
that when he was first blowing up,

1770
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,560
I remember, like, certain thumbnails

1771
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,560
that would continually be in my sidebar.

1772
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,560
So it wasn't, like, every PewDiePie video blew up.

1773
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,560
It's like, he probably had, like, 10 or so videos

1774
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,560
during his big upswing period

1775
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,560
that were, like, huge tentpole,

1776
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,560
you know, tens of millions of view videos

1777
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,560
that were, like, every subscriber he earned

1778
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,560
was from those.

1779
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,560
And any other video he has

1780
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,560
is being watched by people who are already subscribed.

1781
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,560
But, like, if the video doesn't escape your audience,

1782
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,560
then it just isn't adding to your subscribers.

1783
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,560
So, like, any time a channel blows up in sub-count,

1784
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,560
it's always because they're writing off of some video

1785
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,560
that, like, really took off,

1786
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,560
and usually, in the modern cold environment,

1787
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,560
if that video is not, like, at least 20 minutes long,

1788
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,560
it's not gonna leave enough of an impression on people

1789
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,560
to, like, subscribe, you know?

1790
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,560
Like...

1791
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,560
Yeah.

1792
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,560
There's always most...

1793
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,560
Yeah, most YouTubers will have, like,

1794
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,560
they'll have, like, one video that does really well,

1795
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,560
and that's, like, the start of their career,

1796
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,560
pretty much.

1797
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
More or less.

1798
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,560
Like, I remember, I remember Jack...

1799
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,560
Jack Saints was, um,

1800
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,560
he did the video about how, like, Sky...

1801
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,560
The, like...

1802
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,560
The, like, straight-to-video Disney movie Sky High

1803
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,560
is, like, fascist propaganda,

1804
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,560
and that one went pretty viral,

1805
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,560
and I think that was, like, he went from, like,

1806
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,560
in the 10Ks to, like, 100K or something for that,

1807
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,560
and that was, like, okay, now we're doing it.

1808
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,560
Um, and I, you know...

1809
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,560
Uh, you know, I got the...

1810
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,560
The only reason anyone watches my channel at all

1811
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,560
is because of the Sonichu lecture,

1812
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,560
which, just for whatever reason,

1813
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,560
cracked a million, which is, like...

1814
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,560
Yeah.

1815
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,560
Uh, good job.

1816
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,560
Uh...

1817
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,560
Yeah, you're totally right about that.

1818
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,560
You were talking about, like, uh,

1819
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
people who, like, fall off,

1820
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,560
and, uh, have you heard of the YouTuber Danny Mullen?

1821
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,560
Uh...

1822
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,560
No.

1823
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,560
Uh, so he's a pretty funny and good, uh,

1824
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,560
like, man on the street,

1825
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,560
like, basically him and his team

1826
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
will just, like, bomb into a town

1827
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,560
and just start messing with people

1828
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,560
and, like, seeing what happens,

1829
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,560
but he is a very good way of making people like him.

1830
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,560
Like, even though he fucks with people,

1831
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,560
he will turn it around so that he's the good guy,

1832
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,560
or, like, just make people enjoy the experience.

1833
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,560
It's a, it's pretty fun to watch,

1834
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,560
but, um, he did a video about a YouTuber

1835
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,560
who had been, like, an early influence on him,

1836
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,560
this guy who was called, uh...

1837
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,560
Oh, let's see here, what was it?

1838
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,560
It's...

1839
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,560
This reminds me of, uh, I think Kassim G,

1840
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,560
have you heard of him?

1841
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,560
Over...

1842
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,560
No.

1843
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,560
Sorry, Overboard Humor was the name of the guy who he goes

1844
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,560
to hang out with this dude who was, like,

1845
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,560
an early prank star on YouTube

1846
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,560
who had, like, a millions of subs,

1847
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,560
made a shitload of money,

1848
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,560
spent it all, uh,

1849
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,560
you know, fucked up his life, got into drugs,

1850
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,560
and now he lives in a tent in the woods,

1851
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,560
and, uh, just, like...

1852
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Jesus.

1853
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,560
Basically goes around asking people for drugs

1854
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,560
so he can sell the drugs,

1855
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,560
because people are more likely to give you drugs than money.

1856
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,560
And, uh, yeah.

1857
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,560
So, Danny Mullen, who is currently successful,

1858
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,560
and obviously, like, fascinated with this guy,

1859
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,560
like, goes out to spend 24 hours with him

1860
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,560
and, like, uh, try to, you know, help him out.

1861
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,560
Like, he goes into it, like,

1862
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,560
I don't know if I'm gonna hate this guy or like this guy

1863
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,560
or, like, want to help him out by the end,

1864
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,560
and in the end, he does kind of find him to be, like,

1865
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,560
kind of pathetic and try to give him a little bit of help, but, uh...

1866
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,560
Wait, how long is this video? Is it, like, a documentary?

1867
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,560
Yeah, it's, like, 45 minutes long.

1868
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,560
I might check that out. That sounds pretty cool.

1869
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,560
Yeah, I think you'll like that one,

1870
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,560
and Danny Mullen's pretty fun in general,

1871
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,560
but that video in particular...

1872
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,560
You know, uh, success in all walks of life

1873
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,560
has a combination of what you do

1874
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,560
and also luck being in the right place and right time,

1875
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,560
and how much luck and how much skill

1876
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,560
depends on what the market is

1877
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,560
and what you're doing exactly.

1878
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,560
Mm-hmm.

1879
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,560
And I think on YouTube, uh, there's a lot of...

1880
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,560
There's probably more luck involved than in other, uh, fields,

1881
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,560
but it's not all luck, obviously.

1882
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
Yeah.

1883
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,560
Oh, and YouTube and I think so.

1884
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,560
Like, in some fields, like, it's like if you...

1885
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,560
If you put the work in, you'll eventually get something.

1886
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,560
On the Internet, you might...

1887
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,560
You might never get anywhere,

1888
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,560
and it might not even be your fault.

1889
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,560
Yeah, that's true.

1890
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,560
But there are some fields that are almost 100%

1891
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,560
based on your abilities.

1892
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:07,560
Like, if you become a professional fighting game player,

1893
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,560
like a professional Smash player,

1894
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,560
then how much money you make...

1895
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Well, to a certain extent, yes.

1896
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:18,560
I would argue that, like,

1897
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,560
it's not like just anyone could become,

1898
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,560
like, a top-level fighting game player,

1899
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,560
no matter how much they practiced.

1900
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,560
I think you do kind of have to just have, like,

1901
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,560
the natural ability to be, like, a top-level player at that.

1902
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,560
So I think, to a certain extent,

1903
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,560
you have to be lucky for that, too.

1904
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,560
Yeah.

1905
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,560
But, I mean, you do have to, like, perform.

1906
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,560
I think, um...

1907
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,560
But what I mean is how much money you make in that field

1908
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:48,560
is directly influenced by how you perform,

1909
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,560
your performance.

1910
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,560
There's no, like...

1911
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,560
Sure, yeah, it's true.

1912
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,560
Outside of your genetics, there's no luck element to that.

1913
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,560
It's not like you can, like, win tons of tournaments,

1914
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,560
but, like, get screwed over by the algorithm or whatever.

1915
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,560
Yeah, exactly.

1916
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,560
Well, the thing about it with doing creative work

1917
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,560
is that, like, quality is irrelevant to success.

1918
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,560
It's about what people want.

1919
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,560
And what people want, like, they often don't know that.

1920
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,560
Like, you can't just ask people what they want

1921
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,560
and then give them that.

1922
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,560
You have to create something that they will then realize

1923
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,560
that they want.

1924
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,560
But, like, that can be...

1925
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,560
Like, there's a...

1926
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,560
On one level, you have to be able to identify...

1927
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,560
It sounds so easy.

1928
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,560
Well, there's identifying what people want,

1929
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,560
which I don't find to be that difficult.

1930
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,560
Like, I think that if you just observe, like,

1931
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,560
what people are already enjoying

1932
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,560
and then just iterate on that in, like, a, you know, logical way,

1933
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,560
it's not terribly difficult to come up with something people will want.

1934
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,560
It's, do you actually want to do that?

1935
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,560
Like...

1936
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,560
Yeah.

1937
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,560
Most of the time, when people are doing creative work,

1938
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,560
it's more out of personal fulfillment

1939
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,560
and, like, trying to bridge the gap between, like,

1940
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,560
how can I make this fulfilling for me and the audience?

1941
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,560
That's the difficult part.

1942
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,560
Like, making something that just fulfills the audience,

1943
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,560
like, I think that a lot of the most successful directors

1944
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,560
who make, like, really big pop media,

1945
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,560
the reason they're able to do it

1946
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,560
is that they just sincerely want to entertain the audience.

1947
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,560
Like, they're like, I want to make the thing

1948
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,560
that's gonna make people go, whoa, the most!

1949
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,560
And, like, if that's the way you feel,

1950
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,560
then, like, you're perfect to do that kind of thing.

1951
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,560
Whereas if you're somebody who's like,

1952
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,560
I have to get this thing off of my chest

1953
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,560
and everybody needs to hear it,

1954
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,560
then it's like you're in a very difficult position.

1955
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,560
I think if you want to be, like, mainstream successful,

1956
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,560
you have to...

1957
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,560
Or it probably helps a lot to be someone who just, like,

1958
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,560
really, really enjoys, like, unironically,

1959
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,560
like, the kind of, like, you know...

1960
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,560
The kind of thing you're making.

1961
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,560
I mean, everybody kind of tries to make something

1962
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,560
that is close to what they themselves like, you know?

1963
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,560
Yeah, I think if you love, like, you know,

1964
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,560
really broad, kind of, like, not basic shit, I guess,

1965
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,560
you know, like, really, like, mass appeal shit,

1966
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,560
and you're like, oh, fuck yeah, this is cool.

1967
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
Even if I've seen it a hundred times before,

1968
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,560
but this is like a cool thing, too.

1969
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,560
I want to make something that's like this thing

1970
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,560
that everybody already likes because it's what I like.

1971
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,560
I mean, that's probably pretty good.

1972
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,560
Like, that's probably not going to hurt you.

1973
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,560
If what appeals to you is also what appeals to the masses.

1974
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,560
Yeah, that's a great decision.

1975
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,560
But if what appeals to you doesn't appeal to anyone else,

1976
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,560
then you're kind of out of luck.

1977
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,560
Totally boned. Totally fucking boned.

1978
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,560
That's the position I've been in, unfortunately,

1979
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,560
is everything that I want to copy is already not popular, so...

1980
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,560
I'm like...

1981
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,560
Every time I think... I don't know, I can't...

1982
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,560
I'm going to funk. I'm going to funk lately,

1983
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:51,560
because I'm like, everything that I might think...

1984
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,560
I can't even imagine, like, finding an idea interesting.

1985
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,560
Do you know what I mean?

1986
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,560
Yeah, I can't even imagine, like, thinking of something.

1987
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,560
Like, say I thought and being like,

1988
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,560
man, I should, like, make a project.

1989
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,560
I should, like, see this idea through to fulfillment,

1990
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,560
because it would be like, it would add something to the world,

1991
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,560
or to culture, or people would be interested in it.

1992
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,560
Everything that I think of, it's like,

1993
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,560
okay, well, I thought of it. It's old.

1994
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,560
Like, if I thought of it, everybody must know it already.

1995
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,560
Everybody must be familiar with it.

1996
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,560
Um, it's boring.

1997
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,560
This is a problem of the lockdown,

1998
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,560
making it so you're not out there talking to people,

1999
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,560
finding out what they want from you.

2000
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,560
I think it's true to...

2001
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,560
I think it's true that lockdown and me not social...

2002
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,560
I think socializing with people is a big source of, like,

2003
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,560
is a big source of inspiration that I don't have anymore,

2004
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,560
and it's making me depressed.

2005
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,560
Um, and I...

2006
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,560
I think when you're talking and you're bouncing ideas off people,

2007
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,560
like new people, meeting people and stuff,

2008
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,560
then you're like, you have a flow of ideas that is, like, stimulating,

2009
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,560
and you might have a fucking...

2010
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,560
Your fucking neurons might occasionally fire and have a brain blast

2011
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,560
because of all the random stimulation you're providing with them.

2012
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,560
Not so for me now.

2013
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,560
Now, my neurons are fucking dead.

2014
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,560
They're all fucking dead. They're asleep.

2015
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,560
And I killed them.

2016
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,560
They went to sleep, and then I killed them in their sleep

2017
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,560
by drinking too much fucking barefoot bubbly...

2018
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,560
Yeah, I was gonna say, you probably shouldn't have gotten blackout drunk so many times.

2019
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,560
Well, it's too late. I fucking did.

2020
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,560
But, uh, that's why, uh, a lot of sitcoms...

2021
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,560
A lot of sitcoms, they have, like, writer's rooms,

2022
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,560
and, uh, there's a lot of writers in there,

2023
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,560
and they bounce ideas off of each other.

2024
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,560
It helps you talk to other people when you're trying to come up with stuff.

2025
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,560
Yeah, Ben, write a sitcom.

2026
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,560
Okay.

2027
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,560
You know, that's actually...

2028
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,560
I kind of wish I could do that.

2029
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,560
You would be an amazing sitcom character,

2030
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,560
so I think you would write a good sitcom also.

2031
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:55,560
I bet I could write for a sitcom pretty well.

2032
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,560
But, like, I say that.

2033
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,560
But imagine, imagining, like, okay, I have that idea,

2034
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,560
and I'm like, yeah, I bet, yeah, I could probably be a sitcom writer.

2035
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,560
But then I'm like, what if I, like, how stupid would it be

2036
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,560
if I were to, like, what would I even do?

2037
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,560
Like, I go, and I'm like, hmm, I know.

2038
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,560
I'll sit down at my computer, and I'll open up fucking Microsoft Word,

2039
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:25,560
and I will, like, type, like, uh, uh, you know, script,

2040
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,560
and go down and start, like, writing,

2041
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,560
and start, like, coming up with, like, dialogue

2042
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,560
to just, like, hmm, what's this, what's this,

2043
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,560
like, I can't fucking do that.

2044
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,560
That's so cringe. That's so stupid.

2045
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,560
I would never do such a thing.

2046
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,560
I don't think it's that bad. That's what I do for, uh, my stuff.

2047
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,560
That sounds horrible. I would die.

2048
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,560
I would die of shame if I even...

2049
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,560
Well, then just draw it as a storyboard

2050
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,560
and then take the pictures out.

2051
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,560
That also makes me want to die of shame.

2052
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,560
Drawing a comic? Imagine.

2053
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,560
No, a storyboard. Do it, like, originally.

2054
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,560
That's just a comic. It's just the same thing.

2055
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,560
Yeah, but, like, layout. Do it with the storyboard layout.

2056
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,560
No, no, no. I would have to have ideas.

2057
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,560
I would have to have ideas to that,

2058
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,560
and having ideas is fucking embarrassing.

2059
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,560
It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.

2060
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,560
You should kill yourself if you even consider it.

2061
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,560
I am going to kill myself right now.

2062
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,560
Do we have anything else we want to talk about,

2063
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,560
or should we go to voicemail?

2064
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,560
I don't know. How long have we been going?

2065
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,560
An hour and a half?

2066
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,560
An hour and a half, yeah.

2067
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,560
Okay.

2068
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,560
Well, um, yeah, we can go to voicemail.

2069
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,560
Gamer, Gamer Statham, do you want to listen to voicemails with us?

2070
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,560
Or is there anything else you wanted to talk about

2071
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,560
before we move on?

2072
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,560
Uh, yeah, we can go to voicemails if you want.

2073
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,560
I mean, it's, uh, your show.

2074
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,560
That's true.

2075
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,560
It's, it's, it's, uh, okay.

2076
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,560
Okay, okay, let me, let me get them.

2077
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,560
I got them here.

2078
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,560
Uh, I will post them in the general.

2079
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,560
Uh, we will go in order.

2080
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,560
This first one, here we go.

2081
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,560
This first one is called Bob misses the samurai.

2082
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,560
Uh, let's start it in three, two, one, go.

2083
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,560
Okay.

2084
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,560
I'm sure this will be horribly irrelevant.

2085
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,560
Yeah.

2086
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,560
By the time this goes in, but I just want to say that I fucking hate

2087
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,560
all of the conversations about circumcision.

2088
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,560
It's super boring.

2089
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,560
Yeah, I agree.

2090
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,560
That's why every single episode I say it's over.

2091
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,560
Stop asking me about it.

2092
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,560
It's super boring to know that I might be missing out on

2093
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:28,560
extra cool feelings as a bisexual man.

2094
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,560
It's so much easier to suck circumcised dick.

2095
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:36,560
It's just, it's just, it's just easier as.

2096
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,560
Huh.

2097
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,560
Hey man.

2098
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,560
Don't see why or how.

2099
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,560
As.

2100
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Maybe he looks like.

2101
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,560
My ex has a kid and his circumcision was botched

2102
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,560
and that fucking sucks.

2103
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,560
Yeah.

2104
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,560
His dick looks super weird.

2105
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,560
I guess my point is doctors learn how to do circumcisions

2106
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,560
and just do it to everyone.

2107
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,560
Fuck this whole conversation.

2108
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,560
Wait, so this guy's pro circumcision.

2109
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,560
I think so.

2110
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,560
He just seemed to think it was easier to suck a circumcised

2111
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:07,560
dick, which I don't understand how or why that would be the case.

2112
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,560
I don't really get it.

2113
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,560
I was hoping he'd elaborate, but he didn't.

2114
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,560
What is.

2115
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,560
I don't need another Colin, buddy.

2116
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,560
I'm a little curious.

2117
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,560
I'm a little curious.

2118
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,560
He says it was a botched circumcision.

2119
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,560
Now the dick looks weird.

2120
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,560
I kind of want to know why, like what exactly is weird about it?

2121
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,560
Well, I'm pretty, pretty against this myself.

2122
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,560
This circumcision.

2123
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,560
Yeah.

2124
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,560
And I think it's, unless you have a really good reason to do it,

2125
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,560
it's better not to do it.

2126
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,560
People have, people have gotten frustrated with me for being

2127
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,560
like ambivalent about it.

2128
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,560
But sometimes you got to pick a side, Ben.

2129
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,560
I guess I do.

2130
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,560
All right.

2131
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,560
Because we can't talk about circumcision anymore.

2132
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,560
We had to draw a hard line in the same.

2133
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,560
You're right.

2134
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,560
You're right.

2135
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,560
You're right.

2136
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
I made the rules and I got to stick to them.

2137
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,560
Okay.

2138
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,560
This one is called on your recording and release schedule.

2139
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,560
Three, two, one, go.

2140
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,560
Hey.

2141
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,560
So last episode, two episodes ago actually at this point,

2142
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,560
there were like two, maybe three voicemails that were all like based

2143
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,560
on like story of like running storylines and people's characters

2144
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:27,560
who fucked up and weren't up to date on the lore because of how

2145
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:33,560
far apart the podcast is recorded and then released between

2146
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,560
like, like that gap to miss out.

2147
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,560
I don't know.

2148
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:42,560
Which is a weird thing.

2149
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,560
I feel like if you release the podcast a lot sooner,

2150
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,560
like maybe like two or three days instead of like five days after.

2151
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,560
No.

2152
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,560
Okay.

2153
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,560
Yeah.

2154
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,560
Okay.

2155
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,560
That's all right.

2156
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,560
Yeah.

2157
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,560
Oh, if you just, if you just worked harder, if you just worked your editor

2158
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,560
harder, the problem would be solved.

2159
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:04,560
So the podcast was shorter and had less parts moving parts and had fewer

2160
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,560
things to edit it.

2161
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,560
I don't know.

2162
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,560
I don't understand.

2163
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,560
It takes days.

2164
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,560
Looks like you're getting some.

2165
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,560
We don't pay our editor a living wage.

2166
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,560
In a, in a, in a perfect world.

2167
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,560
Yeah.

2168
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,560
The podcast would come out immediately, but it's not going to.

2169
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,560
So, you know, you're just going to have to deal with it.

2170
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,560
Listen, I would advise, I would advise people that want to make PCP

2171
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:28,560
Canon just sent, just wait until the episode comes out on Friday.

2172
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,560
Just send your, just send your voicemail over the weekend.

2173
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,560
I don't understand anybody who thinks that their problem with the show

2174
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,560
will be solved through a voicemail rather than through sending us money.

2175
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,560
Like sending us money is the only way to say you want these to come out

2176
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,560
faster, more money.

2177
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,560
It's the only way that's going to happen.

2178
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,560
You have to agree with that.

2179
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,560
If we were making enough money to release this like, remember back in

2180
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,560
the pony days when we used to fucking get our videos out within like two

2181
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,560
hours of the show airing, we have like a fully edited analysis video,

2182
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,560
like two or three hours after the show aired.

2183
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,560
Why? Because it made a lot of money.

2184
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,560
Because it made the money.

2185
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:09,560
Just put your request on the money itself, write it down on the dollars.

2186
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,560
Yes, put the money in the hand and all your dreams will come true.

2187
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:20,560
If enough patrons, if enough patrons unionize and say we will,

2188
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,560
we demand, we demand certain things of the show.

2189
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,560
I mean, you have power.

2190
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,560
You just need to have solidarity.

2191
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,560
You just need to have solidarity and wield it against us.

2192
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,560
Okay.

2193
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,560
The next one is called the Irish samurai.

2194
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,560
And there it is.

2195
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,560
And three, two, one, go.

2196
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,560
Konnichiwa.

2197
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,560
This is the Irish samurai.

2198
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,560
Oh my God.

2199
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:48,560
I heard from agent E.

2200
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:55,560
A very, very scary, very scary, but very professional lady.

2201
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,560
That Benos sent Osan might know something about my fallen brother,

2202
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,560
the Kawasaki samurai.

2203
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,560
Samurai, Samma.

2204
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:10,560
I heard that he died and that it's your fault that you refused a birthday cake.

2205
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
And then he killed himself.

2206
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,560
This can't be forgiven, Benosan.

2207
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:20,560
I say, if you want to make men's, you should give agent E. your brain.

2208
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,560
Yes, I know about that.

2209
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,560
She told me that too.

2210
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,560
You see, the new podcast ain't out yet, but I heard she told me.

2211
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,560
And that's what she wants from you.

2212
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,560
She wants your brain.

2213
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,560
I know.

2214
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,560
I would say give her your brain.

2215
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,560
It's the only way to make amends at this point.

2216
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,560
You're a fucking idiot if you don't give her your brain.

2217
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,560
I'm sorry if this is a little disjointed.

2218
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:42,560
I usually write a script.

2219
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:43,560
Okay, that's it.

2220
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,560
Yeah.

2221
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,560
No, no, no.

2222
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:46,560
This time.

2223
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,560
Good try.

2224
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,560
Good try.

2225
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,560
I didn't understand any of that.

2226
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,560
I mean, you know, that's just an opinion.

2227
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,560
It's just an opinion.

2228
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,560
But what's your case?

2229
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,560
But what's your actual case?

2230
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,560
You have no argument.

2231
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,560
You have no argument.

2232
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,560
That's not an argument.

2233
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,560
Not an argument.

2234
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,560
Where are the facts and logic?

2235
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,560
They're nowhere.

2236
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,560
Okay.

2237
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,560
Next one is called cross.

2238
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,560
Wait, hold on.

2239
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,560
Here it is.

2240
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,560
It's called cross.

2241
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,560
My two cents on no nut November.

2242
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,560
Three, two, one, go.

2243
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:15,560
I do know that November partially for the memes, but also because I find that it really helps

2244
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,560
my creative motivation.

2245
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,560
Like I did it two years ago.

2246
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:23,560
And during those 30 days, my skill at drawing anatomy got noticeably better because my thought

2247
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,560
process was like, I'm not going to jack off to porn.

2248
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,560
So I guess I'll just draw it.

2249
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:29,560
And then I drew just endless number of tits.

2250
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,560
By the way, team mommy milkers for the win.

2251
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,560
And then last year, a similar thing happened with my writing ability because I started

2252
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,560
writing smut instead of reading it.

2253
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,560
And then again, like I noticeably improved.

2254
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:46,560
Plus it's just like a unique experience to have, like to see how you'd react, not masturbating

2255
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,560
for the entire month.

2256
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:53,560
And then like if you're successful, it's nice to know that you could like just not like

2257
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,560
stop masturbating just like right now.

2258
01:32:55,560 --> 01:33:00,560
If you wanted to, not that like masturbating is bad at all though.

2259
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,560
I don't know.

2260
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,560
Hopefully that makes sense.

2261
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,560
I'm really tired.

2262
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,560
Sure.

2263
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,560
Sure.

2264
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:06,560
I mean, okay.

2265
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,560
I totally get that like if you don't, if you're not masturbating, you might be more productive.

2266
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,560
That makes perfect sense to me.

2267
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,560
What's weird about it is that like.

2268
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,560
Why would you then, why would you draw like porn?

2269
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,560
Why would you write porn?

2270
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:27,560
Wouldn't, to me like not masturbating would just make me do like, I would do anything but

2271
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,560
that.

2272
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,560
Yeah, that is pretty weird.

2273
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,560
Yeah.

2274
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,560
I would think the same.

2275
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,560
That would make it worse.

2276
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,560
That would make it worse.

2277
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,560
That would make no November worse.

2278
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,560
It would make it way worse.

2279
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,560
I agree.

2280
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,560
Yeah.

2281
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,560
I don't, that's, I'm like 80% with you, but that last 20% is fucking.

2282
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:49,560
Although at the same time, the hardest part about drawing porn is that you, you know,

2283
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,560
get too horny and have to go jack off.

2284
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:55,560
So maybe if you can't, then it makes it easier.

2285
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,560
I don't, I don't draw porn.

2286
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,560
So I don't really know.

2287
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:04,560
But like most of like the porn artists that I like follow on the internet, I, most of

2288
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,560
them seem to say that they don't, they don't jack off to their own shit, which is like.

2289
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,560
Self control.

2290
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,560
Which is weird to me.

2291
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,560
Self control, I guess.

2292
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,560
Because it's hot.

2293
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,560
And I, because it's stuff I think is hot.

2294
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:18,560
And I'm like, man, I bet they're fucking jacking it because I sure am.

2295
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,560
But they're like, nah, they're like, nah.

2296
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,560
I mean, maybe you have to have that.

2297
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,560
This is, this is just a paycheck for me.

2298
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,560
Maybe you have to have that to be able to draw porn.

2299
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:28,560
Maybe you do.

2300
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,560
Maybe you do.

2301
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,560
All right.

2302
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,560
Okay.

2303
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:39,560
The next one is, wait, did we just listen to this one?

2304
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,560
I'm lost.

2305
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,560
Okay.

2306
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:47,560
This one is called fraud is real.

2307
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,560
Okay.

2308
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,560
Three, two, one, go.

2309
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:57,560
Wikipedia changed the definition of president elect.

2310
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,560
Yeah.

2311
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,560
They changed it.

2312
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:04,560
Before it said something like, oh, the president select elect isn't selected.

2313
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,560
If it's disputed, you know, they're not like considered the president elect, but they

2314
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,560
changed it.

2315
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:12,560
They removed that line.

2316
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,560
Weird.

2317
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,560
Weird.

2318
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,560
A lot of voter fraud stuff.

2319
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,560
I mean, I don't care what we're doing.

2320
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,560
We don't care anymore.

2321
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,560
Can we move on to the next one?

2322
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,560
Yeah, this guy, honestly, this guy sucks.

2323
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,560
Boring.

2324
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:29,560
This guy, this guy used to be funny, but now he just like makes these like, unironic,

2325
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,560
like, he's like, unironic.

2326
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,560
What's the word?

2327
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,560
Political.

2328
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:38,560
Like, yeah, like, like right wing, like political diatribe voicemails and like, it's pretty,

2329
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,560
it's pretty tedious, honestly.

2330
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,560
Next.

2331
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:46,560
Next one is, it all comes full circle.

2332
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,560
There.

2333
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,560
Three, two, one, go.

2334
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:55,560
I used to watch TVP that stopped because I lost interest in ponies.

2335
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:58,560
I then independently discovered best guy over in Ben St.

2336
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,560
And only after getting into the PCP did I realize that they were TVP.

2337
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,560
Pretty wild.

2338
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,560
That'd be like if I didn't know give and take and hypocrite were the same person.

2339
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:10,560
That's happened.

2340
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,560
That's what happened to me initially.

2341
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,560
Yeah.

2342
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,560
I mean, that's like talking about that.

2343
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:18,560
Wait, wait, that's not, wait, sorry.

2344
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,560
Did I miss it?

2345
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,560
Did you say that you felt that you watched TVP?

2346
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:26,560
No, he did not know that hippo and given were the same person.

2347
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,560
Oh, okay.

2348
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,560
Okay.

2349
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,560
Did you watch TVP?

2350
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,560
That would be fucking crazy.

2351
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,560
That's funny.

2352
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,560
That's a weird comparison.

2353
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,560
If I was going to say, I would make the comparison.

2354
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,560
I would be like, that would be like if I was watching Game Grumps and I didn't realize that

2355
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:45,560
Aaron was the, was the sequelitis guy or something.

2356
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,560
I don't know.

2357
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:50,560
It's, it's funny to use, it's funny to use like hippo for that.

2358
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,560
I did it again.

2359
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:52,560
To use Gib for that.

2360
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,560
Cause like, I don't know.

2361
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:58,560
Gib is, Gib is as small and insignificant as the rest of us.

2362
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:07,560
Well, on a small side note, I didn't actually mention this last time, but the early Game

2363
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:12,560
Grumps with John are huge inspiration to my channel actually.

2364
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:17,560
I mean, same to this whole podcast for sure.

2365
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:22,560
I liked, I liked, yeah, I liked, I liked the John episodes.

2366
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,560
I liked the, I liked the, I liked the early Danny episodes.

2367
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,560
I don't listen to them anymore.

2368
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:28,560
I don't like John anymore.

2369
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,560
I think John Tron is a fucking asshole.

2370
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,560
I haven't listened to them in a while either, but I think the John episodes are still pretty good.

2371
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,560
I actually still go back to them for inspiration.

2372
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:40,560
I believe that.

2373
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:41,560
I believe it.

2374
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,560
I haven't watched, I don't know.

2375
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,560
I like, I like try, I had a, I had a period where I binged Game Grumps for a while.

2376
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,560
It was, I was pretty, it was a time I was pretty depressed.

2377
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,560
Probably, probably the second most depressed I've ever been in my life.

2378
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,560
Second only two right now.

2379
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,560
And it was, it was a dark time.

2380
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,560
So I think it kind of makes me like not want to revisit that.

2381
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,560
Are you the most depressed you've ever been in your life right now, Ben?

2382
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:09,560
Yeah, probably.

2383
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:11,560
Yeah, probably getting there.

2384
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:15,560
You don't seem, you don't seem the most depressed I've ever seen you.

2385
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,560
Is, is, have you, have you seen, have you seen me more depressed?

2386
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,560
Like visibly, like noticeably?

2387
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,560
Well, I don't see you lately.

2388
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,560
So maybe that's, maybe that's part of the problem.

2389
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,560
I don't know what you physically look like.

2390
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:32,560
I don't know, I thought every year, doesn't it make sense every year would be the most

2391
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,560
depressing year of your life because you're older?

2392
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:37,560
I don't.

2393
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,560
It wasn't working that way for me.

2394
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,560
My adulthood has been better than my teen years.

2395
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,560
So for a long time, I felt like every year was getting better.

2396
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,560
I mean, I actually, I mean, I look, I look fine.

2397
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,560
I look, I look fantastic.

2398
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,560
I posted a selfie on Twitter today and there's everybody, everybody loves me.

2399
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,560
I'm lifting again.

2400
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:57,560
I'm lifting again.

2401
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,560
That's pretty good.

2402
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,560
But on the inside, I'm crying.

2403
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:06,560
2020 is definitely worse in every conceivable way than 2019 for me, which is probably true

2404
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,560
for almost everybody on planet Earth.

2405
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,560
But I feel like I did not get it as bad as most people did.

2406
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:18,560
Like for, for most of the coronavirus going on, I was feeling like, wow, I feel like this

2407
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:21,560
has had less of an effect on me than almost anybody else.

2408
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:26,560
Eventually the effects, you know, the, just the long-term effects of the entire world

2409
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:30,560
being shit for like months started to finally take its toll.

2410
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,560
But, you know, I'm hopeful for the future.

2411
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,560
I feel like, I don't feel like I got, I do.

2412
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:43,560
I feel similarly in that coronavirus directly affected me less than most people.

2413
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:52,560
So, but it, but I feel worse in a way because I feel like I personally failed to use the

2414
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,560
coronavirus time effectively.

2415
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,560
I feel like I fucking fucked it up and squandered it.

2416
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,560
I don't think there was anything you could do.

2417
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,560
I think, I think we were all fucked.

2418
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,560
I could, okay.

2419
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,560
I just think I could have done a lot more with the time.

2420
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,560
I feel like I could have, I could have gotten my shit done a lot faster and I could have

2421
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,560
been doing other stuff.

2422
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,560
I could have, it makes, I feel like I could have been streaming these past several months

2423
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,560
and it probably would have been a good time to do so.

2424
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,560
I just, nobody has any money to give you.

2425
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,560
Like everybody's fucking broke.

2426
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,560
The world is fucking broke.

2427
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,560
Like we're, people aren't even working.

2428
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,560
Well, it's not much longer.

2429
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:28,560
This is going to last.

2430
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,560
So you might still have plenty of time.

2431
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,560
Yeah.

2432
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,560
I guess you're right.

2433
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,560
I guess like, you know, it's true.

2434
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:40,560
I could, I could, I could try and turn it around at any time, but like, I mean, I probably

2435
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,560
just should try to do that.

2436
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,560
Yeah.

2437
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,560
Well, let's listen to the next voice mail.

2438
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,560
Yeah.

2439
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,560
Move on with our own lives.

2440
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:52,560
Next one is Agent E. Three, two, one, go.

2441
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,560
Konnichiwa.

2442
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,560
Oh no.

2443
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,560
Benosento san.

2444
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:56,560
Sorry.

2445
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,560
It's more lore.

2446
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:04,560
This is Agent E. I heard that you were contacted by my, we'll say colleagues.

2447
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,560
Irish Samurai, yes.

2448
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,560
The Irish Samurai.

2449
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:07,560
True.

2450
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:11,560
As you can no doubt tell, there are many moving pieces in this story.

2451
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,560
There's too many, Frank.

2452
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,560
And it is your story, Ben.

2453
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:20,560
And so you must decide, are you what's protagonist or it's antagonist?

2454
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,560
Will you do what is right?

2455
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,560
No.

2456
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,560
Give us your unique brain.

2457
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,560
I will never do what is right.

2458
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,560
We must be used force to acquire it.

2459
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,560
Stop asking for my brain.

2460
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,560
You play, you play Last of Us.

2461
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,560
You may be wondering.

2462
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,560
Don't give them the brain.

2463
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,560
The memories of the Samurai are false?

2464
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,560
Then who was calling for two and a half months?

2465
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,560
Why does he seem to remember you?

2466
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,560
And who's dead body do we have?

2467
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,560
And to be honest, those are all fair questions.

2468
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,560
Doesn't make any fucking sense come to think of it.

2469
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,560
The Samurai both exist and not exist.

2470
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,560
You got to just pull the trigger.

2471
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,560
Oh my God.

2472
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,560
No.

2473
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,560
What?

2474
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,560
But how?

2475
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,560
The Samurai is.

2476
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,560
Konnichiwa.

2477
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,560
Oh.

2478
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,560
Okay.

2479
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:04,560
Yes.

2480
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,560
The Necronomicon.

2481
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:06,560
Yes.

2482
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:07,560
Of course.

2483
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:08,560
Fuck you.

2484
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:09,560
The red herring.

2485
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:14,560
It was Chekov's Necronomicon has come back in full effect.

2486
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,560
You are next.

2487
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,560
Until next time.

2488
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,560
Sayonara.

2489
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:19,560
He said it.

2490
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,560
He said it.

2491
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,560
He's back, everyone.

2492
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,560
He's back.

2493
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,560
Feels good.

2494
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,560
Feels good.

2495
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,560
Fantastic.

2496
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,560
Fantastic.

2497
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,560
All right.

2498
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:31,560
Next voice.

2499
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,560
The wheels keep on turning.

2500
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,560
The cogs of time.

2501
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,560
Wheel of fate is turning.

2502
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,560
Duel one.

2503
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,560
Endlessly.

2504
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,560
Is that guilty gear?

2505
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,560
Yeah.

2506
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:41,560
Nice.

2507
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:42,560
Probably.

2508
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,560
Next one is.

2509
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,560
Actually guilty gear is heaven or hell.

2510
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:46,560
Duel one.

2511
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,560
Blazblue is the wheel.

2512
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,560
Blazblue.

2513
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:50,560
Okay.

2514
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,560
I knew it was something.

2515
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,560
It was one of those.

2516
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,560
One of those weeb games.

2517
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,560
Next one is called.

2518
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,560
One of those weeb games.

2519
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,560
Next one is called.

2520
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:00,560
The end.

2521
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,560
Three.

2522
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,560
Two.

2523
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:03,560
One.

2524
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,560
Go.

2525
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,560
Konnichiwa.

2526
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,560
Samurai-sama.

2527
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:07,560
Get a rustle.

2528
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,560
On way to Benno.

2529
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,560
At Begiru shop.

2530
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:12,560
With a logo.

2531
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,560
Look like Gochi.

2532
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,560
Not know where go from.

2533
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:18,560
Goldilocks.

2534
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,560
You go forward.

2535
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:20,560
Who are you?

2536
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,560
You go forward and take a ride.

2537
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,560
Steady.

2538
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,560
Steady.

2539
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,560
Steady.

2540
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,560
Steady.

2541
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,560
Steady.

2542
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,560
Agent E told me to wait outside.

2543
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,560
And from outside I heard everything.

2544
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,560
And.

2545
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,560
Well you get where this is going right?

2546
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,560
No.

2547
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,560
Anyway.

2548
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,560
Look.

2549
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:38,560
I don't.

2550
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,560
We wrapping it up right here.

2551
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,560
Phase two had grander.

2552
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,560
Grander design.

2553
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,560
We was going to team up.

2554
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,560
Samurai was going to jump through realities.

2555
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,560
Agent E would be the villain.

2556
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:50,560
All of that.

2557
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,560
But.

2558
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,560
Cassidy.

2559
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,560
She got more important things to be worried about riding it.

2560
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,560
So.

2561
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,560
We cutting it right here.

2562
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,560
Alright.

2563
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:03,560
I'm going to go kill that Irish guy.

2564
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:06,560
Then I will be the only loose end.

2565
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,560
And then I will have to die.

2566
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,560
Like.

2567
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,560
You ever seen Terminator 2?

2568
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,560
What a shame.

2569
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,560
You know what I'm talking about.

2570
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:14,560
It's not a rule.

2571
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,560
We'll miss you Mr. T.

2572
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,560
So.

2573
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,560
Anyway.

2574
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,560
Look.

2575
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,560
I've already.

2576
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,560
I've always wanted to see this.

2577
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,560
It's you.

2578
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,560
Nick's.

2579
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,560
Sayonara.

2580
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,560
Tab.

2581
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,560
Wait.

2582
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,560
I fucked it up.

2583
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,560
And I haven't got enough time to crack myself.

2584
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:31,560
God damn it.

2585
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:32,560
No.

2586
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,560
No.

2587
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,560
The curtain closes on a grand drama.

2588
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,560
Wait a minute.

2589
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,560
You've seen play out.

2590
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,560
I forgot to mention this before.

2591
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:38,560
Before our very eyes.

2592
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:41,560
I forgot to mention this but the last guy said he was Irish.

2593
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,560
But he didn't have an Irish accent.

2594
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,560
No.

2595
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:46,560
The other guy.

2596
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,560
It was the other guy.

2597
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,560
The first guy was the Irish guy.

2598
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,560
Yeah.

2599
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,560
The Irish and Japanese I guess.

2600
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:53,560
He had like a double accent.

2601
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:54,560
It was fucked up.

2602
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,560
That's weird.

2603
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,560
Fuck.

2604
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,560
It was fucked up.

2605
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,560
Next.

2606
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,560
Next one.

2607
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,560
Next one.

2608
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,560
The greatest utility known to man.

2609
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,560
Three.

2610
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,560
Two.

2611
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:06,560
One.

2612
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,560
Go.

2613
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:08,560
So you're jacking off.

2614
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,560
Yeah.

2615
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:10,560
And you come.

2616
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,560
And you're like oh I have to clean up all this cum.

2617
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,560
But.

2618
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,560
So much right.

2619
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,560
You can do.

2620
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,560
Is you can.

2621
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,560
If you have a foreskin you can pinch it closed and it contains the cum.

2622
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,560
Then you can just drop it off.

2623
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,560
The nearest.

2624
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,560
The nearest safe deposit box.

2625
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,560
And then rinse off your day.

2626
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,560
The nearest jar with a rarity.

2627
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:28,560
Yeah.

2628
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,560
There you go.

2629
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,560
It's useful.

2630
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,560
Then you know there's utility to it.

2631
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,560
Everyone should have one.

2632
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:34,560
Die.

2633
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:35,560
Even women.

2634
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:36,560
Die.

2635
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,560
Die.

2636
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:38,560
Die.

2637
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,560
Die.

2638
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,560
Just die.

2639
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,560
Just fucking die.

2640
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,560
That's useful advice.

2641
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,560
It's not.

2642
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:44,560
It's not.

2643
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:45,560
Not if you're a fucking.

2644
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:46,560
Not if you're a fucking goi.

2645
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,560
Wait.

2646
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:48,560
No.

2647
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:49,560
Gois are uncircumcised.

2648
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:51,560
Not if you're a fucking.

2649
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,560
Not if you're one of God's chosen.

2650
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,560

01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,560
See you later.

2667
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,560

2668
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,560
I love you.

2669
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,320
Thanks for the voicemail, Liam. Love you. Love you, baby

2670
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,020
I would sample that and maybe in another context. It might be

2671
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,560
I fucking dare you I dare you to do it

2672
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:34,440
Next one is called how to delete bad voice call and I and a lot a lot of us could could stand

2673
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,920

2674
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,920
Oh

2675
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:46,480
Okay, thanks for your thanks for your call Jesus Christ

2676
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:56,800
Next one ran. Oh wait, I got a fucking posted here. Next one is called random PCP prisoner

2677
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,080
Oh, God, I'm one of them three two one go

2678
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,000
Hey, just have a simple question of any of you ever write a book called the intergame of tennis

2679
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,640
It's about how to approve of things and it's pretty good cause you touched on some of the ideas

2680
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:12,200
I highly recommend it if you have read it, and if you have what are your takes after reading it?

2681
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,160
I literally got better at everything I did and it's literally great

2682
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:18,420
I'm a missionary in Africa building churches instead of giving you food

2683
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,720
Die anyway. Oh God, I just I'm the one leaving the city voice mouth now

2684
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:31,000
So my only choice is to wrap a sheet around my neck with Jeffrey Epstein myself looking lean forward at produce 500 pounds of pressure

2685
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:34,800
Just by leaning forward really fast and ending my life. So I'm gonna do that now

2686
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:41,040
That's the that's that's the trick. Um, I feel like there's two types of PCP voice mailers

2687
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:45,280
There's like the the ones who like do like the three types

2688
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:51,040
There's the ones who do a character the ones who sound like they're drunk and the ones who sound like munchie

2689
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:55,840
Was which one was that was a munchie one just like the non

2690
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:04,200
They're trying to cram everything into one complete sentence 136 second burst of words and energy

2691
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:10,760
She she she she she really tries to keep hers concise and it's and I appreciate it as well

2692
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,600
I mean the munchie like ones are the best ones because they talk fast

2693
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:19,560
You know what that value that thanks for valuing. Thanks for valuing our time

2694
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:24,160
But I have not read the inner art of tennis. Is that what it was called?

2695
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,240
But I'm glad that it made you have a rather other

2696
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:34,080
African missionary thanks. Thanks for valuing our time, but we don't value your time

2697
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,640
No, good get fucked

2698
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:42,560
Next one is called imagine being gay three two one go

2699
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:51,520
Those sweet heads still crying cause the dead left

2700
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,960
Baby come back

2701
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,080
You can

2702
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,200
I

2703
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,080
Baby come back

2704
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:22,440
Imagines just imagine being gay that gay. I can't do it. I can't either next one

2705
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,120
Next one is called yet another voicemail about four of skin. God

2706
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:34,080
Have to play it. I do three. I have to at least hear them out three two one go

2707
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:40,920
The upsides are negligible the downsides are negligible. It's not really doesn't matter

2708
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:45,120
I don't understand like so many people have such strong feelings about this. Okay. Yes. I agree

2709
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:49,200
Wait, what do you mean? It's not now for me the downsides are negligible if they fuck it up

2710
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,200
I probably want to get my kids circumcised. Oh

2711
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:57,640
Yeah, if they bought this procedure and like it's just a weird cultural thing that owned by states in like a handful of

2712
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,880
That being said, okay, yeah, yeah, we've been over no long time

2713
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:09,920
Um, I don't understand why people feel the need to throw in their two cents and then say the same thing that everyone else already said

2714
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,280
I

2715
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:15,760
I agree like like the first couple weeks. I attributed it to like

2716
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,640
To it's the same as the last guy

2717
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,800
The first couple the first couple weeks

2718
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,680
I attributed it to people not having heard the latest episode because they hadn't come out

2719
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:28,120
But now it's been like five fucking weeks and like you should know better

2720
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,920
You should really know better than to send another voicemail about circumcision

2721
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,000
Speaking of which the next one is called

2722
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:43,560
The next one is called cross not an argument for or against circumcision three two one go

2723
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:47,320
There is a medical condition called fimosis, which is

2724
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:58,640
We've talked about it. I've mentioned fimosis in discussing circumcision you fucking moron cross

2725
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:04,600
You're in the fucking voice jail. You're in fucking voice jail. I'm saying it. You're done. You're dead. You're out

2726
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:08,520

2727
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:10,360
Okay

2728
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:15,200
Next one is called Biden COVID shoplifting Digi trans now

2729
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:22,520
All right three two one go

2730
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,720
Wait a second

2731
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,720
if Nate is gone and

2732
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,480
Mesh is gone and Monty is gone and

2733
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:33,760
Ben is a cock

2734
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,320
Then who's driving the PCT?

2735
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:42,920
Also, it is scientifically proven that it only comes as a circumcision

2736
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,520
if the ball such

2737
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,640
Well, I'm convinced

2738
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,320
All right

2739
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:03,920
Next one is called mother's basement

2740
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,240
three two one go

2741
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,480
Hi, I'm Mozilla Fennigan and I

2742
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:19,920
This is my application for the replacement to be

2743
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:24,080
Goofy or whatever the fuck his name is

2744
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:29,000
So I yeah, I hear you're looking for a replacement. So let me tell you why I'm the guy for the job

2745
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,960
All right, so I annula I analyzed anime openings on my YouTube channel

2746
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,320
No, don't look for it

2747
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,160
Don't look for my channel don't go there and find out that I don't have like two videos about anime

2748
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:39,280
I think that I don't make videos anymore. That's what I love

2749
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,680
I just like talking about

2750
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:46,000
And just like just like mr. G off I also come from reddit in fact

2751
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,920
I'm currently part of a podcast called the our anime podcast. I know the base name

2752
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,000
Although now he's talking like three times faster than Jeff's game

2753
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,640
But whatever fuck crunch roll we're sponsored by hide-eye and we shove it in our audience's faces at every opportunity

2754
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:01,640
She's awesome to know that they can get a 30-day free trial at hide-eye.com

2755
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:07,640
So LPs are actually like you watch cool anime like Tomica market and they did the best to complete the identical anime and

2756
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:10,120
I mean my own basement

2757
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:14,240
I mean some my mother's basement, but like he doesn't even live in the basement anymore. So fuck him

2758
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,240
I win this argument and

2759
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,280
There are a couple things I don't have you know

2760
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:21,480
I don't have an ethot gf with fake boobs, but you know, maybe some day

2761
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:32,640
Next one is called also mother's basement. I can't wait three two one go. I wasn't fucking done. I wasn't

2762
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:38,680
Mentioned the best part which is that

2763
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,440
Just like

2764
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:46,960
I don't even got you up to the podcast, you know like I don't even have to be on the fucking podcast

2765
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,720
You can just be like hey remember remember that guy who was on the podcast one time, which I have but on the podcast

2766
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:57,840
Fucking you fucking got me fucking got me Mozilla. Fuck fuck off. Fuck you

2767
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,480
But well well played

2768
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,840
Don't ever fucking talk to me or my son

2769
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,600
Next one is called I got COVID

2770
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:15,080
I think this might be someone in the comments of the last episode said they had COVID

2771
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:22,040
Which is they said they can't tell it's mate smell or taste anything pretty fucked up

2772
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,840
Well, let's let's hear three two one go

2773
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:32,240
So just to give you guys some background. I am a college freshman. I take a COVID test every week

2774
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,240
I wear a mask. I do what I got to do

2775
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:40,360
So to start the story, I'm hanging out with some friends playing some super smash bros as you do

2776
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,360
Once suddenly this kid gets a phone call

2777
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:49,360
Saying that he tested positive for COVID. I'm just sitting here thinking fuck. This means I have COVID too

2778
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:53,880
Like I had just ripped his bond 30 minutes ago. Yeah, I'm gonna have a sip of my water

2779
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:58,560
So I probably have COVID like this is wild. I'm gonna have to buy the shirt, right?

2780
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,040
So I'm an artist I've recently decided to

2781
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,520
drop out of college and

2782
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Maybe go to art school

2783
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,800
It's a good idea bad idea, you don't have to be taught you just

2784
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:22,960
Anyway, love the show. Love you guys

2785
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
This voicemail wasn't even about COVID

2786
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:29,600
No voicemail was just should I drop out of school? I don't fucking know

2787
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,920
First of all, I have an idea for you guys do drop out of school, but don't go to art school. I have an idea for your shirt

2788
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:41,000
Uh, what about what about the shirt? You should modify the shirt the COVID shirt you have to say

2789
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,560
I have COVID and then under it say I'm the reason people are dying

2790
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:50,000
You mean combined combined the two yeah into a into a single

2791
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:54,640
Into a single more powerful. It's a high power. Yeah, exactly

2792
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,560
Just buy both shirts

2793
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,400
Cut them in half and then like and stitch them onto each other and stitch them together

2794
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,800
So it's one on the front one will be more artful that way

2795
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:08,920
It'll be you put your own little you get more pranks little twist

2796
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:15,920
People ask wow, where'd you get that shirt? You can say I didn't make this is a one-of-a-kind. Yeah, nobody has a shirt like this

2797
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:29,600
Next next one is called for Batman love joker jelly beaner three wait. Yeah, three two one go I

2798
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:37,680
Did it because I crave to be in your bat suit

2799
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:45,880
Rachel is the sweetest and kindest girl in Gotham. I

2800
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:53,120
Imagine she smells like oil drums and gunpowder

2801
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:58,520
Your mansion your girlfriend

2802
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,120
Your life I

2803
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:06,280
Want to be you I

2804
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,040
Crave to be you

2805
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:15,320
And for that brief instant I

2806
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:21,640
Was inside your back cave with your but

2807
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,360
In that moment I

2808
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,360
I was the bat man

2809
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:36,440
And it was beautiful

2810
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:41,880
Wow, okay

2811
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,880
You know that sounded awfully familiar

2812
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:49,320
Yeah, it sounded like Dan Harmon. I

2813
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:51,960
can't quite place it

2814
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:57,460
That was jelly beaner. I I think he was in jail. I don't remember. I don't know

2815
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:03,680
Fuck you jelly beaner. Good. Good production on that voicemail. Oh, I'll prove this

2816
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:11,680

Three two one go

2821
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:33,040
Three two one go

2822
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:37,000
I don't know what that means three two one go

2823
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
What a banger that was great

What uh...

2827
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:51,200
Next one.

2828
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,440
That's what I've been hearing the whole, all this time.

2829
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,920
Is that what I sound like?

2830
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:58,480
Just kidding, I know that's what I sound like.

2831
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:07,680
Next one is called, Why You Shouldn't Fap 3, 2, 1 go.

2832
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:13,660
Bang.

2833
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:16,300
Don't like was that do we just get

2834
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:19,400
skeeded on like yeah, they'll

2835
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,600
almost sounded like a they're

2836
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:22,320
almost sounded like a jesse

2837
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,560
bit. I wouldn't. I didn't

2838
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:28,500
consent. I didn't consent no.

2839
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,340
but unfortunately I've already

2840
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:32,840
filled my jail quota for the

2841
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:34,380
day so you're you're free to

2842
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,940
go Mr. censorship.

2843
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:40,420
Okay, oh god, last voicemail is called,

2844
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:44,820
I win the circumcision debate, so everyone shut the fuck up.

2845
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:48,220
We'll see about that, three, two, one, go.

2846
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:51,580
Long ago, I gave birth to a baby boy of my own.

2847
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:53,340
I didn't think about getting him circumcised,

2848
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:55,660
but the psychotic doctors insisted

2849
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:58,180
that they cut up his little peewee hermon.

2850
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:00,100
I wasn't comfortable with it, but the doctor said,

2851
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:02,220
he must lose his force gate.

2852
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:04,860
It's the only way he survives.

2853
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:05,700
It's true.

2854
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:07,860
My precious baby boy stopped sucking

2855
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:10,020
on my fat, milky, motherly titties,

2856
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:12,300
looked the doctor straight in the eye and said,

2857
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:14,380
doctor, I don't want to be circumcised.

2858
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:16,140
Studies have shown that there is little no improvement

2859
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:17,580
in a boy's health due to circumcision.

2860
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:19,820
This is practically child mutilation and nothing more.

2861
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:22,660
Please doctor, don't take my foreskin away.

2862
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:24,500
All the doctors in the room clapped

2863
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:26,180
and I was moved to tears.

2864
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:28,020
My son was not circumcised

2865
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:31,260
and then he lived a happy, healthy life.

2866
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:35,380
And that boy's name was Joe Biden.

2867
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,180
No!

2868
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,300
USA.

2869
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:42,500
I thought it was a wholesome story that it turned out

2870
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:45,780
to be a story about a child rapist.

2871
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:47,700
And it was hot too,

2872
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:49,900
because it had mommy milkers in it.

2873
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:52,180
That story had something for everyone.

2874
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:53,180
It was pretty good.

2875
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,900
I feel good now.

2876
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:57,380
You know what, I was depressed,

2877
02:00:57,380 --> 02:01:00,380
but now I can face the day again.

2878
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:03,060
It's turned it all around for me.

2879
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:05,060
I got a new lease on life.

2880
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:07,820
We made it, we made it to the end.

2881
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:10,580
We listened to every fucking voicemail.

2882
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:13,340
Again.

2883
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:14,500
We did it again.

2884
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,660
You know, I used to think you screamed these

2885
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:18,700
before you listened to them first.

2886
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:20,020
Someone used to.

2887
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:23,620
We used to, back when a fascist was in charge,

2888
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:25,660
but now it's anarchy, baby.

2889
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:28,780
Now the people decide.

2890
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:29,620
They see.

2891
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:34,620
Anyway, how are we feeling?

2892
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,700
Vibe check, vibe check.

2893
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:37,540
I'm feeling pretty good.

2894
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:39,180
Make it die.

2895
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:40,340
Make it die.

2896
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:42,020
I'm hungry.

2897
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:43,180

wall to wall while you watch and play video games.

2914
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:25,740

It's called Smart Ball for the Super Nintendo.

Smart Ball.

2936
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,420
