1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
We're recording, and maybe this will be in the episode, or maybe not.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,080
Yeah, who the fuck knows?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Who knows?

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
It's a mystery.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,560
I mean, if we sync later, you can still sync this all up too, so it's all good.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,640
If we sync like the Titanic later, this will be our lifeboat.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,920
That's every episode since Nate's left, am I right?

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
It was Nate's show.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,920
I mean, it's not the same.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,880
The Titanic is a happy ending, though, because the old lady got a locket or something.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,080
No, she threw it into the ocean like an idiot.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,320
Did she get it again?

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,200
They found it at the end, and they gave it to her, and she throws it into the ocean a

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
second time?

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Is that how it goes?

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
No, she throws it into the ocean and dies.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,840
Oh, well, I approve that.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,080
I've never seen it.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,160
That is not what happens at all.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,800
I mean, I don't remember.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,440
That could be what happens for all I know.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
No.

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,160
I just remember that Leo died.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
Yeah.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,680
Leo!

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,760
My beautiful bull.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,640
I saw a tweet, and it just got me.

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I don't know why.

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,160
It's just a picture of Trump yelling.

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,160
Just Trump yelling, and the text is, I've abandoned my child.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
I've abandoned my bull.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
It's like, yeah.

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
OK.

34
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
We've all been there.

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
My child.

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Dude, I'm watching, I watched like the town hall with Trump.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Oh, man, that was, that was hard to get through.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Oh, was that the one at the same time that Biden was doing one?

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Yeah.

40
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
The what?

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
I didn't check out either.

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah, I watched them both.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm a fucking scrub.

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,160
I mean, give me the highlights.

45
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
It's really hard to just highlight it.

46
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,160
The man is just so dumb, so fucking dumb.

47
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
It's really hard.

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Somebody said, did you see the thing about like Hunter Biden this week?

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,160
You know, I heard about it, but I haven't like watched anything.

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
I saw that image of him being like, I want to go to the anime realm.

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,160
And then Joe Biden gives him a bong and he smokes it and he sees anime.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Is that what happened?

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Whoa, I'm voting for Biden now.

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
That sounds awesome.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
That's what happened.

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Well, it's like, I guess Hunter is on the one hand some sort of like oil company

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,160
executive, but also like a complete fuck up crack head, like a literal crack head.

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Sounds about right.

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Like pictures of him smoking crack.

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,160
And, and I guess I didn't read them, but I guess some texts leaked of like Hunter.

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Like, you know, I get maybe check himself into rehab.

62
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,160
It is, you know, having a fucking crisis or whatever.

63
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
And it's like text between like Joe and Hunter.

64
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,160
And I guess Joe is like, you know, very much like, I love you no matter what, you know,

65
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I'll always love you son or whatever.

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
It's that kind of thing.

67
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,160
And it's like, I guess Rudy Giuliani leaked these thinking that they were like going

68
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
to be damning to him because, oh, your son's a crack head.

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,160
But like everyone I've seen is like, this is like really humanizing and, and is like,

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,160
even like the people that I follow that all hate Biden are like, even I felt something

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,160
for Biden in this, in this read in this shit.

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Right.

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Oh God, the man loves his son.

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
That's that.

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Yeah.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
That's going to go really well.

77
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Like, yeah, what a piece of shit loving his son despite his faults.

78
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Treating him like a human being.

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Wow.

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Amazing.

81
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Incredible.

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:47,160
That's almost like, like it wasn't leaked by someone who's trying to, you know, fuck

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
him up.

84
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
It was leaked.

85
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,160
It's Joe and Hunter Biden making fake, making fake text messages that then leaked to Rudy

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Giuliani so he can leak them.

87
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Like it was all a ploy.

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
It was a 40 chess move.

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Hey, some pretend that I love you for a minute.

90
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Okay.

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Yeah.

92
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Secretly by Joe got his own, his son addicted to crack intentionally so that stage this

93
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,160
whole, this whole long play and he, and he arranged for Bo to die of brain cancer too

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,160
so that he could have a humanizing, a tragic backstory.

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Oh my God.

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,160
And then when the cameras on Joe will kick his son like a puppy.

97
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Me.

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Meanwhile, like there's a, there's a thing from, from Trump.

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,660
There's like some, I guess, like when his first son was being born, I think Baron, that's

100
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,160
Baron's his first son, right?

101
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,160
They're like, no, we're like, Baron's his youngest son.

102
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Oh, no, no, no.

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Don.

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Don Jr.

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Is that?

106
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Or who?

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
No, he's not the oldest one.

108
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,460
I don't know who the oldest one is, but I guess when his first son was being born, his

109
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,760
wife wanted to, his wife wanted to name him Don Jr. and Trump said like, no, I don't name

110
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
him Don Jr.

111
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
What if he's a loser?

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,960
That's kind of based.

113
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
A little bit.

114
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Someone said like, you know, I don't like Biden, but this shit is really endearing.

115
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,460
And I, I responded like, Trump says stuff that endears me to him all the time, in that

116
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,360
it's like funny and it makes me laugh.

117
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,460
Like that gift of him making all the funny faces like, this is a funny man, this orange

118
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,860
man's still bad, but like, you know, anyway, this is all in like, you know, you can, we

119
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,160
can, we can, we can all, we can all be like, oh, oh, yeah, pretty, pretty good that Joe

120
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,860
loves his son, but also support Medicare for all, please.

121
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,860
Yeah.

122
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,860
He may care for his son, but that doesn't mean he'll care for us, the sons of America.

123
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,860
No.

124
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
Or we.

125
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
No, indeed.

126
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
What do you mean us?

127
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
Yeah.

128
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Fucking British man.

129
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
Yeah, who are you?

130
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Nothing.

131
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
Nothing.

132
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,860
Give his, give his trans America.

133
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
Trans American.

134
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,860
The trans Atlantic Railroad.

136
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Man, if you really want to like, fucking oppress yourself, become trans Atlantic, become an

137
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,860
American, you have to get, you have to, you have to give yourself COVID.

138
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,860
Like, sorry, that's just, that's just part of the process.

139
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Just the way it is.

140
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,860
Oh, look who's in the chat.

141
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
Look who finally is.

142
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Who's in the chat?

143
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
Finally decided to show up.

144
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Hey.

145
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
This is it.

146
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
This is epic.

147
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Oh my.

148
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Our guest is here.

149
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,860
We did it.

150
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Everything good.

151
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Fashionably late.

152
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
Well, 50 minutes.

153
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,860
What, what a bougie fucking.

154
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
50 minutes late, but it's okay.

155
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
So who are you guys?

157
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,860
Which one is, are you the did your bro guy?

158
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,860
No, he's not here right now.

159
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
We're the less important people.

160
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
Oh.

161
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,860
No, the better people.

162
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
No.

163
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
Is it me?

164
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,860
Which one's the, which one's the guy who did the, the, what's it called?

165
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,860
The guy with the gun and the pizza on his pants.

166
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Oh.

167
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Munchie.

168
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
That's Munchie.

169
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Munchie is, Munchie is dead.

170
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,860
You know, you know, guys, I've watched all of your things, all of your lectures, like

171
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,860
multiple times.

172
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
Excellent.

173
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,860
That's so based.

174
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
Oh, it's a bad one.

175
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
Even the one I did.

176
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Which one was that?

177
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,860
The brisco one.

178
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
What?

179
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,860
No, don't worry about that.

180
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
No.

181
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
Is that one I haven't watched yet?

182
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,860
I thought I watched all of them.

183
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
I guess.

184
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
It's relatively recently.

185
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,860
There was a couple of ones that came out a few months ago.

186
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Like, I gave dude one on, on, on brisco.

187
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,860
I did one on Animorphs, which went over pretty well.

188
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
Ben did a.

189
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
I did Chris Chan 102, which is.

190
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Oh yeah.

191
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,860
You haven't done that one yet.

192
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Still in my fucking editing bay.

193
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
You haven't?

194
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
A family year later.

195
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
You better do it soon.

196
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
I know.

197
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
Yeah.

198
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
It's time.

199
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,860
It's, it's well, it's long past time.

200
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,860
So there's the, the Deagle Nation one, the hottest guys in the universe one, and the

201
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,860
360 Sonata 101.

202
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,860
I can't believe that 360 one exists.

203
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
What a, what a bizarre artifact.

204
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,860
It's pretty great.

205
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,860
It's pretty interesting.

206
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
All right.

207
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,860
Let's.

208
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Hey, okay.

209
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,860
On the count of three is go one, two, three, and then we all say sync.

210
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,860
And just for our editor's sake, could you, when you sit, when you say sync, could you

211
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,860
like maybe wiggle your ears up?

212
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I guess.

213
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,860
So our editor can, can, can sync the footage with the audio.

214
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,860
So when, when we say sync, I raise my eyebrows like this.

215
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Yeah.

216
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
Yes.

217
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Yes.

218
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Okay.

219
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Cool.

220
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
We'll do it twice.

221
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Yeah.

222
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah.

223
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
We'll do it twice.

224
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,860
One, two, three.

225
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,860
Sync.

226
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,860
One, two, three.

227
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Sync.

228
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,860
Very, very nice.

229
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Okay.

230
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,860
I think, I think I have everything positioned so that it won't fuck up.

231
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,860
Let me just close my other windows here.

232
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,860
Yeah.

233
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
Okay.

234
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the pro crass snators podcast.

235
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
It's me.

236
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
It's me, Ben St.

237
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
We got Tom Oliver.

238
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
Hello.

239
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,860
We got Gibb and take.

240
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,860
And we got, and we got our guests today.

241
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:52,860
My friend, Mary weather, who is a, is a cat boy was like a big, a big deal famous guy.

242
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,860
It's like a, he's like a internet content.

243
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,860
He's like an internet, internet fucking mogul over here.

244
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
No.

245
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
Yes.

246
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
And also he's a Vtuber now.

247
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
That's correct.

248
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
And there he is.

249
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,860
Look at, look at him go.

250
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Yes.

251
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,860
He's like looking at that cat boy move.

252
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
It's, it's so sweet.

253
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
It's a dog boy.

254
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
I'm a dog.

255
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
I know.

256
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
I knew he was a dog.

257
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
Wolf.

258
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,860
What the fuck's a dog?

259
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,860
That's very much for having me on everyone.

260
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm a big fan.

261
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
I'm glad you're here.

262
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,860
I'm a big fan of the pro crass to pay us boys.

263
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
Same.

264
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
That's its name.

265
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,860
The perspirated boys podcast radio show.

266
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,860
I enjoy when you, I enjoyed when you did the lecture on that guy.

267
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,860
What's his name again?

268
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,860
Paul Western, Paul Western Chandler, that one.

269
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Yes.

270
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
Yeah.

271
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
Yeah.

272
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
Paul Joseph.

273
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
Paul Joseph.

274
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Yeah.

275
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
Paul Joseph Westerns.

276
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
Yeah.

277
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Chris, Chris Chan.

278
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,860
I think that's, I think that was probably the first thing we talked about, Mary.

279
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
I don't even remember.

280
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,860
I think, I think it was.

281
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,860
I think, I think it must, it must have been, we had, because I think around the time that

282
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,860
we started talking, you had not too recent, had not too long ago done an interview with

283
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
Chris on your other channel.

284
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,860
That's correct.

285
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,860
That's right.

286
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:38,860
And it was, I pride myself on that interview because what I was told afterwards is that

287
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
we didn't try to troll him.

288
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Oh, sorry.

289
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
Yeah.

290
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,860
Um, trolling.

291
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
Yeah.

292
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,860
There's, there's a certain strain.

293
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:55,860
There's a certain strain of a, have you, you've, you've interacted with, with Christine

294
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
on the, like on Twitter.

295
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,860
Yeah.

296
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
Right.

297
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,860
A few times.

298
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Do you, do you notice, do you notice like the tone of the replies that always happen?

299
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Yeah.

300
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,860
Uh, whenever she does anything on Twitter is so negative and gross.

301
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,860
It feels like very, um, it's so overdone honestly.

302
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:23,860
I don't think, I don't think anyone's really trolled Christine in a funny or creative way

303
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,860
for many years.

304
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Yeah.

305
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Uh, the, the, the like, it's, it's, it's, it's sad.

306
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
Like you, I don't know.

307
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,860
She'll just like do, says anything and like, everyone's just immediately jumping on it,

308
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,860
even if it's something unremarkable.

309
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
Fifteen, like teenagers or something.

310
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
I don't know.

311
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,860
We'll, we'll just be in there like, uh, Chris, shut up.

312
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,860
You're delusional.

313
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
Like nobody, nobody likes you.

314
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,860
Nobody believes in the dimensional merge to get a job.

315
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Yeah.

316
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,860
She'll just say like, I'm having a good day and everyone will go, no, you're not.

317
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,860
Oh, you, everyone hates you.

318
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,860
You're a terrible person.

319
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,860
It's very, it's very crazy.

320
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
All of the personal stuff.

321
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,860
The epitome of your reputation precedes you.

322
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,860
They always bring up like extremely personal stuff that only a complete lunatic would

323
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
know about.

324
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Like this, like stuff about his mother and stuff.

325
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,860
Like, why do you care so much?

326
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,860
You're just trying to be an asshole.

327
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
Yeah.

328
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
That's right.

329
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
That's true.

330
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
Sad, but true.

331
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:37,860
Um, Mary, um, you, uh, do you want to, I don't know, I, I make comics sometimes and you've

332
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,860
made like a million, I also do comics sometimes.

333
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,860
You've made like a million fucking comics.

334
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,860
You have like, I, I don't think I can list them all.

335
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Honestly.

336
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,860
I'm sorry.

337
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
That's okay.

338
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
That's all for you.

339
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
If you'd like me to.

340
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Yeah, sure.

341
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Go for it.

342
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,860
Winter moon, internet explore, everywhere and nowhere, stalker, stalker, my succubus

343
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,860
girlfriend, one million gold, fox girls are better, uh, console girls, meme girls and

344
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,860
spook man.

345
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Nice.

346
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,860
I think I've seen the, I didn't know about seven was the internet explorer one.

347
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,860
I think I've read that.

348
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
You might have.

349
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,860
Yeah.

350
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
Posted it everywhere.

351
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
Yeah.

352
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,460
I've read, I've read that one.

353
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,460
And I read, um, I read most of, wait, you did.

354
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Did you say crawling dreams?

355
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,460
Yeah.

356
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,460
I read most of crawling dreams because I like the girl with the big boobs.

357
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,460
You guys know it's illustrated by a girl.

358
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
Uh, no.

359
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,460
And, and she refuses.

360
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:46,460
She absolutely refuses to draw anything that does not have giant boobs.

361
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
Can you introduce me?

362
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,460
I can.

363
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,460
I'll send you a link afterwards.

364
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:59,460
So her name is, her name is Ushimi and she, uh, I have offered her to attempt to draw

365
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,460
a girl with a slightly less gigantic boobs.

366
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
Uh, and she has refused.

367
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
So yes.

368
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,460
If you, if I will, I will actually send her, I will, I will message her and I will say

369
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm a big fan of your.

370
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
I think you should.

371
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
I think that will make her very happy.

372
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
I will.

373
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Absolutely.

374
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
100%.

375
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Nothing would, nothing would make me.

376
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
It's funny.

377
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,460
Everyone thinks I'm the one asking for those characters to have gigantic boobs, but no.

378
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,460
In fact, I would prefer it if they didn't, every single one of them have gigantic boobs.

379
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,460
But, uh, yeah, every character that is not, that does not have giant boobs in that series

380
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,460
is drawn by the second artist we have on that series.

381
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,460
You're kidding.

382
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,460
I'm not even kidding.

383
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
No, she's, she's that serious about it.

384
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
She does not do the backgrounds.

385
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
She does not do the male characters.

386
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,460
She does not do anything that is not a giant titted female.

387
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,460
I respect the dedication to the craft.

388
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
Yeah.

389
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,460
Perfect.

390
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,460
Real goals right there.

391
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Nobody else.

392
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Nobody else fucking.

393
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,460
No, no, no, I'm going to do it.

394
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Nobody else fucking talks to you.

395
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
Yeah.

396
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:12,460
Um, actually I remember that lecture you did on the girl, the girl who did the, uh, the

397
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
coconut wish girl.

398
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
What, what was her name again?

399
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
Yeah.

400
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
Yeah.

401
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,460
Jennifer Diane right.

402
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,460
Yeah.

403
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
She's fantastic.

404
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,460
I had no idea about any of the things.

405
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,460
All I'd ever seen of us was that one coconut wish comic.

406
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
Um, yeah.

407
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
Yeah.

408
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
And introduced me to this whole world.

409
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,460
I had no clue about.

410
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
I was so amazed.

411
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,460
Honestly.

412
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,460
So I left a comment on that video.

413
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
I said, why?

414
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Mm hmm.

415
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,460
I was so amazed.

416
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,460
I was so flabbergasted.

417
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,460
Honestly.

418
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
How?

419
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,460
Uh huh.

420
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,860
I, I said in my comment, very specifically, why is the coconut wish girl better at writing

421
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,060
webcomics than me?

422
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,780
And I've been doing it for like nine years now.

423
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:58,980
And all of your viewers completely just dog piled me because you saw your awful, maybe

424
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,460
try putting some effort in, maybe you'll beat her then.

425
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,460
Oh, was it, was it that bad?

426
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,460
Wait, let me, let's, let's find, let's find, I deleted the comment though.

427
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
You did.

428
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,960
I kept, I kept getting, I kept getting replies.

429
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,460
They kept being like in my notifications for months later.

430
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,460
No.

431
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
What the fuck?

432
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
It was so amazing.

433
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,460
They just all owned me.

434
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
They kept doing it.

435
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,460
Your view is just, just like ganged up on me and bullied me too.

436
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
It was amazing.

437
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

438
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,460
No, I, I, I, I see, I see the comment.

439
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Oh, I didn't delete it.

440
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,460
I see, let's, no, I'm, I'm glad though.

441
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
I might have just.

442
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
What was the one?

443
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
I talked myself out of believing it.

444
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,460
The one that I said I thought was the funniest was, oh wait, you, you were, you were too afraid

445
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,460
to go on.

446
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,460
That's, that's the difference between you and JDR is that JDR goes all in and you, you

447
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,460
just, you just lacked the, the, the, the moral fiber.

448
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Yeah, I really am.

449
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Apparently.

450
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,460
It's so difficult writing such a robust world building thing.

451
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,460
You know, I've tried so many times and I just frazzled my brain trying to come up with everything.

452
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
Yeah.

453
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:25,460
I, I was thinking about, I was, I was thinking about, I was thinking about that.

454
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,460
I was thinking about like, man, building like a big like comic.

455
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,460
I was thinking about the champion specifically.

456
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,460
I was like, man, expanding on that world is like any idea that I have for that just seems

457
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
like stupid.

458
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
It just seems like, what's even the point of doing that?

459
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Like why even bother making a comic, building a world, creating fiction?

460
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
It's so lame.

461
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,460
But then I was like, you know what, actually, you know what?

462
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,460
It's, isn't it actually about, isn't it actually about the characters?

463
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Like if I focus on that, I don't feel that cringy about it.

464
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,460
I don't feel that like intimidated like, oh, how would I even begin to like create a setting

465
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,460
that is not stupid?

466
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,460
The best things usually have a robust world that the characters like use to their advantage

467
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
in telling the story that they're about.

468
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,460
Like the, the interestingness of the world is useful in the story that the character is

469
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,460
in, you know what I mean?

470
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,460
I feel like if you, if you have a character and a white void, they're not going to have

471
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
much to do.

472
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,460
I feel like, like she actually took the hard route with all of it, with all of her world

473
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
building.

474
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Because when you look at the world, like when you look at the, see, based on your lecture,

475
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,460
I haven't actually gotten around to reading the webcomic yet, although I really want to.

476
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,460
Based on what you were telling me, the interesting part was, in fact, not the characters.

477
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
It was the world they were in.

478
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
Oh yeah.

479
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,460
And that takes a lot of skill to do.

480
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Like usually it's the other way around.

481
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,460
I think that she was a lot more interested in Bill.

482
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,460
And I'm sure she likes the characters, especially like, you know, a couple of standouts.

483
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Yes.

484
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,460
But I think she's much more interested in the, in thinking of, thinking about universe,

485
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,460
parallel universes and like timelines and like, ooh, how does, how did, what an alternate

486
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
physics work?

487
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Like that, I think that's what fascinates her.

488
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Yeah.

489
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,460
On this, on, on that subject though, I did something this week or maybe it was last week,

490
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
I don't know.

491
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,460
A little wacky, a little weird, a little crazy.

492
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Well, I went and I read one of her, a, a film fiction, her My Little Pony fan fiction.

493
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Oh my God.

494
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,460
Yeah.

495
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:44,460
She has, I'm looking at her, her biography, Chatoyance on a, a film fiction.

496
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,460
She has written a total of 1.4 million words.

497
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Whoa.

498
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,460
I guess that's a lot.

499
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,540
And they are set in, they're set in a whole bunch of, I think I explained this a little

500
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:03,300
bit in the lecture that like, her, her pony stories are all set in these like, kind of

501
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,660
like sub universes of film fiction.

502
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
You know what I mean?

503
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Right.

504
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,460
These, these like fan, these fan like, constructions wherein like, oh, this is like a, an AU.

505
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
Yeah.

506
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
An AU.

507
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
An AU.

508
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
So she did a Marvel film?

509
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:25,460
She, she didn't start these like, like the, the big one is conversion bureau conversion

510
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:32,420
bureau is an AU in which basically equestria has appeared in the real world as like a magical

511
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:39,420
bubble that is expanding and humans and it is going to take over the entire world.

512
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,740
Humans cannot enter the bubble into equestria.

513
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,420
So in order for them not to be, you know, killed, destroyed by this, they have to become

514
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,620
converted into ponies.

515
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,700
So they, yeah, they have to undergo punification in order to, you know, to enter into this,

516
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
this.

517
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Yeah.

518
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,540
So I read the first, I read the first story she ever posted on film fiction.

519
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:12,180
It was called the big, the big respawn and it's okay.

520
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,060
It's kind of short, actually.

521
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,060
It's, it's, it's fine.

522
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Sounds like another lecture.

523
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,620
I had that idea.

524
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,620
I was like, what if I just did a whole thing about my little pony fan fiction?

525
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,620
Film fiction.net.

526
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,500
I think I could do one specifically on the conversion bureau.

527
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,940
I mean, there's so much, you know, I've watched, I've watched all of your lectures like six

528
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,940
times minimum.

529
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:45,740
Yeah, I've rewatched, I've rewatched them a bunch, especially the, especially the first

530
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
one.

531
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,780
But the second one.

532
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,700
I think my favorite one must be, yeah, Tails gets trolled.

533
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
Really?

534
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Yes.

535
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Most.

536
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,620
That one has a lot of like, whoa, from the audience, although the first one has that

537
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,620
as well.

538
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,620
Yeah.

539
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
I'm noticing.

540
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,580
I haven't watched the first one in a while, actually.

541
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,380
I'm noticing just now the Kokura Wish Lecture just passed a hundred thousand views.

542
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
It's pretty.

543
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,380
Wow.

544
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,380
It's pretty cool.

545
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,700
Oh, wait, I completely forgot about that one.

546
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,100
Yeah, that one's really good too.

547
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Kokura, yeah.

548
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
We're just talking about it.

549
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
How did I forget you did a lecture on it?

550
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
It's weird.

551
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,300
Yeah, the Tails gets trolled when it's like, did you, do you know Cybershell?

552
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
No.

553
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,900
Do you know who that is?

554
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:43,060
Okay, he's a YouTuber, he's a Sonic YouTuber who was gone for a couple years and he just

555
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,940
made a big comeback on YouTube, he just posted a whole bunch of videos, and in one of them

556
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,180
he talks about Tails gets trolled, and in that video he mentions my lecture, but he

557
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,140
says, even this is a good video and it's a good lecture, but if you're going to read

558
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,500
Tails gets trolled, don't watch it, because it basically is just recounting the story.

559
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
And it's true.

560
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,980
The pleasure of the Tails gets trolled lecture is just that listening to it, you hear about

561
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,500
the story of Tails gets trolled, which is from cool and funny and amazing in its own

562
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
place.

563
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,900
It's the revelation of such a story that when you tell somebody in a sentence, that's the

564
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,540
dumbest thing I've ever heard.

565
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,060
But then when you go into more detail, you're like, oh my god, this is incredible.

566
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:39,940
I really liked your lecture because it feels like I get put into the mind of a person discovering,

567
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,940
more like the mind of a community discovering this thing that happened way back that I would

568
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,940
not be able to go into with a fresh mind anymore.

569
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Mm-hmm.

570
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Yeah.

571
00:24:50,940 --> 00:25:00,180
It's, I wish, I wish I could read Tails gets trolled for the first time again.

572
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,940
I wish I could read, I guess I feel that way about a lot of things.

573
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:11,220
You know, actually, he did just start making pages again.

574
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,540
There is like, yeah, we talked about this with Cybershell, but the series ended on a

575
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:23,580
cliffhanger and then he tried, he decided he was going to go back and remake the entire

576
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,820
series and everyone was like, no, please, please don't do that, please just continue.

577
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,660
And then I guess he was gone for a while, but he has, yeah, laser bought the author.

578
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,900
He got a bunch of like artists, a bunch of like volunteer artists, like agreed to like

579
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,100
draw the rest of that chapter for him.

580
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
So the cliffhanger has been resolved.

581
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:52,380
And now I think he is like supposedly back to posting what I think is, no, it's not like

582
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,220
everyone, it seems like the story was almost over, but according to Cybershell and according

583
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:05,660
to, I know the guy who runs the website, the talesgetstroll.org website and runs the

584
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,300
Twitter account and does like all the promotion for it now.

585
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,740
He says that apparently laser bought says the story is only like half done or something.

586
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:20,100
So he did a one piece of web comics over here.

587
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:26,740
It's going to go on, it's going to last, it's going to outlive all of us fucking, yeah.

588
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,260
So you said he wanted to redo the entire story.

589
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Yes.

590
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:40,860
I didn't know this, but apparently he started the story, it was called talesgetstroll polished.

591
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:49,500
And it was just like the story again, but with like more stuff, like more like just

592
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,980
like a longer way of telling it and like it was supposed to be have like a better art

593
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,980
style, but laser bought's not that good at art.

594
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:06,500
So it just kind of like and looked muddy, he tried to shade it, he tried to shade it,

595
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,660
but it just kind of ended up looking like sort of muddy, it wasn't, it wasn't helping.

596
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,060
I'm glad he didn't redo it.

597
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,460
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

598
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,460
no, no, it's just kind of entertaining.

599
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,480
It's kind of funny actually because generally webcomic artists.

600
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,380
It gets I'm sure you know about this too, Ben.

601
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,780
It gets very tempting to like redo the first few chapters.

602
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:39,380
You know, I have never really had that problem.

603
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,900
But I know, I know it's common so good.

604
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,820
It's so perfect every time.

605
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
No, it's not.

606
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
It's not that it's not that.

607
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:57,340
I think I just, I think I had seen other artists try that kind of thing and I knew, I always

608
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,980
knew that that's an artist trap that you can fall into.

609
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:10,380
And I feel like when I look back at my old stuff it's like, I can't remake it, it would

610
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,540
just be a new thing if I tried, I don't know, I never have that urge, I mean I do look back

611
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,820
at my old stuff and I cringe and I think, wow this sucks, but I don't think like, oh

612
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,540
I should do it again and make it good this time, it was like, no, I can't, it's too late,

613
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
it sucks forever.

614
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:35,180
Something I did, which is on one of my comics that I wrote, it's probably the comic I have

615
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,820
with the most subscribers, it's called Winter Moon, it's got 2.5 million subs, which is a

616
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,380
lot for a comic.

617
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:53,620
So with that one, I actually really didn't like the first 100 episodes because they

618
00:28:53,620 --> 00:29:00,300
were all, the artist was not very familiar with typesetting and also it was before I

619
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,580
had like fully an idea of what was going to happen, I was just like making things up

620
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:12,340
as I was going along, so lines of dialogue in that story will appear that reference

621
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,420
potential future villains that never ever appear.

622
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:23,340
So there's like one, one episode that I always think back to when I think about this, which

623
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,060
is like, the main character is like sitting and chilling and then these two guys just

624
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:34,500
pop out of nowhere to attack him and they have this like long bubble of dialogue that's

625
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,220
like way too long and they just go, because I only had four parents to work with, but

626
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,700
I had to like get some sort of foreshadowing in because I thought I was going to do this

627
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:50,060
like one story arc about how it takes place in an MMO and the idea is that the main characters

628
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,460
hated by all the big guild masters because of something he did, which never ended up

629
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
happening.

630
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,340
And so the dialogue of these two guys was just like, they just jump out of nowhere and

631
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,420
they go like, haha, we're going to kill you because the main guild masters union all hate

632
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:17,180
you and they're going to pay us to do it and this never gets brought up again and like

633
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,980
three seasons later, we never hear about this.

634
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,700
So I just hated that episode so very badly and all of the early episodes, they have this

635
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,980
problem with the typesetting and like the way you typeset things is really important.

636
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,580
I only learned this later and all of the dialogue is like very weirdly phrased.

637
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:43,260
So what I did instead of us like going back and redrawing all of it, I just hired two

638
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,940
professional typesetters to like just re-typeset the first 150 episodes and I feel way better

639
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
about it now.

640
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:58,540
That's like, yeah, it's the same, but just like with the jank sort of smooth, I guess.

641
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,700
Yeah, and the rewritten dialogue and stuff.

642
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Yeah.

643
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,860
I mean, I think that like, I think probably there's a lot of like long form works of art

644
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,140
that probably start on like a totally, they say, you know, they have all these loose threads

645
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,380
at the beginning and then it kind of has to like find its footing and like figure out

646
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,660
what it actually wants to be as it goes along.

647
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,420
I mean, the thing that jumps to mind is like Seribus, Tom, you know what I'm talking about.

648
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Yeah.

649
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,460
Seribus, like, you know, it starts out as like a fantasy.

650
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,140
It's like a parody of like Conan the Barbarian and then at some point along the way he starts

651
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,620
going to these alternate realities and it's like.

652
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,180
It becomes a very different thing.

653
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,700
It's like Dave Sim was just like, eh, I kind of don't want to do a fantasy parody anymore.

654
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,180
I kind of just want to talk about like what I think about politics.

655
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Real shit.

656
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,500
Yeah, what I think about how like, you know, how like women suck and stuff.

657
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,860
The first like arc of the story after this parodies is like high society.

658
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
It's all about classism.

659
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,740
And then the second arc is church and state, which is all about commenting on theocracy.

660
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,860
It's like, this started as a Conan parody.

661
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
What is happening?

662
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,020
This is all like through the character of like an anthropomorphic art bark and it's very,

663
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,140
it's like tonal whiplash, but like that's when the comic really gets interesting.

664
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:24,420
Oh, you know, I was, I was going to say Seribus lecture, but I've seen, I have watched at least

665
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:29,940
one YouTube video that basically just summarizes the story of Seribus.

666
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,340
So it wouldn't be beaten to the punch, I guess.

667
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,540
Ben, if I ever become schizophrenic, please promise me one thing.

668
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Yes.

669
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
Anything.

670
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
Make a lecture about me.

671
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:47,860
Oh, like if you just go off the rails and start like putting out like really wacky shit.

672
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,380
If I, if I let go of the rails, become insane, start doing all of this weird stuff.

673
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,100
Everyone starts hating me.

674
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,460
Well, now make a lecture and make me seem so very pleased.

675
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,500
This Mary guy, like he's such a fucking train wreck.

676
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,940
Like, oh, I hate this guy so much, but why, but why is he such a fucking idiot?

677
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
And I'll say, aha.

678
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
And then you do it.

679
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
I know.

680
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,660
Now that you've said, now that you've said that though, how are we ever going to know

681
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,940
if it's a legit breakdown or if you're just trying to bait Ben into making a lecture about

682
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
me?

683
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
You'll never know.

684
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,940
I guess you'll never know.

685
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,300
You can always go back to this and play it and add to the mystery of that.

686
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,020
Is he just pretending?

687
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:31,540
Did you, did you see, did you, you seen Tom's Animorph lecture?

688
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
Not yet.

689
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,060
No, that's, I actually, I didn't know you guys had new lectures.

690
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Yeah.

691
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
They came out.

692
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
They could be getting an April.

693
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
Yeah.

694
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
Yeah.

695
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,860
We recorded all of them in like March and yeah, that one came out in like April.

696
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
That one's pretty good.

697
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,820
I would say Animorph's one is pretty highly regarded, which I'm surprised that.

698
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,820
I see it's, it's a 200.

699
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:56,500
It's a good, it's a good big talk about and a very strange thing.

700
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
I think you would like it.

701
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Yeah.

702
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Mary.

703
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,620
Um, it's, um, it's been, uh, I think I was looking at the analytics and I think it's

704
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,140
been the biggest, uh, I think it's been the biggest, uh, ad rev earner on the channel

705
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,500
for, uh, for a while, which, uh, did pretty well.

706
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,180
That reminds me of, this is a funny, funny anecdote from this week, um, some, some one

707
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:25,140
on Twitter who I don't know made a joke about like podcasts with too many people on them

708
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:32,380
and, uh, and, uh, Bev, who I know, an RFCK person and who was on the, the 40 person,

709
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:39,540
you know, all guest podcasts, tweeted a reply like I was on a podcast with 40 people Lamau.

710
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,780
And I guess maybe this person retweeted it and it got like, uh, I don't know, it got

711
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,940
a few thousand like views from this.

712
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:51,300
And I was, yeah, it made, it made about like, it made like $10 in ad rev.

713
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Sick.

714
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Yeah.

715
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
It was like, fuck yeah.

716
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
Cool.

717
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
What's the animal flexor up to?

718
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
It made like a couple hundred dollars last time I checked, right?

719
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,220
Uh, you know, I mean, I can, I'm not logged in, but let me, let me log in and we can,

720
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,140
uh, uh, I don't know if I care that much to get to log in and it's unbelievable.

721
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,620
Logging is just such a hassle.

722
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
Wait, what?

723
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,620
It totally is.

724
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,620
What are we talking about?

725
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Uh, stuff.

726
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,620
Okay.

727
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Comics.

728
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Nice.

729
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Nice.

730
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Uh, YouTube.

731
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,340
Like with, with the thing with, with, with, uh, cause I've been making comics for a little

732
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,180
while now and I am.

733
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,420
Oh, you do?

734
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
I do.

735
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
I do.

736
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
Uh.

737
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Give makes.

738
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Uh, yeah.

739
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Give makes comics.

740
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
That's true.

741
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Let me get an image.

742
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Sad but true.

743
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,700
The most recent one shot that I submitted to the Tezuka award, um, contest thing.

744
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Oh yeah.

745
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
When do you find out?

746
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,700
Do you read that?

747
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
When do you find out about that?

748
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
I, I just checked today.

749
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
It still isn't closed yet.

750
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,100
They're still, no, it's, it's closed, but they're judging it and I've been judging it

751
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
for a while.

752
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,580
Um, let me get a good page for all the pages.

753
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:04,340
Um, but yeah, I've been doing comics for a little while and I'm like in my head, there's

754
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:10,820
like so many over, like over the top ridiculous big stories that I could tell with all these

755
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,460
characters that I have.

756
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,020
And I'm like, I got to get started somewhere.

757
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:20,260
I'll make a short, small story and then, uh, eventually I'll, I'll foreshadow everything.

758
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,020
Everything that I say will become something later.

759
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,460
It'll all be so fucking based and so cool and people will go back and be like, oh my

760
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,460
God, it's like Oda is just, it's just genius.

761
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,180
Um, but I don't, I feel like it's not going to happen like that.

762
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,940
I think it's just going to be a little fun thing and then I'll actually start being good

763
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,940
later.

764
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,780
I can't find a good image.

765
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,500
Every attempt at like making a comic that I've tried to do has always collapsed under

766
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:50,580
the world building weight because I'm so obsessed with like crazy high concept fantasy stories,

767
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,380
which is why with the character I'm doing now as Umi, it's just like, there's no story.

768
00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:01,260
The story is she does something cool and, uh, it's takes a lot of pressure off and kind

769
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,580
of allows me to be more freeform with the stuff I end up making and, uh, I like it.

770
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
It works for me.

771
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,740
I'm not a craze.

772
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,140
I'm not George R. R. Martin.

773
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm, uh, Michael Bay, I guess, and I just have to own that at some point.

774
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:21,580
You just have to accept Michael Bay, you just have to let go and embrace what you've become

775
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,820
based Adam Jensen.

776
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:30,740
These are some things, the Clarissa gun smoke and the bandit king as I submitted it to the

777
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Tezuka thing.

778
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Are you putting it in discord?

779
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
Yeah, I put it in the general chat.

780
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Right.

781
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,700
Oh, that's like a shit.

782
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
You know, I have that panel is so good.

783
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,460
I haven't actually gotten around to reading it yet.

784
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,500
It's it's it's not fully out yet.

785
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,700
I still need to do the second half and then I'm going to put it on my site.

786
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,700
Right.

787
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,500
That that's why that's why I was waiting for him.

788
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah.

789
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,100
I'm so I'm so I'm so you know what this reminds me of?

790
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Yeah.

791
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,140
What?

792
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,260
It reminds me of you guys have seen Giorgio's bizarre adventure.

793
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
I've heard of such a.

794
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
Yeah.

795
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
A bit.

796
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,820
So there's these characters in Giorgio's bizarre adventure.

797
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:16,100
They have a they have a stand that can allow them to see the future, but it's drawn in a

798
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,900
bizarrely illustrated manga and they're called Oingo Boingo.

799
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,980
One of them is called Oingo.

800
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,460
The other is called Boingo and and and this art style kind of reminds me of them.

801
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,100
Boingo Boingo.

802
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,940
I'm not familiar.

803
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh, wait, I wait.

804
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,420
Oh, well, I can't.

805
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,340
I can't post anything.

806
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,100
I can't post anything.

807
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,300
Oh, no, I just realized I'm going to have to.

808
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,740
I'm going to have to I'm going to have to fuck with the V with the VTuber recording

809
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,380
in order to post the voicemail links later, but that's OK.

810
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,020
That's fine.

811
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,980
It'll it'll it'll be fine.

812
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,140
Oingo Boingo looks yikes.

813
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,300
Yeah, you should you should you should Google it.

814
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,900
Yeah, it's it's odd.

815
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,860
It looks a little bit like more grats.

816
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Oh, God. Yeah.

817
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,900
Is that little like sun thing floating under the brother's adventure?

818
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,660
Is that like is that the sweet bro and hella Jeff?

819
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,820
The turn. Wait, what?

820
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,100
It's sweet bro.

821
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,540
Well, you see when I when I Google Oingo Boingo, I see the purple book cover.

822
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,140
And there's like a little like

823
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,420
flower sun thing.

824
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,020
I don't know, it's got like a sweet bro and hella Jeff mouth.

825
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,860
I've got the Oingo Boingo band that is based off.

826
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,820
No, wrong.

827
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,620
False. OK.

828
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,140
Do you guys want to know?

829
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,380
Do you do you want to know?

830
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,860
Should I make it public information?

831
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,180
How much money?

832
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,220
How much ad revenue all of our all of our top videos have made?

833
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,500
I'm looking. Yeah, why not?

834
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,180
It makes us sound like we're established and cool.

835
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,780
I'm I'm looking at the data right now.

836
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,940
This is this is interesting.

837
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,740
I'm some of these surprised me a little bit.

838
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,180
Number one, Animorphs 101

839
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,380
has made in its lifetime eight hundred and seventy dollars.

840
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,660
Damn.

841
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,980
Hottest goss in the universe has made eight hundred and twenty four dollars.

842
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,740
Guilty Gear 101.

843
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,900
Seven hundred and sixty two dollars.

844
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,100
I'm bringing in all the big bucks, baby.

845
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,460
Deagle Nation, five hundred and nine dollars.

846
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,460
Voice Bale Fund, four hundred and eleven dollars.

847
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,260
But that doesn't count.

848
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,100
That's not ad revenue.

849
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,300
That was donations.

850
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,900
And then OK, then the next one was Radcon for Paradise Opening Ceremony.

851
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,180
That was donations again.

852
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,740
After that, it's Things We Can't Get Into, which has made two hundred and forty seven dollars.

853
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:50,860
And then Sonichu 360 classroom has made two hundred and forty six.

854
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,740
And then it's a whole bunch of bullshit after that.

855
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,620
That's those are the interesting ones.

856
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,780
So now join them.

857
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,100
So now you know, what's that?

858
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,860
Can I join? Can you join?

859
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,140
What? Oh, you want to flex on us with your crazy numbers?

860
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,340
Oh, yeah, please. Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,740
I love data. The funny thing is I actually think you guys have made

862
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,580
like your individual videos have made more than mine.

863
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,060
Wait, really? How's that?

864
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,180
How does it even work? I would I would believe it because my videos are less.

865
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,980
Most of my videos are less than ten minutes.

866
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,620
That's true. Multiple ad breaks.

867
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,300
You you think? Yeah.

868
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,460
You upload a lot of the highest.

869
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,140
They're like, well, then would you call them motion comics?

870
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,620
Yeah, motion comics.

871
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,620
I I had a theory a while ago that you could basically get.

872
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,820
Seventy percent of the way to the feel of getting an anime.

873
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,420
If you look like without any animation,

874
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,260
if you just get Japanese voice actors and custom music, I think you are a hundred

875
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,500
percent correct in that in that apparently it works.

876
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,580
Estimated. Yeah.

877
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,380
Um, I think people I think people

878
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,900
people overvalue polish and like in the same way.

879
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,740
This was laser bots. Great failing.

880
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,460
This is why he wanted to make tails get strolled polished because he was like,

881
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,500
oh, I got to make it perfect.

882
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,260
I got to make it high quality.

883
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,660
I got to have like high fidelity renderings.

884
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,660
I have to render every individual bit of stubble on the Space Marine's cheek.

885
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,460
You know, in my triple a video game and it's all it's all bullshit.

886
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,460
No, I'm even now that I'm looking at my my Clarissa drawings here.

887
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,340
I'm like, God, this was so bad.

888
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,820
It needs to be redone, but of course it doesn't.

889
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,380
It's fine. It'll do. It's cool.

890
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,860
I I look at I look at like my worst.

891
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,900
I look at my worst panels in like

892
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,220
slime and punishment, which like some of them are just straight up bad

893
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,620
because like I would crank them out in like five minutes sometimes.

894
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,780
And I look at the really bad ones and I'm just like, well, that's funny.

895
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
I like it.

896
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,700
I don't know. I don't know.

897
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,300
Well, when you when you rush something or like you just do it real quick

898
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,660
and it comes out sloppy, that's understandable and thus OK.

899
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,060
And you can be like, how low when you try really hard.

900
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,620
And then it turns out that you're, you know, your best is lame.

901
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,460
And it's like, oh, it feels it hurts a little more.

902
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,980
I guess.

903
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,700
Yeah, I guess so.

904
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,020
I guess it's easy to look at that because I know, like, yeah,

905
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,620
I slapped this out in like five minutes. Don't worry about it.

906
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,220
Hmm. Hmm.

907
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,580
I think my biggest earning video was a Minecraft anime one.

908
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,900
Was it the the the Creeper girl?

909
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,860
Yeah. Yeah.

910
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,460
And I looked at your channel the other day and just to see, like,

911
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,980
you know, what you had on there.

912
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,700
And I think that one was like it's got like it's got millions of views, right?

913
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,020
Must. Yeah. Yeah.

914
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,900
I think the biggest one we've got is two point two million views.

915
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,180
Yeah.

916
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,660
But even that one, they don't really make that much money.

917
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,660
I think, like, yeah, it's about watch time.

918
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,660
Yeah. Watch time and average.

919
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,820
Most of my videos don't really go above a few hundred dollars.

920
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,500
Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

921
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,220
Do you?

922
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,740
Well, that really is terrible.

923
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,180
Like, I've heard the way that the YouTube

924
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,620
changed to watch time, destroyed animation on YouTube forever.

925
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,060
And it never really recovered.

926
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,660
And the idea that you can do one thing that kind of saves us

927
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,380
is that we don't do animation. Yeah.

928
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,100
It's like multiple millions of views

929
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,740
and you can't get more than the sort of stuff we make.

930
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,500
The lectures are obviously like good quality content,

931
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,940
but their length like both like we've only got a few.

932
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,300
Well, actually, how many how many views is the top viewed thing on our

933
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,380
Scott? The top viewed.

934
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,620
Yeah. What's the view?

935
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,460
Most of our most viewed video is.

936
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,460
It's the guilty gear lecture with almost just shy of 300 K.

937
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,260
Really? Yeah.

938
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,100
And then the second one is the animorphs with two point 15 K.

939
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,020
Then I thought it would be the.

940
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,260
The son of two lecture or something.

941
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,500
That's not that's not that's not my channel.

942
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,940
That's on a different channel.

943
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,220
So that's actually.

944
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,220
And I mean, Nate's lectures, Nate's one piece lecture,

945
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,260
I think has half a million and the the Kingdom Hearts lecture.

946
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,580
I'm not sure if that's hit a million, but it's got a lot.

947
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,420
I really like the Deagle Nation one.

948
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:34,020
I, you know, I had I remember being there in hearing it live.

949
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,860
And it was a ton of fun.

950
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,900
I don't know if I've gone back and rewatched it.

951
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,460
But maybe I should.

952
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,260
I've rewatched a bunch of the other ones.

953
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,900
One time in Japan, I decided to.

954
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:55,020
So this is this is a PCP lecture story from me about one of the one

955
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,820
of one of the ways I used one of your lectures to get through some work.

956
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,580
OK. So in Japan, I don't know if you guys know this,

957
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,620
but they have a very strict recycling thing.

958
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:08,420
You have to get like these colored bags and put everything in the exact right

959
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,660
thing. And if you don't do it right, you get this like pink slip of shame

960
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,060
that they put on your thing and say that they're going to refuse taking your trash.

961
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:22,740
So one time I had to reorganize all of my trash like five days after I put it there.

962
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,780
Yeah.

963
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,260
And I had to do it all on my tiny balcony.

964
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,220
So I put on the Deagle Nation lecture and I did it then.

965
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,940
Well, you're rifling through trash.

966
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,620
Yeah. Yeah.

967
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,380
It's pretty comfy.

968
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,100
Good. That's that's good.

969
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
That's what it's for. You. Yeah.

970
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
Do you still live in Japan?

971
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,260
No, I I I usually do.

972
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,980
But the problem is the coronavirus pandemic hit.

973
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,780
And then I got afraid because I was it was back in back in like February

974
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,340
when it really got crazy. Yeah.

975
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,340
I I.

976
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,940
I I got I got scared because Japan's close to China.

977
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,540
And back then we didn't really know much about what the coronavirus like truly was.

978
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,420
All we did was like we heard like news from Wuhan about how they were

979
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,380
were like forcefully closing apartments down and stuff.

980
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,500
And and we had no clue if they were even reporting the right numbers and stuff.

981
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,500
So I got scared.

982
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,100
So I went back to Denmark.

983
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:29,900
Yeah.

984
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,820
And like stayed with my mom for a bit.

985
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,420
And unfortunately,

986
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,820
the borders closed like a week or two after.

987
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,740
And then I was stuck and I've been stuck here since.

988
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,060
And the thing is, it's not even much better here.

989
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,820
I was I don't even have much better numbers in Japan.

990
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,620
Yeah, I was going to say like, I don't know exactly how the numbers are.

991
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:56,740
I know like Vietnam and like South Korea, I think, are doing really well

992
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,860
with coronavirus America not doing so great.

993
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,260
Europe overall doing pretty bad right now.

994
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,860
I don't know how I don't have Denmark and Japan are doing in the grand scheme of things.

995
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:12,700
I would. Well, Japan Japan has pretty good set up for the entire thing.

996
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,340
Because they have they are all used to using masks already and used to like washing

997
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,020
their hands and not touching too many things in public.

998
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,780
Yeah. Yeah.

999
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,860
So they were good from the outset.

1000
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,900
This is the first time I've ever seen people using masks in Denmark.

1001
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,060
Oh, yeah. Same.

1002
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,100
Same over here in Massachusetts.

1003
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,300
It's pretty cool, honestly.

1004
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,900
It's pretty pumped. I was so upset.

1005
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,420
I was meant to go to America this year and do conventions.

1006
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,820
Oh, my God.

1007
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,100
Yeah, I'm I'm sure all the convention circuits are closed this year, right?

1008
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,860
Yeah, every every convention.

1009
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,420
I mean, like me and me and like Saber and Paylor.

1010
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,220
And then we all used to go to conventions like MomoCon and stuff.

1011
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,820
And every year since they started going to MomoCon, I've missed it for some reason.

1012
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,940
And this year I finally could.

1013
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,140
And of course, MomoCon is canceled along with every other convention.

1014
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,420
I was going to be I was going to be like a VIP guest at so many different

1015
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,380
conventions this year, and all of them got canceled.

1016
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,700
Yeah. The one year I was some of them canceled next year as well.

1017
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,980
Already, it's fucking crazy.

1018
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,180
It was my first year going to conventions.

1019
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,500
It's it always sucks like hearing that.

1020
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,340
Oh, I was I was waiting.

1021
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,500
And this was the year I was going to do a whole bunch of stuff.

1022
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,340
It's the new decade.

1023
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:31,980
No. No, I I kept I kept, you know, yeah, I kept saying like,

1024
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,860
I'm going to I'm going to start tabling at conventions.

1025
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,900
I meant to do it last year at Mice, the.

1026
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,660
Oh, God, some Massachusetts indie comic expo.

1027
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,260
I meant to do it last year, but I like was too late to sign up and I missed it.

1028
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,060
So this year I went to it and I didn't table again.

1029
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,700
I was like, no, fuck it.

1030
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,700
Next year, I'm going to do it for real.

1031
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,500
It's going to it's going to happen.

1032
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,700
And then, yeah, no, not anymore.

1033
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,700
There's no mice anymore.

1034
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,780
Yeah, so same.

1035
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,580
Yes, another like was my school because I wanted to go, but I never did

1036
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,660
because I suck.

1037
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,780
Honestly, no, I don't like it.

1038
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,900
Damn, I don't I don't I don't like it as an attendee, but I wanted to table at it.

1039
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,060
I think that would I would have felt differently about it.

1040
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,900
Interesting. Yeah.

1041
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,740
Because there's there's nothing there, except like you walk through a series

1042
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,460
of hallways and rooms where people have tables and are selling stuff.

1043
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,980
And I don't want and I don't want to buy shit.

1044
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,740
It sounds like Mocha, which I went to once during college, which was pretty cool

1045
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,380
because I met a bunch of people from a podcast I was listening to.

1046
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,780
But yeah, it was just indie comics.

1047
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,700
It's like, that's all it was, just a big room for the dude selling indie books.

1048
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,100
You've just described why I decided to start doing comics.

1049
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,180
What do you mean?

1050
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,260
I went to the convention in Denmark and I had nothing to do.

1051
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,740
And all of it was just walking through hallways.

1052
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,060
All the things people did was either cosplay or selling things.

1053
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,300
Yeah. I.

1054
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,140
So that's when I decided back in 2012 that I wanted to write comics.

1055
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,540
I when I yeah, at my side, I was like, I would be.

1056
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,700
Like it's it sounds cool.

1057
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,340
Like, oh, it's a gathering of all these.

1058
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,060
Like it's like a lot of them are completely unknown.

1059
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,180
A lot of them are have no like name, recognition.

1060
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,900
There's some guy and or whatever.

1061
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,660
And it would be cool to go and like meet those people.

1062
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,220
But at mice, I didn't meet those people.

1063
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,580
Like there's just like you go in front of their table

1064
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,020
and you look at their shit and either you buy it or you don't.

1065
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,660
And you just make, I don't know.

1066
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,140
You might make a little small to I'm not interested in the in the buying shit.

1067
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,100
I would like to meet other comics people, but it just I went to mice twice

1068
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,460
and neither time, neither time did it scratch that edge for me.

1069
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,860
Then here's a question because here's something I've been thinking about a lot,

1070
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,500
like going to conventions and like why I never went to conventions until like 2013.

1071
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,660
Do you think that being where we were in the pony thing

1072
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,900
and going to pony conventions, like changed our perspective

1073
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,740
on what a convention should be?

1074
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,700
Because like every time I've gone to a con before

1075
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,660
and after like being prominent in that community,

1076
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,460
it feels like a very empty consumerist action.

1077
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,300
Whereas when it was like the pony thing and I was like a known entity

1078
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,980
in that small bubble, like it was a much more dynamic experience.

1079
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,980
And I feel like that was what I really enjoyed about going to cons

1080
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,140
and not just going and like talking to people and buying things.

1081
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,460
I am going to say kind of.

1082
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:40,140
But no, I think that I think I do think that, yeah, being being,

1083
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,860
you know, even a little bit horse famous at a at a pony convention.

1084
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,780
Yeah, like obviously that lent a certain energy to it.

1085
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,260
And, you know, sort of propelled the experience, I guess, because like,

1086
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,900
you know, you were always like we were like we were we were always

1087
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,100
like making appearances and stuff like people were like people would see us

1088
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,820
and they and it would like cause a minor, you know, stare or whatever.

1089
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,980
It would be a little bit of an event wherever we went.

1090
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,940
It was very exciting. It sounds nice.

1091
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,540
It was it was pretty cool. It was pretty bad.

1092
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,820
But like not to say I guess what I'm trying to say is that.

1093
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,700
But my but my but I don't think that's entirely.

1094
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,140
I think that Brony Khan specifically is like a specifically

1095
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,180
like high energy event.

1096
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,420
I guess I guess what I'm trying to say is I think it's a little calm.

1097
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,820
A little bit like when you're saying like I want to go to convention

1098
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,580
to meet people like because of like the the certain degree of clout

1099
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,700
and that people knew who you were to a degree, it made approaching

1100
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,820
and talking and meeting and interacting with people much easier.

1101
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,460
Because like you again, you had like a reputation that preceded you.

1102
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,860
Whereas like if I went to mice, I would feel like a fucking moron trying

1103
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,700
to just go up and talk to somebody because like it's a much it's a cold

1104
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,020
experience versus a warm interaction.

1105
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,140
Yeah, definitely. I've tried both.

1106
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,500
I went to I actually went to a convention like last month

1107
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,580
in Germany. They did one convention, one test to see if it could be possible

1108
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,500
during Corona virus. Oh my God.

1109
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,180
I did test negative afterwards.

1110
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,020
So that was pretty good.

1111
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,740
It was pretty good. Congratulations.

1112
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,820
The convention was a success.

1113
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,660
It was very good.

1114
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,260
I was I sold out of all my comics, which is amazing.

1115
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:22,300
So many people compared to Copenhagen comics, where no one knew who I was.

1116
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,860
You sell you sell like physical comics, too?

1117
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,100
Yeah, only at conventions.

1118
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,060
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1119
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:33,340
So I met so I went to a convention

1120
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,740
and they called Copenhagen comics another time that was like two years ago.

1121
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:44,300
And I thought that I would it was probably one of the first time I really did

1122
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,820
a convention. But the thing is, no one knew who I was because it was like a

1123
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,540
traditional comic convention.

1124
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,140
And they put me over in the corner with the like the youth corner.

1125
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,540
Oh, this is the webcomic guy.

1126
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,460
Yeah, just just put him over in the corner with all the kids, right?

1127
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,940
And and front stage, I was probably

1128
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,860
a follower wise.

1129
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,700
I was probably the biggest one there if you're thinking like social media following.

1130
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,620
But the front and center, they had one of the artists of Garfield.

1131
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,660
And I was just put off all the way in the corner.

1132
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,820
Oh, you can't you can't compete with that Garfield clout.

1133
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,620
There's no touch in there.

1134
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:27,860
And they also did the same thing to to another artist.

1135
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,140
He's called Toshio Maida, and he's the guy who did La Blue Girl,

1136
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,060
which is like a really old hentai.

1137
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,380
Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,540
He's the guy who like he's the guy who like popularized the whole tentacle thing

1139
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,260
in Hentai. Yeah, well, that's doing work over there.

1140
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,900
Yeah, well, he was really cool.

1141
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,260
He told me about how I said hi to him.

1142
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,340
And the first thing he told me because we had like one mutual friend,

1143
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,940
which is Jacob, the CEO of Faku.

1144
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,060
And the first thing he told me is that that guy's girlfriend is hot.

1145
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,460
So that was pretty funny.

1146
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,020
Just this old Japanese guy.

1147
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,380
He's really cool. Yeah.

1148
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:10,940
I yeah, I think that Tom, where you were saying, OK, about about like.

1149
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:16,340
I don't expect to go to something and like have clout.

1150
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,620
Like, obviously, yeah, if you go and you've got clout, that's good.

1151
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,380
And people will respond in a way that's good.

1152
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,780
And yeah, like, obviously, that's ideal.

1153
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,220
I guess. But like, I think that's a little bit of the difference.

1154
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,980
I think would be between like tabling at one of these and as an attendee.

1155
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,860
Because as an attendee, you're just there.

1156
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,980
You're you're a sheep, you know, you're there to consume.

1157
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,180
If you're a tabler, I feel like if you're a tabling,

1158
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,700
you would at least have. Oh, my God, someone.

1159
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,660
Someone just someone just subscribed to the YouTube channel.

1160
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,500
And it like made the like funny gift happen over Mary's face.

1161
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,540
So that's that. Don't don't worry about it.

1162
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,460
Don't worry about it, viewers.

1163
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,580
It's it's good.

1164
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,980
I'm glad it didn't make the sound.

1165
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,220
But yeah, like if you're tabling, I feel like that's

1166
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,140
that would be how you would like get to like

1167
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,580
converse with your fellow creatives or whatever.

1168
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,140
That's like gets you on the inside.

1169
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,380
You're there with a purpose.

1170
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,540
You show up early. You're setting up.

1171
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,100
You're all like, you know, I don't know, making small talk with the people

1172
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,300
tabling around you or whatever.

1173
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,780
Maybe there's like a lounge or something. I don't fucking know.

1174
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,660
I mean, I've I've gone to like one small convention

1175
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,060
before I had any clout in the pony thing.

1176
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,660
And I was trying to table there and I was trying to sell prints and stuff.

1177
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,420
And it was miserable because nobody knew who I was.

1178
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,620
Nobody wanted to talk to me.

1179
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,380
I literally just sat there for two days, but just staring at a wall.

1180
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:46,220
But surely surely you weren't the only person tabling who nobody knew, right?

1181
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,620
Yeah, nobody. I don't think anybody there was like particularly like well known.

1182
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,580
But like nobody wanted to talk to each other either.

1183
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,500
It was just like you were just sitting there like waiting for death and it sucked.

1184
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,260
Well, how does it? Yeah, I know that feel.

1185
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:03,460
OK, it's all thanks for thanks for disillusioning me.

1186
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,540
I just want to say my dream mice could very well end up that way as well.

1187
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,700
Everyone just like kind of awkwardly hoping that someone

1188
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,620
because like it's an awkward position where you have no clout

1189
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,300
and like the little bubble you're in.

1190
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,860
So you're just you're just there hoping like someone will come over

1191
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,100
and they'll look at your stuff and they'll look at you and you'll be like,

1192
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,380
what's going to happen? And then they just walk away.

1193
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,380
And you're just like, well, OK, that was awkward.

1194
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,420
And that was just that 48 hours was like, OK, cool.

1195
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,740
Oh, I tried that in January.

1196
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,500
I was at a Finnish convention and Finnish people are very a social.

1197
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,100
So if you if you make icons, sounds like my kind of way and walk away.

1198
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,540
I feel like if it was like like

1199
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,900
if it was me, you and Gib, I went to mice together and had a table

1200
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,020
like we could like vibe off of each other while trying to do things.

1201
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,420
That would be a totally different experience.

1202
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,540
Oh, it's like me by myself sitting at mice.

1203
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,260
I love that. A big old cut.

1204
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,140
Let's do it, buddy.

1205
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,420
But next time America reopens, let's do it.

1206
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,260
All right, we'll see you in 2037 when the virus is finally contained.

1207
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,940
I was going to fuck.

1208
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,340
Oh, that makes me sad, because I kind of had a plan to do that last time.

1209
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,780
I was when I when I failed to sign up to table at mice, me and me and Kazi.

1210
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,900
We're going to we said we were going to like table together.

1211
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,780
And then I fucking blew it.

1212
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,340
It didn't happen.

1213
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,140
And now it'll never happen.

1214
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,500
Did Kazi table by herself?

1215
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,940
No, she didn't. I'm going.

1216
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,580
No, she didn't either.

1217
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,180
Nobody did. Yes.

1218
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,100
It all came tumbling down.

1219
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,300
God, I've got to I've got to finish some of my comics.

1220
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,580
I've got to I've got to finish the Lord of Ghosts

1221
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,700
so I can print it out and do something.

1222
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,860
I want I want to finish a comic just so I can print it.

1223
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,060
I just want comics on the shelf.

1224
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,940
Yeah, I like be erect for months if I can make that happen.

1225
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:50,980
Yeah, you know, hey, I think we should all do a booth together.

1226
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,460
Yeah, that would be pretty cool.

1227
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,380
That would be so sick. Yeah, please, please.

1228
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,540
But did I have I talked about what a fucking nightmare

1229
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,620
it was trying to peddle my comics in like stores?

1230
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,900
Yeah, I think you have talked about it, but it's been a while.

1231
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,580
I remember I remember during years ago during RFCK.

1232
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,580
No, I'm retrieval con.

1233
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,860
We walked around one of the shops where you had put in

1234
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,700
like you had given the owner of the store

1235
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,980
the vapors chapter one or something

1236
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,900
and Munchie and everyone like conspired to like ask the guy

1237
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,940
like one at a time like, hey, have you seen the Vapors by Ben St.

1238
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,500
to just try and give him the idea to intercept the idea

1239
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,980
that Ben St. is a big deal and that you should buy more comics from him.

1240
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:40,100
You get this one guy to be like, hmm, who is this Ben St.

1241
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,420
fellow? Yeah, the I don't know.

1242
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,420
The thing about, man, I would go from store to store.

1243
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,180
I would I would like look up like comic stores.

1244
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,820
They sell comic books in in Boston.

1245
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,580
OK, and I would go into the city and I'm OK.

1246
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,580
I'm going to hit this place, hit this place, at this place.

1247
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,020
And each time they'd be like, hmm, I don't know who you are.

1248
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,180
But if you want to give me like three copies,

1249
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,980
I'll give you like three dollars a piece for them.

1250
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,580
And I was like, yes, but I'm legit now.

1251
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:12,580
I'm published. I'm in stores, baby.

1252
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,780
It was a giant waste of time.

1253
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,820
I will never do it again.

1254
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,340
The only the only way it's the only way it's worth it is if you have

1255
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,500
a distributor who will like, you know, yeah, lobby these people for you,

1256
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,700
put you in a fucking catalog or something.

1257
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,740
There's like the rewards.

1258
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,260
They're just not they're not willing to like

1259
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,420
stock your comic in bulk if they don't know who you are.

1260
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,700
And why would they?

1261
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,700
And it's just not worth it's not worth the fucking

1262
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,980
bus ticket to go into town and like, yeah,

1263
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,460
sell like twelve dollars worth of shit.

1264
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,340
Spend it on lunch and then come home in the red.

1265
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,220
So it was a bit of a bug.

1266
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,140
You know, I tried to do that with the comic store in my city.

1267
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,260
Yeah. How to go?

1268
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,540
They didn't know who I was and they just basically told me like,

1269
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,780
maybe if you send us something in an email,

1270
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,900
I tried to explain to them that I have the many subs,

1271
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,060
but they did not really care.

1272
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,820
And do you know who I am?

1273
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,540
I mean, these kind of guys who run like comic book shops and stuff,

1274
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:23,180
like their their brain is just like diamond numbers and that's it.

1275
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,220
They don't give a shit about like the Internet.

1276
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,580
So I mean, they're not going to understand the language we're talking.

1277
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,500
They're no like incident.

1278
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,140
They're in they're in the physical.

1279
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,860
They're in the physical media business.

1280
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,060
I imagine I mean, like I imagine that they are

1281
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:44,460
right because like their sales in store are not going to be dependent on like

1282
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,860
how well known someone is elsewhere or on the Internet.

1283
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:52,180
I mean, there's going to be some people who come in looking for a specific thing.

1284
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:56,620
And those are going to be either like the classics or they're going to be like some

1285
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,580
something from like a new like up and comer, right?

1286
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,180
And there's probably only so many of those in like a year.

1287
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:05,180
And then other than that, their sales are just going to be

1288
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,260
people that come in, don't know what they want

1289
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,660
and see something that looks appealing on the shelf, right?

1290
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,460
And they're just going to make like a I guess I'll buy that

1291
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,380
because why not?

1292
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:20,420
So, you know, that's like a whole like mindset.

1293
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,580
That's like that I don't understand.

1294
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,660
Imagine selling things in a store.

1295
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,780
I don't it's so removed.

1296
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,940
It's so removed from from what it's kind of antiquated with the Internet.

1297
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:36,460
But like, you know, we just it's the digital market is still there, I guess.

1298
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:40,220
I mean, if people are still making their living, I guess it's not the fuck.

1299
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,340
If people if it still works, then it's the conclusion.

1300
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,820
Yeah, boomers bad.

1301
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:51,820
Yeah. Well, no, no, it's all bad new good.

1302
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,180
What? What?

1303
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,700
That's like the opposite of the marching orders of this podcast.

1304
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,260
I'm going to disagree.

1305
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,580
I'm going to I disagree.

1306
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:03,460
I I think I I even though I don't do it,

1307
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,980
I think that the idea of like a physical store is nice.

1308
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,180
And, you know, I don't know.

1309
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,420
There's surely there's a surely there's room.

1310
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,020
There's room in this world for brick and mortar retail.

1311
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:20,340
Like it fulfills some some need like community that that that, you know,

1312
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,100
you know, we're all just old right now.

1313
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,220
I feel like anyone under the age of twenty four is probably listening to this,

1314
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:27,020
like being what the fuck are you talking about?

1315
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,540
Just Amazon it.

1316
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,460
I mean, Amazon. No, no.

1317
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,180
Give us give the zoomers more more credit.

1318
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,940
You can't Amazon a sense of community, Tom.

1319
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:40,980
You can't you can't or you can't call up Jeff Bezos and say,

1320
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,580
I'd like ten slices of hot, cheesy belonging.

1321
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,420
It just it just doesn't happen.

1322
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,780
The text isn't there yet.

1323
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,500
I don't think there's any of us.

1324
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,340
They haven't built it.

1325
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:54,620
They haven't built a drone for it yet.

1326
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,620
We have a minute.

1327
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,820
We have a vtuber in our very presence right now.

1328
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:03,140
We are looking in the eye, the community online being built in real time in front of us.

1329
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,340
It's only a matter of time before what you're talking about is a relic of the past.

1330
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,380
No, no.

1331
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,460
The future is not old man.

1332
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,420
No, no, it's not.

1333
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,100
No, we're thirty.

1334
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,940
We're thirty one, Ben.

1335
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,940
We're thirty one.

1336
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:16,780
We don't matter.

1337
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,540
I'm thirty two, fucker.

1338
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,700
Oh, well, okay.

1339
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,620
I'm just making my case for me, bro.

1340
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,860
Have you guys heard of Project Melody?

1341
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,660
What's that?

1342
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,260
Yeah.

1343
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,980
Yes, that sounds familiar.

1344
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,900
Vtuber porn.

1345
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,060
It's the first Vtuber camera.

1346
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:36,820
Yeah.

1347
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,260
And all the all the all the regular cam girls got mad because like

1348
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,700
Project Melody immediately crushed their numbers and revenue.

1349
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,460
It's amazing.

1350
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,540
She debuted and on Chatterbait,

1351
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:53,060
she hit number one immediately and everyone got really mad

1352
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:56,420
because all the all the cam girls were going to get replaced by robots.

1353
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:02,060
Basically, the automation is here, except it's it's with an animated character.

1354
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,140
This is why we needed Yang.

1355
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,100
And we spurned him.

1356
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,820
You're beyond for cam girls.

1357
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,860
This is why would you?

1358
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,380
OK, I don't know.

1359
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,420
Like you're making you're making this lady.

1360
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,420
You're like, this is going to be my little my little puppet,

1361
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,820
my little my little internet fuck puppet.

1362
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:23,980
I'm going to whore her out.

1363
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,980
I'm going to prostitute her on the internet.

1364
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:28,340
And she I mean, that's what it is.

1365
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,380
I mean, you're not wrong.

1366
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,340
I don't I don't want to come on.

1367
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,740
I don't want to come on.

1368
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,820
That's not me. That's not me being anti sex worker or anything.

1369
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,180
But like that is what that is.

1370
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,300
What's going on? I'm just saying, why would you do this?

1371
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,140
And why? Why would you?

1372
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,660
I don't understand why her bust size is so modest is what I'm saying.

1373
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,100
Like you could look like anything and you and you went and you went modest with it.

1374
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,380
I think I think it's because it might actually be.

1375
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,380
Why wouldn't you go hand?

1376
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:59,260
To appeal to the most amount of people, a lot of people get really upset

1377
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,780
when there's big badonka donkers,

1378
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,540
when there's big badonkas.

1379
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,700
Oh, oh, my God, her back.

1380
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,780
Oh, no, that's that's not healthy, bro.

1381
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,260
That's fucked up. This is torture.

1382
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,660
That's all you know.

1383
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,140
The girl I told you about, the female artist I work with,

1384
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,580
we see me, she gets so many comments like that.

1385
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,100
That's oh, my God, her back.

1386
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,460
Like, like, like this is anatomically impossible or something.

1387
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,620
Like, shut up.

1388
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,540
An anime face is anatomically impossible.

1389
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,700
Nobody complains about that.

1390
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,540
Did you know? Yeah, the eyes wouldn't even.

1391
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,540
The eyes are so big, there's no brain.

1392
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,540
There's no space for the brain.

1393
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,940
I think they should just why not just consider them.

1394
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,100
Yeah, aliens with giant tits. Yeah.

1395
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:48,340
But where's that image of like a photo of like a grainy picture of an alien

1396
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:51,340
and then they overlay and anime girl is the exact same proportions.

1397
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,500
Yeah, that's the thing I'm talking about.

1398
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,420
Yeah, I have not.

1399
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,500
Literally true.

1400
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,500
I have not seen that, but I was I was on the cutting edge

1401
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:02,260
of all that stuff when I made the the punk only fans,

1402
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:06,380
the the cartoon character, stick figure, pumpkin girl.

1403
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,900
And I made money off of it.

1404
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:14,420
You still any any any.

1405
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,580
That's criminal.

1406
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,460
It's quite interesting.

1407
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,180
Do you do you guys think that VTubing

1408
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,700
like VTuber characters might replace real streamers?

1409
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,100
Well, I think there's always going to be a place for a real face.

1410
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:32,420
But for everybody, I think what it's it's doing is the people who otherwise

1411
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,620
wouldn't want to be seen on camera are now able to easily have a character

1412
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,300
that is like attractive looking in some fashion.

1413
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,500
Like it's they can make it look exactly however you like.

1414
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,300
So the amount of streamers doing that will just flood the market.

1415
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:53,460
And the people with real faces will be overshadowed.

1416
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,460
Just by quantity, I think.

1417
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:02,460
I mean, I feel like even Pokemon did it.

1418
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:09,460
Yeah, I mean, I think it will probably take up some of the current

1419
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,460
of like the non VTube streamer market.

1420
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:15,460
But, you know, it won't.

1421
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,460
I mean, the the the the there's too many.

1422
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,460
There's always going to be space for German 985 always.

1423
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,460
Right.

1424
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,460
Right.

1425
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,460
Yeah, it's it'll split.

1426
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,460
It'll split the market, but it won't, you know.

1427
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,460
Yeah, I don't think it'll outright replace it, but it'll definitely become

1428
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,460
a significant portion of I mean, it already is.

1429
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,460
Yeah, I think it'll just become more and more mainstream.

1430
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,460
Guys, I have an answer for you.

1431
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,460
I think they're getting.

1432
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,460
I think I think VTubers are going to replace everyone.

1433
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:42,460
All humans.

1434
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:43,460
You know why?

1435
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,460
You know what?

1436
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,460
I have proof.

1437
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,460
I have proof.

1438
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,460
All right.

1439
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,460
What's the proof?

1440
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,460
Ben's lecture.

1441
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,460
What?

1442
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,460
What?

1443
01:09:54,460 --> 01:10:01,460
In the ending of Pastel Defender Heliotrope, the whole world is virtual and everyone's

1444
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,460
using a virtual avatar.

1445
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:04,460
They.

1446
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,460
Oh God.

1447
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:06,460
Yeah.

1448
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,460
Well, that's pastel.

1449
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,460
This is this is Mundus Mundus.

1450
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,460
Okay.

1451
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:16,460
We've got we've got we don't have to be condemned to the same to the same fate.

1452
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,460
I for one, accept it.

1453
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:23,460
I guess they are kind of using they're like, yeah, they're like raw data.

1454
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:27,460
They're like like these like abstract like data structures just kind of floating in

1455
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:31,460
some sort of like information information void.

1456
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,460
I don't know.

1457
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,460
It's it's yeah.

1458
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:39,460
I guess I guess on the way towards that perfect like future of leaving our bodies.

1459
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:40,460
VTubing.

1460
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,460
It's just like Oscar brain.

1461
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,460
VTubing.

1462
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,460
You just know what that is.

1463
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:45,460
Intermediate step.

1464
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,460
A metro is like the the nesting dolls.

1465
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,460
Yeah.

1466
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,460
So there's this concept in sci-fi called a matrioshka brain.

1467
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:59,460
The idea is we build a megastructure around a sun that powers computers that just run

1468
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,460
our brains.

1469
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:04,460
And then we all have fun and VR forever.

1470
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,460
What happens when the sun explodes?

1471
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,460
I guess we all explode.

1472
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:11,460
I mean, that would happen whether you're virtual or not.

1473
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:14,460
We're already kind of fucked when the sun explodes.

1474
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,460
We just zooshes up to another star.

1475
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:21,460
I mean, it's a few billion years or something.

1476
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,460
Right.

1477
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,460
Yeah.

1478
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,460
Wait, I don't.

1479
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,460
Okay.

1480
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,460
Okay.

1481
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,460
I understand.

1482
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:30,460
Imagine being in the digital realm for a billion years.

1483
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,460
Based.

1484
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,460
Was there like that thing where they're trying to like do time dilation.

1485
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,460
So like time in a virtual space goes by slower than real life.

1486
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,460
So you can do like years and like an hour or something in real in the real world.

1487
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,460
That's what we need.

1488
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,460
That's the close.

1489
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,460
That's the hyperbolic time chamber.

1490
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,460
Right.

1491
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:50,460
But you would flex your digital muscles and therefore gain.

1492
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,460
So cool.

1493
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,460
I understand.

1494
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:53,460
So like gain and tell.

1495
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:57,460
Imagine going into the time chamber for 10 years doing nothing but drawing and then come

1496
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:02,460
out in five minutes of pass and you go in a child at drawing and come out a fucking god.

1497
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,460
They have that in Dragon Ball.

1498
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,460
Yeah.

1499
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,460
Yeah.

1500
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,460
Hyperbolic time chamber.

1501
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,460
But then you still spent five years like you're still five years older.

1502
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,460
No.

1503
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,460
Because like your brain is just processing time differently.

1504
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,220
So like when you come back out into the physical world only a couple hours have passed like

1505
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,460
your perception of time in the virtual space is different.

1506
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:25,460
And that's that's there even a physical world at that point.

1507
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:29,460
Are we always why would you why would you even bother with the physical world then.

1508
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,460
Right.

1509
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:33,660
I mean at that point you wouldn't have to like you could argue at that point to take

1510
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:39,020
it like that would be if that would be assuming the physical reality is still prominent but

1511
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:43,580
like the eventual end game to that be everybody exists in virtual world and your lifespan is

1512
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:47,540
now like hundreds if not thousands of years which would be fucking sick.

1513
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:52,740
You know the thing I always get scared about like just thinking about this this putting

1514
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:58,300
a brain in the digital realm so it can do anything at once forever is like from the

1515
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:03,180
perspective of someone on the outside you know like all right the person in queue to

1516
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:09,420
be brain digitized is in front of me and then they go into the thing and then they

1517
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:14,580
decide to do nothing because they have no you know they can do anything they want and

1518
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,180
they decide to do nothing forever.

1519
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:22,220
Well I mean people do nothing for their oh all of all of the all of the the ideas they

1520
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:26,940
had all of the plans they had there's no real reason to do any of them anymore so they just

1521
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:27,940
they just don't.

1522
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:31,420
I mean people do nothing with their entire life as it stands now I feel like it would

1523
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:35,660
still be a net positive like you'll still have people who aren't motivated but that

1524
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:42,620
just gives them more time to possibly find some sort of motivation and if you're in

1525
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:45,940
a virtual world you wouldn't have to worry about your body decaying and breaking down

1526
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:50,940
on you which makes that endeavor more difficult as you gain more experience like wouldn't

1527
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:55,820
it suck to be like 50 something finally like want to like oh man I really want to do like

1528
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:59,780
a physical activity like that's what like my passion life always was I was just too afraid

1529
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,620
to do it but now you're 50 something and you're just broken and you can't do it anymore like

1530
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:08,900
that blows like being organic sucks kill physical bodies virtual reality.

1531
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:16,780
Yeah that's that's why I that's why I would like prefer to like to go halfway and be like

1532
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:22,940
cyborg so that you can augment your physical body I don't think rather than computing your

1533
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:23,940
entire consciousness.

1534
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:27,900
Oh I don't think we should ever digitize our consciousness I think the proper way to

1535
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:32,940
do it would be like the brain and nervous system still exist we would just like have

1536
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,980
that connect directly to a virtual reality and hopefully we'd have some sort of nanomachines

1537
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:42,500
or artificial stem cells that could continually repair the like necessary organic components

1538
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:47,660
that keep our bodies going while our minds exist entirely in a virtual space or entirely

1539
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:53,980
within like a machine body because as soon as you digitize your brain it's an artificial

1540
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:59,620
copy and you are technically dead like you are your brain and nervous system yeah I can

1541
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:04,860
I can one up you you don't even need a virtual space you know what you need you just need

1542
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:12,180
a you just need your brain to get taken out put into some sort of like containment unit

1543
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:17,580
that'll keep the brain alive for as long as possible then you just get your brain to through

1544
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:22,580
some sort of artificial means just pump dopamine you experience nothing but you experience

1545
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:29,660
fulfillment forever I mean that's so fucking scary I've seen I've seen I've seen that that's

1546
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:32,940
like the prototype for the matrix right that was what they said in that movie that they

1547
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:37,140
first tried to make utopia but it didn't work because humans like necessarily need suffering

1548
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,140
anything which I think is probably bullshit but like for the rules of that world that's

1549
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:45,420
what their initial idea was it's not a utopia it's just a the brain is just it's dormant

1550
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:50,540
it's just got it's just got its fulfillment glands activated or whatever it is it is as

1551
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:56,900
equivalent to death in my eyes I've seen things like that yeah I'm like it really it really

1552
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:01,960
forces you to grapple with what is the per you know what is life if you are perfectly

1553
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:07,940
content and do nothing forever so in one of my comedy really be called life in one of

1554
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:16,580
my comics which is like an anarcho-capitalistic utopia I wrote yeah so in that one everything's

1555
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:21,380
run by this one guy called the director who's basically just Jeff Bezos except he actually

1556
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:28,340
owns all business which comic is that Crawling Dreams I thought so okay yeah I was gonna say

1557
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:34,500
it but I didn't want to embarrass myself his name is Jeff Barzo very thinly veiled Jeff

1558
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:39,940
Bizarro he's just called the director because he's the director of all businesses so basically

1559
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,580
and also all the police are just private security for this one company because the company owns

1560
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:52,900
everything anyway so in this world basically the way the plot is going is that everyone is going

1561
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:59,140
to be just working themselves to death so that at the moment they hit 60 they can become part of

1562
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:04,660
this like big tower that just like feeds their brain dopamine keeps them artificially alive and

1563
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:11,620
that's why everyone's working yeah gross that's retirement in this world that's retired that's

1564
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:18,900
pretty funny actually yeah it's like why bother with like yeah why bother with your normal

1565
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:24,100
mortal terrestrial retirement let's just skip to the good part just skip to the part yeah where you

1566
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:29,780
go on a dope event then you need a terrorist organization with cloud strife to blow up the

1567
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:39,780
brain tower hell yeah I don't know I guess I mean I'm obviously speaking supremely biased

1568
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,300
because like I'm living in like a physical body and like having to deal with all the struggles of

1569
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,860
modernity but it feels like to me that just like getting a fucking dopamine ivy and definitely

1570
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:54,660
seems like you're almost not even alive at that point like when you lose your autonomy right like

1571
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:59,620
the whole purpose of like being alive I feel isn't so much like pleasure but like accomplishing

1572
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:03,460
something or like setting goals and trying to accomplish them I feel the same way even though

1573
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:08,100
I logically know it makes no sense to feel that way because all the reason we're doing anything

1574
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:14,420
is because of dopamine releases right yeah I guess on like an instinctual level that's true

1575
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:22,500
I don't want to be brand the broken I want to be like that is just brand the broken yeah

1576
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:30,180
like I feel nothing oh you're your shit fuck you brand stupid when when when we're all

1577
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:37,540
dopamine soaked brains in a big tower then we'll say oh man uh new bad old good remember having

1578
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:43,380
physical bodies guys remember back when we did things remember death death was so cool that was

1579
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:50,260
so base like what a great motivation remember pain you know I don't remember pain I kind of feel

1580
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:55,460
nostalgic about it I want to I want to cause pain let's let's go back yeah yeah super villains are

1581
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,460
born everyone tries to kill each other everything just keeps going in cycles

1582
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:09,620
idea for a comic it's just it's just the day-to-day lives of a bunch of brains floating in a

1583
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:16,740
van that's all kind of be like hmm how will I stimulate my neurons today it's like uh uh rich

1584
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:24,900
richard you stimulated my fucking my my my pain center ah he quit that he knocked it off like

1585
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,940
ha ha I have I fucking jacked into the to the control center I can give you a little zap

1586
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:35,460
and it's uh it's very funny it's very goofy you know there's a bunch of can they be a girl so I'll

1587
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:42,180
have that done by tomorrow yeah no anime anime girl versions their eyes are too big there's no

1588
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:47,620
brain it's true we did anime girl versions of emotions it's just inside out but they're all

1589
01:19:47,620 --> 01:20:00,980
girls this time no no thank you to fucking uh kitchen after this podcast apparently we're

1590
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:06,100
gonna get pressured into it by our viewers I I don't know when I will have the time but I am

1591
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:11,620
I mean I have the software I asked mage about it because mage made a made a well he's made two

1592
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:17,140
actually I was gonna say like there's 3d versus 2d vtubers right like you can do a 3d model or you

1593
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:22,340
can do like a live 2d rig I'm assuming Mary you're using the live 2d one right now yeah all right

1594
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:29,860
I I've got a questions to ask um for the setup with the webcam and lighting how how important is

1595
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:37,780
that to be like high quality video feed the guy at the store told me that 4k is best but I don't

1596
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:44,900
really believe him anymore do you I mean do you have like I don't yeah do you worry about like

1597
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:50,500
do you have to like keep your face well lit and stuff so that it like tracks or do you just

1598
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:56,260
like not that big of a deal you want to try I'm gonna I can try turning off the light oh and then

1599
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:03,540
we see you okay oh I mean yeah I'm sorry okay but like you don't have any like you don't have any

1600
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:10,020
like track lighting or like spotlighting or whatever okay is that enough yeah because I I'm

1601
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:15,220
think that my webcam I have is really a terrible old piece of shit and I'm not sure because I I got

1602
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:20,980
this this one program which is not the program that people use when I was looking into it and it

1603
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:28,500
didn't work at all um I will get live 2d at some point nice I'm gonna have to build all of the pieces

1604
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:37,540
and look at tutorial videos so like I use I use face rig face rig yeah well face live 2d is the

1605
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:44,500
one for like making the puppet and face rig is for like doing yeah tracking like something I haven't

1606
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,180
yeah I don't know that much about it I just I may just told me a little bit about how it works so

1607
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:57,780
there's all these like really creepy characters on face right what yeah oh god oh no what has happened

1608
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:06,580
oh yes I think oh there's isn't there a wolf with a gamer headset do you have that one

1609
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:13,460
whoa that one seems super good we eat things traveling I like I like the cheeseburger

1610
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:22,500
oh no oh my god okay I don't remember I don't remember these that's scary all right well

1611
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:31,140
terrifying we don't have to we don't have to do all that come back for all the cherub next time

1612
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:39,860
I looked I looked at um yeah the 3d I guess the one that the 3d one is called vroid is for making

1613
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:48,580
your 3d model yeah I looked at that and it's really neat how it's like a sort of user friendly art

1614
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:55,140
program that is like specifically designed for like 3d sculpting like an anime character

1615
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:59,380
oh I tried to make one I just didn't want an anime character is the annoying thing I wanted to make

1616
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:07,780
like a like a one of my characters in my style yeah I would I would want a 2d one for sure

1617
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:13,140
I feel like if you're trying to do a custom like art style the 2d one makes more sense

1618
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:20,260
I I think it just looks like the program looks like a lot of fun to just like fuck around with

1619
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:26,660
and like try to push the limits of and see like what happens if I make it like this what if I

1620
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:31,380
like fuck around with it like this like how how much can I get away with in terms of like

1621
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:39,940
what it will accept as like a face you know what I mean uh uh uh oh the way live 2d works

1622
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:45,700
see like you you separate out each uh each part of the drawing right and that's how it

1623
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:50,500
kind of maps everything so as long as you have like some sort of shape for the eye it will animate

1624
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:55,460
it and treat it like an eye I would assume I don't think the aesthetic matters too much but I haven't

1625
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:01,940
looked into it I'm just kind of making baseless assumptions I suppose yeah I don't know uh uh I

1626
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:08,420
assume you tell it like okay I assume that like live uh uh or face rig probably has a bunch of like

1627
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:14,340
preset with like nose like where to place like your eyebrows like your corners of your eyes you

1628
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:18,740
know your nose your nostrils corners of your mouth chin lips whatever I think you like put

1629
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:23,860
tracking points on there to define like where those are relative to a normal face yeah yeah and then

1630
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:28,660
it's like maybe you have like the mouth layer and it like you know that one's controlled like on top

1631
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:35,140
of it or something and uh you know the whatever yeah I don't fucking yeah you're uh Mary you're um

1632
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:45,300
dog boy excuse me um is is that oh it's a social faux pas uh yeah is that like a

1633
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:54,580
like a pre-built thing because it looks very slick very professional and and custom oh custom so

1634
01:24:55,460 --> 01:25:02,660
who drew it uh Japanese artist named Kirito cool Kirito how many layers does that need

1635
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:06,980
because I noticed when you move your torso a bit there's like a like a fake 3d-ness

1636
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:16,580
to to the the a lot of a lot of layers yeah yeah let me let me let me let me give you an expression

1637
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:29,860
that shows a lot of layers oh my god I don't even I really I like I like how you you can I don't know

1638
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:36,500
I I like when the hair moves I like how the hair kind of you I think you can tell the hair like

1639
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:41,860
how to behave like how flowy to be and stuff like how to like follow the character or something

1640
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:46,100
yeah there's a lot to it there's a lot to it that I really want to dig into just because I think it

1641
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:52,420
looks interesting I have a I have a rigor for it who like makes edits to it and plays around with

1642
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:58,260
like the the different moods you can get on this character so the most recent addition has been

1643
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:10,820
um my ears yeah I I saw I saw and I was shocked I saw it wait who's who's the girl that you do

1644
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:21,460
streams with Lumi Lumi yeah yeah I saw her uh uh I think she put a video on Twitter the other day

1645
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:28,260
and I noticed her she has a hand yeah and I'm like how how how the fuck does she how the

1646
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:34,340
fuck does it know where her hand is yeah the in that 3d we had to thing yeah there I think

1647
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:40,020
there was a thing where you could like have a button to have a hand motion or maybe use your

1648
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:46,900
hands wave them in front and like the 3d model would also wave its hand um in the same way we're

1649
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:55,940
doing it is a the way we're doing it is a special glove oh like okay I was I thought maybe because

1650
01:26:55,940 --> 01:27:03,220
like it it would have to know it has to know like if you if you didn't have like a glove with sensors

1651
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:07,540
or something it would have to like be able to know like when the hand comes on screen versus

1652
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:16,180
when it goes off screen and then to like recalibrate like which finger is which finger and yeah so is

1653
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:23,220
it kind of like a VR sort of glove yeah yeah okay a lot of the equipment is also used for VR

1654
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:28,580
games and stuff yeah yeah yeah I had I had thought about it I had thought about like I wonder if they

1655
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:32,180
can have hands I would like to make one with hands and I was like I haven't seen any with hands and

1656
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:39,380
then I saw I saw Lumi moving her hand around I was like oh my god what technology has gone too far

1657
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:47,300
uh you should see like some of the some of the vtubers actually they like they can do dances

1658
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:53,700
and stuff with their characters like full body dancing yeah they have a full body VR suits

1659
01:27:54,900 --> 01:28:03,940
like in like in ready say ready player go just is that what project melody has I think so yeah she

1660
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:10,500
must be fully functional if you know what I'm saying the funny thing when I when I like wave

1661
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:19,940
my hand in front of my model it goes crazy look whoa whoa whoa it's like interrupting the tracking

1662
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:25,060
of your face yeah so it doesn't know what to do yeah when I when I fucked around with face rig I

1663
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:31,780
was using some of those those hideous 3d default models and I think it it was either the lighting

1664
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:37,700
or just the crappiness of my webcam that it like it had a little bit of trouble like it had a little

1665
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:43,620
bit of trouble like following me like where like wherever I moved sometimes it would kind of like

1666
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:49,780
lose track of where my face was and just kind of jump back to like default position yeah and I was

1667
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:56,340
like I assume I have to like really have a nice like clear like camera setup that's like very easy

1668
01:28:56,660 --> 01:29:02,500
for the computer to understand or I would need to maybe like go in and do some like custom fiddling

1669
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:08,260
with the like the rigging to like I don't know so it like matches like the shape of my face better

1670
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:17,940
or something like that I don't know uh yeah it's very it's very neat it's very cool uh I'm not afraid

1671
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:22,900
of technology I welcome it uh uh damn

1672
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:30,420
so uh how you guys you know if we are all yeah if we are if we all become anime girls and all

1673
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:39,540
donate to each other it'll basically be like what yang not wanted yang the automation is to take our

1674
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:45,540
job it's gonna take our streaming jobs next wait if we all donate to each other then wouldn't just

1675
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:52,580
paypal get loads of money oh it will go up to Elon musk no no is he not the paypal man anymore

1676
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:57,140
I don't know I don't think but he's the one he likes anime too so maybe he'll be he'll be willing

1677
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:03,380
but this is long con he's the one who's secretly financing face rig so he'll be like the next

1678
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:11,540
fucking tesla rocket a launch will have like an elon musk anime girl vtuber narrating it nice

1679
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:20,740
ah elon musk would have a fucking you know he liked one of my comics ones

1680
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:29,460

1681
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:33,860
that one but someone someone must have brought it to his attention I almost considered because

1682
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:38,820
there's like a tesla store nearby I almost considered going there asking them for a free tesla

1683
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:44,580
because elon liked me on twitter elon liked my tweet I think I believe in your company policy

1684
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:54,420
it says uh one elon like is worth one tesla three tesla yes yes i think that could work if you just

1689
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:30,100
yeah save those I want those actually send them in the send them in the mail and I heard that

1690
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:35,220
that crows can recognize your face if you feed them for long enough and then they'll bring you

1691
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:42,820
trinkets yep no shit yeah crows are very smart they I think I remember a story of like a girl who

1692
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:51,300
fed the crows a lot and the crows all knew her in the community like the crows talked to each

1693
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:55,780
other about this is the girl she was she had a lot of cloud in the crow she did she literally had a

1694
01:31:55,780 --> 01:32:01,780
lot of crow clouds ironically yeah and they would protect her from bullies that's I don't think that

1695
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:08,580
part happened no they're like now you when you say that I imagine that like some bullies are coming

1696
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:14,820
and the crows like all like flock to her and like form like a big suit around no all the crows all

1697
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:19,540
the crows like show up behind like behind her and like eye down this bully they're like do you want

1698
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,780
to learn why we're called a murder of crows and then just beat the fuck out of them you know you

1699
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:29,860
know in Naruto how how like gara had like the sand that would like always protect him from any

1700
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:34,420
attack it's like that but like a flock of crows yeah she carries a stream of water bottle of

1701
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:41,940
filled with crows on our back this gourd of crows she has like a giant a big like I don't know a big

1702
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:47,540
like like bird feeder like a maybe a big like log with like seed like glued to it with peanut butter

1703
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:54,020
or something it's just covered with crows the crows like seeds they must birds like seeds

1704
01:32:54,980 --> 01:33:02,420
yeah that's the one thing I know about birds they like seeds seems fair uh yeah my my weeks my

1705
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:10,500
multiple days of of stuff have been mostly just fucking around playing video games and

1706
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:18,020
thinking so hard thinking every day about um the bell jpeg book of my first comic it's all part of

1707
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:23,780
the process that I that I made the first page in photoshop I was like ah I see I could I could

1708
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:29,220
put the the text here and then I could put the page number up here and I could be exactly the same

1709
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:34,340
as the the homestuck physical versions where it has the little author comments at the bottom

1710
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:39,860
and I was like I'm gonna write author comments I tried to write one I'm like oh no I'm stupid

1711
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:48,100
though I can't write this is this is not gonna work I think yeah I was thinking of doing I was

1712
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:53,380
considering doing something similar with slime and punishment and I think that I could I think I would

1713
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:59,060
find it pretty not a brag or anything but I could probably write them very well I feel like I know

1714
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:10,660
exactly what I an egg yeah maybe um I boys I'm back at it I'm lifting again I'm fucking ripped

01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:03,700
they reduce my benefits like they cut me but it's okay I'm gonna I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make

1734
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:12,340
it just fine um but yeah super powerful super strong uh sucks to be you guys uh well I get on

1748
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:53,140
of pectin and mono calcium phosphate that's all I have to say about that the pectin the pectin

1749
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:58,740
really really brings out the flavor really imparts a little bit more of that candy consistency

1750
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:04,980
so it doesn't just taste like hard jello uh and it helps the flavors shine a lot more it's very

1751
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:10,420
really on to something one of these days I have to partake in your science experiments they've

1752
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:14,180
they've evolved the ones I'm making now are like nothing like the old ones I feel like

1753
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:18,420
I'm gonna have there I'm gonna have like I'm gonna have to make like mark one mark two mark three

oh okay yeah that's quite far in and this guy who doesn't wash his hand throws axes at her

1796
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:13,300
doesn't wash his hand yeah he doesn't wash his hand um because he wears a gloves vandodecken

1797
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:18,180
his power is to throw something and it will always meet its mark and he's touched shirahoshi

1798
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:23,380
so he doesn't touch anything on that hand again so that he can throw things at it forever oh right

1799
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:29,780
that's his secret plan you forgot about that you're such a one piece idiot Ben

1800
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:39,300
shirahoshi is the best uh girl design she's the same as all of the others she's just bigger

1801
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:44,260
she isn't wait wait wait no no no I'm not thinking who was her mom the queen otohime

1802
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:50,740
otohime is my favorite that's what I meant yeah she was great she's sick she's sick as

1803
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:57,460
is she big too no she's small I think the next you along is the big one she's she's

1804
01:43:57,460 --> 01:44:04,100
otohime is kind of big but not like big big she's like one piece small aka like eight feet tall

1805
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:12,100
saw a tweet the other day uh that was like well it was a visual diagram but the long

1806
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:20,820
and short of it was what if all the big people in one piece like uh uh um like uh donky hote and uh

1807
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:27,940
who's the fucking nightmare guy the shadow guy shadow guy yeah on on thriller bark

1808
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:34,740
oh gecko moria the shishibukai yeah like what if all the big people like donky hote and gecko moria

1809
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:39,940
are actually just normal sized people and people like zoro and luffy are just tiny they're just like

1810
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:47,140
three feet tall that's funny makes makes you think can't disprove it that's just well you can't

1811
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:56,420
disprove it because he said how tall they are um maybe maybe the the planet is lying like like

1812
01:44:56,420 --> 01:45:01,300
like this is people like the gravity is different maybe the plant's quite small so like people grow

1813
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:09,700
really big because the gravity doesn't squish them that much and the the yeah the luffy maybe the

1814
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:15,140
maybe the planet in one piece is flat how what do you think about that why would they sail around the

1815
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:20,500
grand line makes a lot of sense actually yeah you know i don't know it makes no sense there is there

1816
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:25,940
is no red line it's just there's just the there's just the dirt wall there's where's the car there's

1817
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:37,060
just the car you see the curve the whole time no oda has never drawn the curve oh water finds

1818
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:43,940
it's impossible he refuses to draw the curve because he knows he knows one of my uh one of

1819
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:50,180
my favorite things recently is watching like flatter of his own videos on youtube oh i i

1820
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:58,260
it sounds like folding ideas really big it's a whole genre of like videos and it's got its own

1821
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:05,220
like youtube creators and it's got its own keemstar figure it's really funny oh my god yeah okay that's

1822
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:11,700
that's pretty funny the anti-flatter scene i didn't know about that so there's this one guy called

1823
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:20,580
si man dan and um so some of the flat earth is called him satan man dan okay okay oh because he

1824
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:25,940
is a heretic i guess yeah and one of them has this like obsession with walt disney

1825
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:31,460
for the flatters or the anti-flatter the the flat earth is they have this obsession

1826
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:36,020
with walt disney because they think he's like part of the worldwide conspiracy so they call him walt

1827
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:44,020
hitler yeah okay donald duck uh it's all in that one cartoon

1828
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:53,700
i um you know the last flat earth thing i watched was the uh uh the one the new the newest video

1829
01:46:53,700 --> 01:47:00,100
from uh in you and not any i always confuse them folding yeah i watched that one and he went further

1830
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:08,020
than just like how it's for earth is round idiot it was like it was like the whole reason that people

1831
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:16,420
fall into these types of ideas and the the sort of desire of of wanting to make sense of the world

1832
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:25,460
and all of the dangers that come with that i wish the earth was flat yeah then i could throw

1833
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:32,340
like a rock wouldn't it wouldn't make a difference i mean the and if if some of their theory is to

1834
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:39,460
be believed the Antarctic would be like um would be all surrounding us like a giant ice wall to just

1835
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:45,060
kept us out and maybe there would be maybe there would be more worlds with more what if what if

1836
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:52,020
the real world is like minecraft and if you get past that point it starts like the the world's

1837
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:59,620
generation starts fucking up yeah you go into the far lands of real life but nobody's ever

1838
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:05,380
made it that far because it's too cold and they always turn around all i know the earth is flat

1839
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:13,620
nobody's proven otherwise no one can convince me i don't know that's not true that's not true

1840
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:17,220
because in that video i mentioned he literally proves that the earth is round so never mind

1841
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:24,980
now the the earth is the game of thrones intro it's upside inside out earth

1842
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:30,420
it's inside out it's like halo but a sphere it's sphero

1843
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:40,900
it's like it's like a hey it's like a ring but if the ring was like yeah

1844
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:48,580
toward yeah yeah rotated 360 degrees extended in a polar sort of fashion i would be interested to

1845
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:55,140
see how that would look rendered like i've always loved the way halo looks when you see the the ring

1846
01:48:55,140 --> 01:49:00,820
in the distance going all the way up do you um do you guys have any more questions for

1847
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:09,780
oh i have a question here's an interview type question um you you say you write comics uh

1848
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:17,300
do how did you get your start we look in in in terms of like getting people to draw them for you

1849
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:25,620
i did you just have the money to do it or i have a follow-up question i have a follow-up

1850
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:34,500
question do you want me to answer first or yeah i wrote a i wrote a message that basically said

1851
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:40,740
i want to do a comic i have this and this budget and then i copy pasted it to 600 people on dvn

1852
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:50,100
die wow so i mean that's how you do it was your budget yeah um what what was your budget for the

1853
01:49:50,100 --> 01:50:00,740
first one like 200 dollars for like uh for like uh for like i don't know what the first one like

1854
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:09,380
what a yeah what did 200 dollars pay for basically nothing but it got you started and and now look

1855
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:16,420
at you i i was gonna say um um did you have like a did you have like a big break moment or something

1856
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:21,940
when like you went from like just doing this as a hobby to like was there like a moment when

1857
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:28,660
like you got like exposed and you were like uh hey i've sort of broken out into the into the

1858
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:38,100
it um industry i say in quotes it came in three waves yeah uh the first wave was after i'd gotten

1859
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:45,460
my job as a sales guy at a company uh i started having a lot more money to throw at comics so i

1860
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:51,860
could hire a much better artist and i did a comic with him and that comic was drawn really well and

1861
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:59,940
so i just marketed it like crazy on twitter and it gave me a lot of followers um the second wave

1862
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:09,540
came when i got Ushimi the girl who draws big tits um and nice yeah that that came that that is

1863
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:16,820
just that that's just why that i don't need to explain yeah and then the third wave was the

1864
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:24,100
third wave was when i started um doing uh internet exploratory and just like the meme characters

1865
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:31,060
yeah that was the first time i really did like a comic that was made just for twitter not like

1866
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:36,340
with a longer plot like it turned it turned into a series later but that was the first time i did

1867
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:44,660
like uh yeah when i i remember reading it and being surprised when it kind of like yeah it does

1868
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:52,340
it does develop a plot eventually and i was like oh oh shit okay yeah uh hmm so for the uh for the

1869
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:58,500
anniversary we got like a really good artist to come in and do like 180 panels worth of action

1907
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:52,340
to tom's patreon bonus podcast at patreon.com slash polystation two and here's some of how maybe he'd

1908
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:56,900
want to make a fighting game one day and it got me thinking a lot of times this kind of thing will

1909
01:56:56,900 --> 01:57:01,300
come up and the chat or comments will be like yeah i'd love to see a fighting game where i'm playing

1910
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:07,220
as my favorite pcb member and that'd be cool i guess but really i'd love to see a fighting game

1911
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:13,540
with your ocs as the playable characters especially if they were in their original art styles i would

1912
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:22,580
love to see a 3d a zoomy fighting a very simplistic 2d pump i want to see a black and white sophia

1913
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:28,980
having a zoning battle against saraya that's what i would love to see out of a pcb fighting game

1914
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:35,700
it'd be the most eclectic thing since angel i've actually thought about this and i would be all

1915
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:40,660
in for it i don't have making of making like a smash clone with all of our characters but i

1916
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:46,260
would just i don't dare i don't dare to imagine such a thing uh i do all the time it'll be so

1917
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:49,700
based i would run around i mean that's not even the first project i've thought about i thought

1918
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:54,420
about make doing like a deck building game based on uh all of our oc characters and like print out

1919
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:58,100
like a deck of cards with them a deck building game there's a lot of like floating around in my

1920
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:04,820
magic that sounds like sounds like some real nerd shit oh super nerd shit just make top trumps

1921
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:17,540
i have like the the you know top trumps no uh it's this very simplistic card game where uh there

1922
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:23,860
was all the rage back in the playground where it's just a list of things and there's a bunch of

1923
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:31,300
stats and the person just puts down and says i'm using this stat um like if it's like about

1924
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:38,900
cars it's like oh the acceleration number and then the person who goes next if they have a higher

1925
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:42,900
acceleration number they win and they take the cards and the winner is the one who takes all the

1926
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:52,100
cards it's a weird it's it's what the wait what the fuck so you just you is it it's hard to explain

1927
01:58:52,340 --> 01:59:00,420
and so so okay so so the card has it has a list of arbitrary numbers that are related to whatever

1928
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:05,700
the theme of the deck is like that they made so many of these things um there was one about dinosaurs

1929
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:13,300
one about cars harry potter fucking everything lord of the rings but but so the ultimate goal

1930
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:19,940
is just to have the yeah you have to put down your card and say which thing you're you're most

1931
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:26,580
confident in winning um it's like uh i put down this dinosaur and it's like i don't know height

1932
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:32,500
or whatever do you put it do you put it down not knowing what your yeah yeah it's a gamble whether

1933
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:36,900
you have the bigger card and sometimes you get a dinosaur that is really good at something and

1934
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:44,340
really bad at something else and if the other so okay so the you win by having the biggest number

1935
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:50,740
so i imagine that the goal then is to like save your big numbers for like when it really matters

1936
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:56,020
like when no i think you just have to use whatever is the at the top of your deck because you split

1937
01:59:56,020 --> 02:00:04,900
the deck in half oh so it's like war yeah war what's war yeah war is basically you split a

1938
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:10,180
deck of cards in half and then you just like flip cards at each other and like whoever's

1939
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:16,820
higher wins i guess so but um unlike a deck of cars they have multiple numbers you can choose on

1940
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:22,820
each card but wouldn't you always just choose the biggest one no because because because like um

1941
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:32,020
let's say it changes for every uh deck every themed card deck but like um sometimes like a

1942
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:37,540
thing that's really like if we're talking about cars something has really high top speed

1943
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:44,260
will have a really low something else and um you might have a car that has a low top speed but

1944
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:47,940
a really high of that something else i can't think of an example because i haven't looked at these

1945
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:54,260
acceleration or something something like that um and so you could strategically well actually

1946
02:00:54,260 --> 02:01:00,740
it's not really strategy so much as luck and then strategy it sounds like oh okay okay so so when

1947
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:06,660
you're flipping these card decks like you're both gonna have cards that are like themed about like

1948
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:12,420
cars yeah they're all cars in the whole day i was imagining that like you might have one guy flips

1949
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:20,180
like a you know Toyota Corolla with like acceleration 50 and like you know armor 10 or whatever and

1950
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:26,260
then the other guy flips over like uh uh you know mothra you know maximum flight flight speed you

1951
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:32,820
know 50 miles per hour yeah it doesn't special move uh sleep powder it doesn't work like that because

1952
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:40,020
the there are different numbers of stats in in different things yeah like cars have a lot of

1953
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:46,580
different numbers associated with them and some cars just really based i i learned about the

1954
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:52,740
McLaren i learned about all these these car of manufacturers names through this this stupid game

1955
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:58,820
interesting anyway that was a bigger side and meant nothing yeah i mean i was thinking something

1956
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:03,540
more along the lines of star realms but that's an interesting concept as well but anyways we're

1957
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:09,860
talking about a fighting game uh it would be cool it would be like the most titanic endeavor ever

1958
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:15,540
undertaken by all of us to buy i think buddy i was talking about man i was talking about uh

1959
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:23,140
a pcp not not pcp well yeah rom hacks pokemon rom hacks on the stream this week and about how like

1960
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:27,940
it's the kind of thing that i think about like oh what if someone made like a pcp pokemon rom

1961
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:34,420
hack or what if someone made like an rfck pokemon rom hack and it seems it seems just doable enough

1962
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:40,020
but then i know that like if if i were to try to do it it would be like oh this is actually a

1963
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:44,020
lot harder than i thought in all these different ways and it would probably end up taking like

1964
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:51,780
weeks months definitely years even yeah yeah that's everything yeah and like it's like what a what a

1965
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:58,660
shame if it were like to be half made and just like you really need a nightmare that that a

1966
02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:05,700
youngster energy where you can spend the entirety of your waking hours working on something and then

1967
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:13,540
not having to think about like eating because your parents will make it for you i mean i mean when i

1968
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:19,540
was in like college i like got rpg maker and i started working on i've probably talked about

1969
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:24,260
this right i started working on the christian weston chandler's adult chronicles i was trying

1970
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:29,300
to like make my own version of it and i put like a lot of time into that i made like sprites and

1971
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:34,820
stuff i made started making maps it was not even close to like a finished product and yet it was

1972
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:40,740
still like a pretty significant effort that i made towards it and like the shit takes a long time

1973
02:03:40,740 --> 02:03:47,540
it really really does oof i mean just to make that one room of venezuelan game took like the better

1974
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:53,380
part of a year of just like working it just it takes so that was you building the game mechanics

1975
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:58,180
at the same time right oh yeah there's a lot i mean there's a lot going on which is why it took so

1976
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:03,140
long yeah but like you could if you have mechanics and like an entire game if you were to make another

1977
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:08,180
room it wouldn't take as long for just that room no but like every time you enter you build like

1978
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:12,420
because like i started building a level on top of that and it's like okay i want this level to like

1979
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:16,900
because like the whole thing was supposed to take place in like a like an old factory or

1980
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:19,620
something and like all right so there's gonna be a little thing so you have to dodge it like we'll

1981
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:23,780
like crush you if you stand under them but like that has to be built out custom on top of like

1982
02:04:23,780 --> 02:04:27,780
everything else it's like okay so i know how to build a room but now i have to build like the

1983
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:34,180
sequence of like uh like uh variables that cause these objects to go up and down in a certain pattern

1984
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:38,420
and like i have to make sure the collision box follows that sprite that moves up and down and

1985
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:43,220
how it controls everything so like it's just it's a lot video games are complicated as shit

1986
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:48,500
video games are complicated and like a fighting game i've always like in the back of my mind

1987
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:51,860
because i love fighting games Guilty Gear is my favorite thing in the entire fucking world

1988
02:04:51,860 --> 02:04:55,300
and i'm like i'd love to make a fighting game the problem with making a fighting game is that like

1989
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:59,220
it's so simple on the surface because it's like well there's like two characters there's basically

1990
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:04,500
no level design it's just making a pretty background but like the game balance is so

1991
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:08,900
fucking hard because you have to make multiple characters you don't need to make game balance

1992
02:05:08,900 --> 02:05:12,340
and you have to make sure the balance is there and everything yeah you do if you want to make it

1993
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:17,060
fun and like yeah yeah making a shitty fighting game is probably like i mean it's probably still

1994
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:21,780
hard but it's probably like doable you could you could right you're just doing making a character

1995
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:26,420
estate machine over and over and over and you just all you need to do is make punk op and i'll then

1996
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:33,300
that'll be all i suppose that's true i suppose i could just do that to use our fire breath

1997
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:42,100
um so what we're saying is uh yeah uh uh make it somebody else somebody else make it please i think

1998
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:45,860
i think what we need to do is we need to get two hundred dollars we have to message six hundred

1999
02:05:45,860 --> 02:05:51,060
people on dvnart until somebody will make our game for us i think that's where all the games are

2000
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:58,180
on dvnart yeah yeah exactly just go on itch.io and go to like right user page after user page like

2001
02:05:58,180 --> 02:06:07,620
hi i'm looking for someone to uh code me you go to fiverr.com yeah um i use fiverr to make a video

2002
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:15,540
i have two i no i paid someone on fiverr to convert uh to convert a a png image that i had

2003
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:21,700
into a a vector uh it was for the rc game the kickstarter thing how how are those pins going

2004
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:29,940
by the way how's all that stuff have i not mentioned um i have uh the the lady has been like

2005
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:36,260
sort of like hard to get a hold of lately but like i have all the pins except for one pin

2006
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:42,980
and the coin and when i'm missing one of the pins i'm missing the coins but i have settled on the

2007
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:48,500
final design and i just i literally i literally just have to give her the money and then it will

2008
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:55,460
probably be another like whenever i she lets me do that it will probably be another like two weeks

2009
02:06:56,100 --> 02:07:01,380
or so until i have the product and then it will be done and i will have everything and i will start

2010
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:06,260
chipping sick that has just kind of been going on in the background i'm so excited to have the

2011
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:12,980
coins uh they i have the test coins here i i'm like made like a slight change to them but uh i'm

2012
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:17,460
confident that they're going to look sick they're gonna look almost like these ones that i have

2013
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:26,100
like a little different a little bit better um anyway anything else anything else about fighting

2014
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:31,220
games or whatever the fuck what are we even talking about uh fighting games are sick i want to make a

2015
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:36,420
shitty fighting game yeah i guess they're kind of sick i just started playing uh power rangers

2016
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:42,340
battle for the grid actually good pretty cool worth twenty dollars what system is that on it's on

2017
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:50,740
everything how i want to see it i want to see it is it new uh it's like a couple years old it was

2018
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:55,140
like a budget game that came out it was like a small company made it so it's like kind of rough

2019
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:58,820
around the edges but like the actual fighting system is really fun i mean i'm a little surprised

2020
02:07:58,820 --> 02:08:06,020
that like a power rangers game would come out in modern era yeah it's it's strange but it was

2021
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:12,900
really fucking cool and i enjoyed it immensely weird yeah weird cool okay next one is from

next up is more yelling about digimon yeah i'm into this three two one go

2044
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:16,740
i sent in that first digimon rural rumble voicemail since an huge influx of

2045
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:20,980
similar voicemails proud of y'all anyway it's been i think in washington they try doing so in

2046
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:26,020
japanese the english dub is full of character assassination there's a reason why people generally

2047
02:11:26,020 --> 02:11:32,500
like daisuke and taiki and absolutely hate davis and mikey yes i know worst of all is mimi

2048
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:37,220
who in the original show is one of the best characters especially in japanese but the english

2049
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:42,420
dub absolutely ruins her character for the sake of just valley girl generally making her dumb

2050
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:47,940
it's actually kind of sexist and gross and it's not very good watch it in japanese

2051
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:52,260
start with either the original mamora hisota short film or with tamers or

2052
02:11:53,220 --> 02:11:59,140
either work i didn't uh tom tamers is base but recently there's been one just as base

2053
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:04,020
digimon universe aptly monster i know it sounds like some cringe emoji movie stuff it is not it's

2054
02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:10,500
a lot of social commentary about like the internet and youtube and how it's affected how

2055
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:16,100
the youth see their future koreas etc very interesting it is on country roll in america

2056
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:22,020
lastly digimon story cyber salute bundle both the original cyber salute and the spinoff hackers

2057
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:31,300
memory 250 hour rpgs only $50 on pc and steam i meant pc and switch uh often on sale for half off

2058
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:36,900
two very good deal digimon survive look space that first trailer was amazing but it keeps getting

2059
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:43,380
delayed i hear a good thing about the manga so maybe check those out but i haven't read well

2060
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:50,900
that's your uh sounds good that's your digimon uh content update uh for this for this week every

2061
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:55,860
time someone talks about digimon i'm like oh digimon so fucking cool maybe i'll do a lecture

2062
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:59,700
but that'd be a nightmare we should have should we get digital dream on as a guest

2063
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:08,980
i i don't i maybe i don't know like that'd be fun probably for me i'd just get out of a digimon

2064
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:16,580
i'd have a good time no honestly i wouldn't have that much to say about it i just think digital

2065
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:22,260
dream is a very funny person i wouldn't i'll i'll get digital dream we'll do a podcast together

2066
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:31,780
yeah yeah okay all right um next up is next up is that's how'd you how'd you know

2067
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:36,180
i was gonna do for the intro it's i gotta figure out a new one now your name required

2068
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:44,420
i have a great idea listen to me america i have important very important ideas this is what we

2069
02:13:44,420 --> 02:13:49,780
need to do every infant that's born every infant male we need to take them and cut their ear lobes

2070
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:56,500
why number one it's unsightly number two uh greater chance of cancer more flesh equals

2071
02:13:56,500 --> 02:14:02,660
more cancer chance number three they can't get earrings therefore they can't be gay okay there

2072
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:09,700
you go so we need to cut infants ear lobes off because it's it's worthless flesh it does nothing

2073
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:17,620
it's completely functionless um it's great great idea let's do it roll it out it's the default

2114
02:19:29,940 --> 02:19:39,220
anti police and anti prison episode of the pcp i would like to uh send a formal application

2115
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:47,060
for you to reconsider my place within voice prison i think that i've more than served my time and

2116
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:54,660
been a uh good contributing member of society um you know just just just be cool man i'm just

2117
02:19:54,660 --> 02:20:00,180
being cool in prison how is he not uh i don't want to be here anymore how did we let this happen

2118
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:02,340
how did we allow him

2119
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:13,780
why do we let him have a phone he keeps sending he's not allowed to petition light him up and

2120
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:21,860
they just don't finish the job has to be illegal somehow right this has this um the uh the uh the

2121
02:20:21,860 --> 02:20:31,060
the uh some no who who do we just make voice grail who do we just make voice grail appeal to

2122
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:44,580
that guy appeal to that gut i don't remember the guy it doesn't matter it doesn't don't care he's

2123
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:50,100
whoever that guy was his voice grail appeal to him because the only way to get out of voice jail

2124
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:56,580
is to have someone is to have is to mutually annihilate in a burst of pure energy with the pot

2125
02:20:56,580 --> 02:21:03,780
the negatively charged uh the oppositely charged a voice grail i don't make the rules uh i accept

2126
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:12,820
i kind of did but i don't so that's just i i yeah that's right i do in fact make the rules but i

2127
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:16,420
have already made them and i'm not willing to reconsider i do make the rules i just won't

2128
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:26,500
change them next up is bob story three three two one go hey so yeah uh quick follow-up to my story

2129
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:33,700
from last week yes i took all of the pictures for her um oh this is the it was all her idea

2130
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:40,740
i also put the pictures on fourchan a while later um like because she wanted you to right

2131
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:50,100
but yeah the horror of it was that i had a christian video on like a playlist

2132
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:57,860
playing while i was fingering her so i'm like having chris look at me from the corner of my

2133
02:21:57,860 --> 02:22:03,940
eye and he freaked me the fuck out it was also the first time i fingered a girl so is that too

2134
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:13,060
gross uh everything about this is bad okay okay so this this really makes me think though this

2135
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:20,740
really confirms my suspicion that the girl kind of just wanted to get fingered and maybe was using

2136
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:28,580
the let's take pictures as just sort of a sort of a pretense to to sexualize the encounter

2137
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:34,500
i don't know i don't know that's just my that's just my opinion man

2138
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:42,420
yeah but there's there don't worry there's more there's more in bob story four we get the follow

2139
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:52,420
home god three two one go uh to follow up then um the girl and i we kind of went on a couple

2140
02:22:52,420 --> 02:23:00,660
dates and i fingered her a few more times and like made out a couple times and then i found out

2141
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:10,260
she was engaged and i was not okay okay okay okay these are like two very key facts that making this

2142
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:15,060
story as terrifying as you're implying it to be and you let it kept us waiting a whole week you

2143
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:20,820
know what you know what i think my theory holds i just kind of think she was just on the prowl

2144
02:23:21,700 --> 02:23:29,860
yeah no that definitely solidifies that yeah yeah and just uh i can imagine i can imagine

2145
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:35,540
no maybe i'm being unfair here but but my mind goes to like

2146
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:42,900
your guys are talking about chris chan or whatever and she's like why don't why won't this

2147
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:49,060
why won't this homo just just finger me already

2148
02:23:56,980 --> 02:24:02,500
like she she came up to you the first time she saw your hands just like this is like hands i know

2149
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:06,340
she complimented the only language the only language you understand the language of

2150
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:16,180
chan is the language of sonichu i know i'll i can i can pretend that these pictures are for

2151
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:22,260
maybe maybe if i fuck with chan he'll care and then i won't and that's the reason why i can

2152
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:31,700
get naked and i won't look like a slaughter and as as we're posting my my my uh nudes for

2153
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:41,780
weston chan layer onto four uh it doesn't doesn't it i understand more but at the same time i don't

2157
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:19,540

2158
02:25:25,700 --> 02:25:31,380

2162
02:25:56,820 --> 02:26:02,660

02:31:59,060 --> 02:32:08,020
disney drew the body the back cave for the new amusement park they only offered five trillion

2212
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:19,860
dollars batman was insulted so the bat took the mouse his ears took him off shut him down and

2213
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:29,540
stroked and replaced him with bad ears such concludes the weekly report do it next time

2214
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:34,580
same bat time same bad channel batman's a fucking psychopath

2215
02:32:40,660 --> 02:32:46,820
was it was it disney the mouse wanted to um yeah that it seemed like a little low ball

2216
02:32:46,820 --> 02:32:53,220
for price oh i thought they were gonna make that correct a bat cave attraction and they're

2217
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:57,940
no they probably were no they were gonna have they had to buy it from batman yeah oh yeah in

2218
02:32:57,940 --> 02:33:02,660
the authentic bat cave yeah sure yeah yeah yeah yeah i probably i probably would have handled it

2219
02:33:02,660 --> 02:33:10,100
the same exact way honestly yeah completely justified it sends a message hey now's a riddle

2220
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:18,020
my ass batman is one of the many many people who has not completed uh uh uh their uh fucking uh

2221
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:24,580
Kickstarter uh survey uh so i can send the fucking shit in the mail incredible uh

2222
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:33,140
uh yeah yeah for the vapors too um the uh i um it's coming up on a point because i did because

2223
02:33:33,140 --> 02:33:39,700
i did the Kickstarter so long ago um like the surveys are only available for a year and we're

2224
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:45,860
coming up on the year and the surveys are only going to be available until the 31st so after

2225
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:51,780
the 31st i will not be able to see anyone's like uh surveys if they want to like fill them out late

2226
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:57,780
they will have to like message me instead of doing it via the survey which is a little inconvenient

2227
02:33:57,780 --> 02:34:01,380
but i guess what can you do so i don't know if anyone's listening and you haven't fucking done that

2228
02:34:02,260 --> 02:34:07,220
get that in uh pretty soon because the end of the month is coming up and it'll be it'll be less

2229
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:14,580
convenient after that um okay just thought that just put just putting that out there um next one

2230
02:34:14,580 --> 02:34:23,940
is called pancakes shit gay uh three two one go hey pancakes with creators here listen i just

2231
02:34:23,940 --> 02:34:29,220
got back from taking a big fat piece of dump in my toilet just a piece and i was wondering you know

2232
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:35,540
how sometimes like taking a shit sometimes feels even better than sex well is that gay because

2233
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:42,180
taking a shit is like technically anal penetration yeah i mean it's not gay it's pretty gay adjacent

2234
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:47,780
frankly it's only gay and i won't stand for it it's only gay if your your shit is the same gender

2235
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:59,860
that you are so what so you need to know what the gender is that you ate yeah i guess that's uh

2236
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:00,900
it's the only way to do it

2237
02:35:04,500 --> 02:35:12,580
well my shit is non-binary so i don't know what to do better not better not better not come while

2238
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:23,700
you're shitting then or else you're else will never fucking understand uh i mean uh i don't think

2239
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:28,420
i don't know about listen then what do you do when you go to next time you're taking a shit and

2240
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:35,620
you just fucking come while it's happening because it just feels so good just you know just be aware

2241
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:41,380
that yeah if you if your shit is male and so are you then it's gay and there's nothing wrong with

2242
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:50,100
that but it's the fact of life so you know careful um three next up is pancakes physics degree problem

2243
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:58,820
uh three two one go hey pancakes with craters here listen i know some people at pcp

2244
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:07,140
technically have physics quote unquote degrees and i was wondering can you solve this problem

2245
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:16,500
can an object have unlimited surface area but a limited volume why or why not and please explain

2246
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:22,500
uh yeah there's um

2247
02:36:25,300 --> 02:36:31,300
yeah i know i know exactly i think what he might be talking about is the idea that it would it

2248
02:36:31,300 --> 02:36:40,340
it you you can always find you can always uh measure the surface area of like a an irregular

2249
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:45,220
shape more and more finely and it would never you would never get a super completely accurate

2250
02:36:45,220 --> 02:36:50,980
measurement but you can't have it be literally infinite yeah well like um right

2251
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:58,100
it would just take an infinite amount of time to get the next your accurate measurement wait under

2252
02:36:58,100 --> 02:37:06,100
what circumstance um like if you're going around a country and you're trying to find the exact

2253
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:15,540
perimeter of the country um yeah it's like you could go like to the atomic level yeah i

2254
02:37:15,540 --> 02:37:21,620
suppose well by what you define as the coast and eventually you will find there's um you you can

2255
02:37:21,620 --> 02:37:28,660
infinitely like refine your measurements uh okay you guys know what a mobius strip is right

2256
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:33,140
would you say that that is has infinite surface area

2257
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:42,500
because like um no because you can you can't overlap the part before you measured right

2258
02:37:44,100 --> 02:37:49,220
like you can't measure the part because there's a there's a 3d thing called the Klein bottle

2259
02:37:49,220 --> 02:37:55,700
which is basically which is basically a three-dimensional mobius strip it's similarly

2260
02:37:55,700 --> 02:38:02,100
like it's it's its surface area is recursive and it does have a fixed volume it's like it's a it's

2261
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:10,580
a finite 3d shape with a yeah a recursive mobius like surface area but no i wouldn't actually say

2262
02:38:10,580 --> 02:38:22,100
that that has infinite surface area so um i'm gonna say it has one side that's the fun part um

2263
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:26,180
i'm gonna say no i'm gonna say no

2264
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:37,860
you can't you can't have infinite surface area and limited volume right am i missing anything guys

2265
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:45,620
brain teaser have i failed yeah i don't know you're though you're more physics than i am i just

2266
02:38:46,020 --> 02:38:48,660
watch fucking youtube videos i watch smart every day

2267
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:59,620
wait wait a minute wait a minute and v source no that's stupid because what i just described like

2268
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:06,580
an object with like a continuous surface area that wraps around a sphere does that i'm a fucking

2269
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:14,980
moron um all right all right mr. fucking pancakes with prayers if you've got some smart ass answer

2270
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:22,500
then i guess call in next week and we'll see if i've failed uh and if not then get the fuck out of

2271
02:39:22,500 --> 02:39:33,140
here um next up pancakes only play this if you're weak-minded you know wait wait wait i got an answer

2272
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:47,060
unlimited surface area and uh got him oh obliterated uh okay three two one go

2273
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:55,220
jesus christ even a two-year-old with ass burgers could know this and answer this question

2274
02:39:55,220 --> 02:40:04,580
what are you some kind of moron it's obviously gabriel's horn look it up basically

2275
02:40:05,620 --> 02:40:16,260
shit i don't want to fucking explain it just look it up um oh oh yeah i get it yeah i get it

2276
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:23,300
it is a a 3d a three-dimensional okay well

2277
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:30,020
yeah the the point is that like it widened it's a it's a horn that widens at the base

2278
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:37,380
but it widens like two at a rate the asymptotically approaches

2279
02:40:38,260 --> 02:40:43,620
like bottoming out but never quite gets there oh yeah yep yep that would do it

2280
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:50,180
yeah but how could it have limited volume if it never quite gets there just keeps going the volume

2281
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:57,540
also keeps going right it does but it but it keeps going at a diminishing rate that um

2282
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:04,260
what's the word what's the word that converges that converges to a finite number it doesn't

2283
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:11,940
it doesn't approach infinity well all right yeah i've heard of it um

2284
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:19,860
but i would i would i would ask for a robust explanation here because because because to

2285
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:26,420
my thought process if something is going to infinity um the volume inside it there's a bunch

2286
02:41:26,420 --> 02:41:31,460
of youtube videos about it so i'm sure um you could find the answer here we go that me and you

2287
02:41:31,460 --> 02:41:40,180
could understand i've heard here we go here we go um so yeah the recipe okay imagine this um

2288
02:41:41,700 --> 02:41:49,060
i don't i don't know what a triangular number is but um the oh okay okay three the reciprocal

2289
02:41:49,060 --> 02:41:56,820
the reciprocal of powers of two right this is an infinite series of of sums you start with

2290
02:41:57,540 --> 02:42:03,060
one it's a series of fractions that you add on top of each other right you start with one over

2291
02:42:03,060 --> 02:42:09,300
one is the fraction so that has a value of one and then you add to that one over two half you add

2292
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:15,380
to that one over four quarter add to that one eight add one sixteenth add one thirty two

2293
02:42:15,380 --> 02:42:22,580
add one sixty fourth etc etc etc and you keep going to infinity um the numbers get smaller

2294
02:42:23,140 --> 02:42:30,100
as the series goes on such that even though the series is infinite it you it does not even

2295
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:35,300
if you continue it infinitely you don't get infinity uh uh the series continued infinitely

2296
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:43,300
becomes two uh it converges to two so yeah the the the idea with gabriel's horn is similar in that

2297
02:42:43,300 --> 02:42:51,460
like you know the surface the the area that it is enclosing you know yeah at the wide base of it

2298
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:59,700
that like goes out and out and out and out infinitely uh it it like moves like the the space

2299
02:42:59,700 --> 02:43:07,780
between it and the bottom it and the the asymptote is so becomes diminishes at such a rate that's

2300
02:43:07,780 --> 02:43:15,700
similarly it converges to a non-infinite number i don't i don't know if i clarify anything uh

2301
02:43:16,580 --> 02:43:22,420
i'll go to youtube maybe find some smart alec yeah oh because you're sure you're sure is

2302
02:43:22,420 --> 02:43:33,620
fuck not gonna find one here um all right uh next one a disgruntled fan three two one go

2303
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:39,700
you know ben for being such a proud leftist icon you platform a lot of hate speech on your

2304
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:47,060
shell it's disappointing wish you'd be a little better about vetting these things no elaboration

2305
02:43:47,060 --> 02:44:01,700
all right cool uh a couple um a couple people a couple people complained about some of the

2306
02:44:01,700 --> 02:44:06,660
voicemails last week i didn't think any of the voicemails last week were that bad honestly um

2307
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:12,660
well they which ones i can't think exactly because i can't remember because i

2308
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:22,820
block all of the episodes out of my mind uh um i well you know i don't know i i talked i think

2309
02:44:22,820 --> 02:44:28,500
i talked to the person that sent this voicemail afterwards and she said that like she didn't think

2310
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:34,580
it was that big a deal so maybe i should i just kind of want to just move on from it um yeah i'm

2311
02:44:34,580 --> 02:44:43,380
not interested not interested uh next up is called sorry for those shitty ones

2312
02:44:45,060 --> 02:44:54,580
three two one go hey there pc proud boys uh just wanted to be like sorry about those

2313
02:44:54,580 --> 02:45:01,940
really shitty voicemails uh it's uh it's the ones with the metal gear stuff

2314
02:45:03,860 --> 02:45:10,020
i'm just uh this is just a preamble for my next voicemail which is gonna blow your socks off

2315
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:16,020
it i swear it's not a meme i it's it's a genuine voice uh

2316
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:23,060
uh fucking performance genuine voice and it's a story it's got a beginning middle and end you

2317
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:28,980
don't need to do a preamble blow your your fucking uh decks off why is this a whole minute long

2318
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:35,140
and this the next voicemails come guys and uh we've never we've never had a good voicemail

2319
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:41,060
before but i think this might be this might be for real the next one's gonna be good i swear

2320
02:45:41,060 --> 02:45:47,700
okay here we go sense here we go this one's called the good one

2321
02:45:49,220 --> 02:45:51,540
three two one go baby

2322
02:45:54,980 --> 02:46:02,020
you fucking fools you idiots who could have seen this coming god damn reapered you

2323
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:12,420
cook so boy you fucking fell for it are you fucking voice gel voice gel uh i don't know if

2324
02:46:12,420 --> 02:46:22,260
this is even worthy of voice gel this is too it was just pathetic let's move on uh yeah terrible

2325
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:30,020
terrible um bad uh honestly i'm on the fence i'm on the fence about voice gel

2326
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:39,060
i'm thinking about it um next up why does the quality decline sharply several seconds in

2327
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:45,460
three two one go a few moments later this guy sucks should we just cut this voicemail it sucks

2328
02:46:45,460 --> 02:46:52,580
really bad yeah i don't want it all right yeah i i'm okay with that ellie is our uh ellie is our

2329
02:46:52,580 --> 02:46:57,540
cut that voicemail but leave in this part where i'm saying cut that voicemail fuck that last guy

2330
02:46:57,540 --> 02:47:06,260
all right uh yeah um next one is called not worthy of a response frankly disgusting quit

2331
02:47:06,260 --> 02:47:13,460
watching our show um next one is called communism from someone who experienced it

2332
02:47:14,180 --> 02:47:25,220
oh boy three two one go okay so i cringe every fucking time you fucking dumb americans think

2333
02:47:25,220 --> 02:47:32,580
oh communism this i'm gonna suck the dick of communism it's so good it's so fair when we

2334
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:37,940
here in eastern europe we've lived under communism for like almost a hundred years and it was the

2335
02:47:37,940 --> 02:47:44,820
worst thing ever it killed everyone and it's fucking yeah it killed everyone in the ass okay yeah he's

2336
02:47:44,820 --> 02:47:52,900
right and it slowed down our progress like a hundred years we still have medieval villages

2337
02:47:53,140 --> 02:48:02,660
until fucking now it's stupid it's like okay maybe america's brand of communism would be better now

2338
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:08,020
with the power of handsight of we even have a brand of communism not really a tiny it's just a tiny

2339
02:48:08,020 --> 02:48:17,940
subset of people we're like really far left i love the other one but god fucking damn i always

2340
02:48:17,940 --> 02:48:25,060
always cringe when you guys like invoke oh i love the russian national anthem the so who

2341
02:48:28,900 --> 02:48:33,860
hate them i hope i that's that are still alive that have a heart attack right now

2342
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:42,500
they are literally i wait who who's who's hitler i i i it's always the same like the people who

2343
02:48:42,500 --> 02:48:47,940
don't know what they're fucking talking about have in their head the idea of what a leftist is and

2344
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:54,340
what they believe and they think that is what they're talking to whenever any one of us has any some

2345
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:58,900
like they don't think about what we're saying they think of what the the the label of leftist means

2346
02:48:58,900 --> 02:49:04,100
to them and what they've heard and they ascribe it to it like nobody has ever talked about the

2347
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:09,780
fucking russian national anthem maybe yeah i feel like he doesn't know anything about what

2348
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:18,340
communism would actually mean i think i mean not to uh boy i i i i feel like you really need to go

2349
02:49:18,340 --> 02:49:22,660
into this i feel like this is like an open up a whole can of words i feel like maybe i i don't

2350
02:49:22,660 --> 02:49:26,980
want to go into the specifics but i want to address this the mindset and i i feel like i might be

2351
02:49:26,980 --> 02:49:33,460
accused of um i don't know west explaining this or something to uh you know this guy is like hey i was

2352
02:49:34,420 --> 02:49:39,620
i'm in a fucking eastern country uh we experienced communism this guy is probably like 20 so

2353
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:48,420
probably not but whatever um uh is it what what does it mean what does it mean that like

2354
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:55,940
communism like fucked up our development and no the what would probably fucked up the development

2355
02:49:55,940 --> 02:50:04,020
of whatever country this guy is in um was probably the ussr the ussr like supported its

2356
02:50:04,020 --> 02:50:09,940
surrounding you know eastern bloc countries but it was beset at the same time by the rest of the

2357
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:15,300
world the capitalist world which you know sought to destroy it at every turn and i don't know i

2358
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:18,980
kind of feel like maybe that might have had something to do with it i don't think this guy

2359
02:50:18,980 --> 02:50:25,300
has really considered uh all the possibilities here uh for the reasons behind what he describes

2360
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:31,380
as the ills of communism uh i don't know this guy just kind of seems like he's being dogmatic

2361
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:44,740
i think i think it's it's it's like there's you could say that a capitalist um surge is good for

2362
02:50:44,740 --> 02:50:50,580
like getting a good strong foothold and then you're the most powerful country in the world um

2363
02:50:51,700 --> 02:50:57,540
and then from that you can become communist and then give your people what they need but it comes

2364
02:50:57,540 --> 02:51:03,620
down a lot to like just having the right resources in the country like america had a lot of stuff you

2365
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:10,500
know it's really it's really hard it's i mean it's hard to like put any of us there like

2366
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:16,020
neat bow on really educated enough right about the political theory to make a like educated

2367
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:21,140
response to this in terms of the effects and causal links between communism and like capitalist

2368
02:51:21,140 --> 02:51:26,020
pushback it's true eastern europe it's true but at the same time i don't think any of us are

2369
02:51:26,020 --> 02:51:31,940
fucking tanky yeah we're here singing the praises of communist russia just because you want social

2370
02:51:31,940 --> 02:51:37,780
reform in america and are not exactly pleased with what capitalism is doing like i don't think

2371
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:44,740
anyone here is saying we need hardcore need like Stalinist socialism you know like i would be perfectly

2372
02:51:44,740 --> 02:51:52,580
happy with some tax reforms uh to fucking bring the rich back in line yeah like close some loopholes

2373
02:51:52,580 --> 02:51:58,980
and shit so people i i don't know if this guy is is like this but some people get yeah some people

2374
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:05,460
get offended get uppity get like weird about it when you even suggest like what if we tax the rich

2375
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:13,780
more and they act like that's Stalin style siege socialism in and of itself uh i mean there's a

2376
02:52:13,780 --> 02:52:18,180
discussion yeah there doesn't need to be a fucking jumping down everybody else's throat you know like

2377
02:52:18,180 --> 02:52:22,900
there are pros and cons to doing that i i just have to weigh them against each other and just have

2378
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:29,700
a discussion and figure it out i just want to say i think i think that you know the the legacy the

2379
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:35,300
legacy of communism it's so i feel like there's a very difficult web of like causations there and

2380
02:52:35,300 --> 02:52:42,020
i think it's probably really hard to entangle like you know which what what misfortunes were you

2381
02:52:42,020 --> 02:52:48,740
know the fault of communism itself versus what was the what was caused by like deprivation created

2382
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:54,580
by like you know sanctions and or military action from the disapproving you know capitalist rest of

2383
02:52:54,580 --> 02:53:00,580
the world and to just you know to just blanketly say like oh yeah communism ruined everything it's

2384
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:08,260
like no it's never that simple even if that's that's and that's me being charitable uh to this

2385
02:53:08,260 --> 02:53:16,100
interpretation of history which i'm willing to i'm willing to be charitable uh fuck man uh um

2386
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:26,500
hail hail Stalin uh uh uh hail the ussr uh disavow disavow disavow um uh um what's a what's a

2387
02:53:26,500 --> 02:53:33,220
communist thing to say um guillotines i don't know just i just i just want people to fucking

2388
02:53:33,220 --> 02:53:38,180
listen to the things we say and then respond to that instead of the things to be fair i think

2389
02:53:38,180 --> 02:53:43,460
that the line about um the russian he might have been talking about like maybe the left

2390
02:53:43,460 --> 02:53:49,460
generally and not us specifically because surely none of us have ever been like i love the russian

2391
02:53:49,700 --> 02:53:56,020
but like like the left generally is such a the the left generally is not general there's so many

2392
02:53:56,020 --> 02:54:01,940
different things i'm not saying that it's a group yeah i'm not saying it's it's fair but yeah uh yeah

2393
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:10,660
okay have we be specific for fuck's sake have we have we have we have we successfully obliterated

2394
02:54:10,660 --> 02:54:19,540
capitalism once and for all uh nice shut up no no it's still too powerful no no no we're gonna

canned tent uh three two one ago hey everybody and welcome to another episode of canned tan

2410
02:56:24,900 --> 02:56:32,340
canned tan we just watched a fucking terrible anime it's a really bad anime and i don't care

2411
02:56:32,340 --> 02:56:37,460
about it at all listen to me talk about how much i don't care for 45 minutes there's just way too

2412
02:56:37,460 --> 02:56:41,460
much going on in the plot there's a lot of talking and there are more than two things happening at

2413
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:46,980
once that's too much that bores me and because it's boring i don't care at all and because i don't

2414
02:56:46,980 --> 02:56:51,460
care i'm not going to pay attention which will cause me to miss extremely obvious plot details

2415
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:56,020
i'm not misunderstanding because i'm stupid or anything it's just that the show is not good

2416
02:56:56,020 --> 02:57:01,380
if it was just a good show i would understand it very well because i am a smart person it's hard

2417
02:57:01,380 --> 02:57:05,460
to understand and the author made it that way because the author is autistic i don't understand

2418
02:57:05,460 --> 02:57:09,780
the story at all but i completely understand the kind of person the author is and their creative

2419
02:57:09,780 --> 02:57:16,260
process well that's going to do it for this week's episode of canned tan

2420
02:57:20,020 --> 02:57:23,380
i believe i believe this was uh uh

2421
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:33,220
now now i'm now i'm not i'm not i don't watch i don't watch canton but uh i heard people saying

2422
02:57:33,860 --> 02:57:40,740
that the re-zero episode made a lot of people angry did you guys hear anything about this

2423
02:57:40,740 --> 02:57:47,380
i heard nothing i i haven't heard i i don't watch because i don't care about the anime but like

2424
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:53,060
i i totally believe that this is what's happening because it seems it seems very realistic yeah

2425
02:57:53,060 --> 02:57:58,980
yeah it does in particular it's like it's like i was there in in particular it was i i heard people

2426
02:57:58,980 --> 02:58:06,900
saying that the re-zero episode they just kind of like didn't understand the plot and like

2427
02:58:09,060 --> 02:58:13,780
people were like why are you talking about the show you're criticizing the show i mean

2428
02:58:13,780 --> 02:58:18,340
but you like didn't understand it and you are like factually wrong about some things i mean

2429
02:58:18,340 --> 02:58:25,220
that's the biggest nightmare for any person who talks about media is is to be stupid live on screen

2430
02:58:26,180 --> 02:58:33,380
is to is to is to have missed something obvious and talked with authority i i i have nightmares

2431
02:58:33,380 --> 02:58:40,420
of doing that myself i've probably done it hundreds of times because i i just i'm not aware it would

2432
02:58:40,420 --> 02:58:50,180
be it would be pretty embarrassing that's that much i i can uh i can agree with uh well uh canned

2433
02:58:50,580 --> 02:58:57,540
thanks for your thanks for your voicemail uh fuck yeah next one is called ben is racist

2434
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:07,140
uh oh oh oh boy three it's about time this was brought to life three two one go say it say it

2435
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:15,140
say white lives matter if you're not a racist say it say it now oh god i mean i mean i mean i mean

2436
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:21,220
i mean i mean white lives do matter got got right a little bit right like i mean yeah they

2437
02:59:21,220 --> 02:59:26,980
matter too right but ben you just have to say all lives matter you cover everybody i mean i mean

2438
02:59:26,980 --> 02:59:33,460
all lives all lives don't matter you don't live still matter though it's right yeah you come on

2439
02:59:33,460 --> 02:59:41,460
you know it's like uh fuck no it's all right he's right i'm racist i'll i feel like i should

2440
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:49,060
just say the thing the black lives matter is not about black lives matter more is because society

2441
02:59:49,060 --> 02:59:55,380
does not generally deem them to matter in western society it feels it feels the need to be said

2442
02:59:55,380 --> 03:00:00,020
therefore it is a thing that people say do you ever do you ever feel like the left has a language

2443
03:00:00,020 --> 03:00:04,900
problem do you ever feel like the left makes up makes a lot of terms that are seems to be inherently

2444
03:00:04,900 --> 03:00:08,500
difficult for people to understand it's not inherently difficult for people to understand

2445
03:00:08,500 --> 03:00:13,620
they're just not trying to understand i feel like i mean it's not like is sloganable but if

2446
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:17,380
like it had been if the movement had been called black lives matter too we wouldn't have this

2447
03:00:17,380 --> 03:00:21,780
conversation because it would have been implied in this yeah then now that would have saved would

2448
03:00:21,780 --> 03:00:25,620
have saved us all collectively hundreds of hours that one is fair enough i have always thought that

2449
03:00:25,620 --> 03:00:32,660
but i also don't think that at this point people can can be allowed to just still not get it it's

2450
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:37,940
been so all over but i'm just saying if only if only we had known and could have

2451
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:43,940
proactively corrected this problem from the very beginning um i don't know i i i wonder if like

2452
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:50,740
would would like tweaking the phrasing a little bit like really have made that much of a difference

2453
03:00:50,740 --> 03:00:55,460
or would i think the people i think the people with the people with the problem with it had just

2454
03:00:55,460 --> 03:00:59,060
have a problem anyway they just wouldn't i think they would have found another problem but i think

2455
03:00:59,060 --> 03:01:03,380
there are probably a significant amount of people who don't understand who probably once

2456
03:01:03,380 --> 03:01:09,220
explained like oh i get it now and those people would have been saved yeah or the very least the

2457
03:01:09,220 --> 03:01:14,580
people who are on the fence who were convinced by the people who acting in bad faith would never

2458
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:20,580
have had that that avenue to be swayed in the first place i think it's just sort of like if if

2459
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:26,580
someone were to say the statement black lives matter and your responses like not yeah of course

2460
03:01:27,300 --> 03:01:33,620
if your response is defensive then there's something up i mean i know i know a lot of white

2461
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:41,300
people myself included initially was like what about white people um but that's because i yeah i

2462
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:46,020
don't have the i don't have this perspective i do now that's that's that's entirely that's entirely

2463
03:01:46,020 --> 03:01:51,700
my point but like i don't know i learned i learned this here's wasn't that difficult here's but

2464
03:01:51,700 --> 03:01:58,420
you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna go i'm gonna move past that honestly yeah i think those sure

2465
03:01:58,420 --> 03:02:03,300
like out and out racists who are like uh don't say black lives matter that's uh why you why you

2466
03:02:03,300 --> 03:02:10,180
politicize why you gotta bring race into it or whatever like yeah fuck that um but i think i

2467
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:17,140
think there is a more insidious the more insidious problem is the is the guy who's like you're like

2468
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:20,420
okay black lives matter and he's like yeah yeah sure yeah black lives matter yeah yeah of course

2469
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:26,180
yeah equality black people and then you're like okay okay uh you know therefore outlines a bunch

2470
03:02:26,180 --> 03:02:32,020
of like progressive policy ideas like you know defunding the police uh or whatever uh you know

2471
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:38,420
funding social welfare programs instead of over policing uh you know decriminalizing marijuana

2472
03:02:38,420 --> 03:02:44,020
so on and so forth and then they're like whoa whoa whoa i thought this was just about black lives

2473
03:02:44,020 --> 03:02:48,660
you know being equal now you're trying to do well now you're trying to sneak in all this Marxist

2474
03:02:48,660 --> 03:02:55,860
shit on me i think that's the real sticking point i i think that's the that's the thing yeah it does

2475
03:02:55,860 --> 03:03:00,180
come from the same place that's like a bigger hump where it's just they don't have the perspective

2476
03:03:00,180 --> 03:03:05,940
to understand that in order to make sure black lives are treated equally these things need to change

2477
03:03:07,060 --> 03:03:13,060
like like a like a conservative will agree like they'll say like yeah yeah yeah black people are

2478
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:19,220
just as invaluable as white people black lives matter just as much and then you're like okay well

2479
03:03:20,100 --> 03:03:27,540
here's how you know on the whole you know people of color and such are you know disadvantaged

2480
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:33,380
you know the you know wealth and equality is a big problem over policing is a big problem crime

2481
03:03:33,380 --> 03:03:41,140
criminality is you know is not a uniformly enforced and then they'll be like okay okay okay yeah but

2482
03:03:41,140 --> 03:03:45,220
i mean that's just kind of like uh human nature or something like uh like yeah but you can't like

2483
03:03:45,220 --> 03:03:51,300
do anything about that right like share black lives matter but like you can't like do anything

2484
03:03:51,300 --> 03:03:54,820
about that's just like the way the world works that's just like uh and you know maybe they

2485
03:03:54,820 --> 03:04:00,180
shouldn't commit those crimes that you know we convict them for more more vigorously than

2486
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:08,020
than other other people you know what i'm saying i do yeah um i think is there's a there's a there's

2487
03:04:08,980 --> 03:04:16,260
i don't know it's what you say insidious i say that it is it's it's for people who have like more

2488
03:04:16,260 --> 03:04:22,660
insidious um goals they act like that and then there are people who just act like that because

2489
03:04:22,660 --> 03:04:28,180
they don't think about it at all which is an unfortunate double those people that i just

2490
03:04:28,180 --> 03:04:37,540
described are convinced that they are the real not racists right that like redistributive wealth

2491
03:04:37,620 --> 03:04:44,740
is like a racist thing like that's the real racism or something and that makes me so bad

2492
03:04:46,340 --> 03:04:51,140
it's like you know that that like affirmative action is like the real racism or whatever i don't

2493
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:57,780
know it's very it's i'm getting mad just thinking about it um uh i feel like i was gonna say oh i was

2494
03:04:57,780 --> 03:05:03,620
gonna say uh you say you know think about the left having a language problem i think that to a certain

2495
03:05:03,620 --> 03:05:09,060
extent i would agree the black lives matter like yeah i guess i see how like it's a little like

2496
03:05:09,940 --> 03:05:13,140
maybe if you don't think about it it's like well that's kind of a weird you know

2497
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:19,860
another thing is like only black lives oh no you don't mean that okay uh i misunderstood another

2498
03:05:19,860 --> 03:05:26,980
example would be like um what is it private property versus personal property yeah that's a

2499
03:05:26,980 --> 03:05:31,060
whole that's a big fucking problem like imagine all the memes that could have been avoided if we

2500
03:05:31,060 --> 03:05:35,300
didn't use language like that yeah with me i mean mark said i didn't use that language at all but

2501
03:05:35,300 --> 03:05:40,900
you know what i mean like there's just there's tons of small little examples like that um throughout

2502
03:05:40,900 --> 03:05:46,980
like like like language on the left that i feel like when you went if you're not into politics at all

2503
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:52,740
if you're like completely apolitical yeah uh and you stumble upon a lot of this phrasing like abolish

2504
03:05:52,740 --> 03:05:56,820
private property like what the fuck that sounds stupid but like you'd have to have like someone

2505
03:05:56,820 --> 03:06:01,780
who's like knowledge sit down and explain all this like preamble to you and like we we just had a

2506
03:06:01,780 --> 03:06:07,700
very bad reaction at preamble so i'm sure people who have had to live politics feel similarly it

2507
03:06:07,700 --> 03:06:13,460
just seems like really poor language choices on a lot of key issues fucked a lot of this shit up

2508
03:06:13,460 --> 03:06:19,620
yeah i i think that i agree but on the same time i wonder like to what extent was it like

2509
03:06:19,700 --> 03:06:27,140
poor phrasing versus like to what extent has it been like to what extent has the phrasing like

2510
03:06:27,140 --> 03:06:35,140
been poisons on purpose well i mean it took me forever to realize that private property and

2511
03:06:35,140 --> 03:06:40,740
personal property were different among people who are talking about like marks yeah i didn't know that

2512
03:06:40,740 --> 03:06:45,460
forever yeah because as someone who just listened to it i'm like abolish private property that seems

2513
03:06:45,460 --> 03:06:51,060
like it would cause a lot of issues i i feel like if like maybe uh i don't know just um just

2514
03:06:51,060 --> 03:06:55,300
thinking that lab maybe not capitalism's biggest fan so it's not like i was like pulling for the

2515
03:06:55,300 --> 03:07:00,820
other team or anything it just like on the face of it based on like casual vernacular that sounds

2516
03:07:00,820 --> 03:07:08,020
really bad i just i maybe if maybe if like i don't know the educational system were more

2517
03:07:08,820 --> 03:07:13,620
because like you know i grew the orthodoxy that i was taught growing up was that you know the free

2518
03:07:13,620 --> 03:07:20,420
market corrects for itself and and all that stuff all this neoliberal like a voodoo and um

2519
03:07:21,300 --> 03:07:28,500
someone just fucking subscribed or something i don't know um and uh so that but then you know what

2520
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:34,980
one wonders if maybe one wonders if maybe the the we were taught a more like a more genuinely like

2521
03:07:34,980 --> 03:07:39,860
neutral perspective or a more balanced perspective maybe we would know the different because a lot

2522
03:07:39,860 --> 03:07:44,420
of people don't know the difference but like you know that we have a public education system

2523
03:07:44,420 --> 03:07:49,460
is supposed to educate us and make sure we know things i mean i feel like that's one thing that

2524
03:07:49,460 --> 03:07:55,140
maybe could be you know that's i mean i would agree with that to to a point but like i would

2525
03:07:55,140 --> 03:08:00,740
also say that like this entire like group of people on the left are operating under the assumption

2526
03:08:00,740 --> 03:08:06,180
that we live in a system that is very skewed so if you're making an excuse for like well the system

2527
03:08:06,260 --> 03:08:11,060
should be better so we're gonna explain how the system is bad like it just seems like self-defeating

2528
03:08:11,060 --> 03:08:17,700
but you have to be operating with language using the the kind of like framework that we're already

2529
03:08:17,700 --> 03:08:23,060
established in otherwise you're kind of just tacking on like understanding our problem to

2530
03:08:23,060 --> 03:08:27,380
the list of problems you're trying to fix which seems like circular i think that's a fair point

2531
03:08:27,380 --> 03:08:33,140
i agree you have to you have to meet people where they are but like i don't know there's a lot of

2532
03:08:33,860 --> 03:08:39,540
very i don't know whether they're easy to get into but there's plenty of videos now that explain

2533
03:08:39,540 --> 03:08:47,060
these things that people can link to i think on some level people just need to be open to different

2534
03:08:47,060 --> 03:08:56,420
ideas on the whole i mean yeah like if you want if you want to dive down a rabbit hole of learning

2535
03:08:56,420 --> 03:09:03,460
about this stuff like it's it's very easy to do but um you know i'm getting someone getting someone to

2536
03:09:04,580 --> 03:09:10,900
to accept like thinking about it for a little bit is the hardest part and i guess yeah the language

2537
03:09:10,900 --> 03:09:21,540
problem is is you know it's it exists i guess i i guess i i can't disagree um next voicemail

2538
03:09:22,260 --> 03:09:29,780
let's do it next how many more do we have only like four only three more three more only 46 only 14

2539
03:09:30,420 --> 03:09:39,460
no no we're almost done uh uh this one's called fuck them three two one go look the circumcision

2540
03:09:39,460 --> 03:09:44,500
is an operation carried out on infants it's done without their consent it's done without

2541
03:09:44,500 --> 03:09:51,060
anesthetic it's unnecessary it's a cosmetic operation that's what it is you shouldn't

2542
03:09:51,060 --> 03:09:57,940
need to do such a thing routinely to an infant and there is no reason it was invented by this guy

2543
03:09:57,940 --> 03:10:03,300
who wanted to stop people from masturbating how fucked up is that yeah it sure will be hard to

2544
03:10:03,300 --> 03:10:10,340
jack off when your dick is fucking dry yeah it's fine actually it works so sad it's sad that people

2545
03:10:10,340 --> 03:10:19,220
defend it oh yeah like my dick works fine sure sure but your rights were violated dude what the

2546
03:10:19,220 --> 03:10:25,540
fuck stop defending it i'm you know i'm religious reasons call me the fucking circumcision defender

2547
03:10:25,540 --> 03:10:30,660
i'm circumcision biggest fan now dude it's my belief i think we should just cut our heads off at birth

2548
03:10:30,660 --> 03:10:37,300
you know it doesn't make it okay your stupid backwards bullshit doesn't justify your crimes

2549
03:10:37,300 --> 03:10:45,700
your violations of people's rights fuck you uh fuck circumcision fuck people who defend it

2550
03:10:45,700 --> 03:10:54,180
and fuck doctors who perform it is this that same guy who made wait is this the guy who did

2551
03:10:54,180 --> 03:11:01,780
the voicemail that we cut because it was terrible no it was a different guy this guy that's a different

2552
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:09,620
okay okay i mean i agree i don't think circumcision is defendable um you can argue that it's like

2553
03:11:09,620 --> 03:11:14,020
good or bad but i don't think it's it's good that you can you can do that to a child because there's

2554
03:11:14,020 --> 03:11:21,220
no way they could possibly consent to such a thing i'm gonna play devil's advocate here for a second

2555
03:11:21,220 --> 03:11:31,620
whoa holy fuck the tables have turned um i mean i mean i think that um it's not look i i don't know

2556
03:11:31,620 --> 03:11:35,620
i don't know everything but like i've seen the arguments that i've seen are like that it's not

2557
03:11:35,620 --> 03:11:42,180
just a cosmetic operation it's like a sanitary operation and like circum if you're circumcised

2558
03:11:42,180 --> 03:11:48,340
you have like a reduced chance of like uh you know uh various diseases developing and also

2559
03:11:48,340 --> 03:11:54,900
it like it lowers the transmission rate of of various stds and uh things like that

2560
03:11:56,180 --> 03:12:00,740
and i don't know maybe maybe that if that's true maybe it would convince you and maybe it wouldn't

2561
03:12:00,740 --> 03:12:06,100
but like i don't know if well here's the thing if in fact if let me finish if there is like a if

2562
03:12:06,100 --> 03:12:11,860
there is like a sanitary or like a medical reason to do it i don't think that like the oh they didn't

2563
03:12:11,940 --> 03:12:18,020
consent argument holds water because like you give a kid a vaccine without their consent you know

2564
03:12:18,020 --> 03:12:23,940
because like the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and it's because if this kid didn't have the vaccine

2565
03:12:23,940 --> 03:12:30,020
then not only would it hurt not only is it best for the kid it's best for all of society if you

2566
03:12:30,020 --> 03:12:34,260
know everyone's getting the vaccine it's good for everyone and i think that you could probably make

2567
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:38,420
a similar argument if in fact there are medical benefits to circumcision as i have heard argue

2568
03:12:38,420 --> 03:12:44,260
that there are right but nobody someone would argue in response that like a vaccine isn't like

2569
03:12:44,260 --> 03:12:52,100
permanently disfiguring and yeah anyone like vaccines do not have a drawback in the same way

2570
03:12:52,100 --> 03:12:59,140
that circumcision does i mean does it though dude they give you autism that's the drawback

2571
03:12:59,140 --> 03:13:08,100
circumcision does fuck i mean that explains well obviously i can't i can't speak to someone who is

2572
03:13:08,100 --> 03:13:14,420
circumcised circumcised because i'm not but there is no sanitary bullshit it's very very easy to

2573
03:13:14,420 --> 03:13:21,700
keep it clean it's never made any sense like i really hate the the people who talk about that

2574
03:13:21,700 --> 03:13:27,140
when they don't you know they don't have one they don't know it's not a problem that you just wash

2575
03:13:27,140 --> 03:13:37,780
it like you wash any part of your body okay uh ben from the future here so i am a fool and i fucked

2576
03:13:37,780 --> 03:13:43,220
up and my audacity i ran out of disk space so it stopped recording right in the middle of this

2577
03:13:43,220 --> 03:13:51,460
conversation this conversation made me pretty mad uh because nobody fucking uh it's all it's all

2578
03:13:51,460 --> 03:13:59,220
gib being like oh but but oh the baby didn't have a choice or the the the what why would you cut a

2579
03:13:59,220 --> 03:14:07,620
baby and i'm just i'm i just think that we should follow the science and if i'm just i'm merely open

2580
03:14:07,620 --> 03:14:17,220
to the possibility that if you know we're widely practicing circumcision were to significantly cause

2581
03:14:17,220 --> 03:14:21,860
some sort of significant societal benefit like say a reduction in the transmission of std's for

2582
03:14:21,860 --> 03:14:28,340
instance uh uh you know without any with that without significance or with without you know

2583
03:14:28,340 --> 03:14:33,860
a commensurate negative thing because like you know everyone says oh you mutilated oh it's a party

2584
03:14:33,860 --> 03:14:38,260
because like okay well so is your appendix uh but you know sometimes you got to cut that out

2585
03:14:38,260 --> 03:14:43,780
sometimes you're better off without it uh it doesn't necessarily do anything uh let's not let's not

2586
03:14:43,860 --> 03:14:50,500
fall into the trap of the naturalistic fallacy here um so sorry you won't get to hear any of that

2587
03:14:50,500 --> 03:14:59,940
but i've summarized it for you i was right i'm always i'm on top of it um okay back sorry goodbye

2588
03:14:59,940 --> 03:15:08,420
