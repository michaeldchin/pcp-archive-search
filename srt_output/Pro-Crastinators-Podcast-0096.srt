00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,560
Hello everyone and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Hello, this is us. We have a special

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:30,960
guest today, Gamers Tavern. Here he is. Hello. Gamers Tavern is a reviewer of video games and

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,400
does Let's Plays, which is the topic of today's podcast. And with me, Hippocrit, we have other

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,760
members of the show who are usually here. You're an expert at this. I really am good, aren't I?

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,200
He knows what he's doing. Where'd you get that green fucking trash, Ben?

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,680
Yes. And here we have Munchy Jones. Welcome to the only podcast on the internet where one

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,920
six of its hosts consistently has severe, mold-induced respiratory issues. I cannot breathe

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:11,040
right now. There's too much mold in my room. Oh no. We have Tom Oliver. Hello. I have risen from

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:20,960
the grave to bring you more fantastic ramblings. We have Best Guy Ever. It's about that time,

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,480
everybody. And we have Ben Sainte. Discord, I'm hallowed at the moon. In the middle of the summer

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,880
afternoon. Discord, remember whatever we do. Take my pain away. All right. Now, I guess I should have

12
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,120
left Gamers Tavern at the end. I was going to reintroduce him. Gamers Tavern is here.

13
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,080
Hey. There he is. Yeah. Yeah, we're happy to have you. I'd just like to say right off the bat

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,520
that I and a bunch of us here are longtime fans of Gamers Tavern, a tragically underappreciated

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,760
channel who back in the day was putting out some really great, some really enjoyable Let's Play

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,000
content. There can be no doubt. Link in the description to his channel. I'm very flattered

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,120
to hear that. We, I think at the very least, I think Jesse originally was the guy who found

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,880
your content first. Is that accurate, Kim? Was it? I think it was me or Jesse who found his content

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:28,800
and we shared it amongst ourselves and we said, this guy has got the best dry comedy. I think

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,000
that's why you call it dry comedy. Like Let's Plays of just the, it was so funny. We were

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,560
laughing the whole time. It was great. We loved your videos so much and we subscribed and we watched

22
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:50,880
your podcasts and we love Gamers Tavern, we say it. I would like to throw out that I,

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:58,240
unequivocally, wish to preemptively crown Gamers Tavern the king of Let's Plays. I have not seen

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,600
one that's better. It is, you guys, you have to watch, please go watch some of his videos,

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,400
like his Sonic Let's Plays or any of them, the Rocket Knight Adventures. We got Rocket Knight,

26
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,640
Kirby, Sonic. There's more. I'm blanking. There's a whole bunch. Listeners, just look inside your

27
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:24,800
heart and think, do you want unscripted podcasts like a banter between two unqualified, unprofessional

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,520
internet hacks long since their prime, like the Digi Pros or the Game Grumps? Or do you want

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,160
masterfully paced, beautifully executed, pure art Let's Plays such as the Gamers Tavern offers?

30
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,320
The puns are off the charts and so is the quality. Mr. Tavern, I'm curious. How would you describe?

31
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,400
That's his official name and title. Please be respectful, everyone. Mr. Tavern,

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,880
how would you describe your Let's Plays style?

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,680
I don't really know. I just think up of things that are funny and I just try to do them.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,960
I've been dying to ask you for years at years at this point.

35
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,760
I think I know what you're going to ask, because I was just about to ask the same thing.

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,480
Were you going to ask him whether he...

37
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
Whether he does them right as he's doing it or if he goes back over and dubs over them.

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,440
Or is it dubbed in after? Because it's so tight, your lines, the stuff you say is so tight,

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,400
one after another, and it's really funny. I feel like it has to be scripted.

40
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,280
It has to be scripted. It has to be put in afterwards.

41
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,400
Well, you're correct on both of those accounts. It's post commentary, so it's done after I record

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,000
the gameplay footage, and it is scripted. Okay. Fantastic.

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,760
And as we've established in the pre-show, by the way, Ben St. D value is all scripted content.

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,240
Any rehearsed media is invalid and worthless artistically, so that's the major problems here.

45
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean, it's less. It's made less. It's a good thing that the champion,

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
heralded comic, never had a script at all. The champion was all improv.

47
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,440
You know, my whole life is just a big improv. That's true. That's true. A tanking improv session

48
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,880
one day at a time. If I could be that funny without a script, I certainly would.

49
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,200
Of course. I just want to share. I don't know if you remember Mr. T for short.

50
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,760
But there was one occasion where I hooked up at the old house I lived in with a bunch of friends.

51
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,760
I hooked up a projector, and we projected your Let's Plays onto the wall, and we all hung out

52
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,360
for the evening and just relaxed to the sounds of Gamer's Tavern. It was really great. And I

53
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,720
tweeted a picture of it. Yeah, actually, I remember seeing that. I saw that on Twitter.

54
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was me. That was pretty cool. That's awesome. Thanks.

55
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,640
You know what's great about your content? Okay, so guys, in case we haven't made it clear,

56
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,080
the whole shtick that Gamer's Tavern does is he's got his Let's Play footage that he's playing

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:24,880
games, and he just mercilessly, unyieldingly, one after another after another, just lumbasts you

58
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,840
with puns, unceasing, unpityless, or pitpityless, merciless puns. Well, I mean, it's not all puns,

59
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,600
but there are quite a few. It's not all puns, but some of it is just commentary on the game,

60
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,920
which is also cool. Sometimes. What I love about it is that it's not like completely,

61
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,760
like there's no, there is like comedic timing and pauses in between the jokes that is just long

62
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,680
enough for it to feel like a realistic pause, which is why people, like why we were wondering

63
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
whether you do it off the cuff, because there's like, you know, you're playing the game and there's

64
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,280
a pause that is like, it's not so long that it's like nothing is happening, but it's long enough

65
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,360
to make it everything really funny and just like, and not like you just, you know, you just sit back

66
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,880
and you just let it all wash over you. It's almost sort of anti-humor in the sense that like, the

67
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,920
pauses are just long enough to give you room to breathe in between the puns, at least for my

68
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,320
favorite of your videos, I always think of like the sonic ones, when you're on like the ice levels,

69
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,880
ice to meet you. Oh, it's snow, snow problem.

70
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,480
But it's like, it's like an Andy Warhol, if I, is that, wait, is that the right, who's the guy

71
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,320
who, uh, who's the guy who Jim Carrey played? Uh, uh, Jim Carrey. Andy Kaufman. Andy Kaufman,

72
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,000
that's the one. It's almost Andy Kaufman style of like anti-humor, because the puns are super,

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,040
you know, they're just incredibly obvious, but it's the way that they're done just over and over

74
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,880
and over again, just builds up this like, it doesn't start, it's a slow build until eventually you

75
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,880
just hit this peak, like this combo of just hilarity after one after another. It's such an

76
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,200
experience. I don't know what it is, sometimes with your delivery, it sounds almost like,

77
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,800
like you'll make a pun, and then like the one I remember is, I think I remember you made a bunch

78
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,440
of cloud puns about when, um, when Kirby is walking around in the clouds, like you'll make a

79
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,600
cloud pun, and then there'll be a pause, and then you'll kind of, you'll come back in with your dry

80
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,120
delivery, and you'll make some more, and it's like, it's, it's like, it's almost like a self-aware kind

81
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,320
of like, well, I made one, I have to make some more, I'm just gonna do it again.

82
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,480
Uh, do you feel that kind of compulsion to just keep going with the theme as long as possible?

83
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
Is there, yeah, what's your, what's your thought process as you're coming up with these?

84
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,880
Is it just really just, I'm going to keep doing this as long as it's on screen. I'll just keep

85
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,200
making the joke about clouds or ice or whatever it might be. Uh, yeah, it's something like that.

86
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,640
I mean, uh, to me, I feel like, uh, what's the point of watching it? Let's play anymore if the

87
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,840
commentary isn't funny or interesting. Damn right. Absolutely. So, um, I work really hard to always

88
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,640
have something to say about whatever's on screen or maybe, uh, you know, just jokes or puns or

89
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,880
whatever. So, um, I have to find inspiration somewhere, so I kind of look at what's on screen,

90
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,040
and I try to make puns about it. And then when it's not on screen anymore, I make puns about

91
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,000
whatever else ends up being on screen later. Yeah, and it's, and then sometimes I'll make jokes.

92
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,280
I love the distinction between puns and jokes. Yes. I feel like I'm getting played right now.

93
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,760
I feel like you're on a higher level and you're meming me at this very moment. Like I'm just not,

94
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,760
I don't know, like you're, you're some sort of ancient Egyptian alien pharaoh who understands

95
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,200
things in a higher plane than I do. We've only read about this game of Tavern on pyramid walls

96
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,080
in ancient hieroglyphs, and now we've done the summoning circle. We have him here today. We

97
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,960
can already believe it. It's anonic. Well, uh, I guess ancient manuscripts describes me well,

98
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,760
because, uh, I, uh, I started my website in, in 2002. Whoa. Yeah, we should talk about that.

99
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
We should talk about that. That, that's pretty impressive. And I'm actually looking here. Um,

100
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
you haven't updated, I think a lot of your Let's Plays in, in a little while, but I'm looking

101
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,320
at your review updates and you put out your Golden Axe Warrior one, uh, what, like three,

102
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,560
four days ago or something, and then like a two weeks or so before that Axe Battler two weeks

103
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,360
before that, um, Golden Axe the Dual. So you, you really churn these things out on your website.

104
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,960
I haven't really read too many of them myself, but, uh, is this more of your passion or this more

105
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,320
of your interest kind of doing the reviews as opposed to the Let's Plays? Well, uh, that's

106
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,480
where I started, you know, I started writing reviews back in 2003. I started a website in 2002

107
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,440
by the first review I published in 2003, which, uh, that's also when I first named the website, uh,

108
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,640
Gamer's Tower. Because before that, I didn't really have a name or design it. Before that,

109
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,280
I was basically like, uh, those all GeoCity sites from the late 90s. That's how it looked like.

110
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,480
Just full of anime gifts, no doubt, I'm sure. Well, actually it was even less than that. It was

111
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,720
basically a black background with red text to make your eyes. Oh, perfect. Yes. The most delicious.

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
No, I had an old website just like that. So we would have been brothers in arms back in the day.

113
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,880
Gaia online. So I just didn't have the good sense to stop. I kept it going over 15 years.

114
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,800
I'm curious what your professional background is. Do you have any like programming or any,

115
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
is your field of work related to this in any kind of capacity?

116
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Yeah, I guess you could say that. I know a little bit of programming. Obviously, I know

117
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,080
web, HTML stuff, CSS and things of that nature. That's cool. That's cool. Well, I mean, okay,

118
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,680
I mean, we've gone pretty in-depth with your content, which obviously we all love. Maybe we

119
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
should open up the floor a little bit and just see what we feel about. I mean, I don't know about you

120
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,720
guys, but I kind of want to talk about things like other popular let's plays in comparison to

121
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Gamer's Tavern and why he is vastly superior by every metric. There's a few ways to make a let's

122
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,400
play and true. A bunch of us, I mean, a bunch of us have done it. So we've got we've got insights.

123
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,680
The legendary T-Bat plays cannot be questioned as the pinnacle of all let's plays. It's just that

124
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,640
they've retired. I think I've told this before, but at the peak of all of that, my involvement

125
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:52,320
with the horseshoe crew and my, you know, my whole deal with those bastards, I tried watching

126
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,280
T-Bat plays and I couldn't get past one episode and I quit halfway through because it was the

127
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,920
worst video I've ever seen in my life and I was so bewildered and disappointed that I couldn't

128
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,640
even stand looking at my computer anymore and I had to go for a walk. I couldn't believe what I had

129
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,520
witnessed heroes had let you down. Yeah. Yeah. Literally exactly. I couldn't believe that Phantom

130
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,720
Orcheg did this. Like what happened? Like, like, do they have a ghostwriter for the normal videos?

131
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:28,080
Like, what is happening? Yes. Geez. I mean, I didn't think it was bad. Hey, remember the first

132
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,320
fighting game? Remember the one we did the fighting game? Like the very first episode we did that was

133
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
on our main channel that eventually we poured it over as like the first episode of T-Bat plays.

134
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah. That was that. That was that sick like fighting is magic or whatever. And that when I

135
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,160
put a bunch of like edits in and was pretty sick. Yeah. That one was good. That was a quality,

136
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,400
quality thing. I mean, maybe I'm crazy, but I enjoyed T-Bat plays Equestria Bound. Yeah.

137
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,560
Over a hundred episodes. Over a hundred. We were having more time. I mean, yeah.

138
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,720
I guess that's one way to phrase it. No, that's like, it's kind of weird that there is so much

139
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,000
content that I have not consumed because I'm normally the content minor. I mined as much

140
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,680
content as I produced Bitcoin on my computer. But I don't like, was there anything worth listening to?

141
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,320
Let me see that's the thing. The Let's Play is coming a few camps and T-Bat plays is probably,

142
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,760
is easily the champion of the terrible Let's Play camp. It is not good. It is like we simply

143
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,640
describe the things happening on screen and like talk about, you know, it's boring. I think that

144
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:48,320
the true nadir of T-Bat plays was T-Bat plays super lesbian horse RPG because no, no, I liked that.

145
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,120
I thought it was terrible because the game was really text heavy and a lot of what we did was

146
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,960
just reading text on the screen. At least we did voices. We did some voices, but like how long

147
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,520
do those stay interesting really? How long will a funny voice buoy a piece of content? I will tell

148
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,640
you this though. I'll tell you this though, Ben. The only video I ever go back to watch from T-Bat

149
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:20,560
plays is the finale of horseshoe whatever. Super lesbian horse RPG. When the Anamanaguchi song

150
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,800
drops at the end and it's us reacting to it, that was good. Do you actually go back and revisit that?

151
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,240
That one moment, yes I do. I have several times. I have not, but that's interesting.

152
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,280
Maybe I will. Maybe I will just for old time sake. It's always funny to see what kind of weird,

153
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,480
like not important, not grandiose videos that we all secretly have in infinity before and go back

154
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,960
and listen to from our past. Like that episode, I'm sure does not rake in the view. I'm sure it's

155
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,360
not that popular or that like remembered or celebrated. There's just something about that

156
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
will just stick out in your mind forever. I have a lot of views like that from the past that don't

157
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
like like Measurement Man. I fucking love Measurement Man. Measurement Man is my

158
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,560
shit. I love that video. I forget which episode it's from, but the moment, I mean,

159
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,040
I put this in one of my videos because I loved it so much, but it's when,

160
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,760
fuck, it's the dude, what the freak? Like that one moment of duties is so great.

161
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,560
Well, okay. What do you guys think of the Game Grumps? Game Grumps. You get to say something

162
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,880
first. Well, I'll talk about Game Grumps. The Game Grumps introduced me to the idea that Let's

163
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:40,000
Plays were not terrible. Because before that, I had only heard of the idea of like Let's Plays.

164
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,400
I'd seen things on the side of YouTube. We all used to try some quite a bit. Let's play this.

165
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,360
Why would I want to watch someone else play a game? And Game Grumps, they were just really funny

166
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,960
from day one. I saw the video from Egoraptor linking to it, and I clicked on it, and it was great.

167
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:06,400
And to this day, I think there hasn't been like a daily upload Let's Play show that is good.

168
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,240
Aaron! We got a certain nation just for the white race, Aaron!

169
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,040
Oh my gosh. That's John for you. Yeah, I guess so.

170
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,720
Gamestaven, do you have any experience watching other Let's Plays?

171
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Loads. I've been watching them since 2008 or 2007 or something like that.

172
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,720
But I kind of lost interest in watching them because once the novelty wore off,

173
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,000
kind of found them boring. But there is one guy in particular I like still,

174
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,520
one Let's Spare. And if you like my stuff, you'll probably like his stuff a lot as well.

175
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,600
His name is Karma Jolt. I don't know if you've heard of him. Probably not,

176
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,520
because he only has like 500 subscribers. He's really funny and he does the same scripted style

177
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,960
of commentary that I do. How do you spell that? He's been doing it before. Karma Jolt is just,

178
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,640
you know, the word karma and Jolt. Oh, Karma Jolt, okay. Oh god, his last video one month ago

179
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,600
is channel update moving on. Oh no, we caught him at the tail end. Rest in peace. He's not quitting,

180
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,880
he's just on a break. Oh, okay, cool. Glad to hear it. He kind of updates infrequently,

181
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,240
kind of like me. Actually, it's more accurate to say that I'm kind of like him because he came

182
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:41,440
before I did. Oh, he must be old school. I mean, I'm seeing like 30 videos uploaded over the course

183
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,600
of a month. Yeah, okay. Well, recently he's been updating more frequently. He sure has.

184
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,240
And his recent videos aren't scripted. Okay. Oh, so Ben would like them is what you're saying.

185
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,600
Yeah, they'd be vastly superior. Just in principle. I would just like to mention for the crowd,

186
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,320
so I can be, I can be vaunted and approved of in the comment section. I will wear on my badge,

187
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,600
much like call cost victims wore the Golden Juden star on their shirt proudly. I will wear the badge

188
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,680
of being one of the few people who found Gingrumps through John first and I clicked on

189
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,920
his link from his channel. Talk about GamerCred. Talk about GamerCred. I know. I was talking to John

190
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,920
before and I was like, John knows Egoraptor? Egoraptor like has friends and is like a person

191
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,800
that like exists in the physical material world. I'm losing my shit and I couldn't believe that

192
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:50,800
my rinky dink god, god king, John Tron knew Egoraptor. It obliterated my perception of reality.

193
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,040
It was incredible. How big was John at that time? Was he like a 500,000 kind of guy or something?

194
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,520
No, no. It was like, yeah, 10,000, 50,000 sort of. Geez. When he made Gingrumps, he was that size?

195
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,280
He was not big. He got big from Reddit and it was like, you know, a big front page post and he got

196
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,600
like a couple thousand subscribers from, well not a couple, like maybe 10,000, 20,000 subscribers.

197
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,680
And Gingrumps is what like five years old now or something? Yep. Damn. What do you know?

198
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,400
The thing with like, let's plays, I feel like there's certain types and they usually fall

199
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,640
into two main categories. One is about the game and the other is about the personalities.

200
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,640
And you can sort of like mix and match like a slider. Like are you talking about the game more

201
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,080
and or are you just playing a game and not even talking? You're just talking and it's got

202
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,200
gameplay in the background. T-Bap, I feel like was talking about the game, which is why I didn't

203
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,840
find it that interesting because I would rather listen to you talk about cool things. And then

204
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,600
things like Digi's Let's Plays were mostly not about the game at all. Victor would be playing

205
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,840
something. Digi's were way better. And he was just talking about stuff and he even called it a podcast.

206
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,040
Yeah. And like Gingrumps was about the personalities. But after a certain point,

207
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:24,000
they run out of stuff to say. They just... Well, a few life things change for those boys and they

208
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,840
had to change. Like for Digi Bros, they had to like, you know, it wasn't just they ran out of

209
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,320
things to say. Oh, no, no, not Digi. I was thinking about Gingrumps. But yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah.

210
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,920
Were you talking about like the Jontron leaving stuff? No, I'm talking about, well, I mean,

211
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,720
at the end of the Jontron era, that it was sort of winding down as well. And then Dan era, as you

212
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:54,320
call it, it was also sort of like, occasionally, I'll click on a Game Grumps. But most it used

213
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,360
to be I would watch every single episode because they were always really funny bits. But now I

214
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:08,720
spread out. I started watching Grumps like pretty like a little bit after John left. And I got into

215
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,920
Dan and I listened to a lot of like the early Dan stuff and I really liked it. But yeah, eventually

216
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,760
it came to be like, I feel like we're now like revisiting old topics or we're just talking about

217
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,400
nothing, you know? Yeah. Well, it's just it's been every day for like years at this point. Like,

218
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:36,000
like human experiences and lives are like a physical, what's the word, like fossil fuel

219
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,520
mine. Like eventually it will all be used up all of your experiences. You all of the reminiscing

220
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,520
you do is like a plus one Bitcoin you are mining and you will eventually run out of life experiences.

221
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,960
That graphics card is going to wear out. Exactly. Exactly. So you're not going to be able to, you

222
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,560
know, fucking survive on that for that long and they've just been talking nonstop every

223
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,520
fucking day for years. Of course, it's just going to become nothing. Makes sense. So like this way

224
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:13,520
is for like the personality driven Let's Plays to get old because the personality is overexposed

225
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,400
to like the internet, like people just see them over and over and then they run out of,

226
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,040
they run out of like, yeah, you've been hanging around my house for too long, go away, you know,

227
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:30,720
that sort of feeling. You know, that's why. But then the opposite is when the like it's usually

228
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,160
things like Gamer's Tavern or maybe even like some of Spoonie's early Let's Plays where it's

229
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,440
either like a hybrid or like entirely scripted and talking about the stuff on the screen to the

230
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,440
point where it can't really get old because as long as it's funny, you know, as long as you

231
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,280
find a way to continue to make it funny, you can keep doing this forever.

232
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah, it's kind of like, I know the Game Grumps at certain points and maybe still we're taking

233
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,800
like comedy classes, like professional actual, you know, like acting classes and that kind of

234
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,120
stuff. So like it seems like they're, by doing that, they're kind of preparing themselves for

235
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,080
like a long term, actually delivering like a show and working on like, what's the running for,

236
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,320
Extemporaneous Comedy or whatever it is. Yeah, Improv. Improv, exactly. Improv. And then like

237
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,400
in the same way, like Gamer's Tavern for here, for example, like the way he like, you know,

238
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,560
writes scripts and stuff, and I suppose it's a little bit different than just like live Let's Plays

239
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,840
or anything. But he's also, he's like generating content with which he, you know, will stick in

240
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,520
his episodes versus when you, as much was saying, if you just talk about your life, you will definitely

241
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,920
at some point just run out of interesting things to say, which I think is a lot of people have

242
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,040
experienced that with Game Grumps. If you do that for long enough, and if you do Let's Plays,

243
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,000
you know, a lot of the time, like a Game Grumps does, then your life becomes telling stories

244
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,080
about your life. So once you tell your eventual life story, and then you get to the part where

245
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,560
you start Let's Play, where you're gonna say like, oh, remember the story that I told? Wasn't it funny

246
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,120
how I told that? Remember that one time we played a game on the show? Wasn't that crazy? That will

247
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,280
be your story. Yeah. Yeah. And then it just gets less and less like interesting because it's less

248
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,680
and less like fresh new information for people. So I think you really got to do something to like,

249
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,680
maybe you just like take a break, I don't know, maybe even for a year, and then just like go live

250
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,000
a life and have experiences. Then I mean, you'll have built up some experiences that you can bring

251
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,240
back and just like dump onto the table again. So that's maybe that's the cycle. Is it maybe it's

252
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,520
inevitable that happened? I feel like that's like a good idea to like make good content is like,

253
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,280
oh, take a break, experience two things from a regular perspective. The problem is like,

254
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,920
you just basically torpedo your entire business during that because like, if you stop for a week,

255
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,920
YouTube will fucking kill you. So like, you have to be on their dick 24 seven or the algorithm

256
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,320
will murder you. Well, what about this is a theoretical business model, like a Game Grumps

257
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,200
style channel, where you have like hosts, maybe kind of cycling in and out of the channel. So

258
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
the channel is always putting out content, but the individual contributors have time to go off and

259
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,520
kind of mind Bitcoin. And then you can remove the game entirely and just have it be the people

260
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,360
talking. And then you can, you know, you can cycle through the members. Yeah, yeah, it's kind of

261
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,600
like it's too fancy to actually join. So it'll just be consistent group people is normally

262
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,560
bother show fucking up. Yeah, you know, eventually the hosts just start procrastinating. You know,

263
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:35,680
it's fucking it's a it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Well, I get it. I would like to bring

264
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,200
up moment depending on depending on how many tomatoes are thrown my way. I'd like to bring up

265
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,320
the shitty juvenile embarrassing that I would even talk about this topic of Game Grumps drama.

266
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,800
Just what happened? I'm the kind of guy I will not be, I will not be, you know,

267
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,240
I won't be shy about this fact. I am the kind of guy who when John, you know, left, I was the kind

268
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,040
of guy was like typing like, like haunted Game Grumps ARG explain explain to me this content

269
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,520
mansion story. This is a good opportunity for me to reveal the truth because John is me and I have

270
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:23,440
told myself the truth. And here's what happened. John and Aaron, they started Game Grumps and then

271
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,960
he hit Susie didn't he? Huh? He hit Susie. Yeah, he beat Susie to shit. Yeah, she's a zombie now.

272
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,160
John and Aaron started the Game Grumps and they didn't know it was going to be a big thing.

273
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,240
And then it was and then they had to start a they made a joint bank account to have funds go from

274
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,880
that so they could both think. But there's like hints here and there that John, I mean, you know,

275
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,080
Freudian slips, but like he thought of it as his show. So what I think happened, this is all like

276
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,360
out of my brain, is that John wanted to stop Game Grumps because he wanted to work more on

277
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,320
John Tron. He also wanted to go to New York because the continued guys were there and a girl he was

278
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,200
talking to was over there and he wanted to go live with her. And so what John said is like her name.

279
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,640
I love Kim Possible. And then what he did is he said, OK, I want to quit the Game Grumps.

280
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,040
But he didn't just say that he wanted Game Grumps to end. And Aaron was like, well, wait, why can't

281
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,840
we just continue without you? And he's like, well, I don't know. I don't I and it's like there's a

282
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,920
big argument because the John wanted it to be ended. And Aaron wanted to continue without John.

283
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,640
And John was like, fuck you. And he left. And that's why they were angry at each other.

284
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,320
And then Danny was brought in to replace him. And nobody really wanted to talk about it.

285
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,600
Aaron didn't want to make John look like an evil piece of shit. And John didn't want to make Aaron

286
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,840
look like a piece of shit. So they just both kept quiet and it became really awkward. And that's

287
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,400
what I think happened. And then, of course, eventually things eventually warmed up and they,

288
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,240
you know, are talking. And, you know, they were on the Star Wars thing together. So things,

289
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,120
obviously, if Danny was smaller, I could brush my teeth with them.

290
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,720
Well, I was just going to say, he's just like you. That's a good little summary of the whole

291
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,400
thing. I think we now at this point, we pretty much all know prove all the details that I mean,

292
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,600
I still think, you know, Susie, you know, talking sexy time. But no.

293
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,960
Why? Yeah, on top of all that, John was fucking Susie the whole time.

294
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,520
She was always there. But that didn't have anything to do with it.

295
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,520
There's the hot goss I came here for. Indeed. Well, cool. All right. So I mean,

296
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,840
are there any other Let's Players? What about the Yahtzee? Who talked about, people were big

297
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,920
fans of Yahtzee, right? Yahtzee and the, God, there was the Ego.

298
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,360
The insufferable game social media crapcast, right? No. Hang on. God, what was the name of Yahtzee's

299
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,520
Let's Play show that he did with that fuckface Gabe? Oh, was it? I think it was called Let's Drown

300
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,840
Out. That's the one. I'm also a fan of Yahtzee's reviews. Of course, me too. Yeah, I love Yahtzee.

301
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,600
He's great. And I really like Let's Drown Out. And I don't even mind his co-host, Gabe, most of

302
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,800
the time. It's just sometimes I just get the feeling that he's the biggest douchebag and I hate him.

303
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,840
In what way? Is this Gabe with Penny Arcade fame? They'll argue a bunch. Wait,

304
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,200
is that Gabe from Penny Arcade? Is that who that is? No, no, it's an Australian guy.

305
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,520
They'll argue a bunch and Yahtzee will accuse Gabe of waffling. Like, Gabe will say something and

306
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,960
Yahtzee will be like, well, I don't think that's true. And Gabe will be like, well, neither do I,

307
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,920
but da, da, da, da. And Gabe will be like, you're waffling. Like, just out with it,

308
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,360
you're waffling. Gabe will be like, fuck you. I'm not waffling. I'm just saying what I think.

309
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,680
And I always agree with Yahtzee. Gabe is a total waffler. Just like fucking John Kerry. And he'll

310
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:05,680
just get killed. And he'll talk about how he's studying to be a teacher. It's really important

311
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:11,760
and relevant to anything that's going on and it never is. I can't fucking stand it.

312
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,280
Did he ever become that teacher? Did he do it? Not to the best of my knowledge.

313
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,320
By the way, I'm looking at the channel right now. The last Let's Drown Out I Can See was

314
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,000
uploaded over a year ago. Oh, wait, wait, no. One, oh wait, yep, a year ago. Yep. Looks like

315
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,840
they stopped. Looks like they stopped. I guess they stopped because Yahtzee moved to America,

316
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,400
I think. He did. That's news to me. He's on our soil. We can track him down. Yahtzee once.

317
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,520
If we're just listing off the people who we watched or do watch currently, I'm in the

318
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,280
class, you know, electrical beast, billion seat, you know, Lyme Pop School, my personal

319
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,800
giants of the industry. Please. You know, I wouldn't be where I am today without watching

320
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:07,760
Billiam C's incredible spine-cracking Mario Let's Plays. I'm sorry, are you saying Billiam C?

321
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,120
Yeah, you don't know who Billiam C is? I don't think so.

322
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,600
Billiam like William, but with a B? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Here, here,

323
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,920
Gamerstab, you know who Billiam C is, don't you? Yeah, I do. Yeah, yeah, what do you think about him?

324
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,560
I think he's great, but he doesn't appear to be aware of it.

325
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,440
Yeah. What does that mean? Strapolate on that a little bit?

326
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,640
I know what you mean. I know what you mean, Gamerstab.

327
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,960
You gotta watch Red Supri to find out. Yeah, I was just about to say I watch Red Supri all the

328
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,760
time. I kind of stopped since they started doing like weird Kickstarter videos. It wasn't too into

329
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,480
those, but I love Red Supri. I know about all, you know, shit through there. Red Supri, to my

330
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,120
knowledge, correct me if I'm wrong, Gamerstab, but Red Supri is sort of a, it's a commentary channel

331
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,840
where they take Let's Plays and then they commentate over the Let's Plays, and these

332
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,040
Let's Plays are of dubious quality at best. Are we talking about like the greatest Let's

333
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:15,520
Play of all time, Dark Side Fill with his How Not to Play, kind of like those? I suppose so. No,

334
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:22,960
those are commentated. These are, this is like, they're like a Mystery Science Theater 3000-ing

335
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,080
these Let's Plays. Yes. Well, that's kind of, okay, fair enough, fair enough. And the thing

336
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,200
that's interesting about it is I'm fairly certain that one of the co-hosts is the guy who like

337
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,920
invented Let's Play. Yeah, his name is Slow Beef, or I think it was either Slow Beef or

338
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,640
Diabetes that did the first Let's Play. I think it's Slow Beef, I think it's Slow Beef. Yeah,

339
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:52,400
it was Slow Beef. Well, and so it's interesting to see like this guy who like created this like

340
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:59,600
weird like cultural worldwide phenomenon looking at like the worst of the worst of his spawn and

341
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,240
ridiculing them extensively. You know, that is a fantastic angle. Is he popular with this series?

342
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,720
Retsu Prey is pretty big. Yeah, yeah, they're pretty big. Okay. I've seen, they don't do actual

343
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:20,400
Retsu Prey's that much anymore. I'm not sure why. I just realized that Retsu Prey is a joke on Let's

344
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,280
Play. Yeah, that's what it is. Fantastic. I would highly recommend a lot of old ones. My favorite one

345
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,880
is... The Billy MC ones are good. Yeah, Billy MC ones are great. My favorite one is when you're here,

346
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,840
your family. I fucking love that one. These all sound fantastic. I want to watch all of them.

347
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,840
But I think it's time that we crack open the nut I referenced earlier and talk about the

348
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,160
unequivocally greatest Let's Player in the World, with of course the exception of Gamer's Tavern

349
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,240
and the King of Hate and the original Fighting Game Master. And it's Darkseid Phil. Darkseid

350
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:04,800
fucking Phil. He is the only V-approved YouTuber, the only one. He is incredible. He is a god. Gamer

351
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,080
Staphen, what is your take on Darkseid Phil, if you're familiar with his work? I've heard of him,

352
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:16,160
but I'm honestly not very familiar with the guy, unfortunately. Okay, fair enough. I mean,

353
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,880
you've been spared a little bit. I'd just like to throw out... Actually, you know what? I won't

354
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,200
say that. Okay, I will say it since I brought it up, but someone just linked me this very morning

355
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,760
saying that for the second time, give. Your creaky haunted house needs to shut up for recording

356
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,360
her podcast. They say Darkseid Phil was caught masturbating on stream for the second time ever.

357
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,080
Okay, that is not real, I don't think, because it was just audio. He could have just

358
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,160
been yawning loudly. So, frankly, I think people are exaggerating with that, but he definitely

359
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,280
did one time. I am not familiar with this phenomenon. How does one even make such a

360
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:06,320
fault? There's something wrong with your yawns. That's how I yawn. That's how I yawn.

361
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,680
I mean, you know, when you stream like all day, every day, you know, sometimes you make a slip

362
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,800
Yeah, you leave your camera on and you just, you know, just the other day, just the other day,

363
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,160
I had just finished a live stream and, you know, me and The Misses were getting up to some activities

364
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,520
and, you know, I was kind of petrified. I had continued to stream by, you know, but luckily,

365
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,400
I had not, but it's just as easy as forgetting to click one button sometime and there you go.

366
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,760
This is why no one should ever live stream. It's the worst idea in history.

367
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I thought you were going to say no one should associate with women. Concentration camps now,

368
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,120
that's all I'm saying. You know, that's a safe thing too, but...

369
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,480
Darkseid Phil is a legend and it's kind of amazing to watch him. He's gone through so many

370
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,960
ups and downs over his career. He really is a, he's like a slightly, well, okay,

371
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,200
he's honestly significantly more together version of like Christian Weston Chandler,

372
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,400
but like he has his own massive weaknesses as a man. Like he's terrible with money,

373
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,880
he like is not, when he started to get big, like doing Let's Plays and stuff, he just like bought

374
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,040
a big old house and like a new car or something and moved out. I don't know, like to Seattle or

375
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,840
something and just like, and now he's paying for it. Like his girlfriend left him a little while ago.

376
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,760
I don't know exactly what, I don't want to speculate on his life too much. I just want to state the

377
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,720
facts here. The fact are that he overextended himself and continues to bring up how like he

378
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,080
is one of the, he is one of the guys who started like Let's Plays and before it got big and,

379
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,240
you know, continued it getting well. I don't know if he was, it sounds like this Retsu Prey guy is

380
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,200
actually the first, but he was certainly one of the formative people on YouTube doing Let's Plays.

381
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:53,760
And just to watch his life and to watch him be such a terrible, just like guy kind of in general,

382
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,360
I actually am in no way with like these assholes, the sons of Kojima who are like that whole crowd

383
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,160
that like go, they find like every reason to shit on the guy that I think is just like way beyond

384
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,200
the pale and like not actually fair to him whatsoever. Like I hate when people take it too far,

385
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,560
but the tangible things he has done of just being such an asshole and he tells the story one time

386
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,640
of like what an inconvenience his like girlfriend was for like something like having like a mental

387
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,560
breakdown at work and like making him go like take care of her and stuff. Like it's entirely possible

388
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,920
that she was very inconsiderate at some point in that story, but the way that he told it certainly

389
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,200
did not paint him with any degree of sympathy. And he sounds like a big asshole. So, but just

390
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,600
he's such a character. I really want to dive in and I've been thinking of doing a PCB lecture on

391
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,240
him specifically. So let me know people if that's something that interests you. People really want

392
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,480
that. They've been asking for that. I think they do want it one day. I can't guarantee it for

393
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,200
Radcon through anything, but one day I will have to do it. I did see the down the rabbit hole about

394
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,360
Darkseid Phil. Yes. And my only real exposure to him before that was through the let's have the

395
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,320
how not to play with Dark Souls. And I mean, I don't know how much I don't know how much you can

396
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,520
infer about a guy based on like what he says while he's fucking playing Dark Souls or whatever,

397
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,920
but he was a huge asshole and just the most obnoxious dude. Like especially the way he would

398
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,920
like just he would blame the game. Like his blaming the game is the biggest meme. It is the biggest

399
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,640
meme about Darkseid Phil. It's and the wow, really? You know, when the are you saying that it's not

400
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,400
true? I am. No, no, I'm completely agreeing with you. He blames the game for like the vast majority

401
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,160
of everything that goes wrong when he's playing. See the thing with that is that I like I do it too.

402
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,520
I mean, I blame the game like verbally, but like when I calm down later, I'm like, well, that was

403
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,280
just me fucking up. See, not him, not him. He does not. It's his worldview that like the games

404
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:02,880
cheat. My only exposure to Darkseid Phil was like knowing vaguely that he is not good at video games

405
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,200
and then watching several Street Fighter Street Fighter Terminancy was in where he kicked ass.

406
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,480
Darkseid Phil has been riding on this wave of being like a super sick, nasty Street Fighter

407
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,960
player like for his entire career and like refuses to play anyone in it. It's it's exactly like

408
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,400
the episode of Seinfeld where Jerry is like gonna race the guys and he like he chooses not to play.

409
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,440
He chooses not to play. So he doesn't lose his title. It's just like that. It's just like and

410
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,680
you know, I honestly, I honestly do not have that much hatred for the guy. He just seems like kind

411
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,160
of a jerk. I actually respect him in a lot of ways. In other ways, I don't, you know, just because he

412
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,080
seems kind of like a jerk. But like, I mean, hey, man, he was out there. He was one of the pioneers

413
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:48,400
of the Let's Players. He is this guy who realized why don't I just set up my fucking camera behind

414
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,160
me, film the TV that I'm playing games on and upload these full Let's Plays. You know, I

415
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,360
it's that's that's creativity. I don't ironically love camcorder LPs. Like when you can actually

416
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:05,120
see the screen, it's super comfy and it's super fucking aesthetic. And really honestly grossed

417
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,600
to me. I fucking love camcorder LPs when they're when you and of course, you can actually see

418
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,920
the screen and it's not blinding light. I gotta look up how many Let's Plays Darkseid Phil has

419
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,720
uploaded on his channel. Okay, DSP Gaming has, okay, no, sorry, that's the number of subs. Okay,

420
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,360
I can't check right now, but I think he has like hundreds of thousands of uploads or like the most

421
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:32,240
out of like anyone in all of YouTube, something like that. It's been doing multiple times a day

422
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,360
for like, since like YouTube was young. Yeah. And we're talking like 10 a day or something like

423
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:43,680
that for, because he splits up his Let's Plays into so many small individual parts. Let me just

424
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,920
see what he's done today or possibly yesterday. You gotta get those ad dollars, man. You gotta run

425
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,640
an ad on every video. Let me tell you how many videos were uploaded 11 hours ago. One, two, three,

426
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:04,960
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 videos were uploaded 11 hours ago. And how

427
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:13,920
about 16 hours ago, you might ask, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,

428
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:24,160
12, 13, and then 17 hours ago, 14, 15, 16, hang on, 17, 18, 19, 20. He's uploading. He's uploading.

429
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,760
34 videos yesterday, 34 videos. He's uploading over one video an hour, like one and a half videos

430
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,800
an hour. That's insane. They're all like 10 minutes, you know, snippets of this Let's Play. Just,

431
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,480
wow. Unbelievable. That's like the brute force as sense method right there.

432
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,320
Damn right it is. Is this the like most optimal way to do this? Because all these videos have like

433
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,320
150 views or so. No, it is definitely not. Nobody has the time for that. Even if they're only 10

434
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,000
minutes long each. Yeah. It just feels overwhelming to just click on the next one every so. That's

435
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,440
around the views I get. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, he does put out again so many videos. So like,

436
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,840
I suppose all the views add up to some degree. But like, I'm looking at his videos from like a

437
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,280
while ago, they get like 500 views a piece. So even if you upload 30 views or 30 videos of this

438
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,640
thing, if they each get around 500 videos or 500 views, that's a total of 15,000 views in one day.

439
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,000
And that's not terrible, I guess. But for a guy who's trying to make it is so living,

440
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,760
I mean, that's not, that's not sustainable. I mean, you know what, I'm not here to critique

441
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,480
his business model, really. I'm just here to point out that he is a man of legend, you know,

442
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,240
and I wish him well. I hope he keeps it up. Is that what this is about about wishing him well?

443
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,960
Well, sort of. I don't hate the guy. I don't hate the guy. I want to talk about like,

444
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,880
the whole like, cutting episodes up into 10 minute chunks. I have, I used to do Let's Plays,

445
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,120
and part of the fun, for some reason, was like having my big recording and then splitting it up

446
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:07,920
into 10 minute chunks, and, and, and like uploading like 10, and like spreading them out to release

447
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,000
scheduled over like one per day. And I don't know, it's just that that was a cool thing. But like,

448
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,440
those videos, if you ever look at my Let's Plays on Gibbon Gaming, the very first ones are like,

449
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm the meekest you could ever imagine. Even meeker than, than currently. And it's like,

450
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,480
over the course of the Let's Plays, and then into streams. You, you, like, you can see me grow

451
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,320
into a real person. Yeah, I sound like, I sound like a mouse in the Rayman 2 Let's Plays.

452
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,920
You're like a chiapet, only far less entertaining.

453
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,680
Yeah, yeah, they're not even good. They're never, they've never been good. I kind, I kind of like gave

454
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,760
up the, the, even though I liked splitting episodes up into 10 minute chunks, and, and seeing the

455
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,560
uploads, like, oh yeah, look at all these uploads, because Digi used to say, yeah, I've made like

456
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,240
100 videos this month, and most of them are Let's Plays. I'm like, yeah, I like numbers.

457
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,600
Yeah, no kidding. I, I like numbers too. I like saying I can make, I can upload a bunch of videos,

458
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,680
but nobody cared. And, and the live streams, the live streams are so much less editing intensive,

459
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:18,560
so much more fun, and there are some incredible moments in those, like the Minecraft times with,

460
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,880
with Munchie here. That's right. Me, I was there. If there's, if there's anything that I can say

461
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,240
video games have impacted my life in such a way, it would be that now, unequivocally, because of

462
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,240
video games, I love seeing numbers go up. That's what I live for. When I wake up, I, I'm like,

463
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,480
what if I see a six turn into an eight today? I would lose my fucking mind. I love seeing numbers

464
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,520
go up. I am, I am, you, you guys know very well that I have grown into watching analytics and

465
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:54,080
compiling spreadsheets as in a fetishistic style fixation. And I, it's great and I love it. And

466
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,440
I definitely think video games, like I think of it as a video game in the way that, like,

467
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,040
my stats are rising. I'm going to unlock the ultimate weapon at some point.

468
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:09,200
Nate is totally stoked this month to play taxes 20, 2018. It's going to be a great time.

469
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,440
I have been prepping. I've been, I've been grinding out my skills, preparing all my

470
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,240
documentation. Basically, I've been basically specking into taxation mode for the last,

471
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,360
like six months or so. And it's time to read my rewards.

472
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,360
I want to comment. This is kind of like a weird tangent, but I think it's interesting.

473
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,960
Okay. Nate. So like, Darkseid Phil is like one of the, like one of the founding fathers of the,

474
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,560
of the let's play ethno stay. Right. Without question. Without question. Yes.

475
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,760
And, but, but he's averaging like shit views. That's true. This just reminds me, like, like a

476
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,400
month or so ago, I was just, you know, searching for homesick music because that's just the kind

477
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,120
of guy I am. And I found a video called a doctor explained by George Bunziaki and, and you know,

478
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,000
linking the comments or something. And it's, it's, it's the guy who made doctor,

479
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,320
like the Homestuck track doctor, John's land. Okay. And it has like 5,000 views. He has like

480
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,200
less than 300 subscribers. And it's really think like the guy who made Dr. Like, like

481
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,360
probably the most popular, like well received favorite of the homesick entire like OTST

482
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,720
doctor, like is a fucking nobody. Like he's dead in addition, fucking Africa now. No one remembers

483
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,440
him. Like no one gives a single shit about this guy, even though he made like the most successful

484
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,240
fucking track in Homestuck. See that, that's the thing right there. And it's the fact it, it strikes

485
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,680
me as a little bit unjust. Like it's not, it's so unjust. Illegal or anything. But it's, it's so weird

486
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,240
to me that all these people are honestly like significantly successful. Have their little

487
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,800
communities based on I should get that guy to work for me. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Maybe he would,

488
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,640
you know, I mean, obviously he's got skills, but like these guys who just like, for example,

489
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,120
with dark side fill, he gets pretty shit views. But people just, you know, like mock him and

490
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,040
take his content and like retool it in a mocking way and get just so many more views than he gets

491
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,880
and obviously more ad revenue and everything that comes with it. And like that's fine. That's not

492
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,480
criminal. It is relatively transformative. It just strikes me as like, I wish dark side fill

493
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,160
was in some way capitalizing on this too, because he's just languishing and just, it's sound, it's

494
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,120
seeing, it's my, you know, my, my, my faint hints of socialism buried deep down in my sake. You make

495
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,640
me think, God damn it. I wish he was getting a share of this too. Hashtag bash the fash.

496
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,120
I wanted to mention earlier that like going from let's place to live streams is what I did.

497
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,520
And, and a lot of other people have done that. Some successfully, some not.

498
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:51,920
One of my favorite, who's not really considered, yeah, it was German and, and star to maybe bring

499
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,960
up Demolition D a little bit. He's a little different, but still. Yeah. Well, what they did

500
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,680
was they used to make videos about, you know, they, they played a game and then they would

501
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,800
heavily edit it. So it's like, right. It's a let's play, but without the, the boring parts.

502
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,640
And, and it was really funny. And they were really funny. And they would often

503
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,320
collab with each other. And both of them have migrated over to Twitch, which is much more

504
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,080
critical. But in very different ways, in, in very, very different ways. And it's clear that,

505
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:28,000
that star is shit now. He sucks. He's real bad. He's got like, he's got really cool.

506
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,160
A new cool like intro graphic. He's way more successful. Like, like, okay, okay. Like, he,

507
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,120
he, he sucks. Like I would never watch a star stream. That would be poison. But like he, he,

508
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,680
he's way more successful. He, he's like, okay, okay. Well, just to explain. Star and German are

509
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,000
both like Team Fortress 2 players who basically did almost exclusively Team Fortress 2 content.

510
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,840
And then Overwatch came out and, and, and, and, and German just kind of, you know, stopped doing

511
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,280
TF2, but not like, you know, gotten to Overwatch a little bit, but that wasn't just his main thing.

512
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,160
But Star got super in Overwatch. And now he's like a, like a serious Overwatch streamer,

513
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,520
commentator guy. And he goes like Overwatch events. He's like a real esports boy and does that whole

514
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:13,280
scene. And it's just dreadful. It's just the most, the entire world. Like he was never that funny,

515
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,640
but it was sort of like the understated like, yeah, I'm just playing a game and he does something

516
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,960
really cool. And he's like, yeah, yeah, you're dead, you know, whatever. But now he's like screaming.

517
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,520
He's screaming constantly in his Overwatch, let's please. Is that good or bad? It sounds bad.

518
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,560
The screaming is, he's not good at it. And he's like, screams are never funny.

519
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,920
So these guys are like bros though, right? Are they like a team?

520
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:40,320
Well, I mean, they're their friends. I don't know what the situation is, but they haven't

521
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,640
like, collabed or done anything together in a long time. I just noticed they have a channel

522
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:52,080
called stir slash germa stream archive. That's someone else like a third party just uploads them.

523
00:50:52,160 --> 00:51:01,120
Germa has, has, has changed from, he's streaming and he's doing like any game,

524
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,960
like any game that could be funny. And he just makes it like, he tries really hard to make like

525
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,360
funny comedy videos. And he's really good. And he's my favorite boy.

526
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,280
We know this is a very interesting topic. The idea of maybe there's like a cultural shift

527
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,360
happening now from let's plays to streaming. I mean, I'm certainly, I'm streaming.

528
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,600
It's way more profitable, dude. Yeah.

529
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,640
I mean, you got your super chats, you got your stream labs, you got your Twitch,

530
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,760
you know, money stuff. And obviously that's going to drive people to do it.

531
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,640
Like I've been thinking about, I've really only tried on YouTube so far,

532
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,880
but at some point I'll probably try to switch out and, or Twitch out and like the stream lab

533
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,040
stuff and whatnot. But like what I'm, what I'm thinking about is just like, I had been doubting

534
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,960
myself like for a long time again, we'd all doubted like let's plays. And again, I don't think

535
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,880
they're obviously like going to stand the test of time as well as, I don't know, for example,

536
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,440
a Plinkett review. I want to get into that later.

537
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,440
But no need to get into that. But like the other day, I saw something that really rocked my

538
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,920
fucking world and it was, it was just like a snippet of, are you guys familiar with Dr. Disrespect?

539
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,440
You know that guy? No.

540
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,480
So he's like an extremely popular YouTuber, a Twitch streamer who recently had just gotten

541
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,480
into, he had like a little scandal or whatever. I don't care. But like he had, I think this is

542
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,280
as after he had come back and I just saw someone who uploaded a thing and here's what happened.

543
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,160
He's just like, he was like hanging out and like someone donated like five grand or something

544
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,680
all at once. He's like, wow, holy shit. And so he's just, you know, he's like playing the game

545
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,040
and he's, you know, he's got the face cam on him obviously. He's green screened a little bit

546
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,920
and he's like, wow, holy shit, hang on guys. We just got like a big donation. Hold up. And so

547
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,360
he presses a button like on his thing and like the visual changes and the visual is now we're

548
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,720
looking at like a big like night sky skyscraper field with like, like there's a big building

549
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,960
with like Twitch HQ, like on the top of the building. And I had never seen this before because

550
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,280
I haven't actually watched any of his actual streams. And it's all of a sudden, like on his

551
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,960
stream, we're now looking at a big image of like this, this nightline skyscape or whatever. And

552
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,280
we see Twitch HQ in the distance. All of a sudden, like on the bottom left of the screen onto this

553
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,360
like animation, Dr. Disrespect himself walks out into the animation. So, and then he points

554
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:15,760
up at Twitch HQ and he's like, there it is guys, Twitch HQ. I'm taking it for my own today or like

555
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,480
and I'm like, what is happening? How is he doing this? And so, so clearly, like at home,

556
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,040
he's got like a setup going on where he's got like a green screen somewhere and he can press a button

557
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,520
to like switch the viewer to like go to that and he's got it set up so that he can like suddenly

558
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:38,160
be in this cityscape, like looking up at Twitch HQ with like his green screen and like camera

559
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,720
set up at like any time he wants to. He's got this ready to go. So he can just like, he can be in

560
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,600
like this weird cyberpunk Twitch future looking up at the fucking Twitch HQ. I was like, this is

561
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,720
the most creative use of streaming I've ever seen in my entire goddamn life. And I'm starting to get

562
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,400
why this might be where things are going in the future. That sounds incredible. That sounds

563
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,960
indescribable. It was so, I was, I was rocked to my core. I could not believe someone had done

564
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,480
this, but it was like the coolest thing I've ever seen. By far the coolest thing I've ever seen

565
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,960
anyone do on Twitch or like while streaming, it was nuts. Like he must have had another camera,

566
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,720
a green screen setup, everything's ready to go. He must do this all the time, but just unbelievable,

567
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,400
incredible. I loved it. That's sort of like, like real broadcasting sort of, you must have a team of

568
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,960
people setting that up so you could click, click, click, change camera, everything. I mean, I was,

569
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,520
I was just thinking to myself like how I could do it and Xsplit, which is what I use, has like a

570
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,760
function where you can just like basically click to switch like views and it automatically does

571
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,680
just like changes the inputs. And if you set everything up, you can have it at like the push

572
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,360
of a button. If you set up everything ahead of time to just like have that ready to go while

573
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:50,000
you're streaming, but still like to put that whole production together is like, even the idea, the idea

574
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,680
just like, this is what I'm going to set up. This is what I'm going to do. Like that's just,

575
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,400
this guy just is like, he made this animation or something. He's just like, I'm just going to go

576
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,240
now, stand for a while, look up at this fictional Twitch HQ that I've invented in my own little

577
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,960
narrative on my stream. Like, holy shit, that's like the best idea I've ever heard. Just, I mean,

578
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:17,360
if he gets like a regular huge donations of like five grand, then I guess it's easy to pay for that.

579
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,760
They call him, yeah, he's doing very, very well. But like any of us could do this too if we just

580
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,920
had like a second camera running and a green screen. And all you do is like put the image up

581
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:32,400
or something. First video, first video of Radcon 3 checking the Kickstarter. Wow, guys, we got a

582
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,720
big donation coming, like cuts cuts to a recording of us. There it is guys, PCPHQ, we're going to

583
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,320
take it for ourselves. All I'm saying is, if we have PCPHQ and we have like a live stream room or

584
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,760
some sort of like talking room, we could definitely set something like this up. And I very much want

585
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,680
to. I would love that. I'm actually super into streaming. I love streaming. I think it's really

586
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,400
nice. I used to stream a lot, but I've fallen off the wagon now, but I really like it. I think

587
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,800
it's the way of the fucking future. I'm curious though. Mr. Tavern, what do you think of streaming?

588
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,080
Do you see it as possibly the way the future is going? Or do you think it's going to be

589
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,480
equal or just kind of parallel to let's playing stuff? Or what are your thoughts on the matter?

590
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:20,400
Well, I have no idea really. I've never been much for the wave of the future kind of thing,

591
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,680
if you know what I mean. Sure, fair enough. I usually review old games and play older games.

592
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:32,560
But on a personal level, it's really hard for me to watch streams because they usually

593
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:38,080
happen at very specific times. And I prefer YouTube videos because I can just watch them

594
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,720
whenever I want. I do like that. That's kind of the main advantage, isn't it? That's probably

595
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,920
one of the reasons why I've never gotten into watching streams. I do stream sometimes and I

596
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,400
like doing them a lot, but I've never gotten into watching them. I guess.

597
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,600
It's fun to stream just because there's no extra editing work you have to do. You just do it and

598
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,320
once it's done, it's up somewhere. That's great. It's a very relieving feeling to just know you're

599
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:11,200
done at the end. It's a different feeling from making a product because the whole thing with

600
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,480
let's plays is that if it's a personality driven let's play, you're basically hanging out with

601
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:22,960
the people on the let's play. Exactly. And a stream is just more directly adding to that so

602
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,640
that you can chat to the person in real time. The reason I like streaming is also one of the

603
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:35,520
reasons I don't like streaming. It's a two headed thing. It's a Hydra. I like the fact that I get

604
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:43,840
instant input and satisfaction from my trials and tribulations within the virtual world.

605
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,840
But then I also feel like it's kind of sometimes too fan oriented where it just

606
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,040
especially if you're watching stream archives and there is no streamer hasn't put up a

607
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,280
visual of the chat, who's just responding to things in chat and you'll have no idea what the

608
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,720
fuck is going on. So it's super archaic and hard to get into from an archive's point of view,

609
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,160
but I guess that's not the way streams are meant to be played. I'm wondering if maybe it makes the

610
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,440
most sense. I was thinking exactly that. If the point of streaming is to get the engagement,

611
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,280
from an audience perspective, you get to feel like you're part of the action as it's going on,

612
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,680
which I think a lot of kids will really enjoy because kids have no sense of self and they want

613
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:28,480
to attach themselves to a powerful figure in their eyes, et cetera, et cetera. But maybe stream

614
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,120
archives are fun and all, but you totally lose that sense. That's why maybe stream highlights

615
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:40,240
are the thing to go for. That's what German does. I don't want to say I found a solution,

616
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,080
but if you archive something on Twitch and you go back and you rewatch it,

617
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:52,240
it archives the chat as well. That feature is amazing. That's so good. Your archive is on

618
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,320
Twitch. The chat will go in real time with the replay. That is why, unfortunately, all my racist

619
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,640
slurs I post in the Twitch chats every day are forever more be seen by everyone watching.

620
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,480
I was going to be, I guess, the sole contrarian just be like, I hate live streaming. I hate doing

621
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,240
it a lot because I don't know. I feel really stressed out when I do it. I think the reason

622
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,760
is that I either live stream me doing artwork or I live stream playing video games. The reason

623
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:25,280
I do work is to get work done and I want to stay focused. When I'm sure, and I have to not be focused,

624
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,720
I got to keep tabs on the chat and stuff and make sure I'm not just because if I'm just sitting there

625
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:35,280
doing work, I must just do work. Why split my time? Well, I'm curious. I mean,

626
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,000
we've been talking about the idea of possibly streaming the PCP recordings. Haven't you been

627
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,520
kind of advocating for that? Is that a different situation? Yes, I think that is different. The

628
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,120
reason I hate streaming solo is because if I'm doing work, I want to stay focused. Dealing with

629
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,920
the chat is just like, I'm not good at multitasking. They'll be like, half an hour blocks me just

630
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,520
sitting there working and then I'll check the chat and I'm like, oh, hey. Half the people aren't

631
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,480
talking anymore because no one's paying attention. When I stream playing video games, I play video

632
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,920
games to relax. And so I can't relax because I have to like try and keep a persona up and be

633
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,920
entertaining. Yeah. So both scenarios suck. But streaming the PCP would be fine because I'm just

634
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,800
talking. And that's true. That's true. You know, like we'd all be able to keep tabs in the chat

635
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,200
if we had a chat going. So I wouldn't be my sole responsibility. Like there's been huge lulls in

636
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,040
the conversation for me. While you guys are going off about dark side folks, I don't know shit about

637
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,280
them. I could be in the chat just fucking bomb and shit out or whatever. So like, I feel like

638
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,240
that would make more sense just for my comfort in terms of like being able to do it. But when I

639
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,840
just stream solo, I hate it. Like I'm trying to get better because like, I think there is going

640
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,880
to be a big market for that. And I think a lot of people are into it. But I just, I'm not naturally

641
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:53,760
attuned to that medium at all. And this is uphill battle for me. I like, I genuinely like the fact

642
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,400
that I have a small stream audience that I get like maybe 20 viewers, like, like, you know,

643
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,360
after it goes on for a long time, like 10 people like that. You know, that statement,

644
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,960
Munchy is like the equivalent of that old line Ben used to say about how he loved

645
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,440
average looking girls. He liked, he like normal looking girls. You know, I don't want those tens.

646
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,600
I don't want those actually attractive girls. I just want to really say that.

647
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:23,440
King of five. That's not the same at all. Everybody knows what I'm talking about. Everybody

648
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,320
knows about like, you know, the like the blonde tan look is not for everybody. You know, the

649
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:33,440
classic 10 out of 10 is not for everybody. Ben likes attainable girls, everybody. That's not

650
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:40,880
even true. And if I said that one time, it was ironic. The reason I like it is because then I

651
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,440
can just play the game. And the chat is not always going, I don't have to always look at my phone and

652
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,840
you know, see the chat open and respond to it. It can be a slow, you know, drip of a fan interaction

653
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,640
so I can pace myself. I can respond to the game. It's like a let's play. But occasionally I can

654
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,360
have fan input. And this is the second thing I'm about to say here goes into my weird two-headed

655
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:10,400
double think about streaming is whenever I like put a joke in a Twitch chat and the streamer is

656
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,760
like, haha, like I see that like, like, like very funny, munchy, W tiny hats. I'm like, I've been

657
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,520
validated. My life is worth living. I can go to sleep a happy man. If I were to, if I were to die

658
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:27,840
today, I would die fulfilled a happy life. But then when I'm in a chat or I'm in a stream

659
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,960
archive, I'm just like watching. And then like, like, I see, I see the fucking face cam. I see

660
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,400
the streamer with his dopey fucking expression. Look and like lean forward at the monitor, like,

661
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:47,200
like looking and like reading chat. And I see him go, that's a funny one Excalibur 2007. I get

662
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:55,200
flying to find to an uncontrollable rage that this interaction in the place of my of my timeless

663
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,880
media is getting the place of my timeless content. And it's ruining the fucking experience. And I

664
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,840
and I fly off the handle and I cannot accept it as valid artistically. I fucking I hate it when

665
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:15,040
it's not happening to me. I definitely feel like there's a place for both like, let's plays as like

666
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:21,440
rewatchable things that aren't like in the moment stuff. And then also streams, I feel like you

667
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,600
can do you can be a streamer who also does let's plays. I don't know if anyone actually does that.

668
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:32,400
But like, I mean, the the Spoonie experiment let's plays, where he's just he does like

669
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:40,960
Fantasmagoria and this this Ripper game, they're like old Windows PC pointing click games with

670
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,040
like full motion video sequences. And he he riffs on the game. He's just he's playing it. And he's

671
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,240
occasionally he explains something to the audience. But most of the time he's just,

672
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,320
you know, doing like that guy with the glasses reactions to things. But he's not like on camera

673
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:59,920
or anything. It's just like a let's play show of, you know, him playing through the game and

674
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,920
reacting to things as they come. And you know, it's kind of like a hybrid of like, it recorded at

675
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:12,400
the time and also scripted stuff. And the scripted stuff, the aspect of that that's like scripted

676
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:18,080
and cutting out like really boring parts is what makes it so rewatchable. I think I've rewatched

677
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,480
him play Fantasmagoria to like eight times, and it's like a six hour let's play.

678
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:30,400
Like they're just like, they're so so rewatchable. So like, I try to rewatch Digi Bros. But because

679
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,040
because it's all about like stuff that's currently happening to Digi and Victor,

680
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:39,920
it's hard to like get into it again, because it's so long in the past. And it's not even that

681
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,200
particularly interesting. It's just sort of anywhere in an episode. You have to start from

682
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:52,240
the beginning of each series. Yeah. And it's like the things like the what Gamers Teven does and

683
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:58,560
what was the guy you recommended? Darkseid Phil? No, no. The one he recommended.

684
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,840
Retsu Prey? Yeah, Retsu Prey.

685
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,000
Was that your frame to Hippo? No, no, the the other one.

686
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Are you talking about who I recommended? Yeah.

687
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:14,160
Cormor Jolt. That's the one. I'm gonna I'm gonna look at him because like I feel like if if there

688
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,880
anything like yours, they're gonna look at this early early stuff. Yeah, they're gonna be like

689
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,080
things that you can just rewatch and put on at any time to just like, oh man, remember this,

690
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,080
like you I could come back like 10 years later and watch a Gamers Teven let's play because

691
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,880
they're just like funny things. They are basically timeless. They are basically timeless.

692
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,320
You just filed for your second mortgage and your wife has left you and you're stuck with two rotten

693
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,800
kids who don't respect you or love you in any way. You can look back on the old times and just

694
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:48,880
play a playlist of Gamers Teven videos while you put the fucking pistol in your mouth ready to meet

695
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:57,200
your fucking maker. Oh, looking a little cloudy outside, gets hit by a cloudy with a chance of

696
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:04,000
pain balls. Got him. Classic Gamers Teven quotes. You're fucking gray matters.

697
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,680
Well, hell guys, we've got quite a journey here. Maybe are we done here? Should we get to the

698
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:20,640
questions at this point? I'm feeling pretty pretty good. What about me? What about me and my legendary

699
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:28,080
let's play pieces such as nobody going to bring up the elephant in the room? Oh, of course,

700
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,800
the Nuzlocke's. You know, I wasn't thinking the most let's play in the room. I was thinking of

701
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,600
this like more like Nuzlocke's to me are like a subcategory of let's plays, I suppose, that are

702
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:43,760
just infinitely better in every way. Well, yeah, the Ben St. Nuzlocke's are of that sort of same

703
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,840
like rewatchable quality, although I have not gone and rewatch them. I probably should. I just,

704
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,320
since we're on the subject, I want to say about that whole thing that I was really going for,

705
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:03,280
I was really going to like take an extemporaneous improvised format like a let's play and turn

706
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:09,680
it into, not a scripted, but turn it into like a narrative experience. Of course not. You can't

707
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,960
discredit your own statements from earlier. It can't be scripted. Well, yeah, yeah, no, it was

708
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:22,880
totally unscripted. It was totally raw. Ben put like the basic plot points in order, like he's,

709
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,560
you know, a weird dictator murdering Pokemon and whatnot. Delete from the watch later right now.

710
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:35,120
That came up kind of off the cuff. Like I wasn't planning that when I started it.

711
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,240
Right. With your first one, that's true. That's true. More for the second one. Yeah,

712
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,840
like that was all kind of. And it was just like, oh, anything that comes up, anything that gets

713
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:47,600
brought up as like a joke will continue to be relevant and will become lore, you know, was the

714
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:53,360
goal there. And yeah, you're right. It's, I don't know if I would even really call it a let's play.

715
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,280
I mean, it is, but it's really its own animal. It's really just its own piece. You know, it's

716
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,600
something greater. It's something greater than anything. It's greater than let's play. It's

717
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:08,800
more artistic than your commonplace peasant let's play. The Ben St. let's play is truly, you know,

718
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,520
a breed its own. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would certainly recommend Ben's Nuzlocke's. If you

719
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,400
have the slightest interest in Pokemon or Nuzlocke's, I would say a genocide is better than

720
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:24,480
conquest. Um, oh yeah, which one do you like more? Uh, yeah, it's tough. I would probably have to go

721
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:31,840
with genocide. Um, but they both got their, they both got their, their charms. They've both got

722
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,280
bananas. Which is the one with bananas? Which is the one with bananas? That's genocide.

723
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,080
Then genocide's better. Yeah. Yeah. Bananas is a pretty legendary moment.

724
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,760
Also, which is the one with, uh, uh, the radicate, uh, whipstitch? That is all. Yeah,

725
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,680
that's also genocide. Yep. Genocide wins. Genocide wins. Whenever we bring him up, I have,

726
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:55,520
I have to mention how I famously ripped off whipstitch with a lowland radicate and named him

727
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,600
which whipstache and use Ben's own tactic against him. I have to bring that up every

728
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:05,520
sometimes. Did you beat Ben using that? Yeah, I did. I'm so proud of myself. I, I, that, that's

729
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,480
what I think about when I go to sleep. I, I, I, I sue the pain and all the, all the dead souls

730
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:16,320
looming in my ear by just thinking about how, how I pull that off expertly. Fantastic. Well done.

731
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:22,480
Congratulations. That, that did happen. It was canon. Uh, former vice president, Joe Biden did

732
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:28,400
do all of the things Munchy just described. Oh, that's right. That's right. I, I, I, I actually

733
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,960
want to extend this a little bit here. Nate, if that's all right. I've been brushed up upon

734
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,720
something that I would like to mention, uh, how the, I'd not, not, not, he did not actually mean

735
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:44,160
this. It was me, me saying this, but, uh, how some like, like the, the let's plays that are two

736
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,960
dudes talking and let's plays that are, you know, two or, you know, people talking about the game.

737
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,720
There's various types of let's plays of varying quality. And I would like to get to the hard

738
01:09:52,720 --> 01:10:01,040
matter here. Are let's plays like, like good, are, are, are they good? Does just playing a

739
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:08,480
game and coming to a constant being good content and you know, it's, it's a fuzzy area, but it's,

740
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:15,120
it's lofty and retarded. But I, I think like the two different types of let's plays, personality

741
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:21,840
or like a presentation or like a show, like an edited show. Uh, it just depends on a, like if

742
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,360
it's a personality thing that you don't do it too much, I guess. Well, actually, no, that's not

743
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:33,200
really a question. The question is, are they good in general? They can be good. Are they art? Are

744
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:39,200
they art? Are we using the super narrow definition of art? No, what I think it is, is that my, my

745
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:46,880
opinion is that let's plays playing a video game in and of itself is not art. Uh, there's nothing

746
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,160
artistic about it. And if you're making a let's play, just because you're like, I want to play

747
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,880
video games and get paid for that's the dream. You're going about it wrong. A let's play is a

748
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:00,000
foundation on what's, which to build art on top of playing the game has to facilitate some sort of

749
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,040
creativity or some sort of, well, you know, entertainment value, whether it's presentation

750
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:10,320
or personality, or it's a, it's a, it's a platform to showcase something beyond just playing the

751
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:15,520
game itself. I feel like this is sort of wrapped up in the fair use question where it's kind of

752
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:21,680
unclear whether or not, uh, like a let's play is a transformative work, legally speaking. Um,

753
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:29,360
but like, just as like, I think there's things that like long plays are probably the least, um,

754
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:35,040
aren't it, which is just showing especially when there's no commentary commentary. I love watching

755
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,680
long plays. So I have to actually play the game. Yeah, that's what they do. But, but there's other

756
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:46,480
things that don't really require a personality or like, um, an edited show, which is speedruns,

757
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:53,520
which is basically like, it's the same as a long play. It's just less long.

758
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:01,520
In a way, in a way that's true. Um, um, there's a lot going on in a, in a speedrun, but Ben, go

759
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:08,400
ahead. Speedruns are really great when it's a game that you know really well, you know, because

760
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:14,720
like these people are, they're showcasing their mastery of the game and really breaking the mechanics

761
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,200
to like optimize, you know, completion time and whatnot, which is in and of itself sort of,

762
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,200
you know, like changing the game. I mean, it's not actually changing. It's all within the

763
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:28,080
parameters, what the game allows, but it's, I think, I think it's a documentations. Things

764
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,640
like speedruns are like, like just a document. They're kind of like a technical manual of a

765
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,520
thing. I guess if somebody makes, if somebody makes a documentary about people's speedrunning,

766
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:42,240
then it's, uh, but before that it's just like, here's like footage of me trying my best.

767
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:47,920
Is a, here's a question. Is a comedy routine art that like a comedian does on stage, is that art,

768
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,440
or does it become art? If you film it, are either of those art?

769
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,840
Both are clearly inherently.

770
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,840
Both are. Okay. So we can all agree at the very least that what Gamer's Tavern does, for sure,

771
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,640
is art.

772
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,280
Absolutely.

773
01:12:59,280 --> 01:12:59,840
Oh, yes.

774
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,000
When I say art, I know that obviously.

775
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,720
Thank you very much.

776
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:10,160
It's a vague term, but what I mean is, does it hold the same like cultural, like culture per

777
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:16,320
turn output, or like societal, you know, pressure, like, like, like, you know, the Holy Titans,

778
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,480
like 3D anime, or like Super Hals?

779
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:24,320
Here's a good example, though. Like, uh, Egoraptor did, of course, his famous sequelitis on Mega Man X,

780
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,680
but then he also did a long solo Let's Play. I think he most, either completely or mostly finished

781
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:35,200
Mega Man X. Is one of those art, and the other isn't? If so, why? Because they basically do the

782
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:35,760
same thing.

783
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,160
Wait, so I've never seen the second video you're talking about.

784
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:46,400
It was a single Let's Play on Game Grumps where Dan was sick or away or something.

785
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,320
Was he just talking about the game?

786
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,200
Yeah.

787
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:54,240
He was playing it and talking about it. I mean, you've got to just ask the question,

788
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,560
is somebody talking art?

789
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,040
That's exactly what I was about to say. Are two people playing a game,

790
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,320
commenting on it, constitute art? Well, are six people talking about Let's Play's art?

791
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,120
Is this art right now?

792
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,240
Well, see, that's the thing. That's the thing.

793
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:08,720
No.

794
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,680
We have to completely put aside the question of quality.

795
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,160
Quality is completely irrelevant to whether or not it's art or not.

796
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:17,040
If quality is irrelevant, I would say that yes, it is art.

797
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah.

798
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,760
It's a sort of performance art.

799
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,120
Because, yeah, it's kind of performance. It's recorded.

800
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,960
It could be edited, you know.

801
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,840
I guess it depends on the presentation or the intention, I guess.

802
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,000
Because I wouldn't say if you go to college, you sit down in a big fucking auditorium

803
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,800
and someone presents you biology. I wouldn't call that presentation art.

804
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,240
But what if the man makes a single joke within the context of this lecture?

805
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,120
Then the joke is art.

806
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,800
But not the whole thing, just the joke.

807
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,120
I don't think so.

808
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,200
I just think that this whole idea, it's silly.

809
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,800
If it's a recorded product put somewhere for people, if it's made for an audience.

810
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:05,760
The definition of art is really unduable and at the end of the day, rather irrelevant.

811
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:13,920
It's all gray. It's an unspoken truth that we all have fuzzy artwork legitimacy hierarchies.

812
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,560
Oh, for sure.

813
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:23,280
Like subtlety, it'll change for each genre or medium, which we consider more art,

814
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,800
regardless of how retarded that is or how conceited that is.

815
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:35,120
Like how I famously set fire to the petrol black, oil doused wooden altar of porn and books.

816
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:42,080
Their artistic credibility ruined literature and porn forever and no one could view them

817
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,120
as anything that have our artistic quality to them.

818
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:49,360
But at the end of the day, all art is art and there's nothing but pretension and segregation,

819
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,400
but we all do it.

820
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,760
You're asking for an authority here and luckily for you, I have the authority right here.

821
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,520
It's name is UrbanDictionary.com and we've got the definition of art,

822
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,720
allowing me to provide it to you so we can settle this debate for all time.

823
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,080
Here we go, art.

824
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,880
Art is used as the shorter version of the common British greeting all right.

825
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,440
It means that you are okay with something and accept.

826
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,200
Jim wants to go to Walmart.

827
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,560
Quinn, hell yeah.

828
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,080
Jim, I'll pick you up in 10.

829
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,080
Quinn, art, the end.

830
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:18,800
That's it.

831
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,280
Wow.

832
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,160
If, Sue, we're going to have to saw you apart.

833
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,040
No, no, right.

834
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,160
That's wrong.

835
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,520
That's incorrect.

836
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,320
It's right.

837
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,960
We don't say the A bit.

838
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,280
We don't.

839
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,320
We just say right.

840
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,200
That's how we say all right over here.

841
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,160
Okay, fair enough.

842
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,360
So you can't make that.

843
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:41,040
Well, now we know how they say all right in the UK.

844
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,560
Exactly, that was what we really achieved our goal here.

845
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,240
I just want to say one thing.

846
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,760
If say Munchie was not any internet guy, I just, I saw him on the street and he was

847
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,560
saying a speech.

848
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,560
He was just talking funny and I was like, yeah, that's funny.

849
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,800
If I was just doing arm retrieval alone behind the fucking dominoes, yeah.

850
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,120
Walking down the streets doing an arm retrieval and I was like, huh, that's a funny talker.

851
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,880
I like that wordsmith right there.

852
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,800
Would that, would me watching him or listening to him just in person as a human being,

853
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,240
would that be considered art?

854
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:16,480
Yes.

855
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,680
I have something to say about this.

856
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,560
Okay, okay, okay.

857
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,240
Imagine you're in a quirky, comedic or otherwise interesting scenario,

858
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,080
like Kimbo just mentioned, waiting explicit.

859
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,440
Like it doesn't matter what you just, you know,

860
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,920
you're something in your life is unfolding and entertaining and provoking way.

861
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:40,880
And it's something that you would, you know, present to others, to the unwashed message.

862
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:48,400
First of all, is the experience of this scenario are inherent or, and secondly, what would be,

863
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,040
this is what I want to, what would be more artistic?

864
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:56,000
You telling your story to someone or you recording the scenario?

865
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:57,840
Let me break here.

866
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,640
Okay, here's definition two is the answer to this question.

867
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,560
I think this is actually a very good definition from Urban Dictionary on what art is.

868
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:10,000
Once when asked, or art, once when asked what Trans-Siberian Orchestra was about,

869
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,440
Paul O'Neill replied, it's about creating great art.

870
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,400
When asked to define what great art was, Paul said,

871
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,360
the purpose of art is to create an emotional response in the person that is exposed to that art.

872
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:26,080
And there are three categories of art, bad art, good art and great art.

873
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,760
Bad art will elicit no emotional response in the person that is exposed to it.

874
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,440
Good art will make you feel an emotion as you have felt before.

875
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,800
You say blah, blah, blah.

876
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,640
And great art will make you feel an emotion that you have never felt before, et cetera, et cetera,

877
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,200
that's the rest.

878
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,200
I think that's, I like his first statement before delineating between them.

879
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,880
If you feel an emotion, that's it.

880
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,160
You're, it's art.

881
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:52,320
And, and I mean this podcast and any and all Let's Plays by that definition are do qualify.

882
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:58,640
So, so, so if I, if I touch a burning stove and I go, ouch, does that mean that's art?

883
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,320
That experience was art.

884
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,600
The experience is art.

885
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:06,400
Your decision, your decision to touch the, the, the stove was.

886
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,000
There's always going to be arbitrary lines.

887
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,760
I don't know if, but yeah, like some gatekeeper.

888
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:18,320
The reason it's so like everybody always argues about what art is and like the parameters of

889
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,200
what you can define as art and like, oh, but what about this?

890
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,080
And then everyone's like, oh, fuck, what about.

891
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:31,920
And it's like, the reason is, is that art is, if it like applies in that way,

892
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,720
which I probably would agree with, it becomes mostly useless and you just have to use it

893
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,440
colloquially.

894
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,840
Like if you see a painting, people generally accept that a painting is art.

895
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,960
You see it on the wall and you're like, yeah, that's a good piece of art.

896
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,240
And even if something else would qualify, most people like, like somebody just talking on the

897
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,040
street really in a funny accent, you're like, whoa, that's cool.

898
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,080
I feel an emotion.

899
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,240
Nobody would say that's art.

900
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,080
They just say, I saw this real cool guy today and that's what they would say.

901
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,720
Give us right.

902
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,280
Give us right.

903
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,320
Ethnic minorities are art, for sure, for sure.

904
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,160
I would say that art needs to be created.

905
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,680
So, so this means in your scenario, if I had wrote a script for Armoryville and then was

906
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:18,080
reciting that script while banging trash cans and pushing over homeless people,

907
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,800
walking down the street, then that would be art.

908
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,120
But if it was, well, that would rule out improv, I guess.

909
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:25,600
I don't know.

910
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,920
It's never going to be something that anyone can define.

911
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:37,520
But except for what the wider consciousness of the world of people generally think of as art is

912
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,280
like media and things that are like things that we like.

913
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,480
Yeah, that's art.

914
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,920
Even if other things qualify, we'll just say, here's a cool thing.

915
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,160
It's here's a cool art.

916
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,440
I think I have it.

917
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,280
It has to be a creation for an audience.

918
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:58,080
So, so if I were to like touch a stove and get my hand burned, that would not be art.

919
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,960
But if I was like, hey, check out this.

920
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,000
Watch me touch the stove.

921
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:02,960
Yeah, exactly.

922
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:03,600
Watch me touch the stove.

923
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,480
And I was like, ow.

924
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,280
And then I did like a like a cartoonish like suck my my my dick afterward.

925
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,200
Get that nice and wet.

926
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,920
Okay, but what if, okay, here's a thought though.

927
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:19,360
What if like a lightning hits a beach one day and forms like this beautiful like circle of

928
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,640
glass somehow?

929
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,440
Okay, let's say maybe that's not even art right then and there.

930
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:23,520
Not art.

931
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,800
But what if a guy discovers this is like, wow, this is beautiful.

932
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,680
Comes by like puts a frame around it and starts selling tickets to come see this artwork,

933
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,200
this natural artwork.

934
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,160
At what point did it become art, if any?

935
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:36,880
It's not art.

936
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,560
It's a product at that point.

937
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,560
No, that is totally art in the same way that photography is art.

938
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,000
Because you can take a picture of something that naturally exists.

939
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,640
And it becomes art because you've curated it.

940
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:55,440
Because you've excluded, you've chosen what to include and exclude for show.

941
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,840
But he hasn't done that to just put a frame around something.

942
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,080
But that's what you did choose.

943
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,680
That framing is delineating what is and isn't part of the artwork.

944
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:11,440
You can say if they put the frame in a specific way to frame like that natural formation and

945
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:16,640
the background and you were only supposed to view it from this specific angle, then fine.

946
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,680
But if you're someone who's just like, hey, check out this thing on the beach.

947
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,840
Here's, give me $5 to look at it.

948
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,040
That wouldn't be art.

949
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,640
Well, he had to choose the frame.

950
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,760
This comes to what I was asking earlier, where what is more artistic?

951
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,920
Like telling the story of a scenario or recording the scenario?

952
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,720
Because recording is like the obvious like, oh, you have the video file.

953
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,080
There's a difference in scale.

954
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:42,880
I definitely think so.

955
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,520
I definitely think so.

956
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,200
I think that the story is more artistic.

957
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:49,440
Because you're using words in specific ways and telling because, you know, when you're

958
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,360
telling a story, it's not going to be completely factual.

959
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,480
You're going to make work.

960
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,480
You're going to use different words that will have a different meaning in everyone's

961
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,040
else's heads.

962
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,840
Like one word will be different for different people.

963
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,640
But if it's like a recording, it will just be like, you know, a recording.

964
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:07,520
All I know is that this week can go back and forth on what's artistic, what isn't all I want.

965
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,320
But this entire conversation is definitely autistic.

966
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,840
And I'm done with this.

967
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,520
Well, I was going to bring it back around.

968
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,760
The best way to solve this is art is whatever you want it to be.

969
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,640
Yeah, it really is.

970
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,760
That's pretty much what it comes down to.

971
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,640
And that's why Game of Seven is the best Let's Player of the World.

972
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,880
Is the European Union art?

973
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,480
Oh, definitely.

974
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,000
Because they had to curate it.

975
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,800
Because it was created for an audience and that audience is God.

976
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,800
Indeed.

977
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,720
All right, guys, I think we've hit the wall here.

978
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,240
I think we've done all we can do.

979
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,920
Please God end us.

980
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,640
We just have to let the audience sort out our science that we have witnessed before them.

981
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,400
Our patantic bullshit arguments that mean nothing.

982
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,880
But nevertheless, we care intensely about.

983
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,080
Of course.

984
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:50,800
Of course.

985
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,000
Well, that being said, everybody, I should have said this at the very beginning,

986
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,240
by the way, but I just want to make an announcement.

987
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:01,520
RadCon3 Arena is 100% funded and is 100% happening now.

988
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:08,640
The five members here, plus Digi, March 14th or so, it's entering the arena.

989
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,000
Hashtag enter the arena.

990
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,640
It's happening.

991
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,600
Get us the next stretch goal so we can get some fucking go pros and I can shoot the shit.

992
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,000
I can fucking strip Abraham Lincoln.

993
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,760
Nate, best guy ever.

994
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,440
You give me the money.

995
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,120
Wouldn't it be John Wilkes Booth?

996
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,480
Well, I guess not.

997
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,040
I guess they're both.

998
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,320
I guess you will be Abraham Lincoln.

999
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,680
You fucking bigoted fuck.

1000
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,280
Bear it up.

1001
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:29,840
Bear it up.

1002
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:36,400
Me and Nate can 1v1 best guy ever versus worst guy ever in the arena.

1003
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,840
It's ultimate battle.

1004
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,520
And remember, please, if there's a link in the description, of course,

1005
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,240
to the Kickstarter.

1006
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,600
If you would just want to give money, thanks.

1007
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,720
Well, we can always use that.

1008
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:51,280
Again, fund the stretch goal for the enter the arena, the RadCon3 Arena IRL,

1009
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,360
shooting each other with guns and go pros and whatnot.

1010
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,480
I really hope that happens.

1011
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,360
Real guns.

1012
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:55,520
Hopefully going to.

1013
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,440
We're buying Glocks for everyone.

1014
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:58,560
Indeed.

1015
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:58,720
It's going to be great.

1016
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:03,760
And then also, we're going to have to invest in double jump jet boots for everyone as well.

1017
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,080
That's going to be pretty pricey, but we'll see what we can do.

1018
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,040
We'll make it happen.

1019
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,040
I'll keep you guys posted on Twitter.

1020
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:13,840
I'll let you know when I locate the quad damage and the mega health inside the arena.

1021
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,160
I'll let you know as we can keep up.

1022
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,800
And also, feel free to keep giving money if you want to pledge the $50 thing for the,

1023
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,480
for the shirts, the $100 for the shout out during RadCon.

1024
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,920
And if you want to get that $1,000, if you want to be in the Royal Rumble,

1025
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,040
is there still time?

1026
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,760
There is still time, my friends, as well as, you know, $20 for the, for the pin and $10 at

1027
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,600
least for the behind the scenes content.

1028
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,520
That's something that people might want, you know, at any time behind the scene stuff.

1029
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,800
Wait, there is.

1030
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,400
I want to shout something out real quick, but I have to find it.

1031
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,320
There's a comment that I want to shout out on the Kickstarter or where?

1032
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,480
No, on a previous video.

1033
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:51,440
Okay.

1034
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:58,960
Well, while you look for that, Nate, would you like to show us the, the, the pity poor

1035
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,680
fuck peasant surf question from the Twitter?

1036
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,320
Indeed, I would.

1037
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,080
Actually, I want to give a shout out to the Twitter boys, because there was a couple of

1038
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,040
questions here that are actually pretty good that I'm, I'm fond of.

1039
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,480
So we might do more than one pity question.

1040
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,040
Oh my goodness.

1041
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,240
Oh my God.

1042
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:17,680
And again, that's on at TPCrasnators as our Twitter and using hashtag asked PCP when we

1043
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,120
record on these Saturdays.

1044
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,800
That's generally when we're going to see your question.

1045
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,000
So keep it as follow us so that you see the notification so you can send your questions

1046
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,880
in there.

1047
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,040
But here we go from this is, this is one of my favorite questions of all time at

1048
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:35,120
Newer Borno asks, why do bitches have time to hit the club every night, but don't have

1049
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,000
time to attend one parent teacher conference?

1050
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,600
Because they're too busy hitting the clubs because they didn't have any kids in the

1051
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,560
world.

1052
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,480
You should never be allowed ever seen.

1053
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,200
If there's any failure here, it's my delivery.

1054
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,440
That question is awesome and hilarious.

1055
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,080
And I want, I'm glad everyone saw it when you, when you, when you were like, finally,

1056
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,000
we were going to have a good question on this show.

1057
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,800
We found the one good question and we found the needle in the haystack of these shitty

1058
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,840
horrible questions.

1059
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,880
We finally got, we've started on a strong foot here.

1060
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,440
I have found the best question we've ever been asked.

1061
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:09,760
Yeah.

1062
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,480
Best guy ever.

1063
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:14,080
Reading from the sacred text that is the Twitter.

1064
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,280
I was prepared.

1065
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,920
I was pumped up, but you have shoveled me shit.

1066
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,120
And I will rue the day you were born.

1067
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:21,440
All right.

1068
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,320
All right.

1069
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,480
Here's one that's actually got substance to it.

1070
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:28,240
Again, from the, from the Twitter at LibRplex, I think.

1071
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,080
From LibRcock.

1072
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:30,640
Exactly.

1073
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:34,400
Aside from the things immediately relevant to your career, what other internet slash

1074
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,360
IRL communities are you part of?

1075
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,640
That's an interesting question, I think.

1076
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,200
Communities?

1077
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:41,440
Yeah.

1078
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:45,360
I mean, for example, just as one that I, I'm kind of part of is like the fit board on

1079
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:45,840
4chan.

1080
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,680
Like it's in no way really relevant to like any of my content or whatever.

1081
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:53,760
But I sure hang out with those guys and talk about stuff and we talk about fitness and

1082
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,560
whatnot.

1083
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,240
So that, that, that's one for me.

1084
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:56,960
That's one for me.

1085
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,520
Pretty cool, dude.

1086
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,240
It's pretty cool.

1087
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:04,800
My, my answer is kind of sad because my 2017.

1088
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,160
Our incels, our incels.

1089
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:06,880
Yeah, yeah, they had.

1090
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:07,200
Yeah.

1091
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:07,840
Yeah.

1092
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:15,040
2017 was the year of, of the shrinking circle for me where I, I went from, you

1093
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,680
know, not particularly a lot of communities, but over the course of my

1094
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:21,600
involvement with the PCP, my, my, my soul has been sucked and my life has been

1095
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,400
drained.

1096
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,480
And, and, and I've, I've found myself becoming a part of less and less communities.

1097
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,680
Obviously not part of the PCP.

1098
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:32,160
You know, I was not doing that, but I just know coincidence, uh, you know, time frame

1099
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:32,480
reference.

1100
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:37,120
As, as a man focuses on the things important to him in his life, he'll have less time to

1101
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,800
deal with the things that are less important.

1102
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,800
And you know, I think that's a natural consequence.

1103
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,080
So, so, you know, I used to frequent like, you know, like, like V and stuff, you know,

1104
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,440
not, not super in depth.

1105
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,000
I used to go in tumblers to, you know, do a whole bunch of stuff.

1106
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,880
But now, uh, you know, I used to be part of, you know, fandoms and shit, but that was,

1107
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,480
you know, that was, that was, that was way further, uh, wave now.

1108
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,200
Yeah.

1109
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:01,840
Uh, I used to be in a ton of stuff, but now I, I'm really only, you know, a part of

1110
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,680
this circle, which is, you know, you guys are nice and all, but you know.

1111
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,160
Look, nobody's forcing you to do shit, Munchie.

1112
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:08,640
No, I'm not.

1113
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,280
This is not a pity party.

1114
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,400
That's not what I'm saying.

1115
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,920
That's not what I'm saying at all.

1116
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,240
Okay.

1117
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,840
That's not even the point.

1118
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,640
You fucking bigoted fucking family.

1119
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,360
Okay.

1120
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:22,480
I'm, I'm, I'm just saying that, uh, I, uh, I, I'm not part of any communities and,

1121
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,200
and I will make that my goal for 2018 is that I need to be, I want to get back in

1122
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,880
the groove of going on different websites and, you know, uh, you know, hanging out with

1123
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,760
different people.

1124
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,720
I think that's, uh, that's,

1125
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:33,440
I do too.

1126
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,000
I do too.

1127
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,280
I feel like I'm, I'm not, I'm not as active around the internet as I used to be outside

1128
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,520
of the PCP and that kind of sucks.

1129
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,080
It's healthy.

1130
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:42,880
Yeah.

1131
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,480
You gotta have more, you know, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta live a life to have the

1132
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,200
right to reminisce.

1133
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,840
You got, you gotta know more people so you can kill more people.

1134
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,760
That's my, that's my golden rule.

1135
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,400
Exactly.

1136
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,440
I found the comment I was looking for, by the way.

1137
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,080
Oh, okay.

1138
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,440
It is on the, uh, the radcon three Kickstarter announcement.

1139
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,280
Um, it's, it's one of the top, it's one of the most liked comments on there.

1140
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:09,200
Um, and I want to encourage you do not like this comment because Russell posted, Russell

1141
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:15,680
the Gengar posted saying if his comment gets 111 likes, he'll enter the royal rumble and kill me.

1142
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,200
And, um.

1143
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:17,840
Oh no.

1144
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,480
Please.

1145
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,640
He's at, he's at 68 likes so far.

1146
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,000
So he's more than halfway there.

1147
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,600
And if that were to happen, I would shit my pants on the spot.

1148
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,400
We're close.

1149
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,440
We're fucking close.

1150
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,800
So what do you mean we?

1151
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,600
What do you mean we?

1152
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,480
Who's side are you on?

1153
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,600
Our guy Russell.

1154
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,960
I'm just saying guys, you have the fate to put Russell in the royal rumble, it seems.

1155
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:43,680
If you, if you, if you would so desire to see Ben vanquish by his ghostly minions.

1156
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:50,640
If anyone were to imagine how a ghastly would translate onto a humanoid WWE custom character.

1157
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,120
He's involved into a Gengar now, right?

1158
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:53,600
He's a Gengar.

1159
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,120
He did eventually evolve into a Gengar.

1160
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:55,680
Okay.

1161
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,800
He would get those, uh, get those likes up.

1162
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,880
Hashtag let Russell wrestle.

1163
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,520
It's going to be.

1164
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,520
Hashtag let Russell wrestle.

1165
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,040
Please everyone, it's time.

1166
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,320
It's time to make it happen.

1167
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,480
Mr. Tavern, what communities would you consider yourself a part of?

1168
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:14,560
I forgot.

1169
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,120
Was the question about online communities or?

1170
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,200
It actually said IRL or online.

1171
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:21,840
It's all open.

1172
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,400
It's all open.

1173
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,760
Well, as far as online goes, nothing really now.

1174
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:33,840
I used to post on a lot of forums in the early 2000s and used to frequent IRC chat rooms and stuff like that.

1175
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,200
And I used to have a forum on my own website as well.

1176
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:38,800
Mm-hmm.

1177
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:44,000
But, uh, now I'm not really part of, uh, many online communities.

1178
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,720
I'm just, uh, flying solo.

1179
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:48,560
Yeah.

1180
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,280
Yeah.

1181
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,320
It's like our hero, Jason Derulo.

1182
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:50,960
Same.

1183
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,920
Feels bad.

1184
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:52,640
It feels bad.

1185
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:58,640
The only, the only community that I'm involved in that has nothing to do with my work is the gay community.

1186
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:59,760
I'm the best.

1187
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,080
Well, I wouldn't say that, Tom.

1188
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,760
I see a lot of that projected into your work.

1189
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,880
So, you know, you know, you got, you got me there.

1190
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,320
You can't completely expunge all your influences.

1191
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,040
What can I say?

1192
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:17,760
Gamer, I was a huge forum rat, though not in the early 2000s because I was too young.

1193
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,640
But in like 2010, I was a huge, huge forum user.

1194
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:26,480
As, as I've, as I've talked about in my embarrassing role plays,

1195
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,000
I'm just a role play episode so I can explain, I can explain my various role play up at a

1196
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,640
grease because, because I have numerous.

1197
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:35,840
That's not a bad idea.

1198
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,640
It's not a bad idea.

1199
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,080
That could be a bonus episode.

1200
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:43,040
Press one, press one if you want to hear about munchy role plays because that is sick.

1201
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,360
The question was also about IRL communities.

1202
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,640
If you guys like do anything.

1203
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:52,640
Sorry to interject, but I am actually part of one forum right now.

1204
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,840
It's called Hardcore Gaming 101.

1205
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,360
Oh, shit.

1206
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,080
That sounds like a nice place.

1207
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,040
Sounds like my kind of place.

1208
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,240
Sounds like some place Dark Side Phil would hang out.

1209
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:06,080
It is basically just they do game reviews and they have a forum,

1210
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,160
you know, very similar to my website actually.

1211
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:09,840
Yeah, I'm looking at now.

1212
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,800
I started first.

1213
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,080
They started in 2004.

1214
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,520
I started in 2002.

1215
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:14,800
Yeah.

1216
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,440
Got them beat.

1217
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,000
Show those youngsters what for.

1218
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,800
Actually, we haven't said the name of your website.

1219
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,880
I think it's just a, is it gamers tavern.com?

1220
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,160
Yeah, that's it.

1221
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:25,840
Yep, gamertaverns.com.

1222
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,560
There you go, everybody.

1223
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,520
Read the reviews.

1224
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:32,640
The longest running, most fantastic website review site ever.

1225
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,240
Fuck gamespot.com.

1226
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,760
Fuck IGN.com.

1227
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,000
You want the fucking great shit?

1228
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,600
You go to gamers tavern.

1229
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,880
You know, you know that you're at gamers tavern.com.

1230
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,520
You're not getting any of that corruption that you get,

1231
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,200
that journalistic corruption you get.

1232
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,720
At some place like Kotaku.

1233
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:49,520
You know, we're freeable.

1234
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,640
You're a journalistic integrity.

1235
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,440
Yeah, exactly.

1236
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,400
Gamer tavern, the most ethical person known to man.

1237
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,360
Exactly.

1238
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:01,920
His scruples count is as high as the fucking hammer units.

1239
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,720
I pray when I do a dance.

1240
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,640
He may deny it with his dying breath,

1241
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,560
but I suspect that gamers tavern

1242
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,880
is both the alpha and omega of GamerGate.

1243
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,920
He is the source and the end of all of it.

1244
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,920
Well, I did write an article about it.

1245
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,720
What were your thoughts?

1246
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,360
What were your thoughts?

1247
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,720
I actually didn't know anything about it.

1248
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,360
That's the point of the article about it.

1249
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,560
That's the best place to be.

1250
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,080
Oh, see, plausible deniability.

1251
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,040
You wrote that as a cover.

1252
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:29,680
It's a joke.

1253
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,640
It's a joke article.

1254
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,400
Oh, okay.

1255
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,840
Fantastic.

1256
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,880
I did absolutely no research for that one.

1257
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,080
That's how you know there's no collusion.

1258
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,280
That's exactly how much you should do.

1259
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,120
Because he didn't even know what it was.

1260
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,000
He didn't even take a side.

1261
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,560
Dude, talk about journalistic integrity,

1262
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,040
not even willing to be corrupted by the facts of the case.

1263
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,360
That's exactly what he just said.

1264
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,960
Incredible, incredible.

1265
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:51,520
Exactly.

1266
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:52,720
Beautiful.

1267
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,760
Well, hey, I think there was one more question.

1268
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,840
I wonder, oh, okay, here's one final question

1269
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,320
from the Twitter from atreadordarrel.

1270
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,920
And this is incredible.

1271
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,600
It's, are you aware that in the same month as Radcon 3,

1272
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,120
the Muppet Baby's reboot will also be released?

1273
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,800
Both will feature six members,

1274
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,640
and both will have members absent

1275
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,320
from their previous installments.

1276
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,040
And here's the question.

1277
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,000
Oh, shit.

1278
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,800
Coincidence?

1279
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:18,960
I think not.

1280
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,160
I think we definitely are the Muppet Babies.

1281
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,160
What do you think, loyal viewer?

1282
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,960
We'll leave it up to your interpretation.

1283
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:25,360
Yeah.

1284
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,880
Which Muppet Baby are we?

1285
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,480
You're definitely animal,

1286
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,200
because you're an animal in the sack, as we all know.

1287
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,640
Wait, no, he's a baby.

1288
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,600
You can't say that.

1289
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,160
Oh, no.

1290
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,760
That has never stopped me before.

1291
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,840
That's why I can't make that lie now.

1292
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,240
Yes.

1293
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:43,920
It's true.

1294
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,880
Now that those fucking poor people questions are out of the way,

1295
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,880
those fucking, you know...

1296
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,960
If only the contents of their wallet

1297
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,880
match the contents of their brain.

1298
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:53,840
Indeed.

1299
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,880
Oh, and by the way,

1300
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,360
actually, we said Patreon.com slash The Procrastinators

1301
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,880
pledge as little as $1,

1302
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,400
and you're into our Patreon Lounge

1303
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,200
and then $5 more to get those sweet bonus episodes,

1304
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,240
which we just released.

1305
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,440
Just a reminder, everybody,

1306
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,680
GamerGate versus the 2016 United States presidential election,

1307
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:13,520
the most legendary of all bonus episodes.

1308
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,960
So this is from the Patreon Lounge,

1309
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,960
from XenoGrade.

1310
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,040
Do you think guides slash wikis

1311
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,040
ruin the experience of playing the game?

1312
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,240
Oh, what a question.

1313
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:25,680
Yeah, yeah.

1314
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:28,400
Well, okay, my response to that is,

1315
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,480
have you played Minecraft or Terraria

1316
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,160
without having the wiki handy?

1317
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:33,280
You will kill yourself.

1318
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,160
You know, Terraria is actually interesting.

1319
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,840
Yeah, yeah, maybe that's a guide.

1320
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,040
The guide is really nice.

1321
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,840
Well, that's true.

1322
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,920
I just want to say about Terraria,

1323
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:42,640
since you mentioned it.

1324
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,200
I played Terraria blind the first time I did,

1325
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,240
and I actually did get a strong sense of satisfaction

1326
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,080
in the very start when I played it.

1327
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,600
But when I started to look up,

1328
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,040
just kind of like the little tasks

1329
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,160
that I should be doing,

1330
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,520
I got a lot more focus,

1331
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,840
and it really made the experience more fun to do it that way.

1332
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,840
In my experience, the experience of playing Dwarf Fortress

1333
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,760
is mostly reading the wiki.

1334
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,000
That's like, is the texture of the game,

1335
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,320
is the wiki, because I don't know.

1336
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,640
Maybe it's possible to learn it without that,

1337
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,720
but if so, that's a better man than I.

1338
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,440
Do you feel like games that require looking at a wiki,

1339
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,680
do you feel like they're victims of bad design?

1340
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,280
Should that be necessary?

1341
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,120
I think times have changed a little bit.

1342
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,400
I feel like if it can be like an addition,

1343
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,080
like you play a game all the way through,

1344
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,680
and you're like, well, I didn't really understand

1345
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,680
some of these things, and then you look up the wiki.

1346
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:39,200
Like Dark Demon Blood, all those games have the lore.

1347
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,160
And the first time you play it,

1348
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,280
you're like, I don't know what happened,

1349
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,880
but I enjoyed myself.

1350
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,120
And then you go look at all the big old theories

1351
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,920
and stuff and the explanations of the lore,

1352
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,640
and you're like, oh, cool, now I care more.

1353
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:54,080
That can be good.

1354
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,840
Dark Souls is good enough on its face.

1355
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,320
The one thing that's maybe a little bit worthy of criticism

1356
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,480
is it's really hard to get your footing

1357
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,600
at the beginning of Dark Souls

1358
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,520
and figure out where Andrey is

1359
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,960
and how to upgrade weapons.

1360
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,360
Like that can take a lot of hours of gameplay

1361
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,320
before you understand that stuff.

1362
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,360
That's true.

1363
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,040
That's the one way I would criticize it.

1364
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,080
With the lore, though,

1365
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,840
that really is just stuff to explore

1366
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,280
once you're already into the game.

1367
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,520
So I wouldn't really criticize it on that front too much.

1368
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,200
But Ben, remember in the old days

1369
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,960
when we would go to Game Facts

1370
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,520
and print out sheets of how to do stuff

1371
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,720
and Secret of Mana and Mario RPG and stuff.

1372
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,080
Yeah, staple them together

1373
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,000
and keep them in the box that all our video games were.

1374
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,360
I remember that too.

1375
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,400
Those were the old days.

1376
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,040
But with the modern world being the way it is,

1377
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:39,200
I am much more forgiving of games sort of like Dark Souls,

1378
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,280
or right now I'm playing Stardew Valley.

1379
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,200
And that game, it's similar to your Dwarf Forges

1380
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,040
sort of, or like your Terraria's and whatnot.

1381
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,520
Yeah, I played some Stardew Valley.

1382
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,480
More like Terraria, yeah.

1383
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,920
But like in that game,

1384
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,520
there's a lot that you need to either

1385
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,280
just like patiently wait to figure out.

1386
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,400
But I'm way too like goal oriented to wait for that.

1387
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,680
So I'll like look things up on the wiki.

1388
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,280
But it's so easy just to Google

1389
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,640
and go exactly where I need to go.

1390
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,800
Like every game is its own wiki now

1391
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,920
with all the information.

1392
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,000
It's so easy to like find the question,

1393
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,680
the answers to the questions I want to know.

1394
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,600
So I'm way more forgiving now.

1395
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,680
And I wouldn't really call it necessarily

1396
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,840
like a bad game design with something like that.

1397
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,400
Because I don't want to read a page after page

1398
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,800
of tutorial in a game.

1399
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,640
When I can just super easily Google,

1400
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,400
Stardew Valley wiki,

1401
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,080
how to grow a certain type of fruit

1402
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,160
that I need for like the community center or whatever.

1403
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,840
I would much rather just do things

1404
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,320
at my own pace outside the game and then jump in.

1405
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:37,120
Well, Stardew Valley doesn't have any like time restrictions.

1406
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,760
Like a harvest moon.

1407
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,400
Not really.

1408
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,400
Harvest moon, you had to do everything

1409
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,200
in a very tight timeframe.

1410
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,160
And to play that game and get a good ending,

1411
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,240
you really like needed guidance.

1412
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,480
But I feel like Stardew Valley is designed differently.

1413
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,160
Whereas it doesn't really matter

1414
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,920
whether you're playing optimally or not.

1415
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,440
I mean, the worst case scenario

1416
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,880
is that like you miss a window

1417
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,120
and you have to wait a whole year to like do it again.

1418
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,040
Like, and that's gonna be frustrating.

1419
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,440
But you will always I think have more time

1420
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,440
to do more as it keeps going.

1421
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,200
I don't think there's any kind of hard end

1422
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:09,840
to the gameplay.

1423
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:10,720
Though I'm only, you know,

1424
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,400
I'm not even through my first year of the game.

1425
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,520
So I'm not really sure.

1426
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,280
But I do want to make a distinction now.

1427
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:15,920
Oh, go ahead.

1428
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,160
There is a hard end and the first harvest moon

1429
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,120
for the Super Nintendo.

1430
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:19,680
Okay.

1431
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,480
Oh, there is one.

1432
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,640
There is one in like 97 or 98.

1433
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:25,920
I'm only familiar with the one for the N64,

1434
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,120
which does, I mean, it's got,

1435
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,960
it doesn't have a hard ending,

1436
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,160
but it's got like a point

1437
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,560
where like you need to have completed everything by.

1438
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,000
And then, and that's like sort of the ending.

1439
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,240
Here's what I want to make a distinction about.

1440
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,040
Like if a game, a game should be like,

1441
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,040
I don't know, I'm right now,

1442
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,280
I just got like the new like Dragon Ball Z,

1443
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,880
Dragon Ball Fighter Z game.

1444
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,440
And like I don't really like fighting games

1445
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,400
in the way I have to like,

1446
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,040
in a super like non-natural,

1447
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,400
kind of annoying way,

1448
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,160
I have to like study to learn

1449
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,640
how to do the basic mechanics of the fighting.

1450
01:40:58,640 --> 01:40:59,760
Because there's like a lot of,

1451
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,680
like that is just not fun for me.

1452
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:02,640
But if a game,

1453
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,800
like like a Metroidvania on the other hand,

1454
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,480
like builds the game in such a way

1455
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,080
that it forces you to like learn

1456
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,920
every mechanic as you go.

1457
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,000
And so it kind of naturally develop

1458
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,760
the skills you need to do the techniques

1459
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,960
as you play through it.

1460
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,960
And like it becomes a real integral part

1461
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,200
of the experience that you can't just skip over.

1462
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,160
Now that,

1463
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,280
and then so by the,

1464
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,640
when you started playing at the beginning of the game

1465
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,520
versus at the end,

1466
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,840
you have just naturally developed all these skills

1467
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,840
as part of the progression of the game.

1468
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,680
Now that is something I really enjoy.

1469
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,520
That's my favorite way to do stuff like that.

1470
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,640
I think when it,

1471
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,280
Yeah, me too.

1472
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,400
I think when it comes to guides and stuff,

1473
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,040
if you can just pick up a game

1474
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,320
and turn it on and play it,

1475
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,520
and like get the gist of

1476
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,360
how the game is supposed to be played

1477
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,840
enough that you can start to get into it,

1478
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,960
then I think it's fine.

1479
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,280
I think,

1480
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,400
I think when a game doesn't make sense

1481
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,040
or isn't fun unless you use a guide,

1482
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,080
that's,

1483
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,800
that's the point at which a guide is like,

1484
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,160
the game is just badly designed.

1485
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:03,120
The most important part,

1486
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,360
I think of any game is that initial curve

1487
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,440
to get you like hooked on the game.

1488
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,280
Like that is like the most critical moment

1489
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,680
and Dark Souls has a pretty steep one

1490
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,040
just as one example.

1491
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,000
And something like,

1492
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,520
like a Metroid, for example,

1493
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,400
I think is like way lower,

1494
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,160
which is why it's like easier to ease your way

1495
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,480
like into a Metroid than like a Dark Souls or something.

1496
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,000
Hippo, there are certain games now

1497
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,640
where like,

1498
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,160
like with Minecraft tutorial

1499
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,120
where I just mentioned,

1500
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,400
there's like,

1501
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,120
there's like sometimes like built in guides.

1502
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:31,600
Like like, you know,

1503
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,000
we've tried,

1504
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,600
there's the guy where you can go to the materials

1505
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,000
and you can,

1506
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,480
you know,

1507
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,360
see how do I make this?

1508
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,160
He'll tell you Minecraft,

1509
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:37,760
there's like a whole like recipe book now.

1510
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,000
But with one game particular,

1511
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:40,640
Civ,

1512
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,600
civilization,

1513
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,560
which I've been playing a lot now

1514
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,440
as you can probably tell

1515
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,320
the viewers can tell by my dialect nowadays.

1516
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,360
But with the,

1517
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:47,920
with the,

1518
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,960
there is a

1519
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,720
actual like Wikipedia

1520
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,480
inside the game called the Civlopedia

1521
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,200
where you can just like,

1522
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:53,840
press like escape,

1523
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:54,640
like go to the menu,

1524
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,440
then you can just like open that.

1525
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,200
And there's like a fully functioning,

1526
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,800
like Wiki for Civ

1527
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,480
that explain like the details,

1528
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,800
the hard stats and percentages,

1529
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,440
all that stuff is inside of the game.

1530
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,080
So like,

1531
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,400
is that part of the game now?

1532
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,160
Because it is like legal,

1533
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,120
like like right from the start,

1534
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,120
it's telling you to search things up on there.

1535
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:13,440
And it's like,

1536
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:13,840
you know,

1537
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,800
it's encouraged to do that.

1538
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,160
Is that part of the game now?

1539
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:16,960
I think,

1540
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,000
I think it's,

1541
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,560
it's kind of the same as like,

1542
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:20,720
well,

1543
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,680
I don't know about Civ

1544
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:22,400
because I haven't played it,

1545
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,040
but like,

1546
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,320
things like Final Fantasy 13

1547
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,000
is like notorious for,

1548
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,240
if you don't read the data logs

1549
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,160
of information on the things,

1550
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,360
nothing in the story

1551
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,720
will make sense at all.

1552
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:35,200
Basically.

1553
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:35,920
Which is,

1554
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:36,800
Yeah, I remember that.

1555
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:37,360
And it's like,

1556
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,880
reading things is boring in a game,

1557
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:41,680
most of the time,

1558
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,120
unless you're already invested

1559
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,320
and you want to know more,

1560
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,280
if you have to read

1561
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,360
like loads of data logs,

1562
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:48,880
it's just sort of annoying.

1563
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,880
So I don't know how it is in Civ.

1564
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,080
I assume it's fine.

1565
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:52,320
Yeah,

1566
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:53,840
it's,

1567
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,000
yeah,

1568
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,320
yeah,

1569
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,000
you don't need to do it ever.

1570
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:56,880
But it's just like,

1571
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:57,120
you know,

1572
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:57,520
like,

1573
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,640
it's nice because you can just like,

1574
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,120
press like,

1575
01:43:59,120 --> 01:43:59,440
oh, like,

1576
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,080
oh, what is,

1577
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,600
what's this guy unique ability again?

1578
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:01,920
Just like,

1579
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:02,160
you know,

1580
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:02,800
press escape,

1581
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:02,960
like,

1582
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,680
look it up.

1583
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,200
But it feels like,

1584
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,480
it feels almost like it's,

1585
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,960
whatever I do play a game,

1586
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,600
and I'm like,

1587
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,480
I don't want to figure out

1588
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:10,800
how to do this.

1589
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,840
Just show me the,

1590
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,160
you know,

1591
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,440
just wiki,

1592
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,560
wiki please.

1593
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,680
I always feel like I'm

1594
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,800
snidely whiplash,

1595
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,640
like I'm a cartoon villain

1596
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,480
on the run from the fucking FBI,

1597
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,520
and they're going to track me down

1598
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,280
and shoot me right where I stand.

1599
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,080
But with Civ,

1600
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:24,800
the Civlopedia,

1601
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:25,360
it just feels like

1602
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,960
this is just part of the game.

1603
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,400
This is just what you're supposed to do.

1604
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,840
They are giving me this option.

1605
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,160
And it feels way different.

1606
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,080
It feels like I'm not a criminal

1607
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,200
on the run pedophile.

1608
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,120
It feels like I'm not Dan Snyder.

1609
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:37,840
Yeah.

1610
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,120
One of my favorite memories growing up though,

1611
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:44,560
this is where I didn't feel like snidely whiplash,

1612
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,320
and I felt like a fucking god,

1613
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,840
is when me and my friend were playing

1614
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,760
Pokemon XD Galvanarctis.

1615
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:50,240
Incredible.

1616
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,520
Love that game.

1617
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,160
Fucking great.

1618
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:53,840
We were playing that.

1619
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,880
And we, you know,

1620
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,000
we just like Google search,

1621
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,440
like Pokemon XD Galvanarctis,

1622
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,360
like tips and tricks.

1623
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,400
And then we found this like

1624
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,200
really, really shitty game facts guide,

1625
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:03,680
which like,

1626
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,520
was like incomplete,

1627
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,960
I guess it just showed you

1628
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,640
what like shadow Pokemon

1629
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:09,360
were in each area,

1630
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,280
but not like who had them.

1631
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,240
And like, you know, who,

1632
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,440
yeah, you know,

1633
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,120
and that gave me specific people

1634
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:15,920
who had specific Pokemon.

1635
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:16,720
You had to fight those people

1636
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,840
to get those Pokemon.

1637
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,960
So we just knew that they were

1638
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,560
somewhere in the level.

1639
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,080
So whenever we were at a new level,

1640
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,440
I would like check the fucking,

1641
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,080
you know, guys,

1642
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,360
you see like which Pokemon are where.

1643
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:25,920
And I'd be like,

1644
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:26,720
dude, you're not gonna believe this.

1645
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,320
There's a fucking Ampros at this level.

1646
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,360
And you would just be like,

1647
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:29,920
what?

1648
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:30,800
And then we would search,

1649
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,080
we would battle every single

1650
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,200
conceivable person.

1651
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,720
We found that fucking Ampros.

1652
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,520
And then the moment someone

1653
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,240
threw out their Ampros,

1654
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,120
and then that animation player

1655
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,800
where the guy like unloads glasses

1656
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,400
and he fucking like zooms in,

1657
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,320
like, you know, like tactical lens,

1658
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,360
we would fucking scream

1659
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,400
at the top of our lungs.

1660
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,080
We finally found the fucking Ampros

1661
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:48,800
that we needed.

1662
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,440
And we throw,

1663
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,280
we throw as many balls as we could.

1664
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,240
And it was the greatest experience

1665
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:52,560
of my life.

1666
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,360
And I loved it.

1667
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:54,640
So that's,

1668
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:55,840
it's a time that guides,

1669
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:58,000
guides hide in the experience tin fold.

1670
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,120
Well, excellent.

1671
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:01,920
All right.

1672
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,360
There's another question wrapped.

1673
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,360
Hey, but before we read,

1674
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,800
like another one or two questions,

1675
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,240
there was one thing that I forgot

1676
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,920
that we did want to address here.

1677
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:10,480
So, okay,

1678
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,920
slightly serious topic, everybody,

1679
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:12,400
but just want to,

1680
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,600
I'm sure you don't want to do this

1681
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:14,160
at the end,

1682
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,800
just in the middle of questions.

1683
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,560
Well, I suppose if you want to,

1684
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,640
I mean, do we have other questions lined up?

1685
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,640
There's only one more that I would like to do.

1686
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:23,040
Okay.

1687
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:23,760
Okay, go for it.

1688
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,640
It's from Mozilla Finneken.

1689
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:29,600
Which games have you played 100% completion?

1690
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,760
Is getting 100% a gratifying experience

1691
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,600
or a complete waste of time?

1692
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,760
And where is the line stand in between those two?

1693
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,000
I am a 100% guy.

1694
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,120
That's like what I do.

1695
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:41,920
I'm the kind of guy where if I like a game,

1696
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,120
I will do it to 100%.

1697
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:43,680
Famously, I think that-

1698
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:45,440
Well, you know,

1699
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,480
I was kind of of that opinion

1700
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,080
until actually fairly recently.

1701
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,000
Two games have made me really rethink

1702
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,280
this whole 100% thing.

1703
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,600
And I think that it really just depends on the game.

1704
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,200
And those games are Breath of the Wild,

1705
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,200
also Metal Gear Solid 5,

1706
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,880
and then also Mario Odyssey.

1707
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,160
Oh, God, Metal Gear.

1708
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,880
Those games, all three of those,

1709
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,480
are a total weight.

1710
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,240
You know, also actually Kingdom Hearts 2,

1711
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,840
like my favorite game of all time,

1712
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:10,240
is 100% not worth completing

1713
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,440
because you've got to do all that

1714
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,600
gummy ship stuff that sucks dick

1715
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,960
and is not fun and is not cool or interesting.

1716
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,280
If I don't 100% a game,

1717
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,280
I feel like I haven't really beaten it.

1718
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,680
Well, no, I feel exactly the same way.

1719
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:26,400
No, there are some games that just-

1720
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,440
Can you imagine 100% in Metal Gear Solid 5

1721
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,920
taking photos of every single thing of wildlife?

1722
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,400
Bunny Hop's video is legendary on that front,

1723
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,160
and it looks terrible.

1724
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,960
You have not done all the game has to offer.

1725
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,200
Okay, but literally not all of the game

1726
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:43,200
is that fun or worth your time to do.

1727
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:47,520
I think it comes down to games that are built

1728
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,440
to have a certain amount of content

1729
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:54,160
and that games that are built to end satisfyingly at 70%

1730
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:57,440
and then 30% of it is just monotonous boring stuff

1731
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,440
padded out in usually an open world game

1732
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:02,800
where you just have to go around and over an entire cycle.

1733
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,480
That's how I felt about Reciteer,

1734
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,080
like after the main story,

1735
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,360
and even a little bit before,

1736
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,560
like toward the end of the main story and definitely past it,

1737
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:13,760
because there's bonus content,

1738
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,680
like there's extra characters to unlock,

1739
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:16,880
but it was like, oh my god,

1740
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,160
you have to do these fucking dungeons like a thousand times.

1741
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:23,600
The grind, I'm just not up for grinding that.

1742
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,840
I'm totally up for 100% a game

1743
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,480
where like all 100% of the content is engaging.

1744
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,440
Like I did 100% of Fallout 3

1745
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,000
because all the content that I found very entertaining,

1746
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,160
it was interesting, there's lots of quests and I got the DLC

1747
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:39,760
and it was like fun, but Metal Gear Solid 5,

1748
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,520
I could never 100% that game.

1749
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,360
And even like when like the main campaign

1750
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,440
starts getting really grindy, I get pissed off

1751
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,200
because I'm playing Metroid Prime 2

1752
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,960
and I'm at the point where like you have to go back

1753
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,640
to all the places you've been before

1754
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,640
and just scan all these corpses

1755
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:54,800
and like they reveal like a secret part of an item

1756
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:57,200
you need to like unlock the final part of the game.

1757
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,040
And like the most annoying part

1758
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,040
is I've already scanned all these corpses

1759
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,280
because I'm like obsessively like scanning

1760
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,560
and trying to like read all the lore.

1761
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,040
So I have to, I already know like where they are,

1762
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,480
but like I don't know where they are.

1763
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,080
So I have to go all the way back

1764
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,840
and find all these things all over again

1765
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,840
that I've technically already done.

1766
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:14,880
It's infuriating.

1767
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,640
To me, okay, we had a,

1768
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,640
like what is the actual question we're asking

1769
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:19,520
because I feel we're coming at it

1770
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,040
from slightly different perspectives.

1771
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,560
Like guys like Munchie and Gibb,

1772
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,320
or I don't know, whoever was saying it,

1773
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,280
I know Munchie was.

1774
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,520
Like if you sold your through

1775
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,160
and in fact 100% complete a game,

1776
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,400
have you absorbed more of its content?

1777
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,840
Are you like more of a master

1778
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,280
of all the content that someone has?

1779
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:36,320
I've got a perfect metaphor.

1780
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,560
I've got a, I've got a perfect metaphor for this.

1781
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:38,960
Yeah.

1782
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,360
It's like a big old plate of food.

1783
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:41,600
Yeah.

1784
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,920
You know, you can eat the entire plate of food

1785
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,600
even if, you know, you get full at like 80%.

1786
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,360
And you can, it feels good to like, you know,

1787
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,280
eat all the food and then it's a clean plate.

1788
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,920
And you're like, yes, I ate the meal because it's there.

1789
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:00,320
But a lot of the time it's better to stop when you're full

1790
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,320
because it'll be better for you in the long run.

1791
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,000
You will just feel more satisfied afterwards.

1792
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,200
You won't feel bloated.

1793
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,200
You won't feel like a tired.

1794
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:08,880
It will just be good.

1795
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,960
It's a good metaphor because you can always come back

1796
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,160
and have more food later.

1797
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:14,640
You can always go back and finish the game later

1798
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,440
if you feel like it.

1799
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,240
But I won't because fuck that.

1800
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,720
Playing a game, okay, to go with this food analogy,

1801
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:24,000
playing a game is like eating ice cream to me in a cone

1802
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,800
where they're like, the main game will be the ice cream.

1803
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,680
But then the after game to get one is the cone.

1804
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,200
And the cone is delicious.

1805
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,320
So of course I'll eat it.

1806
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,520
No, it's like, it's like,

1807
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,120
have you really eaten the ice cream?

1808
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:36,720
Like you can't just throw the cone away.

1809
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:37,760
Like you can't just throw the,

1810
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,240
you can't throw the crust of your pizza away.

1811
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:43,440
Like you got in guys are thinking way too simplistically about this.

1812
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,240
The objectively correct answer is it depends.

1813
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:47,440
Okay. I mean, it depends.

1814
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,040
It depends on what question we're asking.

1815
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:50,240
Yeah, go ahead.

1816
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,560
I guess there were some games where I wouldn't feel like that,

1817
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,840
but in general, if a game is like a story game

1818
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,040
and has like a campaign.

1819
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:59,120
Okay, let gamers.

1820
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,080
Yeah, please.

1821
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,720
Personally, for me, I feel like I used to like,

1822
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:10,880
I used to enjoy 100% in games back in the 80s and 90s.

1823
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,160
But the newer games, they got way too big

1824
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,600
and they take way too long.

1825
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,280
And a lot of the extra content isn't fun.

1826
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:19,520
Right.

1827
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,040
In my opinion.

1828
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:21,680
See.

1829
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:25,440
So, for example, like in Chrono Trigger.

1830
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,840
Ah, yes.

1831
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,000
When you get near the end of the game,

1832
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,920
there's a bunch of side quests that open up.

1833
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:33,440
They're optional and you can do them and they're all really fun.

1834
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,960
They all give you really good rewards.

1835
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,680
They all have a lot of good character development

1836
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,880
and they add to the story.

1837
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,480
And the attention that is given to these side quests

1838
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:45,120
is almost the same attention they give to the main game.

1839
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:50,000
You know, as if the same budget and the same treatment

1840
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,280
was given to the side quests.

1841
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:56,640
But in a lot of modern games, it's obvious the main quest

1842
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:01,280
is given a much greater budget, much greater priority

1843
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,560
because that's what everyone plays.

1844
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,480
And then the side stuff, they figured,

1845
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:06,640
well, nobody plays the side stuff except, you know,

1846
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,920
a couple of people.

1847
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,840
So they just, you know, put something together

1848
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,960
that's usually really repetitive and tedious

1849
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,120
and just to artificially inflate the play time.

1850
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:23,520
So that's why I almost never 100% games anymore,

1851
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,360
even though I used to 100% everything.

1852
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:26,880
That's a great example.

1853
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,320
That's a great example.

1854
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,160
It definitely depends on the game,

1855
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,520
but I'm just saying that, like,

1856
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,240
one thing it means you have conquered that game.

1857
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,760
There is no bones about it.

1858
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,280
You have obliterated completely.

1859
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:38,880
Well, look, I will never accept.

1860
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,480
I will never accept that I have not conquered Kingdom Hearts 2

1861
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,720
because the Gummy Ship missions are fucking terrible

1862
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,240
and I'm not going to waste my time doing them.

1863
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:49,360
Here's the thing about it all of them.

1864
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,040
I know that they're not good.

1865
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,280
I know the facts that they are not good

1866
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,240
and they are a waste of my time.

1867
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,240
It does not matter if it's good or not.

1868
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:58,400
They're not even sort of relevant

1869
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,640
to the actual game experience that I care about.

1870
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:01,760
Not even kind of.

1871
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,320
The question, the feeling Munchie is getting

1872
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,680
is just the numbers thing.

1873
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:08,240
It's like seeing 100% is very satisfying.

1874
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:08,960
Exactly.

1875
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:14,960
And I would agree, but I would also say that I get more,

1876
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:20,240
like, I guess I'm just able to go away from a game

1877
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,560
that where the number is not 100%

1878
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,240
just because I've had a lot of experiences

1879
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:28,560
where going for the 100% is boring

1880
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,680
and overall is just like bad.

1881
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,360
It's just worse than trying.

1882
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,520
I know, we're kind of making different sort

1883
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:36,880
of emotional arguments here.

1884
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,640
Like, for example, I'm very busy

1885
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:43,280
so I really don't have time to make 100% game play

1886
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,160
on like, you know, fucking Metal Gear Solid 5 or whatever.

1887
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:48,320
So like, I have a reason to want to,

1888
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,400
I want to like justify my gamer cred

1889
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,960
by saying like, no, I've effectively done everything

1890
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,000
even though I have not.

1891
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,200
I mean, that game, I think it was kind of close.

1892
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,640
I'm not saying it's a moral necessity.

1893
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,360
I'm just saying like, objectively,

1894
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:02,720
there is code on that disk you have not unlocked.

1895
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:05,200
I mean, there's always, okay, well, if you mean,

1896
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:05,760
that's your metric.

1897
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,760
There's literally going to be like developer code

1898
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,160
that you have not experienced no matter what you do.

1899
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,280
But you know what I mean.

1900
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,840
I understand where Munchie is coming from

1901
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,800
because I used to have that kind of like OCD.

1902
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,160
I got it 100% out.

1903
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:18,800
Yeah, it is, it is.

1904
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,000
It sucks, you know.

1905
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:20,800
Yeah, exactly.

1906
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:23,920
And I was trying to do that a lot during the PS2 era

1907
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,480
when games started to get a lot of padding.

1908
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:31,120
And I was constantly at war with myself.

1909
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:33,600
I was like, I really want 100% this game,

1910
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,400
but I hate playing it, you know.

1911
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,720
I feel, yeah, yeah, I am.

1912
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,320
It's such a conundrum.

1913
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,080
So that's how I got with Reciteer.

1914
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,680
And eventually it beat me.

1915
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:44,240
Yeah.

1916
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:48,560
I played Final Fantasy VII for a GRPGA video that I did.

1917
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,320
And I got to the end of the game,

1918
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,200
and I beat Sephiroth and the final boss and all that stuff.

1919
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:56,560
I stopped the meteor.

1920
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,760
And then there was like post-game content

1921
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,320
where you could go fight the big under,

1922
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:03,280
like the, what were they called?

1923
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,720
Ruby and Emerald Weapons and stuff.

1924
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:05,360
The weapons.

1925
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:05,920
Yeah, the weapons.

1926
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:06,640
Yeah, of course.

1927
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,440
And I was like, I tried fighting Emerald Weapon

1928
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,240
and it was too hard.

1929
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:12,640
And I was like, well, it looks like I have to grind.

1930
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,680
Well, I beat the game.

1931
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:14,240
I'm done.

1932
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:18,560
And I didn't feel the need to complete it beyond what I did.

1933
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,920
And I know a lot of people like,

1934
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,240
what?

1935
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,080
How could you not do all that?

1936
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,760
And it's like the same with Kingdom Hearts I.

1937
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:27,120
I never tried doing like the,

1938
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:30,240
I'd never tried getting to Sephiroth to fight him

1939
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,360
in Kingdom Hearts I.

1940
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:31,920
Sorry, it's all right.

1941
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,120
One because I heard,

1942
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:34,880
one because I heard that it was like really tough.

1943
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,440
And I was like, well, I beat the game.

1944
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,000
I'm done.

1945
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,600
I'm good with that.

1946
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,960
I feel like it's more satisfying to me.

1947
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,440
And I don't feel like it invalidates

1948
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,440
my completing of the game or like,

1949
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,600
oh, well, you didn't play exactly everything.

1950
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:51,520
Therefore, your opinion isn't valid

1951
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:52,720
because I played enough of it.

1952
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:55,120
I played at least the whole game.

1953
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:56,400
I played to the last boss.

1954
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,080
I feel like that's enough.

1955
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,400
Yeah.

1956
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,240
I mean, that's kind of what I think.

1957
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:05,600
The way to look at it is if you enjoy doing the side stuff

1958
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:09,120
and you enjoy 100%, 100%ing it, then you should do it.

1959
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:11,520
But if you don't enjoy it, then just don't do it.

1960
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:13,520
This is kind of where I'm coming from with this.

1961
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,080
I feel like my emotional response here

1962
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,640
is that it's like Munchy is making an argument

1963
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:21,840
that someone who has like mastered the gummy ship

1964
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:24,400
in addition to like all the base gameplay

1965
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,840
of like Kingdom Hearts 2, for example,

1966
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,920
would have like moral, more authority over Kingdom Hearts.

1967
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,320
I literally have just said that is not a moral necessity.

1968
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,200
Oh, I will.

1969
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,880
I think I get it.

1970
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:41,680
I think it's like Munchy was saying in the back of your head

1971
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:44,560
you know that you haven't experienced a game entirely.

1972
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:47,200
But the way I see it is that there are so many games

1973
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,640
that I haven't gotten around to

1974
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:50,160
and I feel like I should sometimes.

1975
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:53,680
But I've just sort of, it's the same sort of feeling

1976
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,840
like I can let that go.

1977
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,920
Like maybe I'll never get around to that game.

1978
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:59,520
Maybe I'll never get around to that movie.

1979
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,760
I don't need to experience them all

1980
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,800
and I don't need to experience everything to 100% completion

1981
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,600
as long as I get the gist and I can talk about it with people.

1982
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:13,120
To me, I just feel like it's futile, you know.

1983
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:13,920
Sometimes, yeah.

1984
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:14,640
Futile.

1985
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,160
There's just some games that it's almost impossible

1986
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:20,880
to 100% unless you give up your entire life

1987
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,160
and just play it.

1988
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,360
I mean, here's a question.

1989
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,160
Here's a question.

1990
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:25,840
What about a game like Disgaea

1991
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,400
where there is literally infinite content?

1992
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:29,600
Like at what point have you 100%?

1993
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,040
That's basically what I'm talking about.

1994
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:31,920
Yeah, well.

1995
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,440
I tried to 100% that back in the day.

1996
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:34,640
Oh, yeah, it can't be done.

1997
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:35,680
Can't be done.

1998
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:39,520
What I'm saying is just look at what I'm saying.

1999
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:44,240
It's not like controversial or like I'm not saying

2000
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:47,360
that it is good or bad to experience 100% of the game

2001
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,360
and I'm not saying that you have to get 100%

2002
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,120
to be in a four-hour or talk about it.

2003
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:55,520
I'm just saying the fact that you have not experienced 100%

2004
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:57,520
of the game if you have not completed 100%.

2005
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,040
I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing.

2006
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,160
I'm saying I want to experience it.

2007
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:01,440
The fact what?

2008
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,160
I mean, that is true.

2009
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,320
But is there any consequence of this?

2010
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,280
Or are you just saying it is?

2011
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,040
No, it's just that it doesn't feel right.

2012
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:10,160
Yeah, it doesn't feel right and I really beat in the game.

2013
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:12,080
Okay, here's what I'm willing to concede.

2014
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:15,520
I am definitely not an absolute authority

2015
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,080
on the Kingdom Hearts 2 Gummy Ship missions.

2016
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:20,560
I am absolutely not because I have not beaten them.

2017
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:24,800
But I am an absolute authority on Kingdom Hearts 2,

2018
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:28,160
Mainstay, Combat, Story, all that shit.

2019
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:30,000
I will concede that.

2020
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,560
But that's it.

2021
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,720
This is not a fucking war treaty, Nate.

2022
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:35,360
It is a war treaty.

2023
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,640
This is not.

2024
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:39,440
You're going to have to concede authority on the story

2025
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:39,840
and issues.

2026
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,120
I just like seeing numbers go up.

2027
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,080
That's all I want to do.

2028
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,360
I just want to see numbers go up.

2029
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,080
Well, fair enough.

2030
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:49,840
You should really enjoy this guy, then.

2031
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,600
Yeah, except it has no end to it, unfortunately.

2032
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:52,880
There's so many big numbers in that game.

2033
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:59,040
I could not get into the whole infinite procedural content thing.

2034
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,840
The problem with that is that there is no end goal.

2035
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,120
You have nothing to shoot for.

2036
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,320
Yeah, it really was a problem for me.

2037
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:09,280
And it's weird because I really like a lot of procedurally

2038
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,920
generated games, like roguelikes and stuff.

2039
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,000
But those, again, those have an end goal.

2040
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,280
Those have a win state.

2041
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,680
Disgaea basically does not, which is a problem for me.

2042
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:20,080
With Disgaea, it's like, well, I already beat the game,

2043
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:23,600
and now I can just do all this random extra stuff forever.

2044
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,120
But to what end?

2045
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:27,920
For me, that is completely unanticipating.

2046
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,160
Tactical RPG.

2047
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:33,280
This might surprise and baffle and horrify some people.

2048
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:39,040
And this is in no way a discouragement of the quality of Kirby 64.

2049
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:43,600
But I will, and I do not regret any of the moments I spent with that game at all.

2050
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:47,680
My experience was the pinnacle moment of my life, and it was great.

2051
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:51,840
But I will say, there were certain shards where I just

2052
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,800
would fucking rather piss on my cat than play it.

2053
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,840
That one fucking level where you have to get the dynamite ability,

2054
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,400
and carry it through until the end of the level.

2055
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:05,680
And the dynamite ability fucking sucks, and you cannot hit shit with it.

2056
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:09,680
And to traverse, and then fucking parry, and parkour around Bronto,

2057
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:12,240
Burtz, and Wildies to get to where you need to fucking go.

2058
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:13,840
With this shit ability you cannot use.

2059
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:14,560
I remember that, actually.

2060
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:18,480
Yeah, it was the worst moment of my life.

2061
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,080
But when I beat it, I felt so good.

2062
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:24,720
So I feel like the slog and the turmoil that go through for some of the shards

2063
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:27,440
and 100%, it's worth it in my opinion.

2064
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,920
If I like the base game, which I love Kirby 64, I love it.

2065
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,440
And I'm happy to concede.

2066
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,320
I'm happy to concede.

2067
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:35,120
I like to do it.

2068
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:37,840
I'm definitely on your side when it comes to, I don't know,

2069
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:41,840
like I do go for 100% completion on a lot of stuff,

2070
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:45,440
and would absolutely look down on the people who have not done it.

2071
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:47,920
I just want to kind of judge it on a case-by-case basis.

2072
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:53,600
Like for example, getting all the moons in Mario Odyssey is an absolute waste of time.

2073
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,640
Do not do it.

2074
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:56,080
You will regret it.

2075
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:59,360
It is not worth doing, because some of them are just not fun.

2076
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:02,800
And it is in no way an exercise of skill.

2077
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:06,080
Or like what you get for doing some of that is like,

2078
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:10,400
just like you have to like go talk to one character wearing a certain outfit.

2079
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,200
And like that does not give you anything.

2080
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:14,400
Like yes, you have to buy the outfit,

2081
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,640
so you get like a little bit more experience with it.

2082
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:20,880
But like you already get a moon for just like buying every outfit in the game.

2083
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:23,280
Like to me, that's like a goal that makes sense.

2084
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,640
It's like this large, big goal.

2085
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:27,360
You should get like some grand prize for doing that.

2086
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,440
But the weird way that that game has made the prize

2087
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,840
for literally every accomplishment, a moon,

2088
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:34,960
totally cheapens and devalues the moons themselves.

2089
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,840
And did you see the Joseph Anderson video about it?

2090
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:38,720
Of course, of course.

2091
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,440
Okay, yeah.

2092
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:41,920
I'm with him on a lot of that stuff.

2093
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:42,640
Yeah.

2094
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,280
Yeah, he had the same complaints about everything gives you a moon.

2095
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:46,320
Yeah.

2096
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,680
I'm never going to play that game.

2097
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:52,080
But I watched that video like three times.

2098
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:55,120
Sunshine is better because Sunshine is the best 3D Mario,

2099
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:56,560
literally objective fact.

2100
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:57,760
Sunshine is the fucking best.

2101
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,000
I would like to close this out,

2102
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,400
but I think reciting the story that I've said before,

2103
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,520
but it's relevant to this and it's incredible.

2104
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,640
And I am a god.

2105
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:08,320
Bow fucking down right now.

2106
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:11,440
I was going on like a road trip.

2107
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,280
I knew that I'd be in the car and I couldn't do anything else.

2108
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:14,960
So I brought my DS along.

2109
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:18,160
And so I didn't have any games for reasons.

2110
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:22,560
So I went to GameStop and I bought Kirby Superstar Ultra

2111
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,920
for the road trip.

2112
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:31,200
And on that road trip, that rat trap going from my location,

2113
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:34,880
which is like seven hours away or something, and coming back,

2114
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:43,920
I completed Kirby 64 or Kirby Ultra 100% three times on all save files.

2115
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,040
And then I did that.

2116
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,680
I brought it back to the GameStop and I turned it and I got my money back.

2117
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:52,240
In one day, I completed all the files 100%

2118
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:54,560
and I turned it and got my fucking money back.

2119
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:55,040
That was all.

2120
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:56,000
That's incredible.

2121
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,040
I used it like a fucking whore and I got my money back.

2122
02:02:59,040 --> 02:02:59,920
Okay, that's the thing.

2123
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:00,800
It is important.

2124
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,600
Okay, and this is the thing.

2125
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:07,040
Some games absolutely use the 100% completion system

2126
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:09,280
as a way to make sure that the players experience

2127
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,280
all the content that is worth doing.

2128
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,040
Some of them definitely do it that way.

2129
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,240
For example, I would argue that like most Castlevanias

2130
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:16,960
do it that way.

2131
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,600
The RPG ones, like for example,

2132
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,680
getting all the souls in Aria of Sorrow,

2133
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,360
I think is absolutely worth doing.

2134
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:25,440
A lot of them are a grind and are really annoying,

2135
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:28,560
but you get to experience meaningful new aspects of that game

2136
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:31,040
when you push yourself to get like fully...

2137
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:32,320
I think that the actual percentages,

2138
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:35,200
it might be like 210% is what you get

2139
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,760
when you actually have done literally everything in that game

2140
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,720
or something like that.

2141
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:41,680
When the game does it that way...

2142
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,400
For me, I think a positive example for me

2143
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:48,400
is actually Super Mario World.

2144
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,040
Sure, sure.

2145
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:52,880
Because there's a lot of hidden levels in that game,

2146
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,480
but all the hidden levels are just as good as the main levels.

2147
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:56,960
Exactly.

2148
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:58,000
Sometimes they're even better.

2149
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,800
So if you 100% that game, you will truly experience everything.

2150
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:01,600
And like what if...

2151
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,240
That's worth it.

2152
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:04,160
What if Super Mario World had a mechanic

2153
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:06,800
where you have to like go collect seeds

2154
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,880
and then you come back and you plant them in pots

2155
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,400
and then you have to like come back to the level

2156
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,360
after like 24 IRL hours have passed.

2157
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:14,320
I think I know what you're talking about.

2158
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:17,200
Yeah, I mean those kind of mechanics are not fun.

2159
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,320
Sometimes they can be, sometimes they can be.

2160
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,960
But again, I just want to judge it on a case-by-case basis.

2161
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:27,360
Gummy ships, terrible, don't care about them, waste of time.

2162
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:30,000
All this is coming from a guy who has not played

2163
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,360
single-player games at all for like legitimately...

2164
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,440
Like I've never played a single-player game seriously

2165
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:37,280
in a really fucking long time, like a year.

2166
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:38,400
I don't do the multiplayer games

2167
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,800
because fucking multiplayer games master race,

2168
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:41,920
I love those.

2169
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:42,720
Fair enough.

2170
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,600
Okay, well, you know what?

2171
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:44,880
I think it's all the questions.

2172
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:45,280
I think yeah.

2173
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:48,000
I'd like to say you're serious gambit here.

2174
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,240
Okay, well the thing is this isn't actually

2175
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:51,760
like that serious of a thing.

2176
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,920
So I felt uncomfortable saying it before

2177
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,840
because it's not actually like a major issue or anything.

2178
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:56,960
I just want to slip it in.

2179
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,520
But nonetheless, so here's the thing guys.

2180
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,520
So everyone's been commenting on like

2181
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:02,880
when's Jesse coming back?

2182
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,680
Where's Jesse?

2183
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:05,760
Et cetera, et cetera, since the whole monkey thing.

2184
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:07,280
And like I hear what you're saying guys.

2185
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:08,800
I understand where you're coming from.

2186
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,240
Like why isn't Jesse back?

2187
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,480
But here's what you got to understand everybody.

2188
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,680
Jesse was under no impetus to actually return

2189
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:18,000
to the show after Monkey Left or anything.

2190
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,680
It was just if he then chose to.

2191
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,200
It was a separate issue.

2192
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:24,320
So right now Jesse doesn't want to come back on the show.

2193
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:25,840
He's doing his own stuff.

2194
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,680
Do not expect him back.

2195
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,640
He may come back someday or he may not.

2196
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:33,120
It is up to him and do not count on it.

2197
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,480
Do not have expectations.

2198
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:36,480
So everybody commenting, where's Jesse?

2199
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:37,440
This is your answer.

2200
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,360
He's not coming back anytime soon.

2201
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:41,760
He has made that explicitly clear.

2202
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,120
He is going his own way.

2203
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:44,800
The proud MGTOW that he is.

2204
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,240
And didn't go bother him.

2205
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:47,680
We have no bad blood here.

2206
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:49,200
There is literally no bad blood.

2207
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,760
We have been having more fun conversations with Jesse

2208
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,920
than at any time in the last like six months.

2209
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:55,440
He's still our friend.

2210
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:56,400
He is a friend.

2211
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:57,360
He's in our chat.

2212
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,080
We talked to him.

2213
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:00,080
Like there is literally no problem here

2214
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:02,880
other than Jesse just isn't interested in being on the show.

2215
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,240
So there's no conspiracy.

2216
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:05,520
You can go ask the guy on Twitter,

2217
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,480
but please don't bother him.

2218
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,960
Like it's his own, you know, you can add like,

2219
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:09,680
this is just it.

2220
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:10,720
This is just how it is.

2221
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:12,000
He just doesn't want to.

2222
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,080
And we bear him no will will as a result.

2223
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,760
So, you know, chill out everybody.

2224
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,880
You can stop asking all the questions over and over and over

2225
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,480
again, because this is the answer.

2226
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,400
He's just not interested right now.

2227
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,280
To be fair, it is our fault for not calming on earlier,

2228
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:28,800
but the where's Jesse Commons can, can, can please cease.

2229
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,160
You can stop them now.

2230
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:31,120
You can stop them now.

2231
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,680
If people keep asking, then just link them this part

2232
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:34,160
right now.

2233
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:35,440
And then, and then that'll be the answer.

2234
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,680
This is the official PCP statement.

2235
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:40,160
You just, just so nobody thinks, just so nobody thinks

2236
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:42,960
that he's like not invited for whatever reason.

2237
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,400
It's not, it's not like that.

2238
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,960
Yeah, we continue to have an open invitation

2239
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,240
anytime he wants to come back.

2240
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:50,880
And in no way is this an attempt to like guilt him in any way.

2241
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,000
He chooses not to come back.

2242
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,880
That's perfectly fine.

2243
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:55,120
Sometimes people are busy who are regulars

2244
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:56,480
and just don't want to be on the episode

2245
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:57,600
because they're doing other stuff.

2246
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,560
I consider it like that.

2247
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,920
He's just doing his own thing.

2248
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,680
There's nothing, nothing to be worried about guys.

2249
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:02,800
Just maybe we'll be back.

2250
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,400
I know a lot of people want to see him on,

2251
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,640
but unfortunately, you know, it's, it's his decision

2252
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:07,760
and please respect it.

2253
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:09,840
And, and again, you can stop with the questions.

2254
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,640
Like we got it.

2255
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,200
We got it.

2256
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:13,600
This has been a great episode.

2257
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:16,560
Thank you so much, Mr. Tavern for being on.

2258
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:18,480
It's been a real treat.

2259
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:21,280
I'm, I was delighted to, to be on here.

2260
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:22,000
Thank you.

2261
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,480
Oh, great.

2262
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,280
It was really good.

2263
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:24,960
I'm so glad we finally got a chance to talk.

2264
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,240
We've been kind of admiring your work from afar for a long time.

2265
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:31,600
And man, I hope maybe we can, we can twist your arm

2266
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:33,760
to make some more content on that YouTube sometime.

2267
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,360
Cause man, do I miss it?

2268
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:38,160
All I, all I can say is that if there was more, I'd watch it.

2269
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:39,520
That's, that's, you know,

2270
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:43,440
Well, I do, I do intend on making more.

2271
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:43,760
So.

2272
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,280
It's a little perfect.

2273
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,520
Is there anyone, check out his channel in the description.

2274
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:47,920
Yeah.

2275
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,680
If you subscribe to him, he deserves more subs.

2276
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:50,640
He's a great guy.

2277
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,520
Gamer's Tavern show.

2278
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:53,520
And last, here's the last question for you.

2279
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,760
What would you recommend as your own content

2280
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,800
that you think people should watch?

2281
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,480
What would be your content of choice?

2282
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,200
Oh, you mean me?

2283
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:03,920
Yeah. Like it would you recommend like people watch your rocket night

2284
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:06,240
or your sonic or if people were going to get into your channel,

2285
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:07,760
what do you think it'd be a good place to start?

2286
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:13,600
Well, uh, my opinion, uh, which I might not be the same as people who watch me.

2287
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,160
Sure.

2288
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:14,240
Sure.

2289
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:18,960
Uh, I think my best stuff is the most recent stuff,

2290
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:21,440
the sonic three, uh, and not goes play through.

2291
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,080
So start with like part one of that.

2292
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,440
I've, let's link that in the description to people.

2293
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:29,600
That's the point when I started to know what I was doing.

2294
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,640
Before then I was just kind of, you know,

2295
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:33,440
I don't know, man.

2296
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,600
Those rocket night adventures are pretty legendary.

2297
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:37,360
I love them all.

2298
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:37,920
They've all got it.

2299
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:40,400
They've all got a slightly different like tone to them,

2300
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:41,760
but they're all, they're all great.

2301
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:45,120
And I'll just put them on, I'll just put them on, uh, you know,

2302
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:48,400
like the full playlist and just go through the whole series.

2303
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,360
And I don't want to underplay fancy when I get the wild hair.

2304
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:56,480
We have really loved your content, especially Jesse Gibb and Ben have been

2305
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,200
like your champions out here talking about how great you are.

2306
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:00,720
And loving your stuff.

2307
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:04,400
I can't overstate just how great I think it is.

2308
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:09,040
Just how much I've gotten out of it and how I think the other people would too,

2309
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:09,920
if they knew about it.

2310
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:11,120
If they knew about it.

2311
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:13,600
And, and, and Gibb, I want to prompt you.

2312
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:17,120
I mean, what do you have to say about this man and his catalog of work?

2313
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:22,320
It's, it's, it's just really good.

2314
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:29,040
It's, it's, it's a type of, it's a type of comedy video that just I've never seen.

2315
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:35,280
Like I don't see people making really dry pun laden videos of just, it's,

2316
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:36,560
there's no like ego there.

2317
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:41,520
It's just, here I am talking about this thing and oh, there's, there's funny.

2318
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,040
And this is what you do with this boss.

2319
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:47,520
And here's a pun and here's a pun is like, it's, it's, it's very unique.

2320
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,840
Like I haven't seen that before and I really, I was really happy when I found it.

2321
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,520
It's, it's like if hippos best pun tweets were read by your tax attorney.

2322
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:58,640
Excellent.

2323
02:09:58,640 --> 02:09:59,360
Yes.

2324
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:00,080
So, so great.

2325
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:00,880
That's one way to put it.

2326
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:06,000
Well guys, what a lovely episode this has been.

2327
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,080
Thanks again, Gamer's Tavern for joining us.

2328
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,800
Maybe we'll have, we'll have you back sometime soon again.

2329
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:12,640
I would sure love to talk to you again.

2330
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:13,440
All right.

2331
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,480
Thanks for having me.

2332
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,200
Anytime, dude.

2333
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:16,000
Anytime.

2334
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,240
All right, everybody.

2335
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:17,600
We're going to be trying to be more guests.

2336
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:18,640
So yeah.

2337
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:19,200
So yeah.

2338
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:21,520
Let us know if you like having guests, guys, because we're really,

2339
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:24,320
we're really looking to mix it up and we've got a couple of people in mind.

2340
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:26,880
And I guess, I guess, I guess, but we're fucking free spirits.

2341
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:29,040
We don't need that shit, but if you want, I guess.

2342
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,080
Indeed.

2343
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:30,640
That'd be nice.

2344
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:30,960
