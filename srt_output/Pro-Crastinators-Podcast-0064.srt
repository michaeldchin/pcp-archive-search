1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy. And yet, you try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world, as if there is some, some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But people have got to believe that. What's the point?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You need to believe in things that aren't true. How else can they become?

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm your host, Ben Saint, because best guy ever is-

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Quit the show!

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fucked off to hell.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We got an email. He said, guys, I have appreciated doing this podcast with you, but I've got to move on to bigger and better things. I'm doing me a math of a two. I don't have time for the PCPs, so I'm going to drop out and quit.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How dare he plagiarize my litter of resignation that I was just about to turn in.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You were going to do me a math of a two?

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, it's been my plan all along.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't know.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As the new inheritor of the title of PCP Dictator, I'd just like to say, best guy, we wish you well in your future endeavors, and our attorneys will be contacting you soon, and we'll see you in court, you motherfucker.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Ben, do you have any experience with being a dictator? I don't know if you're qualified for the role.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, you know, I do. My track record is spotty. My track record is spotty, but I think let the record show that I always tried my best. I always tried my level best.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was really hoping that since Nate isn't here, none of us would know how to open the show, and it would just be infinite silence forever. Just like a 24-7 livestream of nothing for all time.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That would pretty well suit our topic for today, which, by the way, is death. Pretty much the ultimate topic.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now, I know what you're thinking, people at home. Didn't you already do this? Didn't you do times we almost died and suicide? Yes, but this is a grander scale. We're talking about death in general, the cheeriest, funnest topic for your three amigos, Ben, Jess, and Monkey.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's what they call us. It's a grander topic. A grander topic that demands a more intimate touch. So it's just us three. Just us three, just sitting around, just having a couple of boys, having a couple of cold ones, and talking about the icy nothingness that awaits beyond the grave.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, for the next hour, we should pretend to be dead, just to know what it's like.

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
To give the viewer a little taste. Give the viewer a little taste of what's coming.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's coming in about 50 years.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Fucking, fucking, fucking, god damn it.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Did you bring up an urban dictionary definition?

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, yeah, we usually do that.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We don't even know how to do this. Here we go.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Where's the urban dictionary?

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Go to the master library and take the urban dictionary off the shelf, as Nate does.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Every time.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Alright, yeah, blows off the dust and like...

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The dust from last week?

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, yeah, tons of accumulated dust.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's a real problem inside.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And then takes some tongs and like, gingerly turns the...

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Gingerly, gingerly turns the...

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I combined gingerly and tenderly into genderly.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, according to the urban dictionary, death is a...

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait, death is... oh, the cure for life.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's a...

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's the first one that's made me laugh so far.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's the top definition.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Second definition is, a spiritual stopover on your journey to the other side of eternity

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to determine whether you are eligible to join the Abraham's, Joseph and Paul's,

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
or be with the Hitler's, Moa's and Osama's.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Great.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think Osama's grouped in with the wrong people. He's clearly more of a Joe and Paul.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I see... alright, two definitions in and we've already fallen.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Reach the point of contention.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This third definition just says, what happens when you eat McDonald's too often?

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And also guy in a big black cloak wearing a big scythe, sea grim reaper.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We should mention this episode is sponsored by McDonald's. The McRib is back, everybody.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you want to get closer to death, go get that two-for-one special.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We should all be eating fast food and smoking for the duration of this particular episode.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, I would enjoy that.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We could even call it a slow motion suicide, but I wouldn't call it that.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Suicide is painless. It brings on many changes.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You already did that episode.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, never mind. No, got it, got it, got it. Alright, moving on.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, the first big question we have to tackle, boys. We're going to answer this once and for all.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What happens after you die?

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What is consciousness, guys?

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What is the self? What is a being? What is being?

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ben, you majored in philosophy. You should know. Don't they teach you this in philosophy 300?

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They just tell you what the meaning of life is and what consciousness is.

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, you got to show up for four years, but at the end, the day before you graduate,

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
fucking Neil deGrasse Tyson comes and visits you in your sleep and whispers the meaning of life into your ear.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, shut up, phone.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And that's the jingle you hear when you approach the gate.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think what happens is you turn into a dinosaur because the dinosaur is invented death.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They were the first ones to do it in all of recorded history, so it must be their wheelhouse that you're going into.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, so when we all die, it's like cultural appropriation because we're ripping off what the dinosaurs invented.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes. You got to get rid of it.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's like you get to hell and there's lots of other things, but the dinosaurs were there first, so they took charge.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's mostly dinosaurs. They roll down.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, they were there first, so they took charge and everyone else just followed their lead.

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It didn't have to be shitty. Hell didn't have to be shitty, but they decided it should be and everyone else has just gone with it ever since then.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's good. It's good for you.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, I'm glad we solved that philosophical conundrum.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, it only took 90 seconds.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, I mean, what's the big deal?

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are all these Play-Doh faggots doing debating all day? They should just listen to this podcast.

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sitting around getting stuck in the carpet.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I like to think.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ben, I have a question for you.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, sure.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When you were taking your senior final thesis for a philosophy major, was the final test just like the word why and then that's it?

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Was that what it was?

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I just said why and you have to answer it in like 30 pages?

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, I would have enjoyed that. I would have enjoyed that a lot.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What would you have put?

90
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I would have put, I probably would have put, I probably would have, if they had just asked me why and just said talk about why for 30 pages,

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I probably would have said something about like, because somethingness is a more stable state of being than nothingness or something about that.

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Probably would have been like a vacuum of nothingness will naturally incline towards a, you know, disturbances and fucking create somethingness or some shit.

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know, and I probably would have fucking pulled on my fucking like physics shit and gone into a weird sort of cosmological explanation of why existence would have occurred in the first place.

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh, oh, and probably some shit about, some shit about how like, well, if we weren't, if existence were not a thing, if there were no existence, then we wouldn't be here to ask the question about why it exists.

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So, so therefore it's kind of a self-defeating quandary.

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, see, let's watch you, you do that and there's like 30 pages along at your masterpiece, you worked on it for like a month.

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And then the fact it next to you just writes down why not and it gets an A.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, becomes president of the United States.

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The president of Philosophy Club.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, and they're like, ooh, so clever and I'm like, but, but, but my, which is really much more of a distinguished position is being president of the Philosophy Club.

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's way better than being president of America.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, of course.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Um, so death.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

105
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Do we know anybody who died and impacted us in a positive or negative way?

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I mean, actually my, actually my friend of mine just died like last week.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, shit.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, it was, oh, it was, I didn't put, I didn't connect the fact that I was going to be on the death podcast with this fact until just now.

110
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But yeah, my friend from college was on vacation in Costa Rica and he drowned.

111
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Costa Rica?

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was really sad and terrible.

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, are you guys close?

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because when, when you tweeted about this story, some small part of me thought to reply saying he was one of the lucky ones, but I didn't know how sensitive you would be.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I didn't know if you guys were good friends, so I refrained and now I'm doing it here on this podcast.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, I was, I was pretty, I was pretty bummed about it, although we weren't, we hadn't talked in a while, but, you know, just guy was like, I was like my age.

117
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I was like a year younger than me.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You know, I don't know.

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He wasn't like a, he wasn't like a close friend exactly, but I was still, I was still pretty bummed about it.

120
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And yeah, so that's death.

121
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It sucks.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Death is the worst thing in the world.

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Death's my least favorite thing.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's the scariest thing.

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's the most sad thing and I would murder it if I could.

126
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's, it's, you know, whenever people have discussions about death, it's always like they're trying just not to point out that it's the worst thing in the world.

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah.

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Like people would rather do anything than admit that just we know what the worst thing is.

130
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's like when in fiction, when people get the choice to become immortal.

131
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, that pisses me off so much.

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think, I think I've heard you talk about this before.

133
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's like when people are like, oh, I wouldn't want to be immortal because then I'd see all my family and friends die.

134
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And it's like, bitch, you, they're going to die anyway.

135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like choosing to die yourself just means that, oh, in addition to all that other bad things happening, you also die, which is the worst thing that can happen.

136
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If you really loved your friends, then you would owe it to them to take that offer up and become immortal so that you could keep their memory alive for all time for the people of the future, future generations.

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It is, it is, like the, I've thought about this and I think you're right that like the reason why this always happens is because like media is, like these, like these stories are designed to convince people that dying isn't so bad and that we shouldn't be sad about it.

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But fuck it.

139
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, we should.

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's all marketing, isn't it?

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It always comes down to marketing, trying to convince us that death isn't the worst so they can keep killing us with their Monsanto.

142
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Makes, makes, makes people feel, makes people feel better, makes people feel better and that's what people want to hear.

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There was a study I read one time where they asked everybody, what is your biggest fear?

144
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And the number two biggest fear was death.

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Number one was public speaking.

146
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So these people were more afraid of speaking in public than of dying.

147
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's retarded.

148
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Here you guys talk.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It sounds like you would both agree that death is the worst thing possible.

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like is that something you guys agree with?

151
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Because I certainly don't.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I definitely agree with that.

153
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I mean, the only thing worse than death would be like being tortured and then dying.

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, would you rather be dead or tortured?

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, I would rather be tortured if it meant I could live afterwards.

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What if it's just like eternal torture? I'd rather be fucking dead.

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, I guess I'd rather be dead if there was gonna be nothing else after it.

158
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean, I don't know.

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Even if I was like burned all over and I couldn't move at all and my life was just constant shit forever.

160
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If I lived forever, I could hold out hope that like someday technology could take my brain out and put it in a nice little jar somewhere.

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah.

162
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Maybe that'd be worth living forever for as opposed to just throwing in the towel and saying I don't want to be immortal.

163
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, I agree with that.

164
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I could hold out hope.

165
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I could board enough being alive for 21 years.

166
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know what I would do with eternity.

167
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know.

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm thinking something.

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I've managed so far.

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I've managed to e-cow.

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've managed to entertain myself this long.

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay, Ben, think about it this way.

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you live forever, your fans are going to expect you to nuzloc every Pokemon game.

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Now do you want to die?

175
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You know what?

176
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If I was going to live forever, I wouldn't nuzloc every Pokemon game because why not?

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I wouldn't stress about it.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You wouldn't feel like you wasted half a year of your life on some stupid project?

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, that's exactly what I wouldn't feel like anymore.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'd have the time to do all that and B, I wouldn't worry about not doing other things

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
because I'd have the time to do those things too.

182
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Death is the ultimate problem.

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
People say that death is like a motivator and death is why people...

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, it motivates you to do things because I'm wasting my life and that's true, I guess.

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You know that that is definitely true, that the only reason I do anything is because I'm scared.

186
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's because I'm scared that I'm going to die and I'm going to waste my life.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I see what you're laying down and I feel it, brother.

188
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm with you.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I think that death, I think that every problem ever could probably be traced back to people

190
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
knowing that they're going to die someday.

191
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, and the only reason that I'm sad about anything is because those things that make me sad

192
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
are things that are like harming me in the here and now and damaging the limited time that I have.

193
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If I was going to live forever, everything would roll off my back and nothing would make me sad at all.

194
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It would liberate you from all stress and insecurity.

195
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's the ultimate power, it's the ultimate comfort knowing, hey, even if everything is bad for a million years

196
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll be here for a million plus infinity years, so fuck it.

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But do you know what else gives you eternal...

198
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
No more stress, you get plenty of comfort.

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Death.

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
All these things that you're talking about being a problem are also a solution with death.

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know, man, but then you're not around to experience it.

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If I'm not conscious to feel my wiener getting sucked, then that's a bad deal.

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
End of story.

204
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
A hundred people could suck my corpse wiener and I'd never feel it because I'd have no brain left

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and that would just... I don't want to live that un-life, man.

206
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't want to live that way either.

207
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't want to live my life dead.

208
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Imagine looking into a graveyard, monkey-like, wistfully looking into a graveyard and being like,

209
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
ah, now that's the life, right there.

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Instead of putting...

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's a secret that I've spent the last five years of my life daydreaming of death.

212
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm very open about it.

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It kind of does blow my mind that you guys are talking about it as if it is like the ultimate terrible thing,

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
which I can't get into that mindset at all.

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't know, that's always been my stance on it.

216
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There's definitely pros and cons to it.

217
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean, the con is that I have to die and I'm the best person,

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
so that would be the worst thing that could possibly happen to all fucking life would be without me.

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But also, it's like every good person is going to die. That sucks.

220
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But I mean, the pro of it is that all the really terrible people are going to die too.

221
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So I mean, if you think of like the worst person you've ever met in your entire life,

222
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
for me it's not very hard because they're both right here.

223
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, you would, you know, that person, he'll die. Fuck him. He'll be dead.

224
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That does comfort. That is a comfort, Jesse.

225
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Alright guys, think about it this way.

226
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Great philosopher named Harvey Dent once said,

227
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
either die a hero or you live long enough to become the villain.

228
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So maybe death is the answer.

229
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Well, I would retort to that.

230
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You either die a hero or you live long enough to become the villain,

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
or you live even longer than that and everyone who thought you were a villain dies,

232
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and so then you're a hero again.

233
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, I'm going to go, I like that. I like that much better.

234
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The only way we can talk about death is the alternative being you also can live forever.

235
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is there a way we can talk about death in the realm of we're all going to die at age 80, like reality?

236
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay, okay, we can bring it back. We can bring this back to Earth for a second.

237
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I do have a story of, much like you, Ben, of a classmate of mine dying,

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but mine happened in fucking fourth grade.

239
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Shit.

240
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And it's, here's a story you can put up on the PCP Wiki under my Mumkey page of

241
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Mumkeys emerging sociopathic traits, age nine.

242
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It all started in fourth grade.

243
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And there was a girl in that class whose name I will refrain from saying,

244
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
so I guess we'll just call her Eve, who gives a shit.

245
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And Eve, I didn't know, guys, I didn't know what cancer was at the time.

246
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't fucking know what's going on.

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
All I knew was that this little bitch, Eve, was allowed to wear survivor headbands to school

248
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and nobody else could wear hats or anything and I was jealous as fuck.

249
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because I love survivor and this bitch gets to wear survivor headband to class.

250
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

251
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Wait, just like a headband, like a bandana?

252
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, it's a bandana.

253
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Wait, are you talking about a piece of merchandise from the reality game show Survivor?

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, yeah, they have really cool bandanas that you get to wear.

255
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Huh, I guess that's one reason to get cancer.

256
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, I didn't realize that she was bald underneath it.

257
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I thought she was just like a special girl who got to wear it.

258
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But that's not the only reason why I didn't like her.

259
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Because one day at recess, I recall she said something a little snarky to me and I was like,

260
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
oh, this fucking survivor bitch, man, she's really getting on my nerves.

261
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then we find out that Eve is in the hospital, but she's probably going to make a recovery.

262
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So the teacher says, OK, class, to help out our good friend Eve,

263
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
we're going to make a special, I don't know if it was probably on DVD,

264
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
they probably had DVDs at that time, I don't remember, it was like 2004.

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We're going to make a video for Eve so that she can watch it

266
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and know all of her friends are supporting her back at school while she's in the hospital.

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So we spend like a full month making this project.

268
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You spend a month making a video?

269
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No, it's like a big DVD full of videos.

270
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There were multiple skits, lots of, a lot of shit went into this.

271
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We were like, we sang a song, just a ton of work.

272
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And then, you know, wouldn't you know it?

273
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Right when we finished this big grand video to support her friend, she fucking died.

274
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No.

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Tragic, tragedy.

276
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You know, I think, I think that makes me mad, that makes me mad at the teachers,

277
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that makes me mad at the teachers for their shortsightedness and for them just like,

278
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
for them fucking putting, they just fucked it up, they just fucked it up,

279
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
they tried to do some big grand gesture and guess what, it was retarded.

280
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The teacher told us that they ended up giving the DVD to her family,

281
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
but I don't think they really did, I think they probably just threw that shit away.

282
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, they did.

283
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But here's where Mumkey, the emerging sociopath comes in,

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
because of course everybody, every single person in the classroom is crying when we hear this news,

285
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
except for me, because I'm just thinking, well, I mean, like she wasn't my friend,

286
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
she was mean to me, what do I care?

287
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And I think back and I think, hmm, was I really that jaded and evil at the age of nine

288
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
that I wasn't crying, that my classmate died of cancer?

289
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Maybe, maybe there's something bad under the surface here that we need to evaluate.

290
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Well, how mean are you talking about?

291
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There has to be a threshold.

292
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
She got a survivor bandana and I did it.

293
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay, I don't think that's quite mean enough to worry about.

294
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm not caring that she's dead.

295
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Covered it, covered it, those survivor bandanas.

296
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And she said one mean thing to me at recess one time,

297
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
but I was probably like being mean in the first place, because I was so jealous of her.

298
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I was jealous of the little girl with cancer.

299
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Who wouldn't be?

300
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What's she hiding under that bandana?

301
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Probably a cool Yondu Mohawk that she's not sharing with anyone.

302
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
She can control arrows.

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah.

304
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
She doesn't even have cancer.

305
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She's just Yondu.

306
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
She's hiding her fucking head, Finn.

307
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What about you, Jess, that any of your classmates die in a tragic cancer related accident in Costa Rica?

308
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I also have a story about a classmate of mine dying tragically and me thinking it was quite humorous.

309
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
At least I didn't laugh when it happened.

310
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, I'll say it out the bat.

311
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Putting it like that makes me sound like a pretty bad guy,

312
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
but we just wait to hear my side of the story, okay?

313
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So this was a really rich, privileged shit lord in my grade.

314
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm already on your side.

315
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, he was called Gasper, so of course when we died, we all called him Gasper, the friendly ghost.

316
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So the way he was in a car wreck and his whole body went up in flames,

317
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I guess he burned alive.

318
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It was probably really painful and really horrible.

319
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And really awesome.

320
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, so so far I'm still sounding like a bad guy, but just wait.

321
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
How old was the kid when he died?

322
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He must have been, because I think it was in high school, so he was probably 15 or 16.

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, okay.

324
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, fuck him.

325
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, but the reason that I hated him and the reason that I not only didn't care that he died

326
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
but was kind of like, yeah, was because he came over to my house once on a bicycle

327
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and I had kittens and he picked up my kittens and he threw them off while riding around on his bicycle.

328
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He would throw my kittens.

329
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Who throws kittens?

330
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The kid was a sociopath.

331
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He was a monster.

332
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He just picked up a handful of kittens, got on his bike and then rode and chucked them to the side.

333
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
He tossed my baby cats.

334
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Are you confessing that you cut his brakes?

335
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not confessing that.

336
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You said that and not me.

337
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Okay.

338
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well, fuck.

339
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Sounds like a real asshole.

340
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, you know, it's probably sad for his parents or friends or whatever, but probably.

341
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's a kid who threw cats.

342
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah, if you throw kittens, like, fuck your whole family.

343
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Fucking go up in flames, dude.

344
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah.

345
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
They were endless justice kittens, dude.

346
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Nobody, nobody fucks with my kittens.

347
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
No.

348
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Did you go to the funeral?

349
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh no, god no.

350
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I don't think I...

351
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I will admit, so...

352
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Did you throw a kitten into the grave?

353
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I should have buried him with my cats.

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That would teach him.

355
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I didn't cry when I found out that the student had died, but we went to the open casket service and when I saw the dead body, I did tear up a bit.

356
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So if that gives me any credit towards not being a monster of a human being then...

357
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You know what?

358
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It would have been poetic justice if they had buried him in kitty litter.

359
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And if they had, you know, he would have looked just like a burnt little cat turd because of the way he died.

360
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

361
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Was he driving?

362
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Was it his fault?

363
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I have no idea.

364
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I actually kind of feel bad joking about this in hindsight.

365
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Nah, whatever.

366
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Because he did die.

367
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That does suck.

368
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Dying definitely sucks.

369
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I mean, he covered that.

370
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Maybe he didn't deserve to die.

371
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

372
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Maybe he just deserved to be thrown off of a bike himself a few hundred times.

373
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah, I would have got...

374
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I would have pulled my push head.

375
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
By me in a cat suit.

376
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In my Michelle Pfeiffer Tim Burton catwoman cosplay.

377
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I have never been to an open casket funeral.

378
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I've been to two funerals and they were both closed casket.

379
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So, I've actually never seen...

380
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't think I've ever seen a dead human body.

381
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, wow.

382
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Other than like, yeah, a skeleton like in a science place.

383
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So that's interesting.

384
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's a fact about me.

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I actually...

386
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So if I was in Harry Potter, I couldn't see Festerls.

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Couldn't see Festerls.

388
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What the hell does that mean?

389
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They're these demon horses that you can only see if you've witnessed death.

390
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Whoa, cool.

391
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, they're awesome.

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What book is that in?

393
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, they're technically always there, but they only become visible to Harry in book 6.

394
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I think it's after he sees Sirius die.

395
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
He didn't see his mom die when he was a baby?

396
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
JK Rowling needs to fucking fix this.

397
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Maybe he was a...

398
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Turn the other way or some shit.

399
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
No, I saw the movie.

400
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Do you have to see someone dying or just seeing a body with just seeing a body work?

401
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, no, maybe you have to actually see someone die.

402
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Because I remember that these Festerls come in and I remember thinking it was really obvious that

403
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Rowling had just wanted these Festerls to be a thing and had tried to come up with an excuse

404
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
for why they were suddenly there but had been there all along and I remember not buying it.

405
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Like Harry should definitely have...

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Like if anyone's seen death, it's Harry Potter, the boy who lived.

407
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You know what I'm saying?

408
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
No.

409
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Harry Potter is so stupid.

410
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The whole series is so stupid.

411
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Just the idea that muggles kind of know about wizards but they also kind of don't

412
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
but she can't really commit to either or for the entire series.

413
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Sometimes they're shrouded in secrecy.

414
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sometimes they're not.

415
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's only the Prime Minister that knows about magic.

416
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
No, no.

417
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Harry's whole family, the Dursleys, they know specifically.

418
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Only the Prime Minister and families of wizards.

419
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, they present it as though the wizarding world is a secret.

420
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Like Hogwarts somehow is off everyone's radar.

421
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No one knows about the giant castle in Scotland or whatever.

422
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Somehow nobody knows about all this magical stuff going on and yet a great many wizards

423
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and witches are muggle-born.

424
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Hermione's parents know all about wizards and witches.

425
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Aunt Petunia, her sister was a witch.

426
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Lots of people just have magic folk in their family.

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The whole series makes no sense.

428
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
J.K. Rowling is a fucking back.

429
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The muggles not see them at platform nine and three-quarters just running into a wall.

430
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah, that's...

431
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I think there's some shit about like, oh, because it's all weird and quirky,

432
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
like regular people just can't see it, like their brain just ignores the exceptional.

433
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But when Ron and Harry in the second book, they run into the wall because Dobby closed it

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and some fucking guy sees them immediately after they crash into the wall.

435
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What a crock of shit.

436
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I agree.

437
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You know what J.K. stands for?

438
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It stands for just kidding when I said I was a good author.

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That's what it stands for.

440
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I thought J.K. stood for a giant cunt.

441
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah, I like it.

442
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I dig it.

443
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Should we talk about some people who were going to be very sad when they do die?

444
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Okay.

445
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I know you wanted to talk about Christian.

446
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Oh, yeah, Christian.

447
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Well, I mean, I didn't bring this up. You said it.

448
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But yeah, I will be super...

449
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The new Sonichu came out recently, and I'm going to go read that soon.

450
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And fucking, yeah, when Christian...

451
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
People have been saying, people have been saying for years,

452
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
like people, all Chris's trolls have been saying like,

453
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
oh, with his lifestyle, he's going to die, he's going to die before 40.

454
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And like, I think, I don't believe that because, yeah, he's unhealthy and he's sedentary

455
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and he's fat and he's weak and he's pitiful.

456
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But like, so is like...

457
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Hold on.

458
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Oh no, what have I done?

459
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What have I done?

460
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What have I done?

461
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I misgendered Jim.

462
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But like, yeah, he, she is all those things, but so is like...

463
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Just say she.

464
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So is like everyone else.

465
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Man, I always, I haven't thought about it.

466
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Like, I haven't thought about it the same way since she transitioned.

467
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Like, to me, real Chris is old boy Chris.

468
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Like, that's what I think of when I think of Christian West and Chandler.

469
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Anyway, the point is...

470
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't actually care.

471
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I just think it's funny to like, harass somebody over it because it's so stupid.

472
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Good, because I'm easily triggered.

473
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm easily triggered by this, by the thought of misgendering Christian.

474
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Anyway, I don't think he's actually going to die that early.

475
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I think he's just going to be a fat old person like everyone else.

476
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And hopefully he'll keep making son of two until Kingdom come, baby.

477
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Uh, 50, 50, 50 issues.

478
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
50 issues in a movie.

479
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm trying to think of a celebrity.

480
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I have nothing to say about it.

481
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Because, because as we all know, Momki doesn't care about anybody he knows in person.

482
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's like friends and family, whatever.

483
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm trying to think of a celebrity that would really impact me.

484
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I know, like, people were upset about, like, Prince and all this shit.

485
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But I think, like, upon the death of Leo DiCaprio,

486
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
after seeing him die so many times in film,

487
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
it won't, it won't seem real to have a news story pop up saying Leo died.

488
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I think it was just another one of the movies.

489
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I think coming to terms with the actual death of my, my childhood and adult hero

490
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
is going to be too much for me to cope with.

491
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I might have to take my own life in retaliation against death.

492
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There's a lot of actors.

493
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's, that's doing what death wants.

494
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
No!

495
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's playing right into the trap.

496
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He's playing right into his hands.

497
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Damn it.

498
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You gotta beat him.

499
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What were you saying, Jess?

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You gotta beat him at, like, at video games, like in Bill and Ted.

501
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's the only way to not give death what he wants.

502
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Um, yeah.

503
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
There's definitely a lot of actors who, like, I really love, but who are also really old.

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And that's gonna be sad.

505
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Like, like, Clint Eastwood or Bill Shatner or Stallone even is, like, in his 70s now.

506
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm definitely gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna shit a few tears when Stallone dies.

507
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Um, you know, I'm a big wrestling fan.

508
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
A lot of my, uh, heroes, people that I've always admired are wrestlers.

509
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And, uh, wrestlers are notorious for dropping, like, fucking flies.

510
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Uh, nobody dies more than wrestlers.

511
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Randy Savage.

512
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah.

513
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
In, in the last eight years, there's probably been, like, three dozen really famous wrestlers who've, who've died.

514
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And it's, it's very sad.

515
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And they just keep, because it's, you know, it's a hard grind, a hard life.

516
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Most of them spend their whole, you know, they get addicted to the drugs.

517
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
To the, to the, to all the bad stuff.

518
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And most of them fucking die before they're 60.

519
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Hmm.

520
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Should we move on to a more cheery topic?

521
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I think I'm going to a more cheery episode of this podcast.

522
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No way. No, we can, we can have a cheery fun discussion to death.

523
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Like, for example, what do you want to happen after you die?

524
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I have a great, I was actually just going to bring this up again.

525
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Um, I have, I have my, I have my ideal scenario.

526
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And, uh, I think the best part about this is that it's not completely implausible, right?

527
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This is not completely, this is not completely outside the realm of physical possibility.

528
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I think it might be.

529
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And I don't even know what it is.

530
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
All right. All right.

531
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, listen to this. Listen to this.

532
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
All right.

533
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So there's like, oh God, oh no, I'm going to forget all the big words that would make me sound smart when I explain this.

534
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I hate it when that happens.

535
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't want to say stuff like, oh, that thing.

536
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I hate that thing.

537
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Like, like, I know, like I used to know it in all these like terms.

538
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Like there's all these fancy terms for what I'm going to describe it.

539
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I can't.

540
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Anyway, so there's like, there's like a thing, right?

541
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There's like a thing where like in a system, in like in a system of particles, in like a system of particles,

542
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
like whose configuration is random and who, and that are like moving randomly, there is like, okay.

543
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So like the nature of a system is to increase disorder and entropy generally.

544
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,000
However, however, there is some like, there is some like statistical probability of like a random configuration occurring that like repeats itself,

545
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
even though that even though that even though that goes against the continual increase of entropy.

546
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So what I'm saying is, so what I'm saying is that like, that like a system of particles,

547
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
even though it is nature generally tends toward more disorder, does have some,

548
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
does will eventually, is suggested that it will eventually return to its original configuration, even in spite of all that.

549
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The point being, that this is technically true of the universe as a system as well.

550
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And that according to some, some, I don't remember the calculations, but it's like in like, even though the universe is expanding,

551
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
even though like space itself is expanding, and even though like, like the heat death of the universe is coming and everything is moving outward,

552
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and it doesn't seem like there's, it seems like the universe is just going to become a cold dead nothing.

553
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
There does exist some kind of probability of this occurring, and that means that on a long enough time frame, it will occur eventually.

554
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
In like 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 23,

555
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
or some shit, it's like literally the largest number ever published in a scientific paper.

556
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is what I remember.

557
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
If someone knows what I'm fucking talking about, please link me like this article that I've, this study that I'm talking about.

558
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I am like Patrick with the milk spilling in his brain right now.

559
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The point is, the point is that in this time, there exists some, there exists some possibility that the universe might just fucking randomly reconfigure itself into its,

560
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
into its original state, and it all could begin again, and that's what I would want.

561
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's an episode of Futurama, isn't it?

562
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Is it?

563
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah, they, it's one of the new Comedy Central seasons where-

564
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Oh, I haven't seen the new ones.

565
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah, so something happens and they fuck up, so a fry, and I think a few of the other characters,

566
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
like they just sit there and wait for the universe to start over again, and then they get back to where they were, and it happens like a bunch of times.

567
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I mean, there's like, there's like some, there's different way, like, you know, there's the big bang, and there's like,

568
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
what if it contracts again, and that's the big crunch, but according to everything I've read, like there's not enough mass,

569
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
like there's not enough gravity in the universe, like there's not actually going to be a big crunch.

570
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's just going to keep expanding and expanding, so like, that's really, when I heard, that made me really sad,

571
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
because what I would really, I just want the universe to start over.

572
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
So I read about this like statistical thing, and I was like, oh, maybe, maybe even if there's no big crunch,

573
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
maybe even if the universe continually expands and space expands, maybe there can still, maybe there can still be like a reconfiguration,

574
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
because that's what I want, what I would want, what I really want is for the universe to repeat itself in cycles over and over again,

575
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Time is a flat circle, it's true detective.

576
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I hope so. That's what I want. So that's what I, so that's what I want to happen after death.

577
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I want the universe to die and be reborn and for it to all happen again.

578
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And I know that's probably really cruel to people that live really shit lives, but,

579
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah, no shit.

580
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But I live a pretty good life and I like it, so whatever, I'm going to, I'm going to vote, I'm going to vote my best interests.

581
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm, so I'm voting, I'm voting on what happens after you die, and I'm voting for fucking, I'm voting for a big crunch,

582
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and it starts over again and fuck the weak people.

583
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Well shit, Ben, I just, I just hope that people remember me fondly and think that I was a good person.

584
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
No, I mean, I'd like that, but it's not enough, it's not enough.

585
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
As far as my fucking, as my thought on the subject goes, you're over here talking about the heat death of the universe,

586
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and time being an infinite loop, and I'm just like, I hope nobody thinks I'm an asshole after I go.

587
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You know, boys, those are two pretty good answers, but I think I got you beat.

588
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Alright, let's hear it.

589
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
After you die, three words.

590
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Hot tub bikini party.

591
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That was four words.

592
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I thought you were going to say hot tub time machine, and I was like, yes, yes.

593
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
After you die, every girl you ever had a crush on, both people you knew and celebrities are there in a hot tub with you,

594
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
they're all in bikinis, baby, and maybe, you know, that's just heaven, you're there forever,

595
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and maybe eventually they will take their bikini tops off.

596
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Oh my god, they really are.

597
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Just to clarify, are you talking about this is what happens in the here after,

598
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
or are you talking about that's your funeral, like you invite all the girls you've ever had,

599
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
they get in the tub with your corpse, and because you grew old,

600
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
okay, they're all these old girls that you were crushing on when you were a child.

601
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Disgusting.

602
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
No.

603
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Luna Lovegood is a fictional character, okay?

604
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm not going to have fake characters in my hot tub when I'm a corpse.

605
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm talking, this is heaven after you die.

606
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Alright, that makes more sense.

607
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You gotta, you gotta...

608
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Let's keep this afterlife realistic, Ben.

609
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah, come on.

610
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Let's keep it in the realm of what can definitely happen.

611
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Jess, have you seen that movie Red?

612
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No.

613
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The Bruce Willis movie?

614
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I have not.

615
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay, have you seen Weeds?

616
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
There's some, the woman from those shows.

617
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I have a crush on her.

618
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
She's like the oldest woman I want to fuck.

619
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Whatever her name is.

620
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh wait, um, oh man.

621
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Well she's there too, and she's wearing a bikini.

622
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You know, you know who's old, you know who's old and who I always had a crush on?

623
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Betty White.

624
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Um, no, um, I don't know if I'm saying this right.

625
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Julia Louis Dreyfus from Psycho.

626
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah.

627
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Well that's a, that is a, that is a good looking old broad.

628
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
She's like a, she's like a mega all time nineties babe.

629
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah.

630
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yep.

631
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
For sure.

632
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
For sure.

633
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh, Mary Louise Parkers who I'm talking about.

634
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, she's pretty good.

635
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Pretty cute.

636
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
For an old broad.

637
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
For an old broad.

638
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
If I brought old broad I mean like she's 40.

639
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
For, for an old broad who, for whom death is, is certain and soon.

640
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah.

641
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Who stinks, who stinks of it, you know?

642
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
All right.

643
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The, the, the, the, the chill, the chill of death clings to her at all times.

644
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So what are some other death topics we could focus on in our grand death episode?

645
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Um, how do you want to die?

646
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh, that's a good one.

647
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm, I want to die, um, I want to die, uh, I want to die, well here's how I want to die.

648
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I want to die by having each one of my brain cells replaced, uh, one by one, so that, you

649
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
know, it, like my mind, my brain becomes less and less me and more and more machine.

650
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So I don't, there's no moment of actual death.

651
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I just slowly phase out of existence.

652
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I phase out of existence slowly and I'm, and I'm slowly replaced by an artificial consciousness

653
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
that perfectly mimics me.

654
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Because if I don't get to live, I at least, I at least want like a perfect facsimile of

655
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
me to live on.

656
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And I would, I would be, well not okay with that, but it would be the next best thing

657
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
to not be in dead.

658
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah.

659
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Slowly fading out of consciousness actually sounds pretty good, which is why, uh, the

660
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
way I want to die is suspension hanging from a noose in my closet.

661
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I want to die by my own hand.

662
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I want to decide when it happens, where it happens and why it happens.

663
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm not going to be some faggot getting in a burn up car crash, dying that way so that

664
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
assholes make fun of me in a podcast.

665
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Getting buried in kitty litter.

666
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah.

667
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm not going to get cancer and where a survivor headband everywhere.

668
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm going to decide, you know what?

669
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
This is the point in which I've had enough.

670
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You know, I just hit 40k subs.

671
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That's too many.

672
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

673
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm going to, I'm going to go hang out in the closet.

674
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Death by sub count.

675
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yeah.

676
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
A growing, a growing epidemic.

677
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, you're right.

678
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
No, John Tron and Great Eye Under Ray both died from a, too high of a sub count.

679
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
True.

680
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
True.

681
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Um, yeah, I think-

682
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And I guess Ray William Johnson.

683
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I think we all have a totally different answers on this one because Ben said that he wants

684
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to go, you know, slowly and peacefully losing consciousness.

685
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Monkey wants to fucking kill himself.

686
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Um, why am I laughing?

687
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Um, you know, I think the way I want to go, I know it's a cliche and I'm not trying to

688
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
sound like a tough guy, but I really want to go out in battle.

689
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I want to make a last stand for something I believe in, fighting someone who needs to

690
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
get beaten up.

691
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I want to go out as a fucking vigilante.

692
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Um, you know, you know what I really want-

693
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Just some comments are on a video.

694
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah.

695
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Some guy who didn't understand a plebe in the weeb.

696
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He thought it was supposed to be serious.

697
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I will find the worst commenter of all time.

698
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The guy who understood plebe in the weeb the less than anyone in the world.

699
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'll find that guy.

700
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'll find all of them and it'll be just like the end of Gran Torino.

701
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'll be standing on my front lawn, my front lawn with all the bad commenters and I'm

702
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
going to put my finger out like a gun and they're going to shoot me down and I'll die

703
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
being Clint Eastwood.

704
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Actually becoming Clint Eastwood.

705
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That's terrible revenge.

706
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's, it's a, well you know what, um, I want to take, yeah, better than that, I'll take

707
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
a few of them out with me at least.

708
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

709
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I want that and then I want my funeral to just be the yandu scene at the end of Guardians.

710
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That's exactly what I want to be shot and blown up in fireworks.

711
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
With fireworks in space.

712
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I want Sylvester Stallone to be there saying what a great guy I was.

713
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He'll be like 150.

714
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You want a raccoon to be there crying.

715
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes.

716
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And I want Baby Groot to fucking, to sing Amazing Grace as they blow me up with fireworks.

717
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Baby Groot, baby, baby Groot, baby.

718
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh yeah, that reminds me of Dead and Gay.

719
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That's another topic about being dead.

720
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Oh yeah, I have been dead because I've been dead and gay.

721
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I was actually on that album.

722
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And there we go.

723
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Good job me.

724
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Me and Baby Groot, the two stars of that album and no one else.

725
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I actually did a sick alternate cover art for Gay and Dead.

726
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And it's like this melting skull of all these rainbow colors just melting over a skull.

727
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah, I saw that.

728
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You know what?

729
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I was like that's sick as hell.

730
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's better than the actual cover.

731
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You know what?

732
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What's the actual cover?

733
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
The actual cover is some flowers on a patch of dirt.

734
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember.

735
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You know what?

736
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That'd be cool if in 10 years he made the special edition with a slip cover.

737
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You could put that in the slip cover.

738
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
That'd be cool.

739
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah.

740
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That one, that one was, that one was choice.

741
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That one was mwah.

742
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Mwah.

743
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I wish I knew who did it.

744
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I would say nice job.

745
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Mwah.

746
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's just like the kisses get wetter and sloppier each time.

747
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That's how much you like it.

748
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The more you like something, the wetter and sloppier your kiss.

749
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah, that sounds right.

750
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Alright boys, here's a big one.

751
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yep, yep.

752
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Jess, please, for the love of God, let's keep Trump out of this one.

753
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
What living person would you, do you wish would die?

754
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
If you had a death note, who do you wish was dead?

755
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh, Sargon of Akkad.

756
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Oh, shut the fuck up.

757
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I think we've done this before and you said that same shit.

758
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Sargon of Akkad or any of like the dozens of people that are exactly like him.

759
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
He deserves to die because he got attacked by Anita Sarkeesian.

760
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't think so.

761
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
He and everyone just like him deserves to die because they...

762
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
For being a smug atheist on YouTube?

763
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
For being a fucking...

764
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
For being a fucking...

765
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
What's the word?

766
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
A fucking rage mongering fucking conflict profiteer.

767
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
For being someone whose entire existence is to make people angry.

768
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah, you've got like people like in North Korea who are running death camps and you...

769
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Nah, I think Sargon of Akkad.

770
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Alright, alright.

771
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
He's not like the worst...

772
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Okay, whatever.

773
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
He's just the one that I have like the most...

774
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I don't know those guys.

775
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I haven't seen the death camps.

776
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Why don't you defeat him with your like moral superiority and intelligence instead of just fucking killing?

777
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
No, that's not worth it.

778
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That's them.

779
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That's the wrong.

780
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
They have to die.

781
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'll tell you why.

782
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Because people don't fucking...

783
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
People are too stupid to recognize my moral and intellectual superiority.

784
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's exactly right.

785
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Didn't you beat him on Twitter though?

786
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I don't...

787
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I mean, we have like...

788
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
What kind of an exchange?

789
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I mean, I guess it's up to you who won.

790
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I mean, his creepy sick of fan followers thought that he won.

791
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I thought that I won.

792
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Pick your poison, I suppose.

793
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Yeah, that's the problem with these people on the internet.

794
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Like, you can be better than them and you can win, but they don't know that you won.

795
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So they...

796
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So they just have to die.

797
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's the only way.

798
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
They just like...

799
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
They just like weren't even reading the things that were said.

800
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
They just...

801
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
They like didn't even see what was going on.

802
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
They were just like, oh, I...

803
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't know.

804
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't know what they were thinking.

805
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I hate them.

806
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I hate them more than life itself.

807
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And I...

808
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Wait, I like life itself.

809
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I don't want to die.

810
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, that's a weird phrase to use.

811
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Yeah.

812
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You hate them more than death itself.

813
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That's the...

815
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Well, that's not true.

816
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That sounds stupid too.

817
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I don't know.

818
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If I weren't scared to die, I wouldn't worry about the existence of Sargon and his infinite clone army.

819
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah.

820
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Because I would be like, well, whatever.

821
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It'll all work itself out in the end.

822
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
One day they'll all grow up.

823
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But now I know that they won't, because they'll die first.

824
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah.

825
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah.

826
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I don't think I would use a death note to kill anyone.

827
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Not out of any sense of morals, just because you need to know someone's name and face.

828
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So all the people that I...

829
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Well, that's not specifically a death note.

830
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's just like, if you could choose one person to die, who would it be?

831
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh, like with my bare hands or like a baseball bat, I can just have someone appear in front of me

832
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and I can physically murder them?

833
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Oh my god.

834
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah, sure.

835
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
How do I pick just one?

836
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I want all of them.

837
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
The whole world to line up outside my door.

838
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh shit.

839
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
One by one.

840
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I want that if anyone has ever played the game No More Heroes.

841
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You fight that.

842
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
She's like the number two boss near the end.

843
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
She's like this crazy cheerleader.

844
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
She's just got guys, gimps coming out on the conveyor belt.

845
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And she's like knocking them with a baseball bat one after another.

846
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I want that with everyone.

847
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah.

848
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I want to be the number two boss from No More Heroes.

849
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That's my role model in life.

850
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Would you dress everyone else up as gimps before you sluggered them?

851
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Definitely.

852
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
They need to be dressed as what they are.

853
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Which is, I guess, gimps.

854
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I don't know where I'm going with that.

855
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Clearly the two of you have a lot of inner frustration and hatred and rage towards the world.

856
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I hate that opportunity so much.

857
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I hate them.

858
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah.

859
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
When given the opportunity to kill one person, I would do it out of peace and love and understanding.

860
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I want somebody to be put out of their misery.

861
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Somebody who has not only been miserable for so long, but has spread their misery to the masses.

862
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I think I see where you're going with this, Mumki.

863
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm going to put my buddy Conrad Collins just into him.

864
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Oh yeah.

865
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Let him go.

866
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh yeah.

867
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I think he's done enough.

868
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Now I do have a bit of this selfish reason.

869
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Somebody has to do it.

870
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
The one problem I have with Mr. Conrad Collins other than his eternal misery that he spreads upon the masses is that

871
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
he has 300,000 subs, and if we get rid of him, then I will be ever so close to being the head honcho of the PCP

872
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and then everybody can suck my dick.

873
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And I need that dick sucking really bad.

874
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So that's why Conrad Collins has got to go.

875
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Wait, wait.

876
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Why would you be the head honcho?

877
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I feel like all of us would have to leave, and it would just be you.

878
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Just the idea of everybody thinks the PCP is Digi's thing because he has the most subs, which is not true.

879
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I've always considered it Nate's thing, to be honest.

880
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Well we know that Nate's the only one who takes any kind of a leadership role at all.

881
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But the masses, these dumb ignorant masses that watch Thunderfoot and Armored Skeptic and other such monsters

882
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:32,000
are all thinking that Digi is the king of the mountain and in fact he is just a really nice guy.

883
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah.

884
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Stop thinking that this is Digi Bro's show.

885
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He hasn't been on it in two months and he doesn't give a fuck about it.

886
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Give the credit to Nate and I guess whoever edits the episode.

887
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Let's say we say this, our subs just dropped to like 8,000, 7,000, 6,000.

888
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I thought that was the Digi Bro show.

889
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Wait, I wanted to answer my anime question on the pro questionators.

890
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Okay, do you guys want to go to the Twitter questions?

891
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Yeah, I was just looking at those actually.

892
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You got one?

893
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
No, they all suck ass.

894
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
They're terrible.

895
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Don't like them?

896
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Okay, here we go.

897
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You can only save one.

898
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Mumkey Jones or model railways.

899
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
What the hell's model railways?

900
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That's from Stan on Wheels.

901
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I think he just means like do you save Mumkey Jones or do you save all like model trains in the world?

902
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I mean, I would give you all permission to put me out of my misery anyway, so I mean, all the model trains in the world.

903
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I think it's all of them.

904
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It could just be some.

905
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
He didn't clarify.

906
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Are you sure it's not a YouTube channel called that where a guy talks about trains?

907
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Well, he capitalized your name, but he didn't capitalize model railways, so I don't think he's talking about a person.

908
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:10,000
If Mumkey dies in this arrangement, can I put the Mumkey mask on a model train and just call it the new Mumkey?

909
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It would be just as funny.

910
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Because then everybody wins.

911
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Then you just get a better Mumkey.

912
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah.

913
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Maybe he wouldn't get banned from uploading for two weeks on YouTube.

914
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
IceKiller159 asks, what is your favorite gay and dead track?

915
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Oh.

916
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Gay and dead.

917
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I don't know.

918
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I actually don't know which songs are on that album.

919
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I haven't actually listened to the full album itself, so Jesse.

920
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I have to look at the track list again.

921
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I did listen to it twice in a row today, but it's escaping.

922
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
The second to last track on the album where Digi is more singing than rapping, I thought that sounded really nice and really different for him.

923
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And it was really kind of a beautiful song, and I liked it a lot.

924
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The fucking freak power was really cool.

925
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I think my favorite song on the album is one of the ones that I'm on, Paradise.

926
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I just really love the sound of it, and I love the beat.

927
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I love both of our verses.

928
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I think we both did a really good job.

929
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
My least favorite song on the album is probably the other song that I'm on, The Bunker.

930
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Just because it sounds way too much like Rotten, which we already did.

931
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Lyrically and sound-wise, but I still think it's cool, especially since I put Baby Groot in it.

932
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I made that executive decision for Digi to put Baby Groot all over his album to save, to make it a five-star album.

933
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It would have been a four-star. Baby Groot rounded it out.

934
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Sizzwhitescom69 asks,

935
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
My hero.

936
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Fishing? Yeah!

937
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Totally, dude.

938
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah, fishing's okay. I like fishing.

939
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm way more into cat fishing, actually.

940
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
What's the same shit?

941
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm talking about the internet kind.

942
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Oh, god damn it.

943
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm talking about fucking falsifying your identity on the internet.

944
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Yeah, man.

945
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You're not going by your real name, so maybe you already are doing that to all of us.

946
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm cat-fishing everyone. I'm cat-fishing everyone.

947
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
All my patrons have been cat-fished.

948
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Everybody thinks Nate's name is Nate Sainton. He hates it.

949
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
This whole time you've been cat-fishing us.

950
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
We thought you were a Ben, but it turns out you were a has-ben all along.

951
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
No! I walked right into it!

952
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
There's something very... I'll say euphoric, because I'm wearing a fedora right now.

953
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Very euphoric about... you feel like you can connect to your ancestors.

954
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
When you go out and you catch a fish and you fucking fry that baby up and you eat it,

955
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
you get your own food, you don't have to pay for shit.

956
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You just go get it and you eat it.

957
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I used to go... My mom used to take me fishing once.

958
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
She did it a couple times, and we caught some fish, but we never cooked them.

959
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I always kind of wanted to cook.

960
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
We usually just caught these little sunfish that were not big enough to cook.

961
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
We caught a catfish one time.

962
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
One time I caught a fucking sea bass.

963
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
One time I caught a big fucking fucker.

964
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It was more than a foot long.

965
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I didn't eat it.

966
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I wanted to eat it.

967
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I wanted to be like, Mom, can we take this home and cook it and eat it

968
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
and skin it and do all that shit to it?

969
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I was shy about it and didn't want to impose.

970
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I didn't want to ask her to go to all that trouble, so we didn't.

971
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Why do you just throw them back in?

972
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, I just toss them back in.

973
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
It's probably... I don't know if it's true or not, but they say that fish can't feel pain,

974
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
so I was like, fuck it, just throw it back in.

975
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
They don't even know what's going on.

976
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I believe it.

977
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
They say that about lobsters, too.

978
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Well, no, no.

979
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Lobsters apparently can't feel pain.

980
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Also, apparently, if you put a lobster in the freezer, it goes to sleep

981
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and then you can murder it and it doesn't resist.

982
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Man, that's gotta be a lie.

983
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Because it's too convenient that the one animal we cruelly and viciously boil a lie

984
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
just happens to be the one that doesn't feel pain.

985
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That sounds like you don't know, man.

986
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It's trying to make themselves feel better about something horrible they're doing.

987
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I don't know, man. A lobster is basically like an ocean insect.

988
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's just like a big fucking bug.

989
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So I could believe, just looking at it, it looks like something that can't feel pain.

990
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It just looks like a fucking demon robot.

991
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't know, man. When I see those lobsters in the store, in the tank together,

992
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
with their claws tied up, they look like they're in a lot of emotional pain.

993
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I saw on a cooking video a guy, he took a lobster out of his freezer

994
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
where he had kept it so that it would be comatose.

995
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And then he put it down and he just takes his giant knife and just slices it right in half.

996
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Right down its head.

997
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
And it kind of like its tail kind of like curls up and its claws kind of like twitch a little bit.

998
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And then it just like goes slack.

999
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And I was like, oh my god, what have I just witnessed?

1000
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Shit, I can see festivals now. They're everywhere.

1001
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Oh god.

1002
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It was gruesome. It was gruesome.

1003
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah, always wanted to eat those fish, never did.

1004
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Was the question just like the one word question fishing

1005
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
gave us the biggest answer so far?

1006
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yeah, it's important.

1007
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
If you want to ask a good question, just write down a verb with a question mark and see what happens.

1008
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Just throw a spaghetti at the wall and see what it says.

1009
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Hopscotch?

1010
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Hopscotch?

1011
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Let me tell you about if lobsters can feel pain, motherfucker.

1012
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
KH underscore Caligula says,

1013
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
How do you all feel about competitive video games?

1014
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
If any of you do like them, what games do you watch or play?

1015
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
The most stress I ever feel in my whole life is when I jump into a Gen 4 randomized battle on Pokemon Showdown.

1016
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I don't know how anybody likes it. I hate it.

1017
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
The one-on-one battle is like a double battle is a different thing. I think that's more fun.

1018
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But one-on-one, those motherfuckers are just switching the Pokemon every fucking turn

1019
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
without predicting you at every moment.

1020
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's not even fun.

1021
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I get migraines and stress headaches from playing Pokemon Showdown.

1022
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
For a week or two ago, I was on a crazy winning streak on Showdown

1023
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
doing Gen 7 one-on-one randomized battles.

1024
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
My score got way up and then I got fucked up at some point this week

1025
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
and now my score is shit again. I was really sad.

1026
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah, I guess if Pokemon Showdown counts as a competitive game,

1027
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
yeah, I guess I play that.

1028
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I absolutely fucking hate MOBAs.

1029
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I think they're the worst ever.

1030
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I hate them. I would never watch or play them.

1031
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Briefly, some friends of mine tried to get me into League of Legends

1032
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and I played it a little bit.

1033
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I played it a little bit, got kinda good with Warwick.

1034
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I had mostly figured out Warwick and I was like,

1035
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
oh, okay, I'm feeling a little good.

1036
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'm kinda starting to get a couple of kills and doing a little bit,

1037
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
not completely fucking it up for my team.

1038
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And then my friends were like, okay, good, now do that with 40 other characters.

1039
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And I was like, no, no, I won't do that.

1040
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It's not worth it. I hate you.

1041
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Stop yelling at me because I'm not defending the fucking tower or whatever shit.

1042
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And I hate MOBAs. I hate them. I hate them.

1043
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I passionately fucking hate MOBAs.

1044
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I kind of hate all competitive video games.

1045
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I think video games are for cowards.

1046
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I think video games are a waste of time

1047
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and for nerds and bastards and fuck off.

1048
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I really love Mario Party.

1049
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Oh, yeah, me too.

1050
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Like the first two Mario Party games to this day,

1051
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
if you've got three friends, it's the best possible time you can have in life.

1052
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's the best way to stave off the specter of death.

1053
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
You see, because Mario Party is a special thing where it's actually fun,

1054
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
whereas something like League of Legends or Pokemon Showdown,

1055
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
it feels more like a stressful chore to me.

1056
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It doesn't feel like a fun game, but Mario Party and even Mario Kart,

1057
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
it's just whimsical and fun, and I don't wish I was dead the whole time.

1058
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I like fighting on Pokemon Showdown

1059
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
because a match usually only lasts like 10 minutes at the most,

1060
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
or sometimes they go longer,

1061
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
but you play fucking League of Legends and then you boot it up.

1062
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
40 minutes later, you lost,

1063
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and 45 of your precious minutes are gone,

1064
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and I've never had a worse time than when I fucking played League of Legends.

1065
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Oh, Christ.

1066
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm throwing up thinking about it.

1067
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I gotta fucking calm my nerves with this Rockstar, pure zero.

1068
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Do we have any more good questions, or should we call it a day?

1069
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Um, what are we at?

1070
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
What are we at? Well, we're like just...

1071
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
A job about an hour.

1072
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
We should, let's do one more.

1073
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah, let's do one more.

1074
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Oh, this is a great question.

1075
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
One society, from Best Digi Wood,

1076
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
one society has 100 people each with 100 happy points,

1077
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
one society has 1,000 people each with 99 happy points.

1078
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
This sounds like math.

1079
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Wait, what the fuck?

1080
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
What's the question?

1081
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Which is best.

1082
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Wait, is this like a...

1083
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Wait, this is a really stupid quest.

1084
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This is like a failed communism philosophical debate.

1085
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
This is actually not the question I thought it was going to be.

1086
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I thought it was going to say one society has 100 people each with one happy points,

1087
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and another society has 10 people each with 10 happy points.

1088
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So like, the numbers are equivalent, but they're spread over like a bigger amount.

1089
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
No, this is... one society has 10 times more people,

1090
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
but each one is ever so slightly less happy.

1091
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah, of course that one's better.

1092
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah, I mean...

1093
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I think the point...

1094
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Who wants to be 100% happy all the time?

1095
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Do they not see inside out? You need that sadness, people.

1096
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah, even in a society where everyone is equally sad,

1097
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
they can bond over being equally sad and become friends and make each other happier.

1098
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Yeah, it's called the PCP.

1099
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Well, this is a...

1100
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yeah!

1101
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Well, that's a slippery slope.

1102
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
That's a slippery slope because if you can see that 1,000 people with 99 happy points

1103
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
is better than 100 people with 100 happy points,

1104
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
the logical conclusion of that is that ultimately,

1105
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
a million billion people each with only one happy point is the best of all.

1106
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
That's the slippery slope. What are you fucking talking about?

1107
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You went way too far.

1108
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Well, I'm saying because if more people less happy is better.

1109
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
We're comparing two very specific things.

1110
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
We're not comparing some fictional thing you made up.

1111
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Well, I'm just saying that if you keep iterating on this process,

1112
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
if you multiply the amount of people by 10 and subtract 1 out of 100 happy points,

1113
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
eventually you do that 100 times and you eventually hit a point where nobody's happy anymore,

1114
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
even though there's lots of people.

1115
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
You know what I'm saying?

1116
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Yeah.

1117
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I know what you're saying, but I don't see why it's relevant to comparing these two societies.

1118
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm actually going to hold...

1119
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I'm going to say 100 people each with 100 happy points.

1120
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Why would you want to be 100% happy?

1121
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That sounds fucking terrible.

1122
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Being happy is like definitionally a good thing.

1123
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Have you seen inside out, dude?

1124
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
No, I'm not fucking seen inside out.

1125
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
If you're always happy, then that's not a good thing.

1126
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You need the sadness to actually be a human being.

1127
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I don't want to be a human being.

1128
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I want to be a joy bot.

1129
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You want to be an immortal fucking robot.

1130
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I want to be an immortal robot that feels nothing but happiness

1131
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
and is loved and adored throughout time and all.

1132
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Do you want to just get tired of it eventually?

1133
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
No, you wouldn't because I'm programmed not to.

1134
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm too simple for this question.

1135
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I'm but a humble man of the earth.

1136
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
This is too abstract.

1137
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I don't know.

1138
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Who wants...

1139
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
100 people is enough.

1140
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
100 people is enough.

1141
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
If I was always happy all the time,

1142
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
not only would the people around me get annoyed,

1143
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
but I would just get bored.

1144
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
No, you'd never be bored because you'd be happy.

1145
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Do you like the people who are always super

1146
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
like chipper and happy all the time?

1147
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Fuck those people.

1148
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I don't want to be living with 99 of them around me.

1149
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Fuck that.

1150
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Hang on.

1151
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
The question stipulates that you are...

1152
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I think the question stipulates

1153
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
these people are happy.

1154
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
These people are not getting annoyed by one another

1155
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
being happy. They like it.

1156
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Yeah, I can because it says

1157
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
people have 100 happy points.

1158
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I can be annoyed by people and still be happy.

1159
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I guess.

1160
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Wait.

1161
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
You can be annoyed by people and still be happy?

1162
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Bullshit.

1163
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
How dare you lie to me in such a fashion?

1164
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Can we be done?

1165
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I don't want to talk about these happy points.

1166
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I want to fucking go to bed.

1167
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Alright, alright.

1168
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Okay, here's one.

1169
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Who's the sexiest beetle?

1170
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Ringo.

1171
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Hang on. Let me look up a picture

1172
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
because I think I know the one...

1173
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I think I know the one that's the sexiest.

1174
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You know, I've listened to the beetles.

1175
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I respect them as artists and as men.

1176
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
But they all look and sound

1177
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
exactly the fucking same to me.

1178
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I cannot tell any of them apart.

1179
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Oh, hang on.

1180
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
What's the one where they're walking

1181
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
across the street?

1182
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
The savvy road.

1183
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

1184
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
The...

1185
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I don't know, the third one.

1186
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
The one in the gray.

1187
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah, that's Ringo.

1188
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah, I guess Ringo. I don't know.

1189
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
The other ones kind of look like hobos.

1190
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Maybe George Harrison had a mustache

1191
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
sometimes.

1192
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, I think.

1193
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah, I don't...

1194
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I mean, I know what John Lennon looks like

1195
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and the other three I'm like,

1196
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I can't remember which one's which.

1197
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Yeah, that's my answer.

1198
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
That was a shitty question, dude.

1199
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Here's one that I don't want to answer.

1200
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Well, I'm sorry. Here's a...

1201
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Do the best I can with what I got.

1202
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
A favorite obscure piece of media

1203
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
that you don't talk about that much.

1204
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Oh, huh.

1205
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And I have an answer for this

1206
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
that I do want to talk about.

1207
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's, you know, this is an old show

1208
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
that used to be on G4,

1209
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
the old video game network

1210
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
when they had that before it went...

1211
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Attack the show.

1212
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
This was a show...

1213
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Stop it!

1214
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
This is a show that I think

1215
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
was very influential to the kind of videos

1216
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
that I ended up making.

1217
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It was a show called Portal

1218
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah, I remember Portal.

1219
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

1220
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I remember wanting to like it

1221
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
but not having anything

1222
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
to like about it.

1223
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I don't really remember

1224
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
what its deal was.

1225
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It started out

1226
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
like a regular, like a video game,

1227
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
like a review and a tips show

1228
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
for MMOs, like teaching you how to play

1229
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and teaching you how good they all are,

1230
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
like MMORPGs and like the Sims and stuff,

1231
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
like computer games and stuff.

1232
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
But occasionally he would start

1233
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
putting in like these

1234
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
skits and these wacky characters

1235
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
using the game engines, like

1236
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
sort of like a rooster teeth

1237
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
kind of thing, like the red and blue or whatever.

1238
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
These wacky characters and these skits

1239
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and eventually the skits

1240
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and the characters would become so

1241
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
intricate and like interconnected

1242
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
that by the time you got to Season 2

1243
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
the reviews and the tips

1244
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and tricks aspect of it was completely gone

1245
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and it was just like a narrative show.

1246
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Like the saga of this guy

1247
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
and all of his wacky friends in these computer games

1248
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
and there was like a story and like

1249
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
an overarching plot and a bad guy

1250
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and it was really fucking cool.

1251
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It was the best show ever. Portal on G4.

1252
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Look it up. You can watch the whole series on YouTube.

1253
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It's awesome.

1254
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
One time I was watching Portal

1255
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
and my dad came in

1256
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
and was like, hey what are you watching?

1257
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And I said Portal and I remember that

1258
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
he thought that I said porn

1259
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and

1260
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
like he didn't even like do any

1261
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I think he like laughed

1262
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
like maybe he thought I was joking or something

1263
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I don't know but I remember

1264
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
my dad thought I said I was watching porn

1265
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
What?

1266
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It was weird.

1267
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Fuck it.

1268
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Mom can you got any obscure shit?

1269
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah, there's a little known

1270
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
YouTube channel I really like called Psy

1271
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
about this guy who

1272
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
talks about video games.

1273
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
There's a podcast I really love

1274
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
that's been going on for like 10 or 11 years

1275
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
that gets overshadowed by other

1276
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
podcasts in a similar

1277
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
genre.

1278
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's called The Flop House. It's about these

1279
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
three friends, two of which

1280
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
were the head writers on The Daily Show

1281
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
during John Stewart's peak

1282
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
like the best part so these are funny guys

1283
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and they just every other week they'll watch

1284
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
a bad movie. The show is called The Flop House

1285
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
if I didn't say The Flop House.

1286
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
They'll watch a bad movie and then they'll talk about it

1287
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and you know it's a very simple premise but since these guys are so

1288
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
funny and they've been friends for so long

1289
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
and there's all these inside jokes that

1290
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
get established as the show goes on

1291
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
it's just a great

1292
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
90 minutes out of my week

1293
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
every other week and I really like it so

1294
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
if you need something to listen to

1295
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
to hear three schmucks make fun of a movie

1296
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'd say go check out The Flop House.

1297
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Shit.

1298
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Sick dog.

1299
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
For me

1300
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I'm sure I could probably think

1301
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
of more but

1302
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
the first thing that pops

1303
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
to my mind is a

1304
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
porn actually. It's a

1305
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
hentai manga that I read years ago

1306
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
and I never forgot about it.

1307
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
The Vapors by Benson.

1308
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And I've never

1309
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
heard anyone talk about it although

1310
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
there are some memes from it that float around

1311
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and

1312
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
it's called

1313
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Seiso Tsuidansha

1314
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
which is hard to remember which is probably

1315
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
why I don't see it mentioned very often

1316
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and it's like

1317
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
a couple chapters long

1318
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and it's mostly like

1319
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
femdom, it's kind of like a bunch of

1320
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
mean girls bully this guy

1321
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
which is not something that I'm really into

1322
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
but the reason I like Seiso Tsuidansha

1323
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
so much is that it's really funny

1324
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
like it's really fucking hilarious

1325
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
as well as being sexy

1326
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
so

1327
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I guess that's my

1328
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
obscure thing that I like

1329
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
and fuck everyone else

1330
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
it's got

1331
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
it's iconic, it's got some iconic moments

1332
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
but I won't spoil it

1333
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I don't want to see this

1334
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
just send me a link so I know how to avoid

1335
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
ever going to the website

1336
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
we'll do

1337
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I'll know if I ever see this website

1338
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I shouldn't click on it

1339
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
just do it right now so you don't forget

1340
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
later on I really want to make sure

1341
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I don't click on this

1342
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
here we go

1343
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm off

1344
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
let's see

1345
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
let's see

1346
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
what the

1347
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
favorite

1348
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
YouTube fiction series

1349
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
this is from Duffraven

1350
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
413

1351
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I don't know

1352
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
if this counts as YouTube fiction

1353
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
maybe I'm

1354
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
stretching the definition

1355
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
but I really really liked

1356
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
the Yogscast

1357
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Shadow of Israel

1358
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
series

1359
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
it's a Minecraft let's play

1360
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
but

1361
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
the game is being

1362
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
changed and edited behind

1363
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
the players backs

1364
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
to create this story

1365
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
that they have to adventure through

1366
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
and

1367
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
it's like a let's play

1368
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
but it's being run

1369
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
by outside people

1370
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
who are sort of like

1371
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
they're sort of like dungeon mastering it

1372
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
and like it's sort of being

1373
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
they're sort of being walked through this like

1374
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
fiction scenario

1375
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
so I don't know if that counts but

1376
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
that one's really really cool

1377
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and I love it

1378
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
wait fiction series

1379
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
on YouTube

1380
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
we can't say me and Jess's shows

1381
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
because those are non-fiction

1382
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
those are the actual accounts

1383
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
of our inner demons

1384
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
true stories of our real actual lives

1385
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
both inner and

1386
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
stories of our inner and outer struggles

1387
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
right

1388
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I don't know if it was originally on

1389
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
YouTube but the Brad Neely

1390
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
the Brad Neely Baby Cakes

1391
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
and like Professor Brothers videos

1392
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I guess those would be considered YouTube fiction

1393
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
so those are like

1394
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
way high on my list as like

1395
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
favorite things ever not just on YouTube

1396
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
this might be a loose definition but

1397
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
since we're talking about YouTube fiction

1398
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I'm gonna talk about a Christian

1399
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
singer since obviously

1400
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Christianity's fiction

1401
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
you guys remember making a murderer

1402
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
about that guy who

1403
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
was made into a murderer?

1404
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
no?

1405
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
well it's this big phenomenon on Netflix

1406
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
about this guy who was set up for a crime

1407
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
that he didn't commit and he's like still in prison

1408
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
but his brother is a man named

1409
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Brad Dassie

1410
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and I advise every single person listening

1411
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
in a home to go check this out because

1412
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Brad Dassie is a musician

1413
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
rapper he's like this 40 year old white guy

1414
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
who

1415
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I'm not gonna say he has

1416
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
no talent I'm gonna say

1417
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
he is exceptionally

1418
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
entertaining in a multitude of ways

1419
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
my favorite song by him

1420
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
is called I'm coming home

1421
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
everybody please go search I'm coming home

1422
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Brad Dassie take a listen

1423
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
post a comment saying the PCP

1424
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
sent you there because it's a real treat

1425
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
it's a great song don't listen to the new one

1426
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
he put up a remix it's terrible

1427
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
listen to the one that was put up 5 or 6 years ago

1428
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
he also has a

1429
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
rap song called they didn't do it

1430
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
about how his brother was

1431
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
set up for the murder in the show making a murderer

1432
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and the lyrics go

1433
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
he didn't do it he didn't do it

1434
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
the cops poking around in a minute

1435
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
he didn't do it and he just

1436
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
we all sat for 4 minutes and it's very passionate

1437
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
and I hope his brother

1438
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
gets out of prison soon because he's gonna blow a gasket

1439
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and also he is

1440
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
he is a lot of songs about

1441
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
his relationship with Jesus

1442
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
it's very interesting go check out

1443
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Brad Dassie music

1444
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
yeah

1445
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I don't know if it's technically fiction

1446
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
or if it's kind of like

1447
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
sort of semi-fiction

1448
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I don't know what the deal is but there's this

1449
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
underground channel called Furnace Room

1450
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
it's very

1451
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
about this guy

1452
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
he's trapped in a Furnace Room

1453
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000

01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
just click on it and then

1456
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
skip to the last 10 seconds because that's the best part

1457
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
the videos are only

1458
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
10 seconds long

1459
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
well the out shows are the best

1460
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
it's what I'm clicking on

1461
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
