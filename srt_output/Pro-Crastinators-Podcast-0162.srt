00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello everyone and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm back, and the fun is over!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm the best guy ever. And also we're joined by Gibbontake. Hippocrit.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey guys, belljapes finished and there's a fucking Kickstarter. We're going to talk about that later.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, that's right. Please, please, please.com.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Was that not done when they last spoke, but like it was going to be listenable by them?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But now it's out and we've all read it, at least I have. I read the whole thing.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Of course.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Great shit, great shit. Ben Saint is here.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Woo! I fucked up last episode.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Also.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Very embarrassingly, unlike Hippo, who's got his shit together, last episode I said,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
guys, when you hear this episode, there will be one of the Vaporettes from the first Vapor's book will be published on the website.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I just forgot it was Friday and forgot to do it.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But it's there now. And for real this time, when you hear this episode, there actually will be a second one.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So there will be two by the time you listen to this one.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
At stcomics.com slash something, hit fucking whatever, go to my Twitter to find the direct link.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Very fantastic.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We got Munchie. Munchie's here.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Nate?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're going to have to answer some fucking questions.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm ready.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now or later?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Later.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And did you, bro, is here.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Soon, soon, your time will come.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey, I'm awake at 1pm on a Sunday.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Imagine that.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What better thing could I possibly be doing?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You know, I've been sleeping a lot lately as a result of massive exhaustion from, you know, me and Mavva2,

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
which should be done by the time you hear this PCP, everyone.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes, it's after the end of May, but you know what, 31 days, whatever.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm doing my best.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Those were the questions.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How could this possibly fucking happen?

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, you had more time, did you not?

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought we talked about this on the show that you had more time.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I did have more time, that's correct.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wait, are we talking about the me and Mavva being late?

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Because there happens to be a very prominent X factor in this equation.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's one major thing that's different between Nate's life two years ago and Nate's life today.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I wonder what could possibly be delaying me and Mavva.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you saying that getting a girlfriend ruined best guy F?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just saying that he drives her to and from work.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That is accurate.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Wait a minute, were you single a year ago?

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, that was two years ago, me and Mavva2.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I actually met Michelle as a direct consequence of me and Mavva1 as it would happen.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's right, it was two years ago.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You either die a fan or live long enough to see yourself become the girlfriend.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I am fully prepared to engage on this topic because I couldn't agree more.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's true, so I started at the beginning of this month, so here's the thing.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to talk about this in the final episode of me and Mavva, but whatever, I don't mind.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I had more time because I hoped to be done with my job and have left it.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But because of the particular situation of my job, I suck my own dick a little bit.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm kind of an important member of a particular team, and if I'd gone, they would have been fucked.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So they asked me to stay.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Normally, you give them two weeks, I give them a month.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
They asked for three months, basically, is how it worked out.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I was just like, you know what, these guys did me right.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And frankly, if things don't go so great as a YouTuber, I'm going to come crawling back.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So I'm going to plant some seeds, plant some seeds.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sure, I get that.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They're paying me for half-time work, and I'm working more like two-thirds work.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's how it's shaped out.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So yes, I have a couple more hours in the day to do stuff.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Did you say you're working half as much and they're paying you two-thirds as much?

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They're paying me half as much.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
My pay was slashed by half.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
However, the way it's shaken out, I'm actually working more than half.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's kind of...

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So they gave you a pay cut because you put in your resignation?

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, because I'm working supposedly half-time, which is, you know, how it's supposed to work out.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But then you end up working unpaid overtime?

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I mean, that's, yes, that is what's happening, yes.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Which is, I mean, I'm not thrilled about it, but the thing was already with my job.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My job already had it.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Fair.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, you know what's interesting about my job?

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
After years of, I don't know, I guess I'd call it high performance and then being happy,

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I actually got into a category where I got a monetary bonus per quarter based on an evaluation of my job.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So there was an incentive.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If I did extra work and they were happy with me, I did get paid more.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I mean, it's kind of funny to think, frankly, compared to my YouTube earnings as my side gig,

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it was like a drop in the bucket, which is like a second career entirely.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But it was extra money if I did better.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So that was nice.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But the point is, yes, I had a few extra hours to work, not a ton, but some.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But that would balance out the Michelle driving.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The relationship factor.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
To treat it as coldly, callously, robotically, heartlessly, demonically as possible.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Which you do every day in your life, so it's no way out of character for you.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Correct, correct.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The fact of the matter is a relationship does in fact take time and energy.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I'd be lying if I didn't kind of wistfully remember the kind of pure robotic autistic dedication

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to being able to simply sit down, block out every other need and concern,

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and simply generate, you know, video.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And now I have at least one human relationship.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I cannot avoid, you know, investing time into it.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I wish you could see the fucking smile on my face.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm so smug about this.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Inarguably, it is a nightmare, Nate.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Indeed.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, why did you?

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why are you so smug?

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just because you gave everybody so much shit about having a girlfriend

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and that you got one and all the same things happened.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, I mean, I just want to say, do you remember the days when, like, Digi would mention Mae

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and you would vanguard, you would leave the charge of, like,

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
listen to this guy on top of bringing up your girlfriend again.

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And then he brings up his girlfriend on, like, every PCP episode.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He did, Nate.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're worse than Digi was about it then.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hang on.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Are we just ignoring the fact that, like, in this example,

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
she's being purely brought up in a negative sense

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
as, like, the detriment that she's causing?

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, sure.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
As long as you're shitting on her, then it's okay.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, in this case, I brought her up, so it's different.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But, yeah, there you go.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There you go.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's just, it's hilarious because I know that it doesn't matter.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Like, there's no way for you to ever have to be...

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I know I was accepting the devil's pact here, people,

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
by getting into a relationship.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't think it's typical.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm accepting the losses.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, no, that's what makes it so great, is that...

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We're just saying how the ables have turned, how the ables have turned.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You will never feel, um, you will never feel, like, embarrassed

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
or offended if I point these things out,

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
because you're just gonna be like, yeah, it's exactly true.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've become the beast that I was, uh...

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, that's right.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Making fun of all this time.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm just a bad man now, you know?

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You know, I think the difference about me...

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Failed masculinity at its peak.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There are some aspects of life where I think other people reject this,

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
but I just embrace being a bad person.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
For example, pirating video games and movies and software and music.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Other people make arguments for why it's acceptable.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I make no such argument.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I accept the fact that I am a bad person for doing so.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now, that's it.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now, on the one hand, I respect that.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Actually, no, on both hands, I respect that.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Be a bad person.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, that's fair.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I mean, I guess one should aspire to be a good person, so...

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm completely with you.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I have completely embraced that.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just, you know, do what I want to do,

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and you can make value judgments about it.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not going to, you know?

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll just be like, uh, bad, good?

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What are these words?

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm just doing me.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's an interesting, uh...

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know, paradox isn't the right word.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When you get a girlfriend, you do have less time for work,

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and you spend that time with your girlfriend.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But your time, I don't know...

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's a quality of life investment, right?

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's better.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like, your life is better, necessarily.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, that's insane.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I feel like it's almost, I don't know,

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
it is good to force yourself to experience pleasure,

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
because if we're up to us, we would just not do it.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
At least I would.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There have been multiple times, very recently,

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
where if it were up to me,

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I would have just worked tirelessly

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and wanted to kill myself.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So in a way, yes, work was delayed,

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and in fact, I was doing things that I could have finished.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I was going to finish it in this work.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I haven't done it yet, because I was with my girlfriend.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But when I say the time has been misspent,

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
no, because I had a great time.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I feel like I have improved my life.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This week, I've worked less,

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because I've been spending time with my girlfriend,

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Monty.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It came me, yeah.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Exactly.

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Exactly.

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But on this front, though,

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I do want to say that obviously,

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I make all these, these are not jokes,

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
these are real consequences of investing in a relationship,

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
but I do think that it's a net positive,

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and I'm happy to be doing it and whatnot.

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, yeah.

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I mean, everything that could be said.

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Wait, wait, wait.

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Flash, flash cut to Michelle,

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
sitting on a beach somewhere,

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
whatever she does in her spare time,

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
with her paper.

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
With her divorce papers in hand.

211
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And she goes, oh, he thinks I'm a net positive

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and starts shredding the papers.

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Everyone should think they're a net positive.

214
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No one's perfect.

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Everyone has negatives.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's the highest problem that I can do.

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm saying she puts her hand over her heart

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and says he says I'm a net positive.

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, good.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Good.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But I did want to say, though.

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, I just want to say that this doesn't, you know,

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
exclusively apply to relationships

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in the sense of, like, romantically.

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I mean, this happens for friends.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean, as Ben just said, it happens with me.

229
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm over here in Boston,

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
so we're obviously hanging out more.

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, I mean, I'm sure the productivity

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
has extremely just dropped off the face of the earth

233
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
because I met him for, like, combined,

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
like, 10 hours total.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Absolutely.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
However, I would never claim that you are a net positive,

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
you know what I'm saying?

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, hey.

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
My final point.

240
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So, I mean, look, I can hide behind the shield

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
of, like, my job and Michelle, you know,

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
like, girlfriend time.

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And plus, my dog also takes time.

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So, that's another factor.

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A dog also takes, you know,

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
you have to walk him and whatever.

247
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But the real thing is...

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You have to love him.

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You have to love him.

250
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I mean, yeah.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The real unadulterated truth

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
is that I have made many mistakes in this Weagawa,

253
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I mean, in this Miyamafava.

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Look like that mistake, for instance.

255
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, like that one.

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I mean, just, it has been more than anything,

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
just me getting sloppy and getting...

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Look, I was on track with Miyamafava

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
until day, like, 21 or 22.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And it was at that point.

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So, the thing that happened was, like...

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So, okay, there's two major things that caused me to fuck up.

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
One was, I accepted the thing that I had never accepted

264
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
with Miyamafava 1.

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And that was, I accepted being able to go to sleep

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
before posting a video the next morning.

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I said that this is something I'm going to allow myself to do.

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That was my first and biggest mistake.

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Doing that allowed me to get lazy and sloppy.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I should not have done it.

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I should have just chug coffee and got it done

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and then slept the one or two hours that were left.

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But the other thing beyond that is that I...

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think because of this initial weakness I allowed myself,

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
this mental weakness that crept into my mind,

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I then, when I got, like, a copyright strike

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
on my Point Break video,

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that got me a little bit upset and fucked up.

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was like, no, my perfect, like, plan day-dive-day

280
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
isn't going to work.

281
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And then the next day's plan was to release the Miyamafava theme,

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
which is ready to go.

283
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And the thing is, right now, it's sitting in copyright hell.

284
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It cannot go live on YouTube.

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And it's in the, like...

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's in the secondary stage of copyright fight

287
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
where, like, I'll get a strike if I lose.

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And so, like, the reality of that video just...

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I prepared it.

290
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It has a little bit of fancy editing.

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's got the song.

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I did a bunch of stuff.

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's ready to go.

294
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And seeing that that video just wasn't able to post,

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I was like, okay, well, there goes the video for today.

296
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And then as a result of, like, the next day or two,

297
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was just kind of fucked up and, like,

298
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't know what I'm gonna...

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, I'll just...

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It was so...

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is all on me.

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
100%.

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I just let things get to me and got off schedule and whatnot.

305
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But it was that initial weakness.

306
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Because what I should have done is...

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You should have said, I ain't gonna let it get to me.

308
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm still gonna creep.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah.

310
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Down in Pumpkin Hill, I got to find my lost feet.

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I know that it's here.

312
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I sense it in my feet.

313
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think I'm gonna...

314
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Great inworld power allows me to feel.

315
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah.

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There's no excuse for me not being, like,

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
posted a video.

318
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It didn't go up.

319
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, I'll just make another video right now in the next,

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
like, I don't know, hour or so.

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's what I should have done.

322
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And I didn't do it.

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And it's my fault.

324
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So I'm late.

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And that sucks.

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I don't know.

327
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm also kind of wondering how upset I should be with myself.

328
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But not at all, because nobody gives a shit.

329
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, nobody gives a shit.

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm more upset with myself.

331
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When I did the August video series, like,

332
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
my takeaway was that I was mad at myself for taking it so seriously.

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That, like...

334
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Really?

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because I tried to get...

336
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I got every single video out before midnight.

337
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And there was no point at which I had said I was gonna do that,

338
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
or when that was, like, in the promise.

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The promise was only really to my patrons.

340
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Nobody was even...

341
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Nobody had really made bets on it.

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Like, there wasn't really much at stake.

343
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If I had made them late, or if I had, you know,

344
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
taken more time for myself.

345
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It was just like...

346
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I just imposed it on myself because I felt like I had to do something really crazy

347
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
because I really needed money.

348
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it did make me some money, but like, I didn't...

349
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know, you know, if money was the goal,

350
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it needed to be pitched better, it needed to be more planned out.

351
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I came up with the idea for a very last minute.

352
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like, literally, like, 8 o'clock PM on July 31st.

353
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I did tons of planning, but I fumbled the execution opposite of you.

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, if I am allowed to pull a Nate in hell,

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
ringing that bell, best guy ever, real quick,

356
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and play devil's advocate,

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I just want to say, isn't the whole point of BMFA to be like,

358
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
guys, or this one specifically, like, guys, it's really happening.

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm going to be a professional YouTuber.

360
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can expect this level of dedication to me,

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and I will deliver videos on time,

362
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and you know, this is big glory, like, hyping up me as an AirNet creator,

363
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and that you failed to deliver that.

364
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Would that not mean that it's like, oh, well,

365
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
he couldn't even do this, like, initial, like, high promotional thing?

366
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Would that not be a failure there?

367
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, you know what...

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Now, okay, I mean, I would understand people making that criticism.

369
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I would argue that this Miimath of a...

370
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I mean, if you watch the original pitch video,

371
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the thing is, I should have done this and mostly intended to do it,

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
but I leaned a lot less on the idea of, like, getting one video out per day.

373
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Now, I mean, maybe that's a cop-out.

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Everyone fucking knows what it means.

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's supposed to be one video per day.

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But, I mean, I don't know.

377
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't think it's gonna matter.

378
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
A long-term, no. No one's gonna care.

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But a lot of people are already comparing it to Miimath of a one.

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I have reached a point in my career where I literally don't have any fucking idea,

381
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
like, what's going through the heads of anyone who watches me anymore.

382
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like, I don't really understand the mentality of people consuming my content

383
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
because, like, there's the people who talk to you,

384
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and that makes up such a small percentage.

385
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like, even in my patron discord, like, I have a thousand patrons.

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There's maybe 30, 40 people who talk in the discord.

387
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So, like, I can talk to them and kind of act like, oh, this is...

388
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I have a sense of what my fans care about, but not really.

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's just those people who hang out in the discord.

390
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And there's all these other patrons who I don't know what the hell they want or care about.

391
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't know how many of them are watching each different type of video.

392
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You know, I try to make multiple channels, multiple styles,

393
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and, like, a lot of my videos aren't even getting pushed to my audience

394
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
or nobody's clicking on them.

395
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You know, I've got way more subs than the amount of views I get on average.

396
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And I just keep asking.

397
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like, I've gotten to a point where I just pull my readers or listeners and stuff or whatever,

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and I just say, like, why didn't you watch this video?

399
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like, I did that.

400
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I put out this hour-long Utana video,

401
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and I did it because that was, like, the most requested show I had gotten.

402
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Anytime I ask, like, hey, what anime would you like to see me cover the most?

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The one I get the most is Utana.

404
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So I put, like, I made a video.

405
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's got less than 20,000 views after a couple of days.

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Damn.

407
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, God.

408
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And, like, that's not too surprising because it's an hour-long.

409
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's about an old show that not that many people have seen.

410
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I just thought that because the show has been more hyped over the years,

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
more people, you know, people specifically wanted me to talk about it.

412
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Maybe I see it on Twitter.

413
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Maybe I see references to it on Twitter.

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
His mid-sentence.

415
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Ben, no, kill yourself.

416
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, no.

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, well, Ben's right.

418
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It is on Twitter.

419
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's what I thought, too.

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And, again, like, it gets requested a lot, but I put out this video.

421
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It doesn't get that many views.

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I put out a Twitter poll and I said, hey, have you watched my new Utana video yet?

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If not, why?

424
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And the options were I haven't seen Utana.

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't care about Utana.

426
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's too damn long or I haven't gotten to it yet.

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And the majority was I haven't seen Utana or don't care about it.

428
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Like, 60% was I haven't seen the show.

429
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I'm like, OK, that's not necessarily surprising to me because I know that not that many people

430
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
have watched it.

431
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's just so weird that that is the overwhelming majority of what I get if I ask people what

432
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I should cover.

433
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But it just means most of my audience isn't answering.

434
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You know, Digi, you're so right.

435
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This phenomenon of the vocal minority is so prevalent in, like, the YouTube comments

436
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
sections and the kind of feedback we get when, I mean, I don't know, I don't know if it's

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
cynical or anything.

438
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But the things to listen to really are the total viewership numbers you get, the like-like-to-dislike

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
ratio, and of course, like, the amount of Patreon support one gets.

440
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The thing about that is, yeah, and it gets weird, though, when the Patreons make stuff

441
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
in it because sometimes you might make something that gets a shitload of views, but your patrons

442
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
don't really care about it or vice versa.

443
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Right.

444
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You know, I make tons of stuff that gets no views, but it's the patron's favorite.

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So like, for me, ultimately, it just comes down to don't fucking listen to anybody.

446
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Like, just do whatever I want and market it in a way that makes sense to me.

447
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There's a gut instinct.

448
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's the only thing that's ever worked, and I know the data better than anybody else does,

449
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
because every time I open my mouth about anything, I get a thousand people telling me their idea

450
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
of what I can do to fix it, and always it's missing something.

451
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's always like, yeah, like, that would be a good idea if not for this other element to

452
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it, and like, you guys don't know all the data that I have, so like, there's no victory

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
here.

454
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I've just got to do my own thing and try to figure it out, you know?

455
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, it's-

456
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
There's no victory here.

457
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I feel quite anxious sometimes, like, whether or not to post my Patreon on certain things

458
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
that I do, because the Patreon, I mean, it's changed, like, hands in a sense.

459
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Like, it used to be for pony compilations or analysis or whatever.

460
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Now it's- then it was for hypocrite videos, but now I don't really shill it on things

461
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
like my Red Man comics, or like, my, uh, Bale J, or whatever, uh, because it feels like

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I should make a separate Patreon for those things, because I know that if I post certain

463
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
things on the Patreon, I mean, it's a monthly thing.

464
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I just need to, like, advertise it more.

465
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But, like, it's kind of weird.

466
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's kind of hard to, like, market yourself as, yes, this is me, and this is- I do lots

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
of different things, and if you like any one of them, uh, pledge.

468
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It sounds like how I heard the Osterios Patreon described of it just support this

469
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
internet man doing internet things.

470
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I mean, that's kind of- I don't know whether that's, like, it's- I don't know whether

471
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
for me, specifically, that's, like, quite, uh, you know, a good, uh, idea.

472
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, not a good idea, but, like, uh, it's a hard sell, because the things I've done

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
are not similar, like, comics and YouTube reviews are a little different.

474
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah, I mean, it depends on whether the audience is there for a specific piece of content

475
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
or for the creator, and that's- that's another place where it hook- like, it confuses me

476
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
because I always follow creators.

477
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Like, I per- just if- if somebody makes something good, I follow that person because I expect

478
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
them to be able to make other things that are good.

479
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It doesn't seem like most people really think that way, and I guess that's obvious,

480
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
because, like, most people don't base what they watch on, like, knowing directors or

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
knowing, you know, staff members, but, like, that's entirely how I consume media.

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So, like, to me, if I were to make, like, a separate channel that's about some other

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
subject, like, if any of you made a separate channel, I'm going to follow all of them,

484
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
obviously, and it's not just because you're my friends, it's because I expect anything

485
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you make to be good, so, like, it's a given.

486
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, I'm going to follow that other channel.

487
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Most people don't think that way.

488
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Subscribe to the news update for piece of shit tabloid news by a deceptive evil man,

489
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Johnny News.

490
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And, like, I've come to realize the only way you can get people to care about your

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
other thing is you just have to, like, fucking shill it constantly.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Like, I think YMS is the only person I've ever seen who, like, launched a secondary

493
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
channel and built it up from nothing over, like, the period of, like, a year and a half

494
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
with this gaming channel, because he advertised it at the end of every single video

495
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
until it had steam.

496
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And, like, when IAMgames launched, I had advertised it as, like, I had put it at the

497
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
end of a couple videos, I had put it at the very beginning of one called What is Deep,

498
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
which is a video I wrote just so I could put an IAMgames promo in it.

499
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I did a video announcing, like, my Tales of video on the main channel.

500
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And, like, at that point, I was like, okay, surely I've done enough.

501
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Like, I've mentioned it a bunch of times, I started getting comments of people telling

502
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
me to shut up about it, so I'm like, okay, this must be good enough.

503
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It never, it didn't amount to that many subscribers.

504
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like, it didn't push people to the channel.

505
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The videos still aren't getting a lot, and so the question becomes, like, okay, well,

506
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
is it that people aren't interested in the content, or is it that I haven't promoted

507
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
it enough?

508
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So, my latest video, I just did one on Metroid Prime.

509
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I posted it to IAMgames 13 hours ago, and on there it has 1.8 thousand views.

510
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I posted it to my main channel, opening with an advert for IAMgames three hours ago,

511
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and it has 5.3 thousand views.

512
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So, clearly-

513
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Makes sense.

514
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense because I have way more subs, but it's just like, why is

515
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
there no follow through?

516
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Like, why are people not, like, why are they watching it and not saying, okay, now I want

517
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
to go sub to IAMgames?

518
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I just don't understand the way people think.

519
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think it's like the thing my parents used to tell me about eating your greens.

520
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You have to put an unfamiliar food in front of a child who will not eat it, like a thousand

521
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
times, or maybe not a thousand times, but like a hundred times before they will start

522
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
to try it out of curiosity.

523
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's true.

524
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,840
It needs to be an overwhelming amount because it needs to be something that they can expect

526
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,840
to appear and that they will like brush off, like, almost as like a routine, like, oh yeah,

527
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
they're talking about this at the end of the video, whatever.

528
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
You're fucking totally right.

529
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
That's true.

530
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,720
Like, I should not have let myself be, like, again, vocal minorities, and like, I'm somebody

531
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,840
who falls for it really bad, like, if somebody leaves a comment about something and I, like,

532
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,240
in any way agree with it, I'll just do what it says.

533
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Like this Utana video, I did it as a YouTube premiere because somebody said, hey, you should

534
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,040
do a premiere for, like, your next big analysis video that might, you know, help it to get

535
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
more attention.

536
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
And I was like, that sounds like a good idea.

537
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Crazy suggestion.

538
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
So I premiered it.

539
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,440
Premier seemed to go fairly well, you know, there's a chat, it was fun.

540
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,880
But first of all, lots of negative comments about premieres, like lots of people who were

541
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,720
pissed off because they hate the premiere function.

542
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,920
I don't understand that.

543
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,640
People literally, like, don't understand what a premiere is and they just, like, get confused

544
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
by it.

545
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
It's so weird to me.

546
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,360
Every time I do a premiere, there's people in the chat like, oh, is this happening live?

547
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Like they think it's live.

548
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,200
A lot of people were mad because they clicked on it and it wasn't the video.

549
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
Like they don't notice it says premiere until they click on it.

550
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,000
And then they get pissed off because they're not going to see it live.

551
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,560
And it's just like the feeling of having missed out on it causes them to not want to watch

552
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
it at all.

553
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,120
Like they get mad that they missed the premiere and then they're like, fuck it.

554
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,920
But apparently it also is really bad for you.

555
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,200
Apparently there's tons of YouTubers who have reported that it fucks up the launch of the

556
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,120
video once it actually does launch.

557
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,960
And like it doesn't repost to people's sub boxes and a bunch of people just completely

558
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
miss it.

559
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,920
Like the view counts always go to complete shit.

560
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,480
People will do a premiere of a video, unlist it, re-upload it and get better views from

561
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,440
the second upload than they did from the initial one.

562
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,560
So apparently it's just kind of fucking broken and a bunch of people have talked about it

563
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
and I didn't know.

564
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,400
It seems that way because with the quickdraw server channel where we post the art things

565
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,880
that used to, you know, the drawcasts move over to the...

566
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,240
Hey, yeah, wait, hold on.

567
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,880
Before you continue on with the story about it, I don't think people know that people

568
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,360
ask sometimes like, where's the drawcast?

569
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
It's over there.

570
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
It only went somewhere.

571
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,520
It didn't go anywhere if you know what I'm trying to say.

572
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,440
It's still happening under a new name and it's on another channel, a separate channel

573
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,480
called Quickdraw and you can do it and there are like three episodes soon before.

574
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,520
You're going to have to mention that on every episode of this show from now on.

575
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Yeah, that's true.

576
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
That's true.

577
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Yeah, guess so.

578
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Link in the description to the Quickdraw.

579
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Go.

580
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,240
The problem with this is we all do a lot of stuff.

581
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,160
So it's like the thought of trying to bog down our show by literally just listing everything

582
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,360
we're doing every single time.

583
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
And yet like...

584
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
That's true, sister.

585
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
You said it.

586
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,560
There's something about Pumpk and every single time he mentions it, there's somebody who's

587
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,280
like, I've never heard of Pumpk before and it's like, ouch.

588
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
That was from Homestuck?

589
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Yeah.

590
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,560
I saw that comic.

591
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
That was funny.

592
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
What a legend.

593
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,280
Anyway, were you saying anything about the Quickdraw premieres?

594
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,760
Well, yeah, the Quickdraw premieres seem to have like a very small view count compared

595
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,320
to the amount of people who liked the drawcast and are in the server even.

596
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,920
But maybe it is just that people don't know on the PCP channel that it has moved.

597
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,520
But I feel like if it wasn't a premier, it may even be getting more views than it is.

598
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Yeah, maybe, Doug.

599
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
I don't know.

600
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
Might be worth trying.

601
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,120
The thing is, is that I just like the idea of a premier because I would certainly like

602
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
to...

603
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,440
I enjoy seeing premieres when I do.

604
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,040
I like seeing like, oh, hey, there's going to be premier in like two days.

605
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
I think I'm going to catch that.

606
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,960
That sounds like a fun time.

607
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
All right.

608
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Maybe for you.

609
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
I think...

610
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
I mean, it's not good for channel show.

611
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm arguing that we like personally should do it or if the online space should do it.

612
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
I just think it's...

613
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,200
I don't know why people don't appreciate the same way I do.

614
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
They're always confused.

615
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
They don't know what the fuck's happening.

616
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
And just seems like, are you stupid?

617
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
I think it's the fact that it's...

618
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Are you literally dumb?

619
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Can you not read me?

620
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,120
Like two days ahead of time is too long.

621
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,360
Like a day on the life of the internet is like a month.

622
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
They'll forget.

623
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
I have an issue...

624
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Oh, sorry.

625
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Go on.

626
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Go on.

627
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Well, it's like notifications.

628
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,480
You can turn them on, but you have to turn them on.

629
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Like set reminder.

630
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
I've never clicked that.

631
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,640
I keep forgetting to click that, even when I want a reminder about it.

632
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,680
Even when you're constantly told to ring that bell.

633
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,520
One of the annoying things I have is that like you get notifications of premieres the

634
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,600
same way that you get like a new video.

635
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,200
So it'll be pretty common that this doesn't really impact whether or not I want to watch.

636
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,640
I still want to watch the premiere or just the video eventually, but like when I click

637
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
on it and it takes me to, oh, this premieres in two days, I'm like, Jesus Christ, why would

638
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
you even show me this YouTube?

639
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,720
Let me know when it's actually premiering.

640
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Maybe I'll watch it then.

641
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,840
This is another place where I feel like an alien because I get people who say like,

642
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,360
I didn't even know you posted this video because I didn't get a notification for it.

643
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,240
And I'm like, I don't use notifications anywhere on the internet ever.

644
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Yeah.

645
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Notifications are the devil to me.

646
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
I want to be that.

647
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,800
I'm unsubscribing from a bunch of stuff because I'm realizing what a waste of time and energy

648
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
it is.

649
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
But yeah.

650
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,200
I mean, I'm subscribed to tons of channels, but I just go to my subscription page when

651
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,280
I want to, like when I want to watch YouTube, I go to YouTube and I watch videos.

652
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,960
I can't imagine getting a notification and then dropping everything and watching a video.

653
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
That's what I do.

654
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
That's what I do.

655
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,960
That's really what you do.

656
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
That's insane to me.

657
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
I need to be fair.

658
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,800
A lot of the things I subscribe to are like ASMR people.

659
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,640
So like, oh, new ASMR, this is the new thing I can listen to and not think about it while

660
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
I'm listening to it.

661
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,440
What are you doing when you get the notification?

662
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,840
Like just I'll be at work, like working and then, oh, notification, oh, let's take a few

663
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,760
minutes and watch this 10 minute video or something.

664
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,120
I guess if you can dick around at your job, then that's...

665
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,720
I mean, I can absolutely dick around at my job because I got my own office.

666
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,160
That's how boomer jobs work, dude.

667
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,920
Boomer jobs can just fuck around like 80% of the time.

668
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Yeah.

669
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
It's a corporate job.

670
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,920
And as long as you get your quota done, like by the end of the day, the thing is I do end

671
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,920
up staying late at my job because I have fucked around too much during like the normal

672
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
eight hours or whatever.

673
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
So it bites you.

674
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
It bites you at the end.

675
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,520
That feel when you're on Twitter and you find an artist who draws big ass titties and you

676
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,600
go and check their workout and it turns out half their shit is some fucking morbid obesity,

677
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
big old punch shit.

678
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
You know what I'm saying?

679
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I feel you, man.

680
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I feel you, man.

681
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
You know what I'm fucking dealing with over here.

682
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,120
I couldn't fucking resonate with you less right now.

683
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,200
That feel when you're on Twitter, you see an artist and they draw big old fucking titties

684
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,240
and you go to their art page and all they draw is big old titties even when it's weird,

685
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
even when it's strange.

686
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Like, dude, this ain't no big old titties, this is just like a stick figure or something.

687
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
That's crazy, dude.

688
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
What are you doing?

689
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

690
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,400
I literally don't understand what you're saying.

691
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,800
Hyper people hide in the shadows and you think it might just be normal art, but it's actually

692
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,960
hyper art.

693
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,800
That feel when you go on Twitter and you see a Twitter artist with the big old titties,

694
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,480
but then most of what they put on Twitter is not art and that's just talking and I don't

695
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
care.

696
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
I don't want to read.

697
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Oh, yeah.

698
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Hey, it's time for a call out.

699
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,560
It's time for a call out against a Twitter up and falling for many years.

700
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,520
Mokuo bot, Mokuo bot, Mokuo is a Toho girl.

701
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
She's the Chinese one.

702
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,120
She's cool and I was following them for a million years.

703
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,920
Now I had known all of a sudden I'm seeing people, this Mokuo bot, this account that

704
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,720
is only tweeted Mokuo bot images or Mokuo images by the specific artist for years and

705
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,840
all of a sudden is engaged with debate.

706
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Okay.

707
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Okay.

708
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,120
The path of progression was simply that this person suddenly tweeted, I think it was just

709
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:38,720
two words, trans rights just canceled, canceled and look, I mean, that was fine, but the next

710
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,680
many tweets from this account were being angry at people who expressed, I mean, to

711
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:52,200
my eyes, any kind of pushback that this account would tweet, you know, a somewhat political

712
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
statement.

713
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
You know, obviously there's some nuance there.

714
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,680
That's what it seems like a rite of passage, like you walk up to the lion's den, you say

715
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,560
trans rights and you see if you can survive, you can see if you can fight them off.

716
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,320
You know, I don't think any sane person would argue with the point of the tweet.

717
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,360
I would, however, argue that this is really not what I signed up for when I pledged to

718
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,320
the Mokuo bot account.

719
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,520
And why would you think, sir or madam, that I'm here for your political opinion or, you

720
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,040
know, sure, trans rights, it's great, but I'm here for the, for the japery, the memory,

721
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,400
and I will, I would have unpledged you a million years ago if there was going to be any of

722
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
this kind of business.

723
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,720
And you know, it's not that I hate trans rights.

724
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,560
Well, it's not the one tweet that made you want to unsub, it's that it became like a

725
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,880
long protracted thing.

726
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
That's correct, Ben.

727
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
That is correct.

728
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
And you know what the good news is?

729
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,720
I did not unpledge your Mokuo bot and they've gone back to tweeting Mokuo images and I

730
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
couldn't be happier.

731
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,280
This is, you know, I'm loving it.

732
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Digi, I'm going to need you to give me a news update and if you, and if you say that

733
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,560
you haven't followed this Twitter for years and I'm going to start barking at you like

734
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,240
a literal dog, so get ready for that if you've just treated me in this way.

735
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,040
Is Nihilist Arby's still good?

736
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,760
Oh, I haven't read it in years.

737
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,000
That joke seems played out.

738
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:11,200
You know, I found out, I found out today that you can't be fat and trans in New York.

739
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
What do you mean?

740
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,520
They did a ban on trans fats.

741
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,360
Yeah, that's what I call my label, fat, like fats.

742
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,080
I'm part of the fats community.

743
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Nate, did you see these pictures from Oda of Nami age 40 and Nami age 60?

744
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,680
Oh my God, that was from the new SBS and no, I have not.

745
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,040
Where are they? Where can I see them?

746
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Oh, I saw them.

747
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,880
I will link them in the chat, but you prepare to be disappointed because it's just her with

748
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
a different haircut.

749
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
I'm not surprised.

750
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,280
There's no difference whatsoever.

751
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,760
Have you one piece boys seen these fucking ramen commercials?

752
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,040
Oh, you bet your bottom dollar I have, dude.

753
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,640
I saw the Zoro one.

754
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,840
Yeah, I've only seen that one.

755
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Is there more?

756
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Is there more than that one?

757
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,720
Yeah, there's I think there's a handful.

758
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Oh my God.

759
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,960
Well, yeah, the Zoro one of like it's actually it's I've studied that many times.

760
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,800
So okay, so there's a there's a cup noodle commercial featuring Zoro as like a high

761
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,680
school boy in, you know, like one piece high school and he's in like the Kendo club and

762
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,560
he got beat by Mihawk blah, blah, blah and he's hanging around.

763
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:23,880
It's like Zoro's story condensed into like 30 seconds, but if he was a high school Kendo

764
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,920
club member instead of fucking want to be the greatest swordsman on the on the high seas.

765
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
And it's a lot.

766
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
And it's a lot.

767
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,120
Yeah, at the end, Luffy just shows up and it just has ramen, which is relevant somehow.

768
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,440
This studio was already making like anim like weird anime ramen ads like this, which were

769
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,240
usually just like short rom like romantic stories that are just like they're just beautifully

770
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,160
animated 30 second romance stories that then have like a ramen cup at the end.

771
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,760
By missing at the very end.

772
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,160
It's Japanese media.

773
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,920
Have you guys ever seen Lost in Translation with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson?

774
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,720
No, I was just watching it the other day and obviously it's not real life, but it is fascinating.

775
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:08,960
I don't know.

776
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,600
I'm thinking about Japan a lot these days.

777
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,240
I love Japan.

778
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,240
You might say I love it, period, but the ceremonies, you know, a dog.

779
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,720
The the no one they do commercials.

780
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,720
J-rock.

781
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
J-rock.

782
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Karugamesh.

783
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Yeah.

784
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Smile DK.

785
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Yeah, thank you.

786
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
I'd say that of course.

787
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Oh, I forgot the dog.

788
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
We got to do it.

789
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
We got to do it.

790
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Oh, I forgot the dog in the, you know, the Japanese dog.

791
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Oh, because all Japanese dogs.

792
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,720
We got to we got to go back and remake it for for 2019.

793
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,720
We have to put like our faces coming in and saying trans rights.

794
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Trans rights.

795
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
What else?

796
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Trans fat.

797
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Puppers.

798
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Just just multiple names for dogs.

799
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Someone opens their mouth and you just hear the sound.

800
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Come out of their mouth.

801
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
No, you need a guy in the very lights up blue.

802
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,720
I want you to be in like the very back of the shot at like the far end of the

803
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
restaurant in the gesture outfit screaming.

804
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Dude, Radcon four.

805
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
We should do that.

806
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
That's the only thing we should do a Radcon four.

807
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
We should do nothing else.

808
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
But you know what?

809
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,720
I bet that Oscar voice actor lady doesn't have a lot going on.

810
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,720
And you know who else's career got canceled?

811
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,720
My boy, Vic Mignana.

812
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
So he's going to need a gig.

813
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
We could probably get him to do the voiceover.

814
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I can go.

815
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I can go on the dick show and I can get Nick Rakita to put me in contact with

816
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Vic and then he could do the boys.

817
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Have I told you guys that when I was in college, I knew a girl who she was a,

818
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,720
as I recall, she was a relatively attractive, like cosplay kind of girl who

819
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,720
claimed to have a personal relationship with Vic Mignana.

820
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,720
And I'm just saying it plays into, I don't even know if I believe or disbelieve

821
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
any of the accusations.

822
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,720
I'm just saying that if I had to guess, if this woman was at the very least

823
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,720
aspiring to fuck Mignana, I would say 100%, she was attempting to do so.

824
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Whether or not that was reciprocated, I have no idea.

825
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,720
But they did know each other at least a little bit.

826
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
So I don't know.

827
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm not even, this isn't even a criticism of anyone.

828
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,720
You should ask Josh if he took that dick if you still know her.

829
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
I wish I could remember her name, but...

830
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
The Vic dick.

831
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
The Vic dick.

832
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Yeah.

833
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
The Vic dick.

834
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Yeah.

835
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Okay.

836
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
It's going around lately.

837
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
I want to talk now about Bill Jaype.

838
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Okay.

839
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
And it's a webcomic that I made.

840
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,720
When will Bill Jaype get canceled?

841
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Too late.

842
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
He's already finished.

843
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,720
It can't get canceled.

844
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,720
So what do you guys think?

845
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,720
What do you think of my comic I made?

846
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
You saw the fan art that I did.

847
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
I did.

848
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I did.

849
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Great.

850
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Did we talk about this last episode?

851
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
No.

852
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
It was not real yet.

853
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
It wasn't finished at the time.

854
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,720
I'm very annoyed because the way that Twitter cropped it, you couldn't see

855
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Pumpk.

856
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,720
And Pumpk is the big money maker.

857
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,720
It's like a promo image.

858
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
Show Don't Link Oblivion.

859
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
Get that Link slave.

860
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:20,720
All the characters displayed out in a symmetrical way with the hero and the front supporting

861
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
characters behind.

862
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,720
They're floating in the background.

863
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,720
The classic trope of snakes all around the border.

864
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,720
I have a lot to say about Jailbape because before the finale was released, just maybe

865
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,720
even just going back like maybe a month ago, I had not read a single page of that comic.

866
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:48,720
But I had the honor of doing one small part of the Jailbape animation and I saw that

867
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
to myself.

868
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Well, you know.

869
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Bill Jaype, you clawed.

870
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,720
As I said at RFCK a couple days ago, I will literally never say Bill Jaype ever.

871
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
You just did.

872
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Okay.

873
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
Well, whatever.

874
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Slip that.

875
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Ladies and gents.

876
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Anyway, so I went back and read it and I have a lot to say about Jailbape because I absolutely

877
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
love the comic.

878
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:17,720
It's really interesting to me in a lot of ways because of its basically, I'm sure you would

879
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,720
admit that a lot of it is rushed artwork in the sense that you didn't spend a year or

880
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
two on each panel.

881
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,720
This just plays right into what I've been saying for a while now, that art does not have to

882
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
be good to be good.

883
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,920
In fact, it was probably in most scenarios actually to its detriment to try and make each panel

884
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
individually perfect.

885
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,720
I think in every scenario it's to its detriment.

886
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,720
Yeah, I would agree.

887
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,720
You can clearly tell in Jailbape, like many panels where it's like, okay, obviously-

888
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Hang on.

889
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,080
If we reduce that rule to something that's like to put in more effort in something than

890
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,720
the bare minimum to get the ideas, the essential ideas across-

891
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Yes, yes.

892
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Could just be a waste of time and yeah.

893
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Okay, okay.

894
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Yes, yes.

895
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,720
There's very many panels where you can clearly tell that you cut corners in many ways and

896
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,960
that did not impact the moment to moment of it at all because there are legitimately pages

897
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,400
upon pages of Jailbape that I would consider homestuck level of memorabilia.

898
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,480
I often regard the many Tiki poses, specifically that one page where it's completely red.

899
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,560
The lava has just broken down into an underground tunnel and a cannonball has broken the roof

900
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,960
of said underground tunnel.

901
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,960
While it's fun and Tiki is just standing there posing, it is absolutely incredible.

902
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,240
I think about that and many other pages constantly and even though if you really take a fucking

903
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:57,200
measuring glass and look at each of the lines, you can say, hmm, this was made in three seconds.

904
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,480
Literally does not matter.

905
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,360
One fucking molecule.

906
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,120
Again, this goes out from the art, like the story.

907
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,720
There basically is no actual story, things just happen one after another.

908
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,480
But your passion for just the character designs basically and you know what little character

909
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:24,000
they do have shines through and especially in this lovingly crafted animation that you

910
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
made.

911
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,840
It is just like the pure like energy in this project regardless of the quote unquote lower

912
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,040
case Q quality of it.

913
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
That doesn't matter at all.

914
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,200
What matters is that this was a new thing that you had done.

915
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,640
This was, you know, you had done can story before, but let's face it, Jailbait basically

916
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,480
outclasses it in every single way.

917
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,360
I mean can story doesn't even hold a candle.

918
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,120
Call it Baaljab for fuck's sake.

919
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
Never.

920
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
I never will.

921
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Whatever.

922
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Fuck you then.

923
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Get the idea.

924
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
You get the idea, exactly.

925
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,720
It just is so refreshing in so many different ways that comic and I'm so happy that you

926
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:06,040
were able to finish it in such a spectacular way and I encourage every single person to

927
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,160
go and read that comic because it is the best thing that any member has done in maybe a

928
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,080
year of any member of the PCP has done.

929
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
Just for fun.

930
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,000
What do you think was the last good thing that was like as good that any of us have done

931
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,160
before Baaljab?

932
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Anyone.

933
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
This goes to anybody.

934
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
I'm trying to think myself.

935
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
The timeline is hard in my mind.

936
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
It's fuzzy in my mind.

937
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
It really depends who you ask.

938
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
True.

939
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
True.

940
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
We're asking all.

941
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Okay.

942
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Me and Matthew will one maybe.

943
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Okay.

944
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
The timeline is good.

945
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
The timeline is fuzzy.

946
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
The timeline is fuzzy.

947
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
So there's probably something else.

948
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Are we not allowed to pick our own shit?

949
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
No.

950
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
You pick your own shit.

951
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Why not?

952
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Go for it.

953
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,280
I mean, champion chapter one ended and then the game came out after the game.

954
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Oh, okay.

955
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
That's a good one.

956
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
No.

957
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
That was in like late.

958
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,280
That was like early, like the first half of 2018.

959
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
2018.

960
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Okay.

961
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,280
No.

962
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Okay.

963
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Sure.

964
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
That's probably what I would go for, I think.

965
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Are we saying that?

966
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Are we trying to think of something that's as impressive as Jailbait?

967
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
No.

968
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,120
I mean, I knew we were refreshing in any way.

969
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,560
That's just not the same old shit, that's something that's like PCP like production

970
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,560
cannonball.

971
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
Oh, wait.

972
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Azumi.

973
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
The Azumi demo was recent.

974
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Yeah.

975
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
Azumi game.

976
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,560
Azumi game.

977
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,560
I was going to say the Davoose game as well.

978
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
Oh, yeah.

979
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Davoose game.

980
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Yeah.

981
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
A ton of this.

982
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
A ton of this game.

983
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,560
When did that come out?

984
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,560
When did that come out?

985
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Yeah.

986
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,560
Personally, I would count my albums in there, but none of y'all listen to that shit.

987
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Yeah.

988
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Sorry, dude.

989
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
I just don't listen to them.

990
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,560
Yeah.

991
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,560
I'm sorry.

992
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Maybe if I did, I'd love them.

993
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
I just haven't.

994
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Sorry.

995
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
I don't like Digi, bro.

996
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
I don't like Singers.

997
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Digi's too black sounding for me.

998
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,560
Well, to each his own.

999
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
Okay.

1000
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
So Azumi game.

1001
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
That's a line, guys.

1002
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
He's not racist.

1003
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Please.

1004
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,560
It's a quote.

1005
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,560
It's a quote.

1006
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
I mean, this doesn't have to turn into a dick measuring contest.

1007
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
I'm just trying to say hippo.

1008
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
I'm really proud of you.

1009
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Yeah.

1010
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,060
I'm just capturing a flame that I feel has been slightly extinguished.

1011
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,440
And I'm really happy that you are doing something so interesting and unique again.

1012
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
And you know, I think...

1013
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
Thank you very much.

1014
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
It might...

1015
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Well, yes, I don't mean to undercut you.

1016
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Cut you off there.

1017
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
No.

1018
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I really appreciate all those words.

1019
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,860
And I agree that like initially it was just, let's just fuck around and draw some stuff

1020
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,860
and see what happens.

1021
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,100
And like the first half, the first few first hundred or so pages was like, let's make it

1022
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,180
up as I go.

1023
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,460
And now that I have some things, I started progressively to decide, okay, well, why is

1024
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,740
that a thing?

1025
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,860
And then I, you know, thought of what, where they are and what they're doing.

1026
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:46,180
And then I tried my very best to incorporate everything that was brought up randomly into

1027
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,620
the finale or the end or like, so everything got wrapped up.

1028
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:55,220
My brother did notice that there was that one thing that when Tiki smashed the bottle

1029
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,620
in her face and then like had the broken bottle, she put it in an inventory, that didn't come

1030
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,620
back.

1031
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,540
So, you know, zero out of 10 for that.

1032
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,740
Yeah, true.

1033
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,340
But everything else, including the table of potions...

1034
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Well, it's a red herring, dude.

1035
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
It's a red herring.

1036
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,980
Yeah, it's actually 10 out of 10.

1037
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,980
Excuse me.

1038
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,980
I mean, like...

1039
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,980
Oh yeah, sorry, God.

1040
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:21,300
When I saw that the finale was a video, I was expecting something like the Endless War

1041
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,700
S-Descend, which you also made, which was...

1042
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,300
Did you not know it was going to be a real animation?

1043
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,300
I didn't.

1044
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,300
No, which, I mean, S-Descend is great, but I can tell that it was made in a time-efficient

1045
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,300
manner.

1046
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,980
Like, you know, it's mostly stills with video.

1047
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,980
I mean, there is some animation in there.

1048
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,540
Which, I mean, the sort of goes back to like, you know, that was good enough and that was

1049
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,540
a great...

1050
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,100
That was good enough.

1051
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,620
And so that's why I was like, why would you do more than this?

1052
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
Because it's fucking outstanding as well.

1053
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1054
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,620
Well, yeah, and then I saw...

1055
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,620
Because it's a genie.

1056
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,620
It's a Stratobloid genie.

1057
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,380
I saw that it was like fully animated.

1058
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,100
I was like, oh my, oh my God.

1059
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:05,500
It took a very long time, but I, you know, if there's anything I can say is that I learned

1060
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,140
how to do the pre-production on that so that it happened in an efficient manner from going

1061
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,140
to uni.

1062
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
That's my story there.

1063
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,740
Don't go to college, please.

1064
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,740
Don't go to college.

1065
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,740
Anything but that, totally.

1066
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,980
Don't go to college, but if you do accidentally go to college, if you do accidentally find

1067
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,580
yourself with a degree, you may as well have remembered some of the things you learned.

1068
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,740
And you may find yourself with an animation degree.

1069
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,260
This is not my beautiful dorm.

1070
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,220
This is not my beautiful student loan desk.

1071
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:39,020
There is a PCP release somewhere in time around you released the Bugs Life YouTube Hippocrate

1072
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,140
review.

1073
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,140
Yeah.

1074
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,300
Where I believe I mentioned like Hippo, you know, video games review, are they cool?

1075
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:51,620
You know, I like video games, but your animations were so cool and you were like, yeah.

1076
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:56,540
And then you said, yeah, but in the future, which is now, and you had released one moments

1077
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,500
ago, and it's really cool.

1078
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,700
It's really cool that you're doing it again.

1079
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:05,580
It's really cool that you're doing animations and the things that are unique to you as opposed

1080
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,020
to being another cog in the fucking machine.

1081
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,140
I think it's only fair.

1082
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:15,420
I think it's only fair we give Munchy, I'm going to get around 100% credit for give make

1083
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,420
in this animation.

1084
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,420
Oh yeah.

1085
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,420
Oh yeah.

1086
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
That's definitely what I meant by suggesting that you do animations again.

1087
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,420
Yeah.

1088
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,420
Yeah.

1089
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,420
That's good.

1090
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,900
I do want to make one point about like the whole, it doesn't need to be good to be good

1091
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:31,540
because combined with, I think it was like way back when I was doing the drawing your

1092
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:37,980
waifus if it was risk a video series where I drew like a copied image and then gave

1093
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,380
her like risk a horns.

1094
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,380
Yeah.

1095
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,500
And then Munchy and Ben shadow me mercilessly about how that's not, yeah, both of you.

1096
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
I remember.

1097
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Wait, wait, for what?

1098
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,900
Drawing your waifus if it was risk a because like I was doing it with the idea of, of like,

1099
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,900
wasn't tracing.

1100
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,900
It was copying.

1101
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,900
It was close by.

1102
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,300
It was in my peripheral, but like you were saying that's not going to get you better

1103
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,300
at drawing.

1104
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,300
I was like, they're right.

1105
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,300
Yeah.

1106
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,300
It's pretty true.

1107
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,580
From that point, I think like a thing in my brain change little, little thing where

1108
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,260
it was like, so I do get 100% credit.

1109
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,780
Well, I guess you do.

1110
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,300
Both of you, both of you, 200% between the two of you.

1111
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,900
Yes.

1112
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,060
High five, Ben.

1113
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,820
High five.

1114
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,220
High hoof, bro.

1115
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:26,260
But like it was the idea, the idea of I'm, you know, I've been okay at drawing for a

1116
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,700
long time, but it doesn't seem like I'm getting that much better.

1117
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,940
And I want to be really good in order to do certain things.

1118
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,260
But it's time sticking, time sticking.

1119
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,540
And I'm not like suddenly better yet, even though I'm drawing a little bit more than

1120
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,540
I was.

1121
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,820
Why don't I just work within my means?

1122
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,580
Why don't I just like make something with the power that I have currently?

1123
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:50,900
And then that will be my practice for the next thing I know.

1124
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,420
That's it.

1125
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,620
That's what I've been since.

1126
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,540
That's all you can do.

1127
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,180
That's what Vapors One was for me.

1128
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,580
I was like, I can kind of draw.

1129
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,620
I'll just, I'll just do a comic with as best I can.

1130
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,580
And that'll be my practice.

1131
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,660
I think we can all agree, I think we can all agree that this, this concept of sitting

1132
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,900
around and waiting for the perfect time to do whatever, to hone your skints.

1133
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,940
It's all a bunch of bullshit.

1134
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,940
This is what I mean.

1135
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,380
I don't, I don't, I like, don't believe in practice unless there's like a highly

1136
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,700
specific thing that you really want to get like exactly down.

1137
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,020
Look, I'm going to go be a tightrope walker today and fuck practice.

1138
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:22,700
I don't need a net.

1139
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,540
I'm just going out on my unicycle.

1140
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,580
I'm going to win it.

1141
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,380
I understand.

1142
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,300
I believe in myself.

1143
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,900
I'm speaking about this from like, I've spoken about this many times before.

1144
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,420
So I don't feel like I need to do the whole preamble that I always do.

1145
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,700
But I'm not anti practice or anything.

1146
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,980
And I'm not anti things being good, obviously.

1147
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,700
Like when I say he doesn't have to be good to be good.

1148
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,780
I mean, that it doesn't have to be of, I'm saying it doesn't have to be of

1149
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,460
technical prowess.

1150
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,780
It does not have to be like, you know, none of Jill is like, like technically

1151
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,540
impressive.

1152
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:55,460
What even is technically impressive is such a weird idea in the first place.

1153
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,460
Because it's like, it's like something that has to be determined by like

1154
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,060
academic consensus.

1155
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,940
Like it's like a bunch of people are specifically trying to boil down what

1156
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,620
they're going to consider to be technically proficient and nobody else cares.

1157
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,580
And I think there was a time where I think this is basically the difference

1158
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,260
between like modernism and postmodernism is the idea of like, yeah, OK,

1159
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:24,060
but like you guys can come up with a bunch of logic for why that is what

1160
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,300
you're going to call good.

1161
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,300
But we can come up with a bunch of logic for why anything could be called

1162
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,180
good, like when it comes down to it, what matters is the effect it has.

1163
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,100
And like individual people are going to make their own determinations about

1164
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,820
whether it's good or not.

1165
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:43,660
Anyways, they're not going to listen to what is considered to be good or bad.

1166
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,740
So I think what matters when we're worried about it when you judge

1167
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:51,020
something's quality is what the idea is.

1168
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,380
If you think it's a good idea in whatever way you may categorize that

1169
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,940
and if it's communicated effectively.

1170
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:01,500
So going back to that to those Tiki page pages, what is the idea?

1171
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,820
Tiki looks cool.

1172
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,180
Is that a good idea?

1173
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,460
Yes, Tiki is my wife is executed effectively.

1174
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,260
Yes, she looks cool.

1175
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:10,860
Done.

1176
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,900
That's all that panel needed to be.

1177
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,860
And you pull it off spectacularly.

1178
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:19,340
You did not need to make, I don't know, you didn't have to make Tiki

1179
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,700
atomically correct or make or make the line with or even just, you know,

1180
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,060
going away from technical problems, making the line with absolutely

1181
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,500
perfect on that one page.

1182
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,540
That would not have made the idea communicated any better.

1183
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,180
It didn't, you know, you know, it would have really improved jail, jail

1184
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,380
babe, though, if you didn't connect your lines, if you use that like super

1185
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,900
secret technique of not connecting my lines, because then how could I do

1186
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,020
the fill in bucket?

1187
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,420
Well, well, well, wait, hippo, I think you're really missing an opportunity

1188
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,020
to get your content for your patrons.

1189
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,620
I think that you would get way more money if you just didn't release

1190
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:53,540
the jail babe animation for three years and they just had to be patron only.

1191
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,140
Thanks, man.

1192
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,940
I have all these, all these points.

1193
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,100
Oh, sorry, yeah, if you want to.

1194
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:05,340
I have one thing that, like, I made a, I also have a plush, which is

1195
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,540
being kickstarted currently of punk.

1196
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,940
And that's like, that's cool.

1197
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,860
It's, it's, it's, you want to talk about how the kickstarter is going?

1198
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,620
I got like a fifth of the way there already.

1199
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,580
So that's pretty good.

1200
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,180
Okay.

1201
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,420
And it's running for a month, right?

1202
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,380
Running for a month.

1203
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,780
Likely it will get like kind of close, but might not actually go over.

1204
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,620
But that's not what I want to talk about right now.

1205
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,300
I just want to, I just want to highlight one comment from that

1206
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:38,140
video where I announced it from Pan Limak, who says, sorry to say this,

1207
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,540
but the art isn't nice.

1208
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,140
The comic looks ugly, the game looks ugly, the animation looks ugly,

1209
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,300
and the plushie looks rather ugly.

1210
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,860
The thing about stories with good funny writing is that bad art

1211
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,900
doesn't make them better.

1212
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,860
I mean, it's bad after all.

1213
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,820
It feels weird when you show up on YouTube suddenly just to throw an ad.

1214
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,180
Good luck, I guess.

1215
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,100
What a fucking.

1216
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,180
This is your post on Hippo.

1217
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:06,380
I kind of, it's very like, very dismissive of the thing.

1218
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,340
But you know, I kind of like him because he didn't, he didn't, he didn't

1219
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,180
say fuck you.

1220
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,660
He just said, I don't like it.

1221
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,260
True.

1222
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,740
And we said it, that's nice.

1223
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,260
There's kind of a difference.

1224
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,060
I mean, when people say something's bad, they mean they don't like it.

1225
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,340
Nobody really knows how to say that.

1226
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,860
I agree, Hippo, that is what it means.

1227
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,420
And I kind of want to, okay, okay.

1228
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,900
Remember that, that leprechaun video I did where I said that like being

1229
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,100
saying something is bad is just to say that you don't like it.

1230
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,260
Someone, oh God, I should dig up this tweet.

1231
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,580
I like, after that video, someone tweeted at me and he was like, this is a

1232
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:45,700
like particular value theory in philosophy that has been disproven.

1233
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,860
And then he linked me to, well, well, hold on.

1234
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:53,020
Well, he linked me, he cited some source and I went and I tried to read it and it

1235
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,740
was my, and I could tell that there was like more literature on the subject.

1236
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,940
And this is something I've been thinking about ever since.

1237
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:03,940
And I crave to make a video where I like an actual like philosophical argument

1238
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,300
where I go into that like value theory of judgment and I try and I like argue in

1239
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,900
favor of my theory and I try and like rebut because apparently this is like a

1240
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,020
thing, this is like a thing that has been like, like literature has been written

1241
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,820
about philosophical theory has been written about.

1242
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,540
And this is something that I'm interested in arguing in and I just

1243
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,940
haven't dived into it yet.

1244
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,260
Hang on, is this about the general principle of artistic merit?

1245
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,540
Or is there a specific type?

1246
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:31,700
Well, this is about like what is, is a value judgment purely subjective?

1247
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:36,700
Or like it is saying something is bad, identical in structure to saying I

1248
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,580
don't like it or is there a distinction?

1249
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,220
Is there a linguistic distinction between those two things?

1250
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,580
And this comment was saying that that link has been disproven.

1251
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,660
I mean, this tweet, this tweet, I said that like this, like,

1252
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,740
your theory of value has been philosophically disproven.

1253
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:56,340
I regardless of that, I don't think every person is going to use bad or

1254
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:01,420
like I don't like it in the same way as as like some people are going to think

1255
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,900
about that most people are not.

1256
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,140
Say when they say I like it's bad, they mean they think it's objectively bad.

1257
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,500
Like I think that's a very common belief.

1258
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,500
Well, I think they think they mean that, but I think they might fail to mean

1259
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,180
that even if they intend to.

1260
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:20,540
I agree, but that that's, you know, that's like death of the authoring

1261
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,700
these people's comment.

1262
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,140
Like this guy, I think it's totally legit.

1263
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:24,820
It is.

1264
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:30,140
No, I agree with you that what this guy is saying is I don't like it.

1265
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,820
But because his intent was to say that it was objectively bad.

1266
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,020
I think he's a piece of shit asshole.

1267
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,260
Maybe I suppose.

1268
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,820
OK, but it depends on what you want to do with it.

1269
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:47,100
It just, it just, you know, I don't because I have like kind of a small

1270
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,660
audience and the people who I was showing Belle Jape to as it was being made.

1271
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,140
It wasn't like that many people, obviously, since people people on my

1272
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,060
hypocrite channel have no idea what about anything I do.

1273
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,140
Really, you know, you know what?

1274
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:01,900
Oh, yeah.

1275
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,220
Well, it was a duh.

1276
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:12,100
I forgot my train of thought, something about the comment being mean.

1277
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,780
Oh, no, yeah, it reminded me that, yeah, people will see Belle Jape.

1278
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,580
They will see the way it's drawn.

1279
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,380
The fact that it's like kind of, you know, low resolution, like pixelated,

1280
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:27,020
not super clean, doesn't look like a way to put it, but it is actually accurate.

1281
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:33,580
Like, well, it's better than pixelated as a term, because everything's pixels.

1282
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,940
But true, people will see that and they will think, you know,

1283
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,620
this isn't a good quality image.

1284
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,740
This guy doesn't know how to draw really.

1285
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,180
And they will dismiss it offhand.

1286
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,420
This is like most people, I think, would see this.

1287
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,300
People who say like Kill La Kill is badly animated or like people who say.

1288
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,900
Kill La Kill can get people's attention.

1289
00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:00,940
I feel like Belle Jape was like more well received in the small community,

1290
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,020
but on a larger scale, may not appeal to that many people.

1291
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:09,660
But I still feel proud about the writing I've got, like the quality

1292
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,420
of the writing, the, you know, the things I've learned.

1293
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,580
I mean, if you look at the first few panels and then the last few panels,

1294
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,060
you can tell I've become at least a lot more confident in drawing

1295
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,220
like more difficult poses and things.

1296
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,580
I was going to say, I feel like you improved, like reading it through in one go.

1297
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,700
You can tell that you improved a lot.

1298
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,900
Yeah, I haven't done that.

1299
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,420
I just want to say that like the fact that people are seeing it

1300
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,140
and making negative comments means that people who aren't already into it

1301
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,020
are seeing it.

1302
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,260
So like, even though that comment is like it's symptomatic

1303
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,900
of the fact that new people are seeing it, which is good.

1304
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,100
Yeah. And you know, when new when when more people see a thing,

1305
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,740
obviously they're not all going to be into it.

1306
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,140
Yeah. Hey, all this is fine discussion and criticism,

1307
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,300
but really it's all pointless bullshit because I have a substantive

1308
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,420
lower point to make about Belle Jape and it's the only point that matters.

1309
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,380
And I actually already talked to give about this,

1310
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,100
but I just want to express a sentiment I had because unlike you,

1311
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,820
meta commentary dumbass pieces of shit, I actually care about the actual

1312
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,620
characters and have concern for their well-being.

1313
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,060
And this is what it is.

1314
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,660
It's that at the end of Belle Jape, I guess I won't specifically spoil it,

1315
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,860
but Belle Jape takes place on a sea of lava.

1316
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:27,380
And as we have not seen anything outside of this one island, which is in

1317
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,300
we do see other islands in the distance, do we really?

1318
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,540
I don't remember that in some of the wide shots.

1319
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:38,060
You can see that there are other things like way off in the distance in the sea.

1320
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,220
Is that?

1321
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:44,420
Yeah, this is a few little pixels of black in the inverted horizon and a few things.

1322
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,820
I must have missed those.

1323
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,180
OK, well, my my OK, nonetheless, nonetheless, as a dumbass piece of shit,

1324
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,380
idiot who didn't miss any of these.

1325
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,380
I was really cared about the substance.

1326
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,220
That's right. That's me.

1327
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,380
I represent the common man.

1328
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,060
We at the very end of the series,

1329
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,700
I felt so seeing our heroes, you know, win and go off and drift off in the sea of

1330
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,060
lava, I felt a deep, profound anxiety because I was like,

1331
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,100
I see these guys on a world of lava with no indication of civilization

1332
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,020
or potential safety.

1333
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,940
And I don't know how long this this this orb of Splish is going to last.

1334
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,340
You know, I don't know what their ultimate destination is.

1335
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,780
The jewel of Splish is the jewel of Splish is eternal.

1336
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,540
Well, OK, nice head cannon, bro.

1337
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,620
Cool head cannon.

1338
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,340
But you know, I'm not here.

1339
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,740
Takes a hit of my jewel.

1340
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,900
Ah, Splish flavor.

1341
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,820
I all I'm saying is if I was begging Gibb to make an epilogue or something

1342
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,940
where we see them like, you know, just I would have been this would have been

1343
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:51,020
addressed if just on the in like the last panel, we see them drifting off.

1344
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,460
And maybe there's like the silhouette of like a city looming in the distance

1345
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,500
or or like something like just just a hopeful element.

1346
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,820
But there was none.

1347
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,900
And the fact that I missed these islands in the distance.

1348
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,180
OK, I'm already I've already missed some stuff because there is hope

1349
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,180
because one of those you could theoretically go to and live.

1350
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,460
Just please go back and just add a black panel and then in show card

1351
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,380
gothic just right and they lived happily ever after so I can rest easy at night.

1352
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,220
I mean, that's a I mean, that's a bullshit way to do it.

1353
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,460
I want a more artistic way to do it more, you know, yeah.

1354
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,660
But yes, no, I guess.

1355
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,940
Well, obviously, the more artistic way flew over your head.

1356
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:31,460
I want him to artistically do what I want him to do to his story.

1357
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,260
That's that's what they had many grand adventures.

1358
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,020
Look, I'm saying as the person who cares most about these characters

1359
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:44,260
in the world, more than anyone in the world, I am scared

1360
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,380
and pissing my pants currently worried about them.

1361
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,860
And I want them to be safe and happy.

1362
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,740
And please, sir, help.

1363
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,380
OK, I can I can tell you that scholar.

1364
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:59,420
I mean, first of all, you need to make like an analysis video

1365
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:03,940
like theorizing and then I can say all your theories are stupid

1366
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,980
and they'll they'll reach an island.

1367
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,300
You so you so you can comment, lull.

1368
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,340
I didn't put I didn't think about any of this.

1369
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,980
It was all I do, bro.

1370
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,220
I just comment death of the author and death of the author

1371
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,220
in all caps like a hundred times and say, fuck you, death of the author.

1372
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,180
And then start your five hundred page Bill J.

1373
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,580
fan fiction that becomes more popular than the original.

1374
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,700
And I was like, oh, yeah, Nate, Saint, the bell, jake guy, cool.

1375
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,220
The bell, jake theorists like like like a Game of Thrones guy.

1376
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,620
Exactly. Analyzing.

1377
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,580
I'm going to talk about how pretty how pretty jail babe is.

1378
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,220
But it doesn't just live up to like the narrative

1379
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:41,180
stronghold, just ironclad, a thousand times folded script.

1380
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,740
That is canon story.

1381
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,460
I mean, come on, it may look more visually impressive, but come on.

1382
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,860
Like the real meat and potatoes narratively is in.

1383
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,700
No, check off gun remains unfired in canon story.

1384
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,340
We can all agree the pocket boys is the real.

1385
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,340
Oh, yeah, indeed.

1386
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,780
And by the way, another moment I just really loved was

1387
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,540
like at the end, when the shits going down, these are spoiled.

1388
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,900
OK, you know, I guess I won't say it.

1389
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,900
But OK, I will say that the payoff of the of the Flamingo narrative

1390
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,500
I very much enjoyed.

1391
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,900
And I mean, that I kind of felt one of those like, like, oh, my God,

1392
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,660
moments like you'd get in like a real story.

1393
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,460
Like imagine that and it felt great.

1394
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,820
We can all agree that the real HIPAA winner is all those fucking

1395
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:37,500
Terezi, Vriska, Porns, I see a real 34 pa heal, but I have to scroll

1396
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,300
past whenever I search home stuck.

1397
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,540
I always see them and makes me feel uncomfortable.

1398
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,340
Who uploaded those and why?

1399
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,140
There was there was one moment when I was very surprised.

1400
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:52,700
I was like, oh, my God, that happened.

1401
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,940
But then I thought I was like, oh, wait, that makes perfect sense.

1402
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,980
Ah, and I don't want to say what it is because it's a big spoiler.

1403
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,980
But I'll just say that that did happen.

1404
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,620
Type it in in chat and I'll react accordingly.

1405
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,780
I've got one, too.

1406
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:10,820
I'm also going to type it in this audio podcast and totally ruin it.

1407
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,140
Oh, yeah, that was that was.

1408
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,460
I was I was like, I was like, what?

1409
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,140
Wait a minute, may actually in hindsight, of course, that would happen.

1410
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,740
Oh, I got one, too.

1411
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,740
He's coming on this.

1412
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,340
That was that was a thing that happened.

1413
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,940
And oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1414
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,540
Oh, yeah, go watch. Go read.

1415
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,500
Bell shape right now.

1416
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,300
Link in the description.

1417
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,060
Link on street.

1418
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,380
There's a hundred links on screen.

1419
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,380
Oblivion fall.

1420
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,500
You better put a hundred links on screen.

1421
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
I could say like literally 100 or.

1422
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,540
Why did why did these people deserve to live

1423
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,620
as opposed to all the other people?

1424
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,660
It's not fair.

1425
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,660
It's not just wait.

1426
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,020
We pay him. You do have to do.

1427
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,460
There's no justice in this world.

1428
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,100
That's true.

1429
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,860
That's in this lava world.

1430
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,140
Hey, did you did you?

1431
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,460
Yeah, did you read it?

1432
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,180
Have you read it yet?

1433
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,220
I've only read as much as was out

1434
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,300
like a month after it started because I decided I would wait for it to be over.

1435
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,460
And now it's over.

1436
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,820
So now I have to read it, please.

1437
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,340
Please.

1438
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,140
I read it.

1439
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,300
Give it a little thing in about an hour and a half.

1440
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,140
Making an hour announced video and then releases a premiere.

1441
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,220
Why don't you make a 12 port analysis?

1442
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,220
You piece of shit.

1443
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,500
Maybe I will do a thoroughly analyzing

1444
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,780
my little pumpkin.

1445
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:27,380
Hey, hey, pumpkin.

1446
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,460
I want my pumpkin.

1447
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,700
Hey, let me tell you about something.

1448
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,180
Let me tell you about something that makes me.

1449
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,140
It bends here.

1450
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,780
Oh, God.

1451
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,140
This is this is my new this is my new crusade

1452
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,420
that I've started to take up and get legitimately.

1453
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,220
All right, more people on Twitter who are stupid.

1454
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,340
Guys, look at this.

1455
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,220
Look at this image.

1456
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,580
Look at this image.

1457
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,780
Look at this tweet.

1458
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,180
Look at this image and tell me that you would look at this and say,

1459
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,460
no, thanks, I prefer I prefer a more well proportioned woman.

1460
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,300
Get fucked. You're a pervert.

1461
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,620
You're a sick pervert.

1462
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:00,060
Hang on. You don't like these big ass titties.

1463
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,300
That's what I'm fucking mad about.

1464
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,260
OK, like you're a big fan of these titties.

1465
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,940
Little. Yes, of course I am.

1466
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,540
This is great. This is disgusting.

1467
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,260
This is really disgusting.

1468
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,780
This is what I'm here for.

1469
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,860
This is the shit. No.

1470
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,820
This is the shit.

1471
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,300
Some shatman shit.

1472
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,060
I mean, that is not some fucking shatman shit.

1473
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,620
I'm so surprised and happy that we are brothers on this issue.

1474
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,860
I would have never guessed, but I'm really happy.

1475
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,140
You're all perverts.

1476
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,180
In regard to Paul, I'm not a fan of I get to count in the comments.

1477
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:33,060
Yeah, all you sick fucks in the comments who are like, no, thanks.

1478
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,380
An undeserving of life is what you are.

1479
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,500
In regards to this specific example that you've posted,

1480
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,140
I find that Betty Boop has a more attractive body type than.

1481
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:45,340
Look, Betty Boop is looking great here.

1482
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:46,780
Betty Boop is looking great here,

1483
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,540
but Jessica Rabbit is what I am about.

1484
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,660
Ben, you know what? I'm surprised.

1485
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,500
I'm very surprised you say that.

1486
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,260
I didn't know when did this revelation come.

1487
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:59,020
This is the truth. This is the this is the dark truth.

1488
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:02,620
This is the dark shameful truth that I like big old titties.

1489
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,180
I stand with Ben. I stand with Ben on this one.

1490
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,660
You are a nightmare.

1491
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,980
Hippo, you literally remind me of like a tractor going inside my wreath, right?

1492
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:17,860
Like you are the worst thing that could happen when it comes to sex, very problematic,

1493
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,220
which is why your riskatresi images on a rule three, four pack.

1494
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,180
You'll always get my fucking goat.

1495
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,620
Well, I don't draw anything.

1496
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:32,180
Anyway, anyway, guys, speaking of comics and hippo, I literally don't care.

1497
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:35,260
Don't worry about it. I want to fight about I want to fight about this.

1498
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,900
OK, I want to fucking fight whatever even is there to fight about retarded.

1499
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,740
My opinion is the correct one.

1500
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,140
I wouldn't really criticize anyone for being into it,

1501
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:47,460
but I would also have no problem with someone saying that they don't like it,

1502
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,100
which sounds like what the argument is.

1503
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,300
So really, I have no comment.

1504
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,180
I just can't wrap my head around it.

1505
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,420
I just can't wrap my head around it. I can't do it.

1506
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:59,380
Well, I guess it looks unnatural and strange is this is one of those things.

1507
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:03,140
This is one of those things where I just I just I can't respect.

1508
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,460
I can't respect a conflicting opinion.

1509
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,300
I can't do it.

1510
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,420
You mean like every other opinion and a thing that people have,

1511
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,540
like, you know, like all the rest, you can't respect that.

1512
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,660
That's right. Yes.

1513
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,940
In other words, this is just like everything else, I believe.

1514
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,740
Things that look unnatural and strange is like part of the reason

1515
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,020
why you would draw it rather than photograph in the first place.

1516
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,020
You know what? OK, if Shadmander these, if Shadmander these,

1517
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,500
they would be big and like spherical and that would be horrible.

1518
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,940
But in that first drawing of it, like they've got half to them,

1519
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,500
like they look like they're made of flesh.

1520
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,980
No, it's they're just.

1521
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,220
You're fucking gross.

1522
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,340
No, it's it's 10 out of 10.

1523
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,180
I wouldn't use the word grow.

1524
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,660
It's ten five. I'll allow it.

1525
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,060
Fine. OK, good. Great. All right. All right.

1526
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,300
Hey, well, that's my that's my contribution.

1527
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,140
I was walking. I'll see you all later.

1528
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,980
Doing thank you all for coming.

1529
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,900
Doing doing the thing that I love to do more than anything else

1530
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:55,980
in the entire world, go inside of Newberry Comics

1531
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,780
and go to the Children's section.

1532
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:01,700
Because for some reason, I was not informed of this.

1533
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:06,260
But apparently Western comics are like fantastic and cool looking,

1534
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,580
says the person who's never bought any of them.

1535
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,260
He's like, go to the kids section

1536
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,140
and I just see covers that look like this.

1537
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,340
And I'm going to post them in the show notes for you to look at.

1538
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,180
And I think myself, what? Huh?

1539
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,180
This is like a loud.

1540
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,660
What is not my beautiful comic?

1541
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,220
Discussing audio links so that we don't have to copy it over.

1542
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,700
I literally did. You fucking dumbass.

1543
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,140
It's in gross assumption audio.

1544
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,660
Oh, you're right. I'm wrong. OK.

1545
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,500
Hey, Nate, kill yourself.

1546
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,620
Anyway, that's fair.

1547
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,140
So it's things like this.

1548
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,700
Is this a Western comic? Yes.

1549
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,060
OK, it is a children's comic.

1550
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:38,940
Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1551
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:43,740
What's extremely average is named at Atelier Cento?

1552
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,300
Atelier Cento.

1553
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,060
That's not a real name.

1554
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,460
Is it one of the is he the star of one of the Atelier games?

1555
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,740
Atelier. Is he Atelier Heidi's brother?

1556
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:55,220
I have no idea.

1557
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,980
The first name is what connects them.

1558
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:59,060
But this looks so Japanese.

1559
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,020
So, yeah, it's so intriguing.

1560
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,700
Art style wise and subject matter wise.

1561
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,420
Look at that girl. Look at how she has no people.

1562
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,860
Because that's the thing that I like.

1563
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,460
I like when characters don't have pupils.

1564
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,860
That's what I like. That mushroom cut.

1565
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,300
I had a mushroom cut when I was young.

1566
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,940
I find this almost as confusing as Ben's picture of the giant tits.

1567
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,900
What the hell?

1568
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,220
I just don't see anything unique or appealing about it.

1569
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,260
No, I think it looks nice.

1570
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,820
It doesn't make me want to read it.

1571
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:25,860
You know, OK, you know what?

1572
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,500
Maybe this is a man or a woman.

1573
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,460
I don't know who's like Japanese by origin

1574
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,300
because it's called Daira of a yokai ghost hunter.

1575
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,100
I mean, that is a Japanese name.

1576
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,340
I mean, his name is Cento.

1577
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,060
That's a Japanese name.

1578
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,100
And yeah, his name is Cento.

1579
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,860
So he's either Japanese or like descendant of Japanese people or something.

1580
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,980
Well, the reason I'm sure that you're right, Digi,

1581
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,340
that it has to be the name of a group, right?

1582
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,620
Because it's a children's book.

1583
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,740
They usually group atelier or worse.

1584
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:53,500
If I had the media prowess that you did,

1585
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,420
I probably would not find this interesting.

1586
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:59,740
But the fact of the matter is is that I have been pretty stunted media growth wise

1587
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:03,180
and I have not watched or consumed shows or comics

1588
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:08,020
basically like almost ever like like consistently throughout my life.

1589
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:11,140
I basically have grown up on video games

1590
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,780
that I have like three of them.

1591
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,060
I was about to post that late night. God damn it.

1592
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,620
Hey, what? Hey, hey.

1593
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,820
So is it a collective or is it a French guys?

1594
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,060
Yeah, inspired by their travels in Japan, apparently.

1595
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,660
So their website actually, the artwork that shows up when you click on it is.

1596
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,500
Yeah, I like it a lot. It looks great.

1597
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,300
So so so when I see stuff like this, I think to myself, wow,

1598
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:35,060
I legitimately haven't really seen much things that look like this.

1599
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,580
And so I open it up and it's just a really nice experience.

1600
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:41,060
And it makes me think about things I've talked about many times in the past

1601
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:45,460
where I just feel against stifled media wise in the sense that I feel like

1602
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:49,020
I don't make enough time for myself to actually watch shows,

1603
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,580
which may seem weird to, you know, maybe other people,

1604
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,820
but maybe maybe any of you guys, but I really just don't do it.

1605
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,420
And so I made a pact myself.

1606
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,420
I didn't buy this book, obviously, because why would I fucking buy things?

1607
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:02,700
But by next episode, I will have watched,

1608
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,020
I will have read the entirety of this book.

1609
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,020
So this is the new thing.

1610
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,340
Munchie Book Club, one comic at a time.

1611
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,500
I'm actually doing media for Reels this time.

1612
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,780
These these Atelier Cento guys also make games in this art style.

1613
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,900
Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

1614
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,300
They make like a mobile games.

1615
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,380
Yeah, I'll put a link to their blog.

1616
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,220
Oh, that's cool.

1617
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:22,420
That's, huh?

1618
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,820
Like mobile adventure games in that art style.

1619
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,900
It looks pretty cool.

1620
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,060
Sounds sick as hell.

1621
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,260
And I'm really excited.

1622
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,940
I like are they like a are they like a husband and wife do?

1623
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,020
Or are they like two dudes?

1624
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,860
They seem to be a man and a woman, but I don't know their relationship.

1625
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,860
I don't know. I don't know.

1626
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:42,580
I see a picture of a woman holding a tablet, playing one of these games.

1627
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,900
And I wonder if she's one of them.

1628
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,180
I'll be one of you.

1629
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,500
I think so. YouTube channel, too.

1630
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,740
Well, we have now.

1631
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,340
Well, there you go.

1632
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:53,020
Deep dive.

1633
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,540
This is fucking great.

1634
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,860
Long in the children's book that Munchie was interested in.

1635
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:03,620
It looks like this is a good example of like good art plus, you know,

1636
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,700
like, oh, yeah, art can be good and as well as being good.

1637
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,220
I just want to say, I mean, this is exactly the way that I consume things,

1638
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:15,180
by the way, is that like I see something, I look it up

1639
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:20,300
and I find everything that person's ever done and then just systematically consume it all.

1640
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:22,300
And like, that's what I was trying to get at earlier.

1641
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,300
Like it's always about the artist.

1642
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,380
It's like, oh, this person did something that I'm interested in at all.

1643
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,580
Let me consume everything they've ever done

1644
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,940
because it's all going to interest me.

1645
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:34,900
And I think that's the I think that's a good just a piece of advice.

1646
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,460
If anybody you have trouble finding things that you enjoy,

1647
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,220
you know, consider looking into the people who've created the things

1648
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,180
that you've enjoyed previously.

1649
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,820
And they've probably made other things you enjoy.

1650
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,900
I only had any respect for Weaboo's.

1651
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:51,700
I might be able to appreciate this.

1652
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:56,220
Ben, I know I know that you've resonate me on the not watching media front.

1653
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:00,020
You, you should fucking watch a movie or something, dude.

1654
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,660
Come on this journey.

1655
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:04,540
Be a media, be a media meister, be a media muncher.

1656
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,460
You need to consume more media.

1657
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,340
It's such a weird thing to say, right?

1658
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:14,020
It's a weird like on this show being like, oh, I don't watch shows.

1659
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,700
But like, it's true. It's like actually true in real life thing about you.

1660
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,740
Saying this much is that I also don't consume nearly enough media.

1661
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,740
I just have the appearance of doing so because I research shit all the time.

1662
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,340
Like the amount of stuff I actually consume is nowhere near the amount

1663
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:33,100
that I like watch analysis videos of or just like.

1664
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,780
Yeah, I do too much of that.

1665
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:38,700
I do too much of just listening to some guy on YouTube explain things to me.

1666
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,340
Completely agree.

1667
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:44,060
Yeah, I think I think also that the reason a lot of people have ended up

1668
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:47,420
looking at YouTube like reviews and analysis of things

1669
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,340
is because there's so much media out there that you're like,

1670
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,620
ah, geez, I don't want to be stuck watching or reading the wrong thing.

1671
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:59,020
And you go to let you like somebody to compartmentalize all of the different

1672
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:01,700
things and tell you which one's the best game of the year.

1673
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,260
Well, I don't even like it for that reason.

1674
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,060
I like it because I don't have to consume any of it, except for that.

1675
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:12,220
Like the things that I tend to be interested in are almost never

1676
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,060
some kind of big blockbuster thing.

1677
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,540
It's never going to be something that even will get covered by YouTubers

1678
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,300
because they would get no views.

1679
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,980
So like it gives me the opportunity that I can go fuck off

1680
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:25,980
and play my stupid weird indie games that I like.

1681
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:29,500
And then I can still be a part of the conversation about what's happening

1682
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,620
in the mainstream because other people are doing the job for me.

1683
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,980
So like I could I could literally sit here and have a full fledged

1684
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,420
conversation with any of you about the latest Avengers movie,

1685
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,420
not having seen any Marvel movies in like 10 years,

1686
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:45,980
because I've listened to so many podcasts that describe the plot in depth

1687
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:49,300
that I have, you know, and like I would have hated the movie.

1688
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,980
I could tell by the way it's described.

1689
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:53,980
But listening to Jesse talk about it or listening to Red Letter Media

1690
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,460
talk about it is enjoyable because I like those guys.

1691
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,540
So it's like it's a better way to consume it for me.

1692
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:04,140
Non sequitur right now, I'm imagining right now an alternate reality

1693
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,020
where where Jailbap was a video game released for the Game Boy.

1694
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,460
And I imagine the mid 2000s commercial for that Game Boy game

1695
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:15,020
and about how I can imagine like some like 2000s teenagers

1696
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:18,740
like going to your pumpkin patch and being like, huh, better not stay out here

1697
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:20,580
at night dot, dot, dot.

1698
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:23,300
And then one of the pumpkins grows eyes and then pump chunks out.

1699
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,820
And then it like flashes like it does like an eye catch for like a couple levels.

1700
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,380
And then it's like Nintendo at the end.

1701
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,620
Anyway, I just thought you guys would like to know that.

1702
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,380
Make it real.

1703
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,380
That sounds pretty good.

1704
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,380
I've seen it in the podcast, everyone.

1705
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,860
I if you didn't know, by the way, people of viewers who haven't yet read

1706
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:46,420
Bill J, there is a video game inside the comic called Run Away from Snakes,

1707
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,540
which is like a 3D 3D endless runner where you run away from snakes.

1708
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,740
I've got my brother to make a new grounds account

1709
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:56,740
and he has uploaded it to there at just the endless mode.

1710
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,900
So that will hopefully get a lot of traction.

1711
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:03,580
Because the high score is winning ever since ever since Tom got front

1712
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:09,700
paged with Azuni, I've been meaning to try to put the the champion game up there.

1713
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:12,900
I don't think it would do as well because it's not a side-scrolling platformer.

1714
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:16,940
It's not it's not a, you know, it's more of a narrative experience.

1715
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:20,500
So I wouldn't expect it to do as well just on that basis.

1716
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,260
But still, it'd be cool.

1717
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:23,940
Wait, there's a champion game.

1718
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,660
I didn't hear about this.

1719
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:27,260
It's page one, technically, right?

1720
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:32,380
It is the yeah, it is like sort of a prequel story to the first chapter.

1721
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:37,180
And yeah, when you go to stcomics.com, it is the landing page or in there in a little bit.

1722
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:40,300
Yeah, you play as the champion.

1723
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,780
What's your name, Sophia and you and you are in the arena.

1724
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:50,700
It is sort of a it is sort of a JRPG like Final Fantasy six kind of gross.

1725
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:53,620
Yeah. Well, well, there it is.

1726
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:54,740
Advertise this enough.

1727
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,380
Did I did I not advertise it enough?

1728
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,900
I mean, I guess not.

1729
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,980
If people fail to hear about it, then I suppose the answer is if you're listening

1730
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:06,420
to this on Friday, maybe you should head over to stcomics.com, check out that game

1731
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,580
and then check out the two new vaporettes that are up at the end of the vapor section.

1732
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:15,140
The first one by Emily Rhee and the second one by Lauren Colt.

1733
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:18,780
Just one more week until the munchy vapor.

1734
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,940
Just one more week.

1735
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,500
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Next week.

1736
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:29,980
Oh, which is by far the longest and by far the bestest, far longer than needed to be.

1737
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:35,340
I'm going to break down why we all continually fail at this, why we're all

1738
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:42,220
still marketing wrong, because the Vapors, there's a good chance a lot of people

1739
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,180
listen to this, don't even know what the fuck it is.

1740
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,380
So full bore, go back, explain what is the Vapors?

1741
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,220
It's a comic that I made.

1742
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:55,980
So if you go to stcomics.com, there's a bunch of comics that Ben's written.

1743
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:00,500
He wrote two chapters of the Vapors, chapter three being written on the

1744
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,900
Patreon, like released page for page.

1745
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,180
It's been it's been released page by page on the Patreon.

1746
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,500
It will be up to it will be done in two weeks from when you.

1747
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:15,300
And a vaporette is like a one page, like short starring the characters.

1748
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:20,620
It's a short story with guest art, yes, with a guest artist is what a vaporette is.

1749
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:26,540
There was one by Fennel Kedenurix, one by Emily Rhee, one by Lauren Colt,

1750
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,220
and one by Munchie.

1751
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,660
And there's going to be a there's going to be a bunch more that come out with

1752
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:35,420
chapter three. And it's a story about a couple of deeply neurotic

1753
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:40,540
college autistic college kids, I guess.

1754
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,220
Probably maybe autistic, maybe undiagnosed.

1755
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,300
Maybe they just maybe they just have maybe not personal.

1756
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,660
Maybe they just. Oh my God, you just fuck.

1757
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,900
I just remembered the most important thing I had to describe.

1758
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,860
Talk about on the show.

1759
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:59,540
Yeah, please tell me you guys heard about they found the cure for autism.

1760
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,740
What? Oh, I was a bang, bang energy.

1761
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,820
No, no, it's way more insane than bang energy.

1762
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,540
I saw a little bit of this.

1763
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,340
Was this a joke? Do you just have to get it?

1764
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,420
It's not a joke.

1765
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:17,620
The cure for autism, unironically, literally is eating Normie's shit.

1766
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,820
What? How can this be?

1767
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:22,500
Because let's hear more about that.

1768
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,060
They have discovered is that autism is linked to gut bacteria

1769
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,740
and a lack of certain types of gut bacteria.

1770
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,660
Apparently are apparently a lot of intestinal bacteria

1771
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:37,300
as in shit have a lot to do with how our minds work.

1772
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:41,740
And yeah, there's a certain gut bacteria that if you are lacking it,

1773
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,940
then then you will I can't read this.

1774
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:53,300
You will have autism and you can get it by ingesting feces

1775
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,260
from neurotypical people.

1776
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,980
Right. No, surely.

1777
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,380
This sounds like an epic brand.

1778
01:19:58,380 --> 01:19:59,860
And it has autistic people.

1779
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,860
No, there is no.

1780
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:06,660
There was a full bore study where they they fed normal people feces

1781
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,900
to children over the course has to be a joke.

1782
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,420
It's not a fucking joke.

1783
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:15,020
Why would they not extract the important element

1784
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,740
from the feces if this is the only way to get it?

1785
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,980
They made it into a pill.

1786
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,700
They didn't like feed them shit. OK, OK, I'm sure.

1787
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,100
Yeah, they made like a fecal metal pill.

1788
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,140
There's other stuff you can find the fucking article.

1789
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:27,740
I retweeted it from May.

1790
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,620
Is it going to get a link?

1791
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,180
I mean, in the show notes or something, hopefully.

1792
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,140
OK, we'll get it.

1793
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:35,900
I mean, I have heard that there are procedures wherein you literally

1794
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,020
transplant feces from one person's intestines to another.

1795
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:41,260
Like to get the good.

1796
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,700
They ingested it orally in this particular experiment.

1797
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,820
But if you just look up, I don't know what to look up,

1798
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:48,940
but you could find this.

1799
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:50,460
It's it's being reported on.

1800
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,660
It's a study that was done on a bunch of autistic children,

1801
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:58,780
all of whom showed fewer symptoms of autism

1802
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,660
after about 18 months of going through this course.

1803
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,380
Eight of them were so much less autistic

1804
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:08,660
that they were no longer considered to even be on the spectrum

1805
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,580
by the end of the treatment.

1806
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:12,100
They are considered neurotypical now.

1807
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:15,300
Is this something you have to do to a kid when they're young

1808
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,940
like and still developing or like what if I don't know,

1809
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,940
autistic adult become less autistic.

1810
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:23,940
I haven't seen anything other than just the study that was done.

1811
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,900
Hey, where the shit at?

1812
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:30,940
I need to ask what you're trying to do out here trying to eat shit.

1813
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,460
Please correct me.

1814
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:36,700
So is autism defined as simply a set of behaviors?

1815
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,340
Is that what that seems to be the case?

1816
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,220
I don't think there's any other clearer definition than that.

1817
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:44,620
We don't we don't understand the like underlying

1818
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:46,540
physiological cause of it.

1819
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,220
Apparently, though, it's tied to gut bacteria.

1820
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:53,780
And you know, you know, by eating normie shit.

1821
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,420
I'm prepared to entertain that this is true.

1822
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:02,180
I kind of need more data before I'm going to be fully on board with this.

1823
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,980
Go read some new look it up.

1824
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,940
No, I read an article on the Economist about it.

1825
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,500
On the Economist, yes.

1826
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:14,460
What I'd rather do instead is just give I'll give these people, you know,

1827
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,860
like 10 years, like go go fix autism and report back when it's done.

1828
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,540
I mean, this is what I'm going to do.

1829
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,740
I'm not going to read anything.

1830
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:23,660
I mean, I'm not going to be 10 years.

1831
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,860
It's going to be a year.

1832
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,300
Well, great. Then they'll be able to do it within 10 years.

1833
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,980
No problem. I'm sure this is not the cure.

1834
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,620
And like, oh, this is it. All that other stuff and irrelevant.

1835
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,780
It's just it's just the poop. It's just about poop.

1836
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,380
That's all it ever was from the beginning.

1837
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,340
I guess can't be that simple, right?

1838
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:43,260
I I'm I'm still in shock mostly

1839
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:47,380
because my diet apparently isn't working and I'm still not fixed.

1840
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:50,140
I mean, I was doing this before anyone else.

1841
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:52,100
And it's just not fucking working.

1842
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,620
What am I doing wrong?

1843
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:58,220
Maybe the maybe the people's shit you're eating is not a normies.

1844
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:59,900
Yeah, sure.

1845
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:04,940
Surely the the the not the only way to get the good gut

1846
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:08,940
bacteria is specifically eating it from normies poop.

1847
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,940
Like, is this just a dietary problem?

1848
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:11,780
I'm not saying it.

1849
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,940
Embrace it. This is the way of the future.

1850
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,460
I really don't feel that uncomfortable,

1851
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,300
but it's like I'm just wrapping my mind or it's like surely.

1852
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,860
Like, I don't know why they did the experiment the way they did it.

1853
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:24,060
Like, all I have is the data of what was done.

1854
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:27,940
They fed people, married children for 18 months.

1855
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,260
We're over analyzing.

1856
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:32,900
Well, of them, eight of them were fully cured of autism.

1857
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,580
Oh, look, the reason I'm giving such resistance here is because I don't want

1858
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:40,900
a lot of people camped out around my toilet and my septic tank,

1859
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,180
eating my neurotypical poop.

1860
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:47,180
Does does this mean does this mean that if you eat autistic shit,

1861
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,020
you will become more autistic? I hope so.

1862
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,660
I hope I'm right.

1863
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:54,180
We'll see what I'm thinking is the start of the fucking war.

1864
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:54,900
A sewer war.

1865
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:58,700
What this is going to lead to is you can customize your own neurosis.

1866
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,780
Like, you can have whatever brain type you want.

1867
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:05,780
Like, you could like, it's all going to make it go for one to the other.

1868
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:10,780
Right. So like, you could just add or remove gut bacteria if you need to be

1869
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:13,060
more or less autistic for your job.

1870
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,580
It's like you really like a little bit.

1871
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:19,940
Maybe if you like being autistic, like, avoid normie bathrooms

1872
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:22,860
because you don't want to get infected with that normie gut bacteria.

1873
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,980
It's like it's like you shouldn't hang out with cats because they'll give you

1874
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:29,700
like they'll give you like brain like brain parasites that make you love cats

1875
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,420
more. It's the same with normies.

1876
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:34,420
They'll give you fucking gut parasites that will make you a normie.

1877
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,060
Don't let them don't let them get you.

1878
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:37,900
And some people, yeah, you know, fuck it.

1879
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,620
I bet Nikola Tesla probably would have upped his I mean,

1880
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,500
he was probably at max level autism already.

1881
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:46,140
But, you know, like if you could increase it for more like autistic focus

1882
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,140
on your work might help some people.

1883
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,220
It's not all negative.

1884
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,060
There's some benefits.

1885
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,620
Yeah, I got to eat shit so I can be Mozart.

1886
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:56,740
Nikola Tesla totally autistic and that guy never ate shit in his life.

1887
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,620
Coincidence.

1888
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:00,820
Imagine if he had how far we'd be ahead in the future right now.

1889
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:04,580
Kind of tech we'd have boy.

1890
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,420
You got to learn something new every day.

1891
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,700
It should be utilized as a marketing strategy.

1892
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,780
So it definitely took me a couple of days to fully internalize it.

1893
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,700
But now you know what this means, guys?

1894
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,260
The Patreon closed that shit down.

1895
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:17,780
We can just sell our shit for fucking money now.

1896
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,900
So we can give it off the cyberpunks.

1897
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,500
Selling shit to cyberpunks is going to make up like 80 percent of our business now.

1898
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:27,420
Who like, OK, are we just assuming that like

1899
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:30,700
if you eat anybody's shit, you just become whatever they are?

1900
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:35,540
Like, if you want to be a better like anime analyst, don't close my shit.

1901
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:36,940
Yeah, all right.

1902
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,820
I think I think it's a power up.

1903
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:42,900
Appalachic all kinds of of unproven hearsay from this finding.

1904
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,020
And you know what, we can make all kinds of shit based claims now.

1905
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,780
We can send a poop based like care packages to people who we want

1906
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:52,860
to be tweaked one way or another, you know, just send them like,

1907
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:55,220
I don't know, who could use a dose of more Ben?

1908
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:59,380
I mean, you know, people say that me and Ben are like two diametrically opposed.

1909
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:00,980
What if Ben and I swap shit?

1910
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:03,260
Just swap shit.

1911
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:07,180
Yeah, yeah, we become the happy medium somewhere.

1912
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,100
The phrase, you're full of shit is going to mean something different like five years.

1913
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,820
OK, OK, you sign up to a subscription based service

1914
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:19,500
where they have like celebrities that each contribute and you can like custom formulate a pill.

1915
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,140
It's like, hmm, you know, I want to be I want to be successful.

1916
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,620
I want to be a successful capitalist.

1917
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:28,580
So like, give me like, give me like, you know, maybe give me a pill once once a day.

1918
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,700
Give me that musk shit.

1919
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:33,420
Yeah, yeah, 40 percent Elon Musk, 20 percent Jordan Peterson,

1920
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:38,180
maybe maybe a dash of Steve Jobs, you know, Joe Rogan in there.

1921
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:39,540
So they still like to be extracted.

1922
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,260
Dude, OK, I'm shit from his corpse.

1923
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:44,180
There's going to be literally there's going to be Ben St.

1924
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,220
shit flavored vapes in the near future.

1925
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:53,060
And you can get if you subscribe to loot shit, my new box based shit subscription service.

1926
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,980
Comes with randomized normy, normy shit.

1927
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:02,740
Normy shit should be a flavor of fuck energy in my in my discord last night.

1928
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:06,300
We were all thrown out like ideas for for fuck energy flavors.

1929
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:10,700
I'm I'm a fan of a water flavor, just urine.

1930
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,540
How long is it going to be before I can get over the counter jankum?

1931
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,380
Soon. Oh, man.

1932
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:19,620
Well, that's a whole legalizer.

1933
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:21,220
Man, I want to I want to start.

1934
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:25,460
I legitimately would be so excited to start like a like a like like garage,

1935
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:30,180
like drink canning business and just like put it in like local like vending machines.

1936
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:32,780
Fuck energy drink the fuck energy.

1937
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:33,980
The competition.

1938
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:37,180
This is this is like an amazing market because.

1939
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:38,820
Yeah, like it is.

1940
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:43,140
Yeah, because everybody I mean, anybody who has who can prove the value

1941
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:47,540
of their shit can sell their shit in this market place we're describing.

1942
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:53,060
Like if if all you have to do is market yourself as somebody with desirable shit.

1943
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:58,220
So like the competition is endless, like nobody can just make the best shit.

1944
01:27:58,580 --> 01:27:58,980
That's true.

1945
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:02,300
Everybody's going to have somebody else who they who's shit they want.

1946
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,980
They're all the kind of shit that they enjoy the most.

1947
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:09,500
The Japanese, as always, so far ahead, you can buy you can buy sexy girl

1948
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,100
shit in vending machines in little capsules, I'm sure.

1949
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,260
I don't know. I know.

1950
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,780
And for those who wish to be a little girl, they got your cover.

1951
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:17,740
It's so much easier.

1952
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:21,020
It's just girl shit.

1953
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,220
Some guys who have been trying that for years and it hasn't had much effect,

1954
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:28,780
but maybe maybe with a higher concentration.

1955
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,820
Well, what have we solved it?

1956
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,740
We solved every problem.

1957
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:38,180
Each shit get fuck energy.

1958
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,140
That is I think that's all for this episode.

1959
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,060
Yeah, I think we've run the game over the voicemails.

1960
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,380
Move on to voicemails now.

1961
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:47,180
This this was great.

1962
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:47,980
This was great and breezy.

1963
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,940
I didn't get to like half the things I want to talk about.

1964
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:50,980
That's how you know it's a good episode.

1965
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:51,700
That's how it should be.

1966
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:57,100
I like how much he's like rushing us to the end and then saying he has more to say.

1967
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,260
Well, I mean, I could go on with these things.

1968
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,900
Always go on for like two fucking hundred hours.

1969
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,060
You know, I want to go in later.

1970
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:06,660
I mean, I really think that we should, as we're recording these,

1971
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:09,420
we should reach a point where we say to ourselves,

1972
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:11,580
you know what, we've literally done enough.

1973
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,380
Like we can just pick it up next week.

1974
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:17,900
Like there's no need to, you know, jam stuff in where it does need to be.

1975
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,820
Because I don't know.

1976
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,980
That's how I feel anyway.

1977
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:24,700
Around this time, it's better to leave on a high note than in a low note.

1978
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,500
Even when there's more. Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1979
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:28,260
That's true. What is it?

1980
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:29,900
You know, I heard somebody say something the other day.

1981
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:33,220
It was about like it was why did someone famous like retire

1982
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:36,660
before they like like their career like totally bottomed out?

1983
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:39,540
And I think it was I think it was on Joe Rogan, some comedian or something.

1984
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,780
And it was just like because you want to retire

1985
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:45,060
with something left in the tank, because you want to use that gas

1986
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,300
you got left to like start your next thing.

1987
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,860
And I think like topics on episodes.

1988
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:52,140
I think that applies to that reasonably, reasonably successfully.

1989
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,060
It's not like these things go away.

1990
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:54,940
Yeah, exactly.

1991
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:57,660
And I mean, if there's something topical that has to be discussed that week,

1992
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,700
that should be like the first thing you discuss anyway.

1993
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:04,100
So I wish I had been more on top of the fucking eating normally shit thing.

1994
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,900
But I guess that was a strong finish.

1995
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,940
All right, well, then let's get to the fucking voicemails.

1996
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,140
Yeah, let's do it.

1997
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,060
Read read read.

1998
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:14,340
Yeah, bail, jpe, read the vapors.

1999
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:16,820
Click on the vaporettes.

2000
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:17,900
Listen to my album.

2001
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,100
Click on the pump contest.

2002
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,220
Digi, put that's true.

2003
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:23,060
Digi, put them in the put them in the show.

Yeah, put links to my fucking put a link to the world over

01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:30,460
and the unknown tape and the fuck off mix tape.

2006
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:32,900
Digi, let's get the people something really easy.

2007
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:36,340
Digi, if there was one project that we should that we,

2008
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,460
your potential audio listener, music people should go listen to,

2009
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,300
what's the one thing we should go listen to?

2010
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,900
Oh, see, I'm just saying make it easy for us.

2011
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:45,540
Give us a table.

2012
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,180
You know what?

2013
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,020
Because everybody's going to like a different one.

2014
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,620
All right, Digi, news next episode.

2015
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:55,300
Next episode, I will have the listen to the world over and we will discuss it.

2016
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:55,780
Be there next time.

2017
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,180
That's it.

2018
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:56,740
The world over.

2019
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,860
Listen to the world over.

2020
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:58,420
There you go.

2021
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:58,980
All right, cool.

2022
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,460
That's my personal favorite.

2023
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:03,060
Also on next episode,

2024
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:07,140
I will have read the fucking yokai ghost hunter bullshit.

2025
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:07,780
So right.

2026
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,740
Tune in for that too.

2027
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,860
Read the real along with me.

2028
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:13,140
This is this is the we're laying seas right now here ladies and gentlemen.

2029
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,460
And go to Gibbs fucking pump Kickstarter.

2030
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,940
And give him money for plushes.

2031
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,140
I want those to be real.

2032
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:22,420
If anyone deserves it,

2033
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:25,620
literally lower your pledge to the PCP to donate.

2034
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,980
No, don't do that.

2035
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,100
Earn more money.

2036
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:29,220
That's my counter.

2037
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:33,300
Oh, the fucking phone here.

2038
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:34,820
However, 40.

2039
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:35,220
What is it?

2040
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:36,020
$40 for one?

2041
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:36,980
That's not a bad price.

2042
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,260
It's about it's about 40 bucks plus shipping.

2043
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:45,300
For custom made plus she that doesn't sound unreasonable to me.

2044
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:50,100
Yeah, I think if any of you have not read the comic and you're thinking,

2045
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:54,020
I don't know about plush, there's plenty of time for you to read it

2046
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:56,420
and then become a fan enough that you will want to buy one.

2047
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:57,060
That's true.

2048
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:01,220
Please consider indoctrinate yourself into buying it by reading the comic.

2049
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,780
All right, let's go to the voice bells.

2050
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:04,340
Yeah, here we go.

2051
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,540
Okay, now first of all,

2052
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,700
now I don't know if this was the thing you guys did last week

2053
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,140
while I was away or something,

2054
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:15,060
but there's a guy who named his thing voicemail theme contest.

2055
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,580
Is this a thing that started?

2056
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,140
Is this happening?

2057
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:17,540
No.

2058
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:17,620
No?

2059
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:18,260
No.

2060
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:18,820
Okay, okay.

2061
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:22,500
Well, then forget that part because he also just called it PCP hype man.

2062
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,260
So we'll use this as our prerequisite to the voicemails for today.

2063
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,860
So, okay, take it away.

2064
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:31,860
Go.

2065
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:38,980
Everybody, let's get ready for the PCP voice mails.

2066
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:43,220
When I say PC, you say P.

2067
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,100
Oh no.

2068
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,220
You say P.

2069
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:45,940
P.

2070
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:46,900
You say P.

2071
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,700
P.

2072
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:51,060
When I say voice, you say mails.

2073
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:52,020
Voice.

2074
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:52,820
Mails.

2075
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:53,780
Voice.

2076
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,580
Mails.

2077
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:58,020
When I say patreon.com, you say slash bensake.

2078
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:58,180
No.

2079
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:59,140
Let's go with the top.

2080
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,180
No, no.

2081
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:01,140
Slash bensake, bro.

2082
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,100
Bluey baton.

2083
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:03,380
patreon.com.

2084
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:04,980
Slash bensake.

2085
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,340
I went to the bathroom, but I'm back.

2086
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,460
It was the pep rally.

2087
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:15,860
God damn it, I went to the bathroom.

2088
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:18,580
I went to the bathroom and then I'm like, oh my god, he said bensake.

2089
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,660
I gotta rush back and complete the challenge.

2090
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,900
You made it in time for the second one.

2091
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,220
Well, great.

2092
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:25,940
I'm spent.

2093
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:27,140
I'm tired.

2094
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,100
Okay, let's go on.

2095
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,380
I'm so tired, everybody.

2096
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:30,180
So tired.

2097
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:31,540
All right.

2098
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:32,740
First real voicemail.

2099
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:35,140
I think this is a follow up to last week or so.

2100
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,620
It's called I, or am I a furry?

2101
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,260
Okay, go.

2102
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:40,420
Hello again.

2103
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:44,100
It's me, the one that did you call this furry the last time.

2104
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,100
Because you said my voice sounded like a furry.

2105
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:52,340
So this is a complicated subject because I don't identify as a furry.

2106
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:59,460
Because my definition of a furry is someone who actually like identifies as an animal.

2107
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,660
Like I, in my definition of what a furry is, it's like other kin.

2108
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:09,620
But from what I understand, talking to other people, she called me a furry.

2109
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:15,780
Like people's definitions of furry is different and it appears to be a spectrum.

2110
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:18,900
So I'm curious to know what your definition of a furry is.

2111
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,740
Like I don't identify as an animal.

2112
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,540
Like it'd be a dog.

2113
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:26,340
If you find that art style to be in any way appealing, you're a furry.

2114
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:29,540
I don't identify, I don't believe I myself am a furry because I don't want to get up

2115
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:33,060
in a fur suit and tell people I'm a dog because I understand I'm not.

2116
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:37,460
So what's your definition of a furry and what makes a furry and what

2117
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,580
does not make a furry?

2118
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,660
Oh my God, it goes on forever.

2119
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:41,940
So I could have got that up or whatever.

2120
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:45,700
Everyone's insane too.

2121
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:51,140
If you are capable of appreciating the furry art style, you're a furry.

2122
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:53,380
I mean, I could appreciate it.

2123
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,700
There is no one furry art style.

2124
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:59,620
You're not a furry just because you like Disney's Robin Hood.

2125
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:00,260
And I do.

2126
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:00,660
Let me tell you.

2127
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,420
That's not the furry art style.

2128
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:05,060
Okay, no, okay, listen.

2129
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,460
Here's the argument, Ben, you've heard it before.

2130
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:11,780
If you're a furry, if you say you're a furry, if you honestly believe that you are a furry,

2131
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,860
it can mean whatever the fuck you want it to mean.

2132
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:18,980
As long as you engage with the community and believe yourself to be one, then you are one.

2133
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,500
You don't, furries doesn't...

2134
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,340
No, stop, stop, stop.

2135
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,660
Furry doesn't mean you have to be in a fur suit.

2136
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,660
Furry doesn't mean that you have to draw like other furries.

2137
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:29,060
And it doesn't mean that you have to be a fucking under-otherkin.

2138
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,340
It's literally its own word.

2139
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:33,380
What are you insane for thinking that means the same thing?

2140
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:35,780
No, furry just means if you think you're a furry.

2141
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:39,300
Okay, but you just said a bunch of contradictory things.

2142
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:43,860
You said if you think you're a furry, then you are one, comma, if you engage with the community.

2143
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:46,100
Those, like, do you have to engage with the community?

2144
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:50,740
No, but I think it makes sense that if you engage with the community, then you would be a furry.

2145
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,140
I think that...

2146
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:52,180
What is that?

2147
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:52,980
It doesn't have to.

2148
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:56,340
What I said, if you think you have yourself as a furry, then you are one.

2149
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:00,660
Let me kick the can down the road a little bit.

2150
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:05,220
Okay, so maybe we can agree that if you think you're a furry, then you're a furry.

2151
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:09,620
But what criteria would you use to decide whether you yourself are a furry?

2152
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:11,380
I mean, it could depend on a lot of issues.

2153
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:14,180
I mean, it's different for every person whether or not you're a furry.

2154
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:17,380
Okay, well, that does gay and retarded.

2155
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,980
Why is it gay and retarded?

2156
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:23,140
That if you think that that art is appealing, you're a furry.

2157
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:24,180
It's not that art.

2158
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:26,020
There's a ton of different art in the furry community.

2159
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:29,860
That would include so many people who don't consider themselves furries.

2160
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,060
It's not the quality or the design of the art.

2161
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:43,540
If you could magically have two pieces of art that are equivalent in your mind as equally good,

2162
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:48,820
and one has a snout and one is a human, one has a tail, which one do you prefer?

2163
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:50,660
It's a preferential thing.

2164
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:53,700
It's not quantifiable, really.

2165
01:36:54,420 --> 01:37:01,540
It's just like would you rather see anthropomorphized animals instead of a human?

2166
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:06,420
I don't know if I would agree with the collars claim that you have to consider yourself an animal.

2167
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:07,140
No, not at all.

2168
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:07,780
Of course not.

2169
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:12,020
I think you could maybe make a case that you're not really a furry until you have a first sona.

2170
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,140
No.

2171
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:14,260
I don't know if that's necessarily true.

2172
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:16,180
There are plenty of furries that don't have first sonsa.

2173
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:21,940
Can we back up for a second and remember that what she asked is what do you consider to be a furry?

2174
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:26,820
She didn't ask what is the definition which nobody can pin down at all.

2175
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:29,220
We're all going to have our own meaning for it.

2176
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,940
Let's go to the higher authority here, guys.

2177
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:35,380
Urban Dictionary has an extensive definition of furry.

2178
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,740
Let me just read the sample.

2179
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:37,540
Hold on.

2180
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:38,180
Wait, wait, wait.

2181
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:45,060
Before you do, I just want to say that what I said was assuming that you at least know what a furry is

2182
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:46,260
in an abstract.

2183
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:50,580
Like obviously if you were just some random person and you just thought to yourself randomly,

2184
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:54,740
like you had a seizure and your brain thought of thought that dad had no meaning to it,

2185
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,300
I'm a furry now and you had no consequence of what a furry is.

2186
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:58,580
I'm not saying that you are one now.

2187
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:05,220
If somebody was like, well, I'm attracted to men and I love sucking cock,

2188
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:09,460
but I'm not gay because doesn't being gay mean you have to take it in the ass?

2189
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:11,540
I'd be like, no, you're still gay.

2190
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,820
Yeah, like that's what this call was like to me.

2191
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:21,380
It's like, hey, I like what I like the things that furries like just not this and this and this.

2192
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:26,180
And it's like, yeah, but I mean, if you like any of it, then that's not I think as long as you're

2193
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:30,100
for a fan of anthropomorphic animals and you consider yourself to be one than your furry.

2194
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:38,180
I guess, I mean, basically, we're down to the to the sorting hat problem of if you don't want to

2195
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:41,860
be one, I guess you aren't one, even if you exhibit all the signs.

2196
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:47,300
Yes, well, okay, well, what if you like the art, but you don't consider yourself to be one?

2197
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:48,500
Well, then you aren't one.

2198
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:54,020
Well, okay, I guess like, I mean, if you if you if you love anime,

2199
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:58,260
I mean, you don't have to believe that you are.

2200
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:00,260
Are you like considered an animaniac?

2201
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:05,700
You don't have to consider yourself to be something for other people to consider you to be it.

2202
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,860
That's that's what I was going to say.

2203
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:13,380
I think I think it I would say that it is possible for someone to be a furry and not

2204
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,180
know that they are.

2205
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:16,980
But your definition precludes that possibility, Munchie.

2206
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:20,900
Well, I mean, they would not concern to themselves to be one.

2207
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,260
No, I mean, the bottom line is.

2208
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:26,340
So you don't you don't think that you don't think that a person can be a furry,

2209
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:32,580
but not realize nobody can be a furry, because there is no definition of it.

2210
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,580
It's only in the eye of the beholder.

2211
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:41,300
Like, it's up to you, your definition to say therefore, no, not up to the person.

2212
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:46,500
It's up to every single individual upon observation of a person to determine if that person's a

2213
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,020
furry in your mind.

2214
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,580
So I mean, I guess that person can say they're not a furry.

2215
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,980
I can disagree with them about what they are.

2216
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:56,100
They can feel that they are more correct because they are themselves.

2217
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:57,700
But it will not change my opinion.

2218
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:05,220
We are seeking a robust and universal theory of furredom here.

2219
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,860
But it doesn't exist in an intellectual exercise.

2220
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:08,740
It might not exist.

2221
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,500
But isn't it isn't it more about the journey?

2222
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:14,100
You know, this is a real definition of furry is the friends we made along this

2223
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:19,780
reminds me of the label of brony, which I personally so I had an OC.

2224
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:22,740
I mean, you know, you could argue that it was like a joke, which it was.

2225
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,700
But I mean, you know, it existed.

2226
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:31,140
I made videos about my little pony was, you know, relatively heavily engaged.

2227
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:37,620
I never once claimed or considered myself a brony and still don't think I ever fit

2228
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,060
that label personally.

2229
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,500
But I'm sure many people would say that I have in hindsight.

2230
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:47,140
I don't think I think it's pretty clear that we were bronies, even if we did take it with

2231
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:49,540
a high sort of but see, I don't agree.

2232
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:53,460
You watched my videos for enjoyment.

2233
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,940
Why would that make you a brony?

2234
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:56,900
We watched the show.

2235
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:00,020
That's the only definition that I could even imagine.

2236
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:02,180
Like what other definition is there?

2237
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,300
You like the show.

2238
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,020
We did it.

2239
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:05,700
We did everything bronies do.

2240
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:09,860
Would you would you say that a little girl who watches the show and enjoys the show

2241
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:11,940
and then watches your videos is a brony?

2242
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:12,980
Absolutely.

2243
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,780
I think so.

2244
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,180
Yeah.

2245
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:18,420
Is there any way to watch your videos for enjoyment and not be a brony?

2246
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:24,180
If you are watching my videos because you like the show and you like the videos because

2247
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,300
they're about the show, that is exhibiting fandom for the show, which is the fandom of

2248
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:30,900
the show is referred to as bronies.

2249
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:32,340
I mean, you know what?

2250
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,980
I guess I feel kinship with this person that I feel maybe in my mind, the definition of

2251
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:40,180
brony had additional characteristics that maybe other people don't share.

2252
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:42,500
Maybe I'm just wrong about it, but that's what I think.

2253
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:47,300
This is the thing because back in the ye old days when I had a tumblr, there were certain

2254
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:53,860
people I followed who were not bronies and brony things were like blowing up and people

2255
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:56,660
considered bronies to be rapists at the time.

2256
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:04,180
If you call yourself a brony, you are a rapist because you're an apedophile and it was all

2257
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:05,860
that sort of like oh geez.

2258
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:13,220
So like to say like if somebody asks you are you a brony, you're not just defining yourself

2259
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:18,900
by the show, you're labeling yourself in a way that allows people who have an idea of

2260
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:22,500
what that label is to judge you based on that idea of the label.

2261
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,780
I'll say right now.

2262
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:28,900
To not call yourself a brony is just to, you could consider yourself a brony, but if you

2263
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:32,420
say publicly that you're a brony, people will think certain things and if you don't do that,

2264
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,140
then that's just a choice.

2265
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:35,540
I think it's stupid to label yourself at all.

2266
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:41,860
I think that I understand why people do it for a sense of community and being a part of

2267
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:46,740
something, but you're just giving everyone else the reins to interpret it as they see fit.

2268
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:50,980
I would rather reject the labels.

2269
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:56,980
If somebody wants to label me, they can believe whatever they want, but I don't want to put

2270
01:42:56,980 --> 01:43:00,900
a label on myself because I know that it means different things to different people.

2271
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:07,300
What am I going to explain what I mean every single time I talk to somebody and a lot of

2272
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,900
them are just going to disagree with my definition.

2273
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:14,980
I call this the feminist problem because everybody who calls himself a feminist has a

2274
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:18,660
different definition of what it means and they'll explain it to you and they'll say,

2275
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:22,260
well, if you fit this, this, and this characteristic, that means you're a feminist,

2276
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:24,100
but then the next person will say, well, I disagree.

2277
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,820
And I just go, how about we just don't call ourselves anything.

2278
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:31,380
Just have a set of beliefs and just be you who has that set of beliefs.

2279
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:37,620
This desire to boil things down into a single word results inevitably in this problem.

2280
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:42,100
So yeah, you've got to boil it back up or boil it down to the actual arguments that you're

2281
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:44,180
trying to make and it's fucking annoying.

2282
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:51,380
When I see a furry, I become a fury and I arch my back and I hiss and I get my claws out

2283
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,660
and I'm ready to pounce on this piece.

2284
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:58,420
I just really love insisting to people that they are furries because of the fact that people are

2285
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:04,580
so resistant to it and they're resistant to it and they almost don't know why.

2286
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:11,060
They're like, oh, well, well, surely, surely I'm not, it's not just the lack of liking labels,

2287
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:17,620
it's that they want to believe that they are not so far gone when they are definitely a little

2288
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:22,660
far gone, you know, like I'm in front of May for this constantly because she was like,

2289
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:29,300
she was like had like a fursona kit fox when she was younger and like she insists that she's not

2290
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:32,660
a furry, but like warrior cats are just cats.

2291
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,180
They are not anthropomorphized.

2292
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,940
Well, yeah, but she had a anthropomorphized kit fox character.

2293
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:39,620
What do you mean they're not anthropomorphized?

2294
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:44,100
Like physically, but they are given explicit personalities, names, and motivations.

2295
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,140
I have never, ever seen warrior cats or know what they look like.

2296
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:50,740
It has been explained to me that they look like normal cats.

2297
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:51,300
Sure.

2298
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,740
I'm sure they have personalities.

2299
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:55,860
You can anthropomorphize them in other ways, it's not physical.

2300
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:59,460
Of course, but like, is that what we mean when we say furry?

2301
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,860
Someone who looks like a literal cat?

2302
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:02,500
It could be.

2303
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,660
I mean, I don't think that's that.

2304
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:07,620
Again, we fall into the label problem, because when you think furry, you think

2305
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:10,260
the furry art style, which this does not fall under.

2306
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:13,460
The fun in it is just, it's just pushing people.

2307
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:14,740
It's just pushing up again.

2308
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:19,940
Like it's, it's funny to see, I guess, because of the fact that, you know, I don't like to

2309
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:25,620
label myself, but like if other people want to call me something, it doesn't matter to me that

2310
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:25,860
much.

2311
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:29,300
And so it's really funny to me when people get so upset when you call them something,

2312
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,420
like it cracks me up to see how resistant people will be.

2313
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,180
To being called something.

2314
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:36,100
And it's just like, dude, just embrace it.

2315
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:36,900
You like furry shit.

2316
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:37,620
Like, who cares?

2317
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:40,100
Like, it doesn't have to say anything about you.

2318
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:44,980
I suppose, but I mean, weren't you just arguing that you hate labels?

2319
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:49,300
So like, why wouldn't they also do the same thing and be like, no, why box me in?

2320
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:51,300
Let me just like my thing and not label it.

2321
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:57,940
It's, it's not a matter of, it's like, you shouldn't care what somebody else is calling you.

2322
01:45:57,940 --> 01:45:58,740
You know, it's like.

2323
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:01,620
You kind of want them to accept the label that you're pushing on them.

2324
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:03,220
And you're laughing when they resist it.

2325
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:07,060
I'm laughing because they care so much.

2326
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:11,460
I'm laughing because they're trying so hard to not be called something.

2327
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,180
When it doesn't matter, you know, I get you.

2328
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:18,420
I also think it's a unique digi to furries in a way where it's like, it's, it's really like,

2329
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:21,300
I saw this a lot in Bernie's where it's like, dude, what?

2330
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:24,180
Bernie's are not furries.

2331
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:25,940
What are you fucking talking about?

2332
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:26,900
Leave me alone.

2333
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,420
It's like, you know, listen, yeah, okay, I get you.

2334
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:32,820
But like, it's clear you're really insecure about it.

2335
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:38,500
It's that I don't consider it an insult to call someone a furry or a brony or whatever.

2336
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,380
It's like, I respect all these different things that people like.

2337
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:45,460
So when I see somebody who's like, so resistant to being called that thing,

2338
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:49,300
it implies that you, you yourself don't respect that label.

2339
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:54,180
Like you think, oh, I don't want to be a fucking furry because those guys are weird.

2340
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:56,100
And it's like, yeah, but you're also weird.

2341
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,220
So shut the fuck up.

2342
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:58,900
You know, that's why it's funny to me.

2343
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,100
Hardcore resident.

2344
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:00,900
Good job.

2345
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,700
Excellent.

2346
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:04,900
Okay, well, hey, wait, wait, no, no, before we go to the next voicemail,

2347
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:10,180
I just want to say that this person, first of all, I have no idea if you're a furry or not,

2348
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:14,180
because I don't really know, you know, I mean, what do you think it doesn't mean,

2349
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:15,140
what you think it means.

2350
01:47:15,140 --> 01:47:16,420
It's not under other kin.

2351
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:18,980
Do you consider yourself a furry?

2352
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:19,780
You know, ask yourself that.

2353
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:22,580
But also you brought this up by mentioning your voice.

2354
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:25,780
And now you have the furry voice about how furry is the voice.

2355
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:28,660
And this is 100% true.

2356
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:34,500
This is actually factual and this and this is and this is and this is the only red

2357
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:40,020
quick list for being a furry is if you have the furry voice, the furry girl voice.

2358
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:43,780
I'm not trying to shit on this person excessively much, but it's interesting that their defense

2359
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:49,300
for not being a furry is that they do not believe themselves to be an animal,

2360
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:52,500
which I don't really think is much of a defense against.

2361
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,980
That's that's like a that's like an extremist view of what a furry is.

2362
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,980
A furry is not an other can.

2363
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:01,300
We can all agree those two things are not identical.

2364
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:04,740
I was watching a video that she'll not be named.

2365
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:08,500
Although, although, although actually there's I think what she's thinking of is a

2366
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:12,340
farion because an other can is someone who believes themselves to be like a like an

2367
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:13,540
angel or a demon.

2368
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:16,820
A farion is someone who has like an animal spirit and identifies as an animal.

2369
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:20,740
We can give her credit that she clearly isn't a part of a furry community

2370
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:25,460
because yeah, that's these things like because if you were to ask a furry,

2371
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:28,340
if a furry is the same as another can, they're going to say no,

2372
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:33,860
like there's there's as well say I was I was watching a video and

2373
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:39,300
farion might actually just be a subset of other other can.

2374
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:44,580
So I might personally, by the way, extensive audio from a girl that had the furry voice

2375
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:50,740
and it was extremely amusing the furry voice, which can be broadly also categorized as internet

2376
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:56,500
girl. Like like when you're a girl, when you're a fan artist, like a fan girl artist on the

2377
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,220
internet, you just like stop aging.

2378
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:04,340
I'm convinced whenever you like become really interested in something and you're on DeviantArt

2379
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:11,780
slash or Tumblr, your brain and body just stop and you turn into a 13 year old looking

2380
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:15,380
like boy for the rest of your life and you sound like it too.

2381
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:20,180
So you can be like 20, like seven years old, but if you liked warrior cats once,

2382
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:24,820
then you're going to look like you're 13 and sound like you're 13 and act like you're 13 forever.

2383
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:28,980
Like it's just it's like a bizarre genetic disease transmitted through the internet.

2384
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:30,100
And I see it all the time.

2385
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:35,380
We have like a vague lisp and you sort of stutter over your words and and and you just

2386
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:37,780
can't get the words out sometimes.

2387
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,780
Wait, wait, wait.

2388
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:44,740
I think I'm going to have to reevaluate some things really soon.

2389
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:48,500
Okay, all right, let's go on to our next fucking call here.

2390
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,940
We got a handful more.

2391
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:51,700
Okay, this one's from Chillin' Chocolate.

2392
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:53,460
Old call, man.

2393
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,580
Let's let's see what he's got for us.

2394
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,180
My life is fucking L and my fucking L is my life.

2395
01:49:58,180 --> 01:49:58,900
All right.

2396
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,620
You see, there's a girl I like from school, but there's only one.

2397
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:07,460
Do I risk telling her how I feel or do I just leave things on set?

2398
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:10,660
Do I want try to go for a short term relationship?

2399
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:10,980
Say it.

2400
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:16,340
Have a nice time together or, you know, with the like most beautiful and intelligent and

2401
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:18,500
nice person I know or just fucking.

2402
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,100
What do I just give up and shrivel?

2403
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:23,140
What do I do?

2404
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:25,300
Okay, hang on.

2405
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:25,940
You know what?

2406
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:28,420
Actually, giving up and shrivel sounds kind of nice.

2407
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:32,420
I liked a girl in my art class in my senior year

2408
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:35,780
and I regretted for years not saying anything to her.

2409
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:39,700
Okay, what is what is this man actually asking us right now?

2410
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:40,500
We're not doing it.

2411
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:41,300
Can you imagine?

2412
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,980
He's going to graduate, so like.

2413
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:45,300
Right, he's graduating in a month and presumably he's going into college

2414
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,340
and will be separated.

2415
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,100
What he's really asking is,

2416
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:52,660
okay, look, I get the idea of wanting to get like emotionally involved with someone

2417
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:56,500
who you will inevitably be separated from relatively shortly.

2418
01:50:56,500 --> 01:51:00,180
Do I think this relationship is going to last very long if you get split up,

2419
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:01,620
you know, over a distance?

2420
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:02,420
It's certainly not.

2421
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:04,420
But listen to the real question you're asking.

2422
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:10,340
You're asking is, is it worth putting in the effort to like do a good thing like now,

2423
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:13,060
just because it like won't literally last forever?

2424
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:17,860
You're just asking us for an excuse to not put in the effort to do something you already

2425
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:18,820
want to do.

2426
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,260
And you fucking pussy.

2427
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:23,620
You should have already asked her like months and years ago.

2428
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,700
Obviously, you've wanted to for a long time.

2429
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,180
Even if.

2430
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,220
So fucking do it.

2431
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:30,900
Even if all, like, even if you get emotionally invested and you get heartbroken,

2432
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:33,540
at least you might get some like.

2433
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,100
Life experience, a starter bitch.

2434
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:38,260
Get your starter bitch out of the way, dude.

2435
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:40,420
I mean, look, heartbreak is going to come.

2436
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,620
It's going to happen.

2437
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:44,980
Even if you had a relationship that lasted,

2438
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:47,220
she's going to fucking die on you one day, man.

2439
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,260
You're going to have 60 years.

2440
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:52,740
These bitches just be dying on us out here.

2441
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:57,860
I mean, at the very like, if you're really like shrively, shrively,

2442
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:59,300
oh, I can't possibly do it.

2443
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:02,580
Just like write it on a piece of paper like I like you, haha.

2444
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:03,700
And then like, give it to her.

2445
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:05,460
Say, hello, please read this.

2446
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:10,420
And then she takes it and you run away, run away screaming because, you know,

2447
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:11,300
at least then you'll have.

2448
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:13,940
Okay, kind of like, think about the other thing that he brought up.

2449
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:17,140
I guess it's better to do it in a horribly embarrassing way

2450
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:17,860
than not at all.

2451
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:21,060
Think about the way that he frames this though.

2452
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:23,220
He's like, oh my God, do I want to make it awkward

2453
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:25,540
for the last like month among these nine people?

2454
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:27,220
Think about, shoot, the stakes,

2455
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:29,780
the stakes have literally never been lower.

2456
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:32,260
You're about to all split up anyway.

2457
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:36,500
So like what, like, what is your reasoning that like now is a bad time to do it?

2458
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,860
It's like the whole school is going to be up.

2459
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:40,500
So it's nine people and you're graduating in a month.

2460
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,340
Okay. Why would it even be awkward?

2461
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:43,300
Like you asked her out.

2462
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,900
She said, no, who gives a shit.

2463
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:48,420
This transaction happens a million times a day in your school, I'm sure.

2464
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:51,620
These things are awkward, especially for people who haven't done it much.

2465
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,820
Okay, but you got to get over that too.

2466
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:54,580
And now is your time to get over it.

2467
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:55,940
I mean, okay, maybe you love her.

2468
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:57,460
You think she's your specialsome pony.

2469
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:58,260
You know, I get it.

2470
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:59,380
I get it, my dude.

2471
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:02,900
But like, there's no reason not to start now.

2472
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:06,180
And I mean, just taking a step further to a place nobody wants to go.

2473
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:10,980
Like I do think that the whole thing of forming relationships

2474
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:14,660
and having them tragically end and feeling devastated by them emotionally,

2475
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,860
I think it's ultimately good for you anyway.

2476
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:21,540
And I really think you should just get that shit out of the way in your life

2477
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:23,220
so that you can move on.

2478
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:25,860
And frankly, like talk about a clean slate.

2479
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:28,180
If you're going to college or whatever and getting split up,

2480
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:30,580
then like there's not going to be like, I was weird, dude.

2481
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:33,620
My, I broke up with my girlfriend in college and my senior year,

2482
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:34,740
like she was like around.

2483
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:36,420
And let me tell you, I made it awkward.

2484
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:39,460
But the good news with you is you don't have to do that.

2485
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:41,860
You're going to be free and you will stop.

2486
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:45,940
Here's the another, here's a black pill on relationships.

2487
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:50,980
The second that you like have a fleeting glimmer with a girl

2488
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:52,740
past the girl that you just broke up with.

2489
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:55,460
Like, okay, you have this, whatever, month long relationship,

2490
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:57,300
three month long relationship until you leave.

2491
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:59,620
You're all sad, boo-hoo, I broke up with the girl.

2492
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:04,260
Your mammalian mating instincts will make you not give a fuck.

2493
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:07,860
As soon as you meet some sweet young thing at your college or whatever,

2494
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:11,060
and she's interested, you will no longer give a shit

2495
01:54:11,140 --> 01:54:12,820
that that girl broke up with you.

2496
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:16,980
And you've got a new girl because that's just how human beings work.

2497
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:18,420
So there you go.

2498
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,140
So do it.

2499
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:21,140
Why literally listen to this message.

2500
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:22,340
Call her immediately.

2501
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:23,940
You have no excuse.

2502
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:27,060
Make her laugh in some funny way and say, ha, ha, wouldn't it be so funny

2503
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:29,940
if we watched some piece of shit movie together?

2504
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:31,700
Ha, ha, epic joke, whatever.

2505
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:32,580
It doesn't matter.

2506
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:33,780
Make up an excuse.

2507
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:34,340
Okay, okay.

2508
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:37,380
People have come to the piece of pee with like girl advice before,

2509
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:40,260
which first of all, lol, but this one has like,

2510
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,980
this has evolved in a way where it's like,

2511
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:46,980
this one was like really like not like, you know, good.

2512
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:48,980
This one was like, um, I'm so stupid.

2513
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:49,780
I wanted to yell at this man.

2514
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:52,580
It was like weirdly self-deprecated in a way.

2515
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:54,420
And frankly, I'm not into it.

2516
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:55,140
And I hate you.

2517
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:56,820
I get where this guy is at.

2518
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,220
I think the fact that he called in.

2519
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:01,060
He was a little tongue-in-cheek.

2520
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:01,540
I get that.

2521
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:02,260
I get that.

2522
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:03,940
Let's talk about Ben's Tinder profile.

2523
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:08,420
I think that he maybe will actually get the push from this.

2524
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:10,260
I think maybe he was, like you were saying,

2525
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:11,940
he's looking for an excuse not to,

2526
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:13,780
but I don't think he possibly could have thought

2527
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:15,860
we were going to answer differently than we did.

2528
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:16,580
I agree.

2529
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,060
I agree with that.

2530
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:18,980
How many voicemails do I have to piss?

2531
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:19,860
We got like four.

2532
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,300
If you want to go piss, I'm going to go piss.

2533
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,100
Let's move on.

2534
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,460
This is, we've answered this question.

2535
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,420
We've definitely addressed this.

2536
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:24,740
Okay.

2537
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:28,100
This one's from, um, I'll, I think it's pronounced,

2538
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:31,140
I'll die corp voicemail bot.

2539
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:31,860
Sure, sure.

2540
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:32,580
I'll die.

2541
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:32,740
Yeah.

2542
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:33,060
Okay.

2543
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:33,220
Okay.

2544
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:34,500
So let's, uh, let's, let's play it.

2545
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:34,740
Go.

2546
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,700
Booting up.

2547
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:39,940
I'll die corporation voicemail bot.

2548
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:44,660
Cool.

2549
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:45,380
Tends to speech.

2550
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:47,860
I hear to tell you that procreation is immoral.

2551
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:51,060
Being brought into existence may allow you to experience good things,

2552
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:54,180
but it also makes you vulnerable to inevitable suffering.

2553
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:55,940
You cannot consent to being born.

2554
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:57,460
This is trivial to point out,

2555
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:00,020
but I fail to see how that makes it any better.

2556
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:02,180
The only justification for birth is that humans

2557
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:05,700
must continue to exist to create a weird utilitarian utopia.

2558
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:08,660
Still, in a world where millions of children are in need of adoption

2559
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:10,980
to be saved from shitty, shitty lives,

2560
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,540
what moral justification have you for leaving them in the shit

2561
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:16,020
and making a new person who may not ultimately want to exist

2562
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:17,460
to have a good life in their stead?

2563
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,100
Shutting down.

2564
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,340
I'll die corporation voicemail bot.

2565
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:28,020
Another one of these fucking unburthers.

2566
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:31,060
Another one of these procreation is immoral people.

2567
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:33,780
No dude, just adopt, just adopt.

2568
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:35,700
And then when there are no more kids to adopt,

2569
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,300
then you make another batch of them.

2570
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:39,620
Well, you know, okay.

2571
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:42,820
On this argument, I take sole responsibility

2572
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:45,540
when it comes to procreation for the specific children

2573
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,220
that I will be producing,

2574
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:49,380
which I will be producing at some point,

2575
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:51,060
I don't know, not too far from now,

2576
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:52,420
within 10 years I assume.

2577
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:55,220
So like when it comes to those children,

2578
01:56:55,220 --> 01:56:59,380
yeah, I accept full moral responsibility for producing them

2579
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:00,740
and putting them on the earth

2580
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:02,260
and them having to deal with like,

2581
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,540
struggles and whatnot.

2582
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:06,340
But I mean, look, you could even argue

2583
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:08,420
that most of life is suffering.

2584
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:11,140
However, looking at my life, for example,

2585
01:57:11,140 --> 01:57:13,780
I think that the joys I have experienced,

2586
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:16,260
which might not even outweigh the sorrows,

2587
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:18,740
are good enough that I'm glad that I lived.

2588
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:19,780
That's how I feel.

2589
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:25,780
The question is, why make a new person

2590
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:30,260
without their consent versus adopt an existing person

2591
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:32,500
who already exists regardless of consent?

2592
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,620
Did they bring up adoption?

2593
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:34,260
No, I didn't.

2594
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:34,980
Yes.

2595
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:35,460
Yeah.

2596
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:36,580
No, it was explicit.

2597
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:37,460
It was explicit.

2598
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:39,700
I have an answer for that for me personally,

2599
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:45,140
which is that there's a lot of things

2600
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:47,220
that are already going to be going on with that kid

2601
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:49,540
by the time you get a hold of them.

2602
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:53,140
I think that's fine.

2603
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:54,420
Like there's a lot of people who,

2604
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:56,420
and maybe even for me,

2605
01:57:56,420 --> 01:57:58,100
it would be good to take it a kid like that.

2606
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,140
Are you saying there's not going to be

2607
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:01,220
a lot of shit going on with your kid, did you?

2608
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:01,780
Well, it's more of a black slave.

2609
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:03,220
There's not going to be a lot going on with that.

2610
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:03,620
No.

2611
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:07,140
What I mean to say is that all of the programming

2612
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,740
will be done by me from the start?

2613
01:58:09,940 --> 01:58:10,660
No.

2614
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:11,060
Wrong.

2615
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:12,100
Well, more of it.

2616
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:15,620
He or she will come with a brain that you did not design.

2617
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:20,740
But it's a brain that came from the genetic code of me and May.

2618
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:22,420
So, like, I know.

2619
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:23,460
And you get it at ground zero.

2620
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:26,020
I don't know how much that's really worth in the final analysis.

2621
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:27,700
I think it's worth a lot of my ability to relate to.

2622
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:28,660
What does that really mean?

2623
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:34,660
Like, I think that if I have a kid that's, you know, that's mine,

2624
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:38,660
like, they're going to be a lot more similar to me.

2625
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:42,900
There's going to be a lot more ease in me being able to, you know,

2626
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:45,220
work with it.

2627
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:45,540
Maybe.

2628
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:49,780
I think, I mean, again, not to say that I couldn't maybe find,

2629
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:53,060
like, the perfect kid in an orphanage somewhere.

2630
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:55,540
But like, for the most part, like, you know,

2631
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:58,020
kids who are up for adoption are probably going to be from

2632
01:58:58,020 --> 01:58:59,300
pretty shitty backgrounds.

2633
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:03,540
And, you know, it's a lot of it's going to be rehabilitation.

2634
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:06,260
And that's, I mean, still, it's fine.

2635
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:11,700
I think that I think, you know, if somebody's really serious about that as,

2636
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:15,220
like, what they're trying to do as a parent is to just, like,

2637
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:20,100
make society better by creating a, you know, a human functioning as well.

2638
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:20,420
Yeah.

2639
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:21,860
That's probably the best way to go for it.

2640
01:59:21,860 --> 01:59:24,660
Like, for me, having a kid, there's, you know,

2641
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:27,700
obviously an element of ego and, like, you know,

2642
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:34,260
wanting to create one that's as close to what I'm hoping to accomplish as possible,

2643
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:35,140
if that makes sense.

2644
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:36,420
I got you.

2645
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:37,060
I got you.

2646
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:41,540
You know, it's kind of like getting a Pokemon at level one and training it up

2647
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:44,020
versus getting the same Pokemon at level 23.

2648
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:47,060
Your BioKid is going to have better EVs, is what you're saying.

2649
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:47,460
Yes.

2650
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:48,980
That's exactly what it looks like.

2651
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:49,220
Yeah.

2652
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:51,540
Now I get it.

2653
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:53,460
Let me boil this down to one phrase.

2654
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:57,460
And it's that, uh, I care more about my shit than your shit.

2655
01:59:57,460 --> 01:59:59,460
And I make no apology for it.

2656
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:01,300
And this applies on a genetic level.

2657
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:05,940
You know, I just, yeah, like, did you say an vanity is definitely a part of it.

2658
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:10,820
But also it's the fact that I plan on really optimizing my child rearing.

2659
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:13,540
And I mean that by, like, being as good a dad as possible.

2660
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:17,540
And, like, pragmatically speaking, even if I get a kid born one day old,

2661
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:19,940
I think there's a couple issues of, like, uh, you know,

2662
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:22,340
I don't know how much will be done to that kid before I get them.

2663
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:24,900
They're probably going to have had some shit done to them already.

2664
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:27,940
And I'm really looking to optimize my kid experience.

2665
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:28,980
And it's simple.

2666
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:30,180
You just, you can undo all that.

2667
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:31,940
You just put them through unbirthing therapy.

2668
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:32,180
That's fair.

2669
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:32,980
I'll also say this.

2670
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:37,700
Well, look, I'm, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm proud of my genes.

2671
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,820
I think, uh, my, my family, my genes too.

2672
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:42,820
My family's pretty long lived.

2673
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:44,260
I'm pretty smart of a guy.

2674
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:50,020
You know, May comes from a really tall family and she's tall for a girl.

2675
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:53,460
So like, we'll probably have some pretty tall kids, you know,

2676
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:54,740
probably taller than me.

2677
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,860
So that's cool.

2678
02:00:55,860 --> 02:01:00,020
You know, like it's, it's a good, I think it's a good combination of genes.

2679
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:05,060
And I'm like, I'm excited to see if I can create something better than myself.

2680
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:06,660
What a weird way to think about it.

2681
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:08,980
I mean, that is like the issue.

2682
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:12,420
Isn't that just a completely normal way to approach it that everyone has

2683
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:13,380
for all of human history?

2684
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:15,220
It's the unconsciously normal way.

2685
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:18,580
Cause like the only reason we like certain looks or like,

2686
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,700
Oh, this person looks good.

2687
02:01:19,700 --> 02:01:21,620
This person looks healthy or whatever.

2688
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,660
They're muscular.

2689
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,580
That is all because they have good genes.

2690
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:24,820
Right.

2691
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,260
Therefore our kids will be human.

2692
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:27,460
Humans are tribal, man.

2693
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:30,340
I want my kids to generally look like me, you know,

2694
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:32,100
I just think that's a normal thing to want.

2695
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:37,060
I thought that like my genes were really bad or dangerous.

2696
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:40,660
I would be a lot more hesitant to, I would probably want to adopt instead.

2697
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:45,380
Like I would think, okay, let me find a kid who, you know, who needs a home.

2698
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:51,860
But like if I feel like my offspring will benefit the human species, you know,

2699
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:53,700
it's very egotistical to think.

2700
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:54,980
But it's like, I don't know.

2701
02:01:54,980 --> 02:02:00,820
I feel some level of confidence in my genealogies deservedness to continue.

2702
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:01,540
Okay.

2703
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:04,740
But like it's not having the people who have,

2704
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:07,300
who had Hitler's genes said they'll never have children.

2705
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,860
Well, not, not having shitty genes,

2706
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:12,020
like not having genes that will fuck a kid up.

2707
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:13,860
It's not like a rare thing.

2708
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:17,140
You like lots of people have normal, functional, healthy genes.

2709
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:18,500
I mean, my genes, like, I don't know.

2710
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:19,860
Let's just say that I had, you know,

2711
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:21,620
I reproduced with like my current girlfriend,

2712
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:23,380
you know, with Michelle or whatever, if I did that,

2713
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:26,420
like there's potential that our particular combination of genes

2714
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:28,900
resulted in some like awful thing for the,

2715
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,940
like it's always possible.

2716
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:30,660
You don't know.

2717
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:33,620
I'm just saying, I don't know, might not go that way.

2718
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:37,380
And it's just, I like familiarity.

2719
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:40,020
So I'm going to go with kids that are my genetic kids.

2720
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:42,500
Just seems, you know, like a logical way to go.

2721
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:46,820
Now, now if you, to make it a larger argument though,

2722
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:49,940
like if this isn't the net benefit for the world,

2723
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:52,660
now on that, I get that argument that,

2724
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:54,980
that's fair to look into more to like, you know,

2725
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:57,140
deal with kids who are in poverty to maybe adopt them.

2726
02:02:57,140 --> 02:02:59,700
I'm not even opposed to adopting in general,

2727
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:01,620
but I'm not going to lie selfishly.

2728
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:03,300
I just want some kids that have my genes

2729
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:04,900
because you know what, it's just,

2730
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:07,300
I think I got a pretty good brain going on here.

2731
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:08,740
And like my brain patterns,

2732
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:10,900
obviously largely shaped by genes.

2733
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:12,740
So it seems reasonable to pass on.

2734
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,860
Here's what I mean.

2735
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:15,860
I get, but it's not your brain.

2736
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:16,180
What do you mean?

2737
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:16,500
I don't know.

2738
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:18,660
It's not like, yeah, maybe you'd have,

2739
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:20,420
maybe you'd have a kid with a great brain.

2740
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:21,140
So what?

2741
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:22,100
It's not your brain.

2742
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:22,820
It's someone else's brain.

2743
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,580
Oh, well, well, I bet I think that,

2744
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:26,660
that's a fair question, but I think it ties into the,

2745
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:28,580
like how is it that humans,

2746
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:30,340
like what's the purpose of human existence?

2747
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:32,740
I mean, probably to exert our influence

2748
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:34,100
over the world in some way.

2749
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:35,700
And like they say that, you know,

2750
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:37,460
reproduction is the kind of immortality

2751
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:38,740
that humans can obtain.

2752
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:41,700
So like I'm interested in propagating my genes to the future.

2753
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:44,740
If for no other reason than just the vanity of like,

2754
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:47,860
I still kind of continue to exist in this one way.

2755
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:49,460
And you know, I could do that by,

2756
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:51,140
let's just say being a teacher

2757
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:53,220
and like instilling my values on kids.

2758
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:53,540
Okay.

2759
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:54,740
That's a great way to do it.

2760
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:57,220
I just think another way is also genetically.

2761
02:03:57,220 --> 02:03:59,380
So I'm interested in doing that to cover all my basals.

2762
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:01,540
I definitely see that there is like,

2763
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:03,540
an argument to be made for like,

2764
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:06,260
your child will not necessarily be exactly

2765
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:07,780
how you want it to turn out.

2766
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,980
Whether you rear them from your own genes

2767
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:12,420
or whether you adopt them.

2768
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:14,020
It could be that the person you adopt

2769
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:16,020
will love you exactly the same way

2770
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:18,340
and will be even a better person in the end.

2771
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:20,020
But you can't know that either way.

2772
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:23,380
And so in the decision making process,

2773
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:25,940
selfishness is really the only thing that tips the scales.

2774
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,780
And I mean, I'm selfish in all other aspects of my life.

2775
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:30,660
Why not this one?

2776
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:32,020
Yeah.

2777
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:33,540
I mean, if you're extremely moral,

2778
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:38,660
if you hold that higher than selfishness,

2779
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:40,340
then you could go either way.

2780
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:44,260
I think I wouldn't like besmirch anyone

2781
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:45,940
for choosing one or the other, really.

2782
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:46,660
Yeah.

2783
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:48,500
I mean, I wouldn't say, you know,

2784
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,740
I don't think it's wrong to want to have your own kids.

2785
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:55,540
I do think that probably the ultimate moral thing to do

2786
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:57,940
is to adopt a kid that needs a family

2787
02:04:57,940 --> 02:04:59,300
rather than produce a new one.

2788
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:00,260
I get that.

2789
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:01,460
Yeah, I'll say that.

2790
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:03,620
I mean, and we also have to look at it this way.

2791
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:06,900
I mean, in an ideal system, I think,

2792
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:10,020
we would have some way of saying like,

2793
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:16,020
okay, we've measured your benefit to humanity.

2794
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:19,140
You should have kids, and you should not.

2795
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:20,180
You should adopt.

2796
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:23,700
And like, there's only so many kids who need to be adopted.

2797
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:25,620
Someone still has to make babies.

2798
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:29,140
You want to know my hot take.

2799
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:32,900
This is my hottest take, and I think everyone will hate it.

2800
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,020
And no one will like me.

2801
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:36,020
I just think we should abolish families.

2802
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:38,900
I really think that society would be better without...

2803
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:40,820
Yeah, I think society would be better without them,

2804
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:42,420
and we wouldn't miss them when they were gone.

2805
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:44,500
I mean, look, to entertain that, okay,

2806
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:46,020
so like, how do people get raised then?

2807
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:47,140
What's the new model?

2808
02:05:47,700 --> 02:05:50,580
Well, wait, we don't have fucking state barracks.

2809
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:51,300
I've got this great idea.

2810
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:51,620
I don't know.

2811
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:53,860
We should get these big furries called Lucises.

2812
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:55,380
Literally, it would be cool.

2813
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:56,260
Well, I don't like...

2814
02:05:56,260 --> 02:05:57,140
I mean, I don't like...

2815
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:57,620
I don't know.

2816
02:05:57,620 --> 02:06:01,060
I think the fact that trolls are all like birthed in batches

2817
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:04,260
and sort of raised as like a collective community is great.

2818
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:05,300
I think that's awesome.

2819
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:07,380
I think that would be so much cooler if it were like that.

2820
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:08,580
And you know...

2821
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:10,340
The trolls came out really great.

2822
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:16,020
Well, they were fucked up because they were ruled by like a despot.

2823
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:17,540
Yeah, the Alpha timeline was all right.

2824
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:21,620
Yeah, the, you know, like people have in families,

2825
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:23,620
they have like these like nationalistic allegiances.

2826
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:24,820
They have family allegiances.

2827
02:06:24,820 --> 02:06:26,740
They have like racial allegiances.

2828
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:30,260
Honestly, we should just fucking obliterate the family unit,

2829
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:31,380
abolish culture.

2830
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:32,500
We won't miss it when it's gone.

2831
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:33,540
We'll have a new culture.

2832
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:35,220
All cultures die eventually.

2833
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:36,100
And if we just like...

2834
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:37,540
We're like, fuck all these old cultures.

2835
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,780
We're having a new one that is like communal

2836
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:42,820
and is like shared and is not like family based.

2837
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:44,820
And it's called Endless War.

2838
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:47,060
We could keep the old stuff.

2839
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:47,700
Like we wouldn't...

2840
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:48,660
We could keep like...

2841
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:50,100
We could keep like a...

2842
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:52,900
I don't know, Mexican salsa dancing.

2843
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:54,740
That doesn't have to go away.

2844
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:56,660
You know, all the cool stuff we like about culture

2845
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,740
doesn't have to go away just because we like...

2846
02:06:58,740 --> 02:06:59,380
We don't have...

2847
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:02,420
Those cultures don't like actually exist anymore

2848
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:05,140
because we abolish the family and are all living

2849
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:07,860
in like a unified, like beautiful utopia

2850
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:10,580
where we're all brothers under, you know, whatever.

2851
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:13,620
Whatever like anarcho-communist regime we've established.

2852
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:15,300
Ben, you gotta write a book.

2853
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:16,900
You could be like the iron rand

2854
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,820
of the authoritarian left or something.

2855
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:20,900
Didn't they already have that

2856
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:22,820
by the name of Karl Marx or something?

2857
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:24,180
Okay, okay.

2858
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:24,580
I don't know.

2859
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:28,660
I know I say all this stuff

2860
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:29,780
and then I get nervous when I say,

2861
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:30,980
it's like, wait, wouldn't we have to have

2862
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:34,340
like a really fucking totalitarian state to establish this?

2863
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:35,460
And then I try and think about like,

2864
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:37,380
well, how could we do all this without that?

2865
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:38,980
And I'm sure there's a way to do that.

2866
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:39,700
I don't like the...

2867
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:42,580
If you actually change everyone's opinion

2868
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:44,420
so that they wanted to be in that system,

2869
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:45,460
I mean, I don't know how you do it,

2870
02:07:45,460 --> 02:07:47,060
but if you did that, if you convinced people

2871
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:47,780
it was for the best.

2872
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:50,100
I mean, the same way you would get just

2873
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:51,780
a regular communist society.

2874
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:52,580
Not on machines.

2875
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:55,300
I just think families are bad.

2876
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:57,300
Well, you know, even taking...

2877
02:07:58,500 --> 02:07:59,860
Yeah, I guess that's a fair question.

2878
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:01,940
Because we have a fucking fractured...

2879
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:03,300
Okay, well, this is...

2880
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,140
First of all, they fractured society.

2881
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:05,700
That's bad.

2882
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,020
We have...

2883
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:07,220
You have family allegiances,

2884
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:08,500
nationalistic allegiances.

2885
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,300
That's bad.

2886
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,500
I don't think allegiances are...

2887
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,260
Oh, man, I sure love being a Finn.

2888
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:12,500
But Ben...

2889
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,020
And I hate those goddamn Swedes.

2890
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:15,220
Just because you have...

2891
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:15,780
We don't...

2892
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:17,780
Are you saying you want this to be like a global thing?

2893
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,180
This ties into my thing

2894
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:22,260
about how I think inheritance should be illegal

2895
02:08:22,980 --> 02:08:23,460
because it's like...

2896
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:24,340
Illegally mean?

2897
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:25,940
And unjust.

2898
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:26,420
Illegally mean?

2899
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:26,980
I said illegal.

2900
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:30,100
And I know this has been brought up to you before, Ben.

2901
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:30,820
But I mean, you are...

2902
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:32,420
I mean, you're gonna inherit from our parents.

2903
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:33,700
So I mean, is that...

2904
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:34,340
Yes.

2905
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:35,140
Oh, God.

2906
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:36,340
Oh, I participate in...

2907
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:38,820
I criticize society and yet I participate in it.

2908
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:39,300
What a fool.

2909
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:39,700
I mean, what...

2910
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:41,540
Okay, but I mean, how would you...

2911
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:42,900
If you could have complete control,

2912
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:44,660
given the fact that you're going to inherit now,

2913
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:46,340
what system would you replace that with

2914
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:47,060
that you'd prefer?

2915
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:48,340
Okay.

2916
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:51,060
Parents don't raise their kids.

2917
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:51,380
Okay.

2918
02:08:52,420 --> 02:08:53,620
Parents don't raise their kids.

2919
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:55,060
No one inherits anything.

2920
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:56,180
Everyone gets UBI.

2921
02:08:56,180 --> 02:08:56,900
There you go.

2922
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,020
Okay, so basically you're saying

2923
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:00,660
forget inheritance, instead we'll do like a UBI system.

2924
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:01,540
Forget inheritance.

2925
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:03,220
You don't inherit anything from your parents

2926
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:04,740
because you don't need anything

2927
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:06,740
because our society makes enough money

2928
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:08,820
to provide everyone with the necessities

2929
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:11,460
without having their parents make it for them

2930
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:12,340
and then give it to them.

2931
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:13,780
You know, Ben, I'll take your argument.

2932
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:15,300
I accept it as...

2933
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:17,860
I try to accept it at its most reasonable position,

2934
02:09:17,860 --> 02:09:19,620
granting that all of this can be done

2935
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:22,100
and that like human nature will like allow for it.

2936
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:24,100
I would still argue simply that I think

2937
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:26,020
that there's a good amount of utility

2938
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:28,340
in both like the familial structure

2939
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:29,380
and the nation state.

2940
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:29,940
And I just...

2941
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:31,460
I have not yet been convinced

2942
02:09:31,460 --> 02:09:33,220
that a better system is the one you described.

2943
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:33,620
I think.

2944
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:34,180
And that's right.

2945
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:36,020
I think that we could replace...

2946
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:38,660
We could replace the family structure

2947
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:40,180
and the nuclear family

2948
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:44,580
with a new, more egalitarian, more just society.

2949
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:45,780
And we would look back...

2950
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:48,340
And we would look back on late capitalism.

2951
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:50,660
We would look back on when we all lived in...

2952
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:51,700
And when we're all like...

2953
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,140
When we were all just raised

2954
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:54,580
by whatever fucking chuckle fuck

2955
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:56,420
happened to give birth to us, what the fuck?

2956
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:57,620
We would look back on that and say,

2957
02:09:57,620 --> 02:09:59,780
wow, what like barbaric backwards times?

2958
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:00,980
I just don't feel like the state

2959
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:03,140
is particularly competent at these things.

2960
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:04,260
But okay.

2961
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:04,820
But you know what?

2962
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:05,380
I get your point.

2963
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:05,940
It could...

2964
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:06,340
It could...

2965
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,060
Maybe one day.

2966
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:07,380
Maybe one day.

2967
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:08,500
What if it wasn't a state thing?

2968
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:09,540
What if it wasn't a state thing?

2969
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:11,140
What if it was just like a sort of

2970
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:13,620
like democratic like community run process?

2971
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:18,180
What if it wasn't imposed from on high person?

2972
02:10:18,180 --> 02:10:19,460
I would prefer that, certainly.

2973
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:21,700
I mean, they already say it takes a village

2974
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:22,580
to raise a child.

2975
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:24,420
What if communities just got together

2976
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:26,740
and like established like community centers

2977
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:29,380
where kids were like, you know, raised from birth?

2978
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:30,100
I don't know.

2979
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:30,740
I like it.

2980
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:31,780
I get you.

2981
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:35,460
I feel like inevitably there'd be some like kind of human nature

2982
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:37,220
things that we weren't programmed to deal with

2983
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:37,700
that we might...

2984
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:38,740
We already do that.

2985
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:41,060
Humans are programmed to do all kinds of horrible things

2986
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:41,940
that we don't let them do

2987
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:43,540
because they're fucked up and ruin everything.

2988
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:44,740
That's fair.

2989
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:45,540
That's fair.

2990
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:47,940
Just like the family does

2991
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:49,460
and just like inheritance does

2992
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:51,380
and just like all this shit does that we do now

2993
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:52,420
and one day we'll say,

2994
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:54,020
thank God we don't do that anymore.

2995
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:54,500
Well, I guess we'll say.

2996
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:55,060
That's what I...

2997
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:55,140
I guess we'll say.

2998
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:56,100
That's my hot take.

2999
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:56,580
I...

3000
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:57,540
Fair enough.

3001
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:58,180
Fair enough.

3002
02:10:58,180 --> 02:10:58,660
Yep.

3003
02:10:58,660 --> 02:10:59,940
Okay, sound up in the comments

3004
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:02,180
if you think I'm a fucking psychopath or what.

3005
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:02,420
I mean...

3006
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:04,180
Guys, enough of this.

3007
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:04,900
Enough of this.

3008
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,300
Enough.

3009
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:08,580
Every single episode of the Pokemon anime

3010
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:11,220
is for free on like the Pokemon website.

3011
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:14,580
I've just found that you can just watch them all.

3012
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:15,940
God, that's like thousands of episodes.

3013
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:16,660
But not in Japanese, right?

3014
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:18,420
But the Pokemon Company International...

3015
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:20,420
No, it's not in Japanese.

3016
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:20,980
It's English.

3017
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:21,380
Did this just happen?

3018
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:22,580
I mentioned the first episode.

3019
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:23,380
It said...

3020
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:25,620
No, I just saw like somebody linked it and it was like...

3021
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:28,500
You know, I have never seen episode two of Pokemon

3022
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:29,700
and I've always wanted to.

3023
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:30,740
Where...

3024
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:31,940
Look, there's got no views.

3025
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:32,900
Nobody knows about this.

3026
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:35,060
Please put a link in the show notes.

3027
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:38,180
Okay, let's move on to our next call.

3028
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,980
We got, I think like three more or something.

3029
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:41,700
Okay, here we go.

3030
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:46,740
So this is Don't I Repeat Do Not Mine At Night.

3031
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:48,660
Okay, go.

3032
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:03,060
Is this Animal Crossing?

3033
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:05,060
No, it's Minecraft.

3034
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:05,940
We turn.

3035
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:12,260
Can I just boobernate?

3036
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:18,340
I didn't know GLaDOS played Minecraft.

3037
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:19,860
GLaDOS from Portal 2.

3038
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:21,220
Portal 1, in fact.

3039
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:23,780
I think I understood the first like three words of that.

3040
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:24,100
Did anyone...

3041
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:25,140
I could not make it.

3042
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:27,300
I literally could not make out a word of that.

3043
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:28,900
Yeah, was that Miku?

3044
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:29,620
Who was that?

3045
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:32,900
It was Red Boy Genius.

3046
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:34,020
All right, next voicemail.

3047
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:36,340
I thought that you guys might be able to get meaning out of it

3048
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:37,700
that I couldn't figure out.

3049
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:38,500
Okay, all right.

3050
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,260
Unfortunately, it didn't pan out that way.

3051
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:41,220
But I also just thought it sounded nice.

3052
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:42,980
It didn't pan pizza out that way.

3053
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:43,460
Oh.

3054
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:44,660
It did sound nice.

3055
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:45,220
Okay, so there's the plus.

3056
02:12:45,220 --> 02:12:46,820
I did enjoy it aesthetically.

3057
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:47,540
So I'll give it that.

3058
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:48,180
Okay, let's move on.

3059
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:48,740
Oh, you know what?

3060
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,500
This one is actually directly for Mage

3061
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:52,020
and since she's not here, I'm going to skip it.

3062
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:53,540
So sorry, Ultra Violet.

3063
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:54,980
Wait, why?

3064
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:56,500
Oh, it's for Mage.

3065
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:57,220
It was, you know what?

3066
02:12:57,220 --> 02:12:58,100
I mean, I could play it.

3067
02:12:58,100 --> 02:12:58,580
I could play it.

3068
02:12:58,580 --> 02:12:59,540
It's for Mage, but...

3069
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:00,420
Well, maybe we could wait.

3070
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:01,700
Well, see, yeah, I'll just play it.

3071
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:02,500
She won't be here for like two weeks.

3072
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:02,900
All right, fuck it. Here we go.

3073
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:03,220
Play.

3074
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:05,540
We can shit on her.

3075
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:07,780
So, Mage, you claim to like Purple, yeah.

3076
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:10,420
I think we're going to have to see if that's really true.

3077
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:13,860
Now, you may have heard of this little wavelength

3078
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:15,700
called Ultra Violet.

3079
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:16,260
That's right.

3080
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:21,700
Ultra Violet, also known as Purple II.

3081
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:26,260
Now, normally Purple II isn't visible to the human eye,

3082
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:29,620
but it turns out that that's actually

3083
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:32,420
because your eyes are betraying you.

3084
02:13:33,060 --> 02:13:37,300
In fact, you can remove the lens from your eye,

3085
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:41,380
and suddenly you will be able to see Purple II.

3086
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:44,740
It's probably not safe for the eye.

3087
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:50,180
You will still be able to see a new form of Purple.

3088
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:52,580
So, tell me, Mage, is it worth it?

3089
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:56,020
Is it will you destroy your eyes in the pursuit of Purple?

3090
02:13:56,820 --> 02:13:57,460
Is that true?

3091
02:13:57,460 --> 02:13:58,340
I like your answer.

3092
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:01,380
Okay, I've never heard this thing about removing the lens,

3093
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:04,900
but I have heard that there are some people

3094
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:08,660
who's like eye cones are sensitive to a slightly wider range.

3095
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:13,460
So, some people can see somewhat into the Ultra Violet spectrum,

3096
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:15,540
and apparently, according to them,

3097
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:18,420
it looks like the drum roll, please,

3098
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:21,140
a slightly like white pale purplish color.

3099
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:22,820
Sounds worth.

3100
02:14:22,820 --> 02:14:23,620
Sounds worth.

3101
02:14:23,620 --> 02:14:23,940
Yeah.

3102
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:24,900
Cool.

3103
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:28,580
I don't know about this lens removal thing.

3104
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:33,460
Is it like the lens filters light in some particular way?

3105
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:34,580
Maybe it blocks.

3106
02:14:34,580 --> 02:14:35,300
Maybe it.

3107
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,860
I mean, it wouldn't be crazy because Ultra Violet light,

3108
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:39,140
if it's harmful to your eye,

3109
02:14:39,140 --> 02:14:42,180
maybe your lens might have evolved to block some of it

3110
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:43,220
to protect you from it.

3111
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:43,700
That's true.

3112
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:44,420
It doesn't.

3113
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:44,820
Maybe.

3114
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:46,260
I've never heard that before.

3115
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:47,460
Wow, I don't care.

3116
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:48,980
Let's listen to the next voicemail.

3117
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:50,340
Yeah, great.

3118
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,380
All right, all right.

3119
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:52,980
Oh, you talk about don't care.

3120
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:55,380
We got a call here from Oopsy Bobo.

3121
02:14:55,940 --> 02:14:58,420
Now, this man left a couple of messages.

3122
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:00,420
I forget what the deal was.

3123
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:01,940
I think this was for you, Munchy.

3124
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:02,820
Let's see what he has to say.

3125
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:04,180
Oh, I'm not going to like it then.

3126
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:04,500
All right.

3127
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:07,940
So my dumb ass fucked up,

3128
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:10,260
and I wasn't sure if the message quality was great,

3129
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:12,420
so I'm going to record this one again.

3130
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:14,900
Munchy, fuck you.

3131
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,100
This is a thread.

3132
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:17,300
This is not a voicemail.

3133
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:19,380
If you don't let my...

3134
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:23,460
If you don't let my fucking message go in,

3135
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:26,020
the one about the weed,

3136
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:28,020
I'll get a fucking whore of minions,

3137
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:30,820
and Oospamiu is smoking the weed message.

3138
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:31,620
Just constantly, man.

3139
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:33,140
There's just nothing you can do about it.

3140
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:34,820
So, fuck you.

3141
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:44,340
All right, so if I remember correctly,

3142
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:46,340
this guy called in last week,

3143
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:48,100
and I didn't put his message in

3144
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:49,860
because it was really terrible,

3145
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,300
and so now he's mad at me

3146
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:53,140
for not putting in his message.

3147
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:57,620
So I just want to give a shout out to Oopsy Bobo.

3148
02:15:57,620 --> 02:16:00,420
We're going to put this guy in the voice jail

3149
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:02,980
because you had the audacity to appear on the show

3150
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:05,140
and be a piece of shit,

3151
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:06,660
and you are not funny,

3152
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:08,660
and also you're from South America,

3153
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:10,260
and you have not followed on the promise

3154
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,940
that your forefathers gave you

3155
02:16:11,940 --> 02:16:14,100
with the glorious history that you have betrayed.

3156
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:16,500
So good job, and you're going to the voice jail.

3157
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,340
That's fair. His name is just Bobo,

3158
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:19,540
and Oopsy was like the title,

3159
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:21,620
but yeah, okay, Bobo, there you go, buddy.

3160
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:23,860
This is exactly why we need the wall.

3161
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,940
All right, we got our last message here.

3162
02:16:27,940 --> 02:16:28,820
The Panama wall.

3163
02:16:28,820 --> 02:16:29,540
That's the one.

3164
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:32,980
Okay, game board, Gaylord, part three,

3165
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:33,460
calling in.

3166
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:34,740
This is our final one.

3167
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,500
Okay, let's go immediately.

3168
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:38,500
Captain Gaylord, if we don't see any results

3169
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:39,940
of this foolish while you started,

3170
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:42,260
who will prove the plow to you and your crew?

3171
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:44,340
Don't worry, everyone, as they say.

3172
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,340
This is definitely the day of the spades.

3173
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:47,300
See your shit back.

3174
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:49,300
What's the status of our latest missile?

3175
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:51,300
Ah, Cap, this just came in.

3176
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:52,260
I believe we hit him.

3177
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:53,940
Yes, we did it.

3178
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:54,660
We hit him.

3179
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:55,940
Don't celebrate just that.

3180
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:57,060
It might hit us back.

3181
02:16:57,060 --> 02:16:57,460
We moved.

3182
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:57,940
We got that.

3183
02:16:57,940 --> 02:16:59,060
Bobo, gay, Bobo, Bobo.

3184
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:03,780
Bye, Colleen.

3185
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:04,740
They missed.

3186
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:05,300
Yes.

3187
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:05,940
Hooray.

3188
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:07,460
Yes, we know.

3189
02:17:07,460 --> 02:17:08,340
We did it, boys.

3190
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:09,940
We finally got the upper hand.

3191
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:11,780
Lucky for us that we are celebrating

3192
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:13,540
a royalty-free use.

3193
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:14,580
We...

3194
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:17,540
No, because the game board is so small,

3195
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:18,340
we can't lose.

3196
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:22,660
Actually, the game is played on a 25-tile grid,

3197
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:25,700
with 11 of those tiles occupied by our fellowships.

3198
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:28,500
The odds are hitting are probably so high,

3199
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,900
so that if you would be playing in a, you know,

3200
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:34,820
a weak paternal house, it is stupidly complicated.

3201
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:37,300
Anyone with two grandtiles could have figured that one out.

3202
02:17:37,300 --> 02:17:38,260
We did this to ourselves.

3203
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:38,900
Yeah, yeah.

3204
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:40,740
Yeah, we have no one to blame ourselves.

3205
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:42,900
I feel like I'm shooting a brand new story teller.

3206
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:43,220
Do you?

3207
02:17:43,220 --> 02:17:43,700
Bobo.

3208
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:45,140
What?

3209
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:47,220
Oh, it's a hit.

3210
02:17:47,220 --> 02:17:47,620
I think.

3211
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:49,300
He hit our Death's Reader.

3212
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:50,020
Yeah, you know what?

3213
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:50,580
You know what?

3214
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,340
You hit all of our submarines.

3215
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:54,420
Oh, they were all stacked on top of each other,

3216
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:55,700
like at different depths.

3217
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:56,580
And now we're dead.

3218
02:17:56,580 --> 02:17:57,140
Oh, no, you won.

3219
02:17:57,140 --> 02:17:58,020
So good.

3220
02:17:58,020 --> 02:17:59,540
I guess that's the end of the game.

3221
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:00,900
Yep, that's right.

3222
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:04,100
Hey, guys, if you try to be real of my ass, Batman 2,

3223
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:05,140
I want to know that...

3224
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:07,700
I want you guys to know that I personally hate you,

3225
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:10,740
and a fucking please unironically kill yourself.

3226
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:12,660
Like, with a news or a gun.

3227
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:15,620
Anyway, humanly possible, end your own lives.

3228
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:16,420
Oblivion?

3229
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:17,780
Nobody can be riddle my ass, Batman 2.

3230
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:19,540
Oh, this episode's not getting monetized.

3231
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:20,100
That's for sure.

3232
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:24,740
Oblivion, if you could try to make that audible in some way,

3233
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:25,780
that would be great.

3234
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:30,740
Apparently, Oblivion finds the original call audio

3235
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:34,580
and puts that in instead of the SoundCloud version or something.

3236
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:35,140
Oblivion does something.

3237
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:37,620
It's the same fucking thing, but okay, if you can do that, great.

3238
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:40,420
No, he told me that he does some shit with the voicemails

3239
02:18:40,420 --> 02:18:41,700
that just makes them better.

3240
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:42,660
Okay, fantastic.

3241
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:44,660
That man is a god and a king.

3242
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:46,900
Okay, well, anyway, that's the last thing

3243
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:49,860
we got to sit through on this fucking episode of the BCP.

3244
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:50,420
You're free now.

3245
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:50,980
You're free.

3246
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:51,540
Wow.

3247
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:52,340
We did it.

3248
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:53,140
It was really great.

3249
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:55,620
And then some like anarcho-communist shit came,

3250
02:18:55,620 --> 02:18:58,100
and then the voicemails took like 500 hours.

3251
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:58,900
And you know what?

3252
02:18:58,900 --> 02:18:58,980
That's fine.

3253
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:00,900
Only because we talked about it.

3254
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:02,740
Specific questions for whatever.

3255
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:07,540
Go read, bail, jpe, and pledge to the punk plushie Kickstarter.

3256
02:19:08,260 --> 02:19:10,980
And I just want to clarify, that's all true, do that.

3257
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:13,940
And if you left a message and it didn't get on,

3258
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:16,660
I want to confirm it's because it wasn't good enough

3259
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:18,580
because I was looking for good things.

3260
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:19,060
And there was a dirt.

3261
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:22,740
I mean, you heard the quality of what we did end up accepting.

3262
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:24,740
So you were even worse than this.

3263
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:25,540
Oh, imagine that.

3264
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:26,740
Imagine being in that position.

3265
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:29,860
Okay, anyway, patrons.com slash the procrastiners people.

3266
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:31,780
We just made a new fucking bonus episode.

3267
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:33,380
It was Game of Thrones.

3268
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:36,180
Me, Tom, and Gibb talked extensively

3269
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:37,700
about everything you could possibly want to know.

3270
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:40,180
Are you like mashing a burger, meat, or something?

3271
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:41,460
Like you make it a patty over there?

3272
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:42,260
I'm sorry.

3273
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:43,540
Was that visible?

3274
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,260
Sorry, okay.

3275
02:19:44,260 --> 02:19:47,380
So what I'm doing is I've got a bag of, a plastic bag of candy.

3276
02:19:47,380 --> 02:19:50,420
I know I'm trying to puncture it with like the sharp end of a pin

3277
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:51,780
so I can get the candy out

3278
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:55,140
so I can eat some delicious gummy drops.

3279
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:56,820
Well, do that at your time.

3280
02:19:58,420 --> 02:19:58,660
All right.

3281
02:19:58,660 --> 02:20:01,380
But it sounded instead like you were crushing a burger

3282
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:02,420
between your fingers.

3283
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:04,820
At cpcrastinators on Twitter people.

3284
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:06,820
Follow us there for links and whatnot.

3285
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:10,180
And give us money, $5 bonus episodes, $1 patron lounge.

3286
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:12,180
Have fun, hang out with us, be a cool guy.

3287
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:12,740
There you go.

3288
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:13,860
That's all you need to know.

3289
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:14,180
All right.

3290
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:14,580
That's it.

3291
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:14,980
We're out of here.

3292
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:16,260
We'll see you next week, people.

3293
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:17,940
Check out, check out the new vapor.

3294
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:19,860
It's up on stcomics.com right now.

3295
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:21,780
Take all the goddamn links with us.

3296
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:23,060
We all do a million things.

3297
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:24,660
We're all cool guys with cool shit.

3298
02:20:25,300 --> 02:20:25,700
Correct.

3299
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:28,500
The amount of the two will be done by now.

3300
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:29,060
Go check out.

3301
02:20:29,060 --> 02:20:29,540
Oh my God.

3302
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:30,180
That's that school.

3303
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:31,300
We can't be so good.

3304
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:32,180
All right.

3305
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:32,980
I'll see you later, people.

3306
02:20:32,980 --> 02:20:34,340
Have a beautiful night.

3307
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:34,580
Bye.

3308
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:35,060
Bye.

3309
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:35,780
Have a beautiful time.

3310
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:36,340
Bye.

3311
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:36,980
Bye.

3312
02:20:36,980 --> 02:20:37,460
Bye.

3313
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:38,100
I love you.

3314
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:38,900
Oh.

3315
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:22,420
What the hell is wrong with me?
