1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
I don't give a fuck, bitch! Welcome back to Rick's D Minutes. I'm Digibro, and with me is the best guy ever.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,000
You sound like that thing Gibb made. You know what I'm fucking talking about? Yeah, I'm the best guy ever, guys. What's up? What's going on?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No idea what you're talking about. We watched the new Rick and Morty. That wasn't enough of a description, yeah. Okay, me, Rick and Morty.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's episode 4, season 3 about the, what the fuck were they? Vindicators. It's called Vindicators 3, The Return of World Ender. What was the episode?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, this episode I was not that into. Yeah, I'm totally with you. I thought this was pretty weak. First of all, I was very confused.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Because the whole early part of the episode, they keep insisting that this is like the return of the vindicators.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Who have never been characters on the show. Now, I was unsure, because I haven't rewatched season 2, and I was like, did I just blank out on an episode of these guys?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was thinking that the whole time too, yeah. Dude, I fucking wanted to pause the episode and go look it up, but as it went on, I was like, I don't remember any of this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So this couldn't have happened before, you know? Yeah, that was confusing. I liked a bunch of these characters.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Million Ants is like the coolest guy ever, and I would just like, I would remember Million Ants, so yeah, this obviously is the thing they're doing.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We haven't seen this before. So I don't know if these guys are meant to be a parody of the Guardians of the Galaxy, or like obviously the name is...

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Not the expendables, the fucking suicide squad, that's what I was thinking of, but they're more Guardians of the Galaxy.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, I think the idea is that they're a parody of Guardians of the Galaxy, but they're not like a on-the-nose parody. None of them are anything like the Guardians of the Galaxy is what I'm kidding at.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Except for like the main guy. I have not seen Guardians of the Galaxy, but I got the feeling that the main dude was supposed to be like Star Killer or whatever his name is.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Star Lord.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He just seems like the main guy.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How have you not seen the Guardians movies?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't believe that they're that good. How could any movie be good?

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They're fucking fantastic, Nate. They can't be true.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I would give each of them a 9 out of 10.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's pretty damn good.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, I cried in Guardians 2. I saw it twice and cried both times in the same week.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Like a bitch.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Alright, I believe you. Well, I don't need to see that anymore, because I just watched the Vendicators 3 Return of Worlds, and it was everything I could hope for.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't know what this episode's like going for, honestly.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It wasn't going for anything. It was just trying to be like, oh, look how silly Rick's being.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It was, look, Rick's being silly episode with a little bit of like the relationship drama that we've seen like a thousand times already.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It really had nothing new to offer in most departments.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is very Rick and Morty du jour. Like this is the most, it's a lot like Anatomy Park or like M Night Chameleons, but I feel like this is the first episode where I've become concerned about there not being B plots in this show.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because like the worst Rick and Morty adventures have always been matched up with at least semi-decent B plots.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like in Anatomy Park, for instance, everybody criticizes that episode because it's just like a straight up Jurassic Park parody.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But the funniest part about that episode is the Jerry's parents fucking some, like having a weird like threesome relationship with a younger black guy.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, that's pretty good.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's by far the funniest thing about the episode. So this one we're just kind of trapped in this very one note repetitive adventure story that I don't know.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I had no interest in the whole time.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I hate to say it, but I mean this episode gives me the feeling that we've kind of hit the wall.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, like I'm exaggerating, but like this gives the impression to me that like, okay, we've kind of had Rick and Morty run its course now and we got it like we understand what it's been doing and it has now accomplished it.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So like what, like this was just like Rick being a little bit of Rick, Morty being a little bit of Morty in ways that we see every single episode with like, like this was very much like a flash episode.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like I felt like the animation was like a little bit next level on this episode, like everything that the ghost train thing was cool, a million ants when he did like his actions things were pretty sick.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know, like this episode felt very attractive looking, but then just lacked like a script.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Like I left a couple times, but this did not feel as like biting as I was expecting.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't think I laughed the entire episode, you know?

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I got a couple troubles. The first time that Noop Noop like backs up Rick, I don't know, that got a laugh out of me.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The whole like, like when you said about the animation, I think this show is always about on par with animation, but what was not as strong and this is like the directing.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because in Pickle Rick, a lot of my laughs were just at like violent moments.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It was just at like the timing of a scene of like Rick just suddenly like fucking carving somebody in half.

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This episode has one incredibly violent scene that just felt like to me, you know, like when the when the first guy dies.

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And it's just like this way over the top violent scene.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I was just kind of like, what was was that necessary? Like why? Why are we going for that level?

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like it just wasn't funny, you know? It was just really violent.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I was like, okay, it's fun, I guess, you know?

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've seen the hyperviolence from every other episode of the last season and a half, so it's not like impressing me at this point.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I felt like I almost felt like when that guy died specifically, it kind of felt like they cut his arc off too soon.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Like I didn't, I don't know, like they really threw all these characters to the fucking wayside.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Which in a way, I kind of respect that they're like, yeah, we don't give a fuck about our characters that we came up with.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They will just kill them off instantly. Like that's kind of cool.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But on the other hand, it feels wasteful and sort of almost a disrespectful way to their own characters.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know, I'm exaggerating a little bit.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Disrespectful is a word I would use for that guy in particular.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because we didn't, like, what about that dude warranted such an extreme death?

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like it wasn't cathartic. We didn't hate this guy yet.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He just seemed like, I don't know, kind of a milk toast douchey guy, I guess.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We didn't, like, they kind of hinted at like maybe a pedophilia thing that they didn't deliver on that.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They kind of hinted at this other thing.

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They hint at a bunch of little things, but then basically he just becomes a horror character and gets himself killed.

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It seemed like they were going for a horror thing with this, but the episode doesn't...

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not a horror episode.

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
At first it's like, oh, okay, they're going to do a saw thing.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's going to be scary. It's going to be about these guys getting killed in horrible death traps.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But I don't know, after the first one, it's like you see it coming.

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They really do not build up the tension in that way, and the characters really have no difficulty solving the problem.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It really is just window dressing for these characters turning on each other, which is what Rick planned all along.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But I don't care about these characters. We don't know them, so where's my investment in them getting dismembered?

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's like that Morty kind of respects them.

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But of course, meanwhile, we're finding out that they're bad people, which I guess proves Rick's point.

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But yeah, it felt like...

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A point that's been proven, this is just stuff that we've seen before.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Even Morty is like, Rick, you've made this point before.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's like the show is almost self-aware about the fact that this is a repetitive episode, but it doesn't do anything to change that.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I agree completely.

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We've got the undercurrent of maybe Rick somewhat cares about Morty, but then...

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's never been done before. What an amazing plot for an episode.

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's kind of funny when they flip it on its head and it reveals that it's noop-noop that he cares about, not Morty.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But the scene before that already proved that maybe Rick cares about Morty, because that was Rick's theory.

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Was that he cared about Morty and that's why he did this.

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So yeah, again, it's been done in better ways, in better episodes.

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What the hell was with logic showing up at the end of the episode?

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I didn't roll my eyes. It's not an accurate description of what I did.

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I just breathed out a little bit of my soul.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I guess it was fine.

92
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is celebrity cameos what Rick and Morty needs?

93
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The Joel McHale thing already crippled that episode and was just a massive source of unfunnyness.

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This show has had tons and tons of celebrity voice actors in it.

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Almost every episode has had somebody like that.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Stephen Colbert has been on the show.

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Well, never have I ever been annoyed by it except for that one time with Joel McHale.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And now this is happening too.

99
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's just logic though. It's just logic to the episode.

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't think it was funny. It's just logic here.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It wasn't funny at all. Even his song.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I listened to that twice to try to get the humor out of it.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was really like he just makes some vague references to like, oh, he's singing about noop-noop or something.

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The thing about the song is that the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 2 has like a big ending song where it's just like describing the Guardians of the Galaxy.

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So I think this is a straight parody of that.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But again, the episode is so like lacking as a parody of Guardians of the Galaxy.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Like it has nothing to do with it.

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So bringing that in at the end, like suddenly an on-the-nose parody after a whole episode of nothing even resembling Guardians of the Galaxy is really odd.

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It kind of is like the Fury Road parody that just didn't really do anything with it.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It just was the setting for it.

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And then like within that episode, they do things like have that king at the end that has nothing to do with Fury Road.

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And it's like a totally separate thing.

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, like they're really not getting...

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, like wastefulness.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Like they're using this setting and then not really utilizing what it provides.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They're just doing something else.

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's just like an atmospheric thing that doesn't actually add anything to the narrative they're going for in any interesting or meaningful way.

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, I didn't get what they were going for with the characters, with the vindicators.

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Like I didn't understand...

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is the joke just that they're all kind...

121
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because first of all, they never came across as like these like Paragons of Justice kind of guys.

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The main dude is like, yeah, I drink and blah, blah, blah.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And like, I don't know, they're all kind of assholes from the beginning to Rick, you know.

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They're very like...

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They're just kind of snobby, you know.

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I think we're just supposed to take Morty's...

127
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think what they were going for is that we would just like accept what Morty says, at least for the start.

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But I mean, yeah, like it's obvious.

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Whatever Rick says is going to happen is going to happen.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So I don't know, did not really have an effective arc in that way.

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, there was no like reveal.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There was no like, oh, this is taking apart the trope.

133
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's just like, no, it's just an episode about Rick being an asshole and...

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
To be fair, the twist...

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The one thing that was good about it was the twist...

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay, there were some things that were not terrible.

137
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But like the best thing about the episode was the twist where they get to the bad guy, he's been defeated already.

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then it turns out that like the supervillain beyond him was in fact drunk Rick from the last...

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
From the night before.

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like that was a good idea.

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And I was like, okay, this makes perfect sense as a villain that they will have to confront.

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I like this.

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Of course, they have to slip in the like obligatory scene like, oh, by the way, he forgot his portal gun.

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's why he can't use it.

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like they have to explain, which felt a little forced to me.

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But you know, what else can they do?

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Or else we'll just use that.

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So the idea of having Rick fight a version of himself drunk from the night before is a good idea, you know.

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But the only thing was like it wasn't even a fight.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Like there was no difficulty solving any of these issues.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's just that the people are completely incompetent and get themselves killed.

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I really think like if they had actually played out the saw angle that's referenced and like it actually was a horror thing

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and the horror puppeteer was Rick from like a drunk Rick from the night before, like now that's actually pretty damn good.

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And like it really would be an interesting thing that like he is doing all these and they frame the deaths in a way that's not funny,

155
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
but actually like horrific and everyone's like sad and crying and very upset.

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And Rick's just like, I don't know, sorry dude, I was fucking drunk, what can I do?

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I feel like there was more potential there than the angle they took here.

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But yeah, just kind of fell flat the way we were doing it.

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I also, I feel weird anytime Rick and Morty tries to do witty dialogue,

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
which this episode is full of quips and one-liners and references to the fact that they're making quips and one-liners.

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And like it's okay for Rick to do that sometimes, but like when they make him just like the sarcastic asshole character,

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm like that's not really how I see Rick, I see him more as like an unhinged drunken madman, you know?

163
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like you watch the early episodes, particularly the pilot, and like he's practically not saying words half the time, you know?

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He's a babbling psycho who occasionally like busts out some really intellectual stuff

165
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and like I think we've seen him closer to that for like Pickle Rick.

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He's, you know, even though he's doing like this sarcasm thing at some points, like he's also just going totally out of control as a Pickle Man.

167
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, he's fucking insane and it was great. That's the good stuff.

168
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Not like this like super forced like Jew joke with like, oh they just go on about, I'm totally not anti-Semitic.

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I swear, I'm totally non-taking aside at this point and everyone has to react to that.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like, I get it, like you're making a joke about even referencing it.

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Gee, just not, did not get a laugh and it just kept going on and on.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Right, my favorite, like what I love about the Rick and Morty humor is just like yelling Pickle Rick, you know?

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, it's Poopy Butthole.

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The hybrid shit.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You know, having characters sit around going like, oh, maybe you should get your nickname back from the blah, blah, me and then, you know, ah, no.

176
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Stop, this is faggy. I don't want this.

177
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I kind of, like I sort of enjoyed the dynamic.

178
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Like, I thought the quips worked in the way that like it was a way, like this is what makes it good.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Like just doing quips is boring and gay.

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But when like there's a character who's like role is to like be the guy who's like, whoa, nice one dude.

181
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like at least I was like, that's kind of funny that like this is the dynamic happening here.

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's like beyond, that like sort of is the lampooning.

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I didn't think Rick was really like hitting them with these strong zingers though.

184
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Like I didn't laugh at anything he said.

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Like the other guy backing him up is a funny idea, but like they've done that before with stronger jokes in this show.

186
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like when my favorite is in the episode with when we first get introduced to the Council of Rick's.

187
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Rick's being held captive by the evil Rick and he keeps making all these quips and like this like, what was it?

188
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Was it one of the mortis who was something that was like giggling at the jokes and this guy gets it and he's like,

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that thing just makes that noise every 15 seconds and he's like, oh yeah, that's right, that's right.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Way funnier version of the same joke.

191
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, I felt like Noop was supposed to be like a meme character, but he'd left no real impression on me.

192
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I feel like Noop Noop and the lady who survives at the end are going to like come back or something.

193
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't know.

194
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Noop Noop just stuck me as like a shittier version of Mr. Poopy Butthole.

195
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, he looked exactly like him, which can't be a coincidence.

196
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There's got to be something going on there.

197
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, I don't know, just really disappointed, watched it twice.

198
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like I kind of liked it better the second time because I didn't have the sense of anticipation that wasn't delivered upon.

199
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I just kind of enjoyed watching it and I don't know.

200
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I really liked the tangible details of the like superhero squad in the sense that like there was a ghost train conductor.

201
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's kind of funny.

202
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Million ants.

203
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I really, really like million ants.

204
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He's fucking awesome.

205
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I think my favorite line in the whole episode is when he says, I have only lost 400 ants and now my queen has repopulated.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So I am back to a million ants.

207
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's the funniest line in the episode.

208
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I just feel like again, because we don't have a B plot, this got strung out a lot longer than it had to be.

209
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There was a way more setup than usual of like the whole, you know, Morty kind of forcing Rick to get into the situation.

210
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Then we have like a lot of scenes of build up of like Rick's an asshole to these guys.

211
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They don't like him very much.

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Rick and Morty in the room talking about it, getting emotional about it and like just it kind of went on and on and on.

213
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And then we get on the adventure and we get the saw set up and I'm like, okay, now we're in the episode.

214
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like now the plot has kicked in.

215
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I get what the gimmick is cool.

216
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And then it doesn't really do anything with that.

217
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And then it just kind of goes to a dance party at the end, which in the dance scene, logic aside, I like the stuff Rick says.

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Like, you know, just like half the people I end up getting high with later, you know, there's gear over there.

219
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Like, I like that, but...

220
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Dude, how shitty was that like after credits gear had seen?

221
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Like it's fine that he's trying to get laid with it, but then like it just like so flat that he's like, oh, there's danger.

222
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll go change.

223
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Wait, why is he going to change?

224
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Let's go see what's up.

225
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, he left his thing.

226
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There he is running away.

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, he tripped and fell down and that's supposed to be funny.

228
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What the fuck?

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Like that's not funny in any way.

230
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's like the cheapest, shittiest joke in the world.

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I expect better.

232
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I expect better writing.

233
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

234
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So that was disappointing in a big way.

235
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah.

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The funniest thing I thought was kind of, I don't know.

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I just like at the beginning when Morty pulls out his like 10 punch card stamp thing that like, but what's funny about that is it's like a funny way to like force the adventure and move the plot along.

238
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That amused me.

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And like the fact that that's never been referenced before and comes up, you know, just as like an established thing.

240
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Of course, Morty gets a stamp every adventure.

241
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And on this, you know, that was funny.

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's funny.

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So that's the kind of thing that I want to see happening as much as possible.

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Like actually funny stuff that's sort of world building in this ridiculous way, which this episode lacked.

245
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

246
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I would say this is probably one of the worst episodes, if not the worst episode of Rick and Morty.

247
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's up there.

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's up there.

249
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And frankly, it makes me a little concerned about the future.

250
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Like I've seen there are episodes that I think are weaker, but I can remember at least something that jumped out in it, you know.

251
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And this one, there was just nothing that I see myself like reflecting on and thinking, oh, yeah, that was really funny.

252
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That one joke was really good.

253
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll just be like, oh, that was the episode that was kind of boring and and had a really weirdly obtusely violent scene right in the middle that I just found jarring, you know.

254
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I just keep thinking about the scene where like that guy like instantly panics and flees and dies and just like how tremendously unfunny that whole sequence was.

255
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It really is.

256
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Nothing caused that.

257
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I felt like this was sort of like the first half of a two-parter that we'll never get the second part to.

258
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like remember at the beginning, there's like those guys that are going to like turn the whole world sterile.

259
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah.

260
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And then like there's no reference to that ever.

261
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Like that could have been the setup for a joke paid off later in the episode that nothing came of.

262
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I don't know, it just kind of felt like a lot of that stuff.

263
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's just so far under the standard of this show, you know.

264
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

265
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Less inventive than usual, less interesting, less engaging, less funny, less memorable shit, less tight of pacing.

266
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I mean, we're getting this right after Pickle Rick, which is fucking great, you know.

267
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Some different person.

268
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, I've got to say about it.

269
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I ain't got much else.

270
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I have nothing else to say about this episode, only that I really hope this doesn't, I don't know, like two of the four episodes have had an air of less impressiveness to them this season.

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Of course, the other two were like some of the best ever.

272
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So like maybe there's nothing to worry about.

273
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I mean, I just hope they step it up.

274
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I would put like episode two of the season, I would have put on par with the worst episodes of later ones.

275
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You know, it still has moments.

276
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It has good things going for it.

277
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And it had a beat plot that was pretty good.

278
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like even without Jerry, we've had beat plots through these first three episodes.

279
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Now that we're like doing one with no beat plot whatsoever, it really felt like it's strained to fit the time.

280
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Like they spent way too much time on this adventure for the amount of yucks that could be garnered from it.

281
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's, I totally agree.

282
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I think that, yeah, I think that was a big, that makes a lot of sense.

283
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That adding that might have really helped this thing out.

284
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
By the way, did you see the preview for the next episode?

285
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because now that I remember what it is, I'm actually kind of hyped for it.

286
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't.

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I didn't wear it.

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's like, it's like a Jerry Rick episode.

289
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's like those two guys having an adventure together.

290
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And I got to say, I'm kind of excited for it.

291
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I think it could be dope.

292
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Could be.

293
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't know.

294
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We'll see.

295
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah.

296
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
All right.

297
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's it, everybody.

298
