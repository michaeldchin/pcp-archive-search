00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello and welcome to another Pro Crastinators Podcast with me Ben Saint and Gibbontake.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's the truth.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's the truth. It's Sunday, August 2nd.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No it isn't.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's Monday.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, it's Monday. It fucking gives a shit. It's the same thing.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, the one time you say it's Sundays, when it's not Sunday.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, it's usually Sunday.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's usually recorded on Sunday. I got confused.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I couldn't record it yesterday because I was moving.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't want to go on and on about it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What's your address Ben?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was a nightmarish experience. It took me all day.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It took me my entire day to get the van rental, bring it to my house, load it.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I had to make two trips because I have too much useless crap.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Too much for a small room, in my opinion. I don't know why I have all this stuff.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But I wasn't willing to throw any of it out. So I had to make two trips.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My roommates helped me load it up. And then Kazzy helped me unload it.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, not really. Not exactly. She helped me load the second half.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
She didn't help me unload. It was okay. Unloading is easier.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It took all day and it wasn't even done.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I still had to do more this morning and then I just barely got the rental back to the rental place just in time.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It probably cost me like $100. They say on the side of the van it's like $19.95 to rent it for a day.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But then, you know, you got to pay for gas, you got to pay per mile, so on and so forth.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They gave me one of those dollies to let you roll stuff.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That was like an extra like $8. They rented me some moving blankets that I didn't even use.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I just should have said no to that, but I didn't.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I'm very tired. I'm very exhausted and weary and my Wi-Fi doesn't work.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And I'm recording this on Discord through my phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot, which is very annoying.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But I'll figure it out. So that's where I'm at. How are you, Gib?

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm basically just dying again. It's just the Gibbon is sick. Arc reared its head.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I heard you were in the hospital or something.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I was, yes. Well, I mean, I say nothing serious. It turned out to be nothing serious.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But I woke up one morning feeling like I was going to die. I think it was mostly panic.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Mostly panic? Why are you panicked?

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, I woke up and I was super dehydrated, very weak. My muscles felt super weak.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I felt like, oh God, what if I can't move and I can't call for an ambulance?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No one's going to find me. There's no precedent for people coming into my room and seeing if I'm okay.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is it. And so I sort of stumbled out of bed really early in the morning.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And it was terrible. And so I settled down and then we got to the hospital.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I was really fucked up. They checked me out. They did some blood tests.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And they determined that, yes, there is nothing wrong. You idiot.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There's nothing wrong with your blood. There's nothing wrong with your liver.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Shut up. And I'm like, okay, well, at least I'm sort of like...

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why are you so dehydrated? Why did you wake up so dehydrated that your muscles didn't work?

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sounds pretty scary.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean, the muscles stuff was like, it slowly had been getting worse.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think that ultimately, considering everything, it was probably something to do with medication I was taking for HRT.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The estrogen should be fine. But there was an anti-androgen that maybe was causing these side effects.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And it did say those were side effects. And I'm like, okay, like lightheadedness, nausea, dehydration,

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
which was causing other problems. So I'm like, okay, I guess I should stop that and figure out a bit more.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because HRT is like, or like DIY HRT specifically.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Too many letters. You fucking alphabet people and all your letters is too many.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Do it yourself. Hormonal replacement therapy.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
LGBTQIADIYHRT. When does it end? Too many stripes on the flag.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I mean, you got 26, 27, however many letters there are.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can use half of them. You won't stop until we use them all.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There's plenty of room for all of them. All inclusive, Ben. All inclusive.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're right. Sorry.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We're going to start using Greek letters soon.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We should have started with them. They're cooler.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe. So like LGBTQ Beta Gamma Alpha Sigma Omega.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's the L? Is it Gamma?

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Gamma and then the G is, I don't know.

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't know how they look.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is G a Sigma? No. I know how some of them look.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I know the ones that you use in physics equations. I know Mu. I know lowercase Mu.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I know uppercase Sigma. I know Phi, uppercase and lowercase, obviously.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Umlaut is a different thing, right?

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's not a Greek thing.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What is Umlaut?

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's the two dots over the vowel.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, European thing.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So this week, the big news this week is that the whole Chris Chan news dropped

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and the news is so upsetting that I don't even want to talk about it or say what it is here.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The point is that the news dropped and so the effect that that had on me was that I decided that I needed to...

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I had said before that I was going to wait to release the Sonichu lecture until the game was done.

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to make this statement because people have been asking me on the lecture...

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, it's funny. Some people seem to be shocked and think it's a coincidence that the lecture came out when it did.

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It was just complete happenstance.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Some people are saying, oh, nice one, Ben.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Wait a time to take advantage of a terrible situation. You capitalist pig.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And the latter people are mostly right.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean, I don't know. It's not a coincidence that I dropped it when I did.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hearing the news, it changed how I felt about dropping it and suddenly it didn't seem fun and it didn't seem like it would be fun to drop it alongside the game.

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hey guys, big announcement and it's like, oh, CWC.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It would kind of taint the game even though it will already be doing that.

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It kind of will taint. I don't think it's going to taint the game as much as people think.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I mean, this is a spoiler for Slime and Punishment if you haven't read it.

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But if you've read it, I feel like a lot of people haven't read it.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But if you have and you were paying attention, you might have noticed that I killed Chris in Universe in the video in S Revert.

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Like she dies, like she's crushed and killed under the falling something.

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So, you know, that might be a hint of how it ends.

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So, I don't feel like, some people, fucking Econ was like, Ben, you know, don't you feel bad about worshiping Chris now?

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's like, I don't know. I don't know about that. I don't know about that, my dude.

97
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So, I don't, I feel like, I don't feel too bad about it because Chris is literally the villain of Slime and Punishment.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The funny thing about it, the funny thing that I thought was hilarious the whole time is that she's the villain.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But she never knew it. She never understood it.

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
She read the comic and didn't get that she, her OCs are clearly the bad guys, but she doesn't understand.

101
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, she would just have a back and forth.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What was it, the Slime, the acid, no, the bicarbonate rain.

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The bicarbonate rain, yeah.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That was just her, like, being the hero and like, oh, getting rid of this ugly Slime.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And her mind, she was like, we got to fix this Slime problem. It caused a fucking genocide and killed 70,000 people.

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I told her, like, Chris, that's genocide. You're killing us.

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And she's like, ah, it's no big deal. It's only 1% of the population.

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You know, it's, it's, it's, it's like coronavirus. It's like, it's fine, you know, it's good.

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So that's, so I'm still working on the game. I'm still going to do it.

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But at the same time, I'm like, I don't want to hold on to this anymore.

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm just going to put it out now. There's not, there's not going to be a better time.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And like, the stuff, the stuff later in the lecture, like the, the, the, like, the incest stuff, there's, there's creepy incest stuff in the comic, which I touch upon in the lecture.

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And I thought, you know, I kind of think people would appreciate hearing about this right now.

114
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know, just seemed like the right thing to do.

115
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

116
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think a majority of people enjoy that it's coming out around this time.

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I think so. Some people roll their eyes and are like, ooh, think it's like opportunistic.

118
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But most comments are like, oh my God, I can't believe this timing based.

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So that's good.

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Also, yeah, I, I was thinking, I was mulling this over on the, on the train today.

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But like, Sonichu is probably over.

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, a lot of people have been asking me, Ben, are you going to make a Sonichu 103?

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I have to say, I don't think I can because I've now talked about all of Sonichu and there is no more.

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And there probably never will be anymore because Chris is going to jail or some, somewhere.

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Unless she is in jail now, isn't she? She was arrested like yesterday.

126
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She was arrested.

127
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
She, I mean, she might, she might go out on bail or something.

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like jail is like a temporary holding place. She's going to have to await trial.

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She might end up awaiting trial in jail, possibly.

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So yeah, she might be detained for the duration.

131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I mean, I think most likely she'll end up in like a facility or something.

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And it's possible that maybe she'll be, she'll like draw more Sonichu and somehow publish it from there.

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Imagine what would come out of post jail time or post like institution Sonichu chapters.

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's the good ending as far as I'm, that's what I hope happens is like, I hope she just makes Sonichu from jail for the rest of her days.

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh boy, crazy.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Wait, I was going to say something about, oh yeah, I was mulling it over.

137
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, so I have to say probably there can't be a Sonichu Lecture 103.

138
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's just no more material.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And like, you know, I'm not like, I don't make videos about Chris.

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not like, the lectures are about the comic.

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They're about Sonichu.

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They mentioned Chris because you have to understand Chris to understand the context of the comic.

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But yeah.

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So that is all fine.

145
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Anyway, I was on the train and I was thinking, you know, Sonichu is over.

146
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If Sonichu is over, that means that Slime and Punishment is the canon ending to Sonichu.

147
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's the last.

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, I'm not, it's true.

149
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's the last special episode.

150
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And also Chris dies.

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Damn.

152
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That is cool.

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's pretty.

154
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Everything worked out in the end.

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Aside from the rape.

156
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yeah, well, you know, whatever.

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So, you know, this just means that I have to take as much even more care than I was going to to make, you know, the game.

158
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The Phantom's Revenge and the ending of Slime and Punishment.

159
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The, you know, the best it can be because it is now also the canon ending of Sonichu.

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's just the way it works.

161
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't make the rules.

162
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It is what it is.

163
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Lamal.

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So yeah, I wanted to, I wanted to say all that because people keep asking me about it in the comments.

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And now I can say, listen to the first, what are the 15 minutes in of the PC of the new PCP.

166
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And I explain all that shit.

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I just, I just got a comment just right now.

168
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
A comment just appeared saying.

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You sucks.

170
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What does it say?

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Saying it's, oh, it's Scalope.

172
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's Scalope from RFCK.

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Scalope.

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Scalope.

175
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It says, I wonder what are the reasons for this video's delayed release?

176
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Slime and Punishment is so barely mentioned.

177
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It can't be that.

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ah, but it was that.

179
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Ah, but it was that.

180
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And now you, Scalope, now you can listen to this podcast and now you can have this question answered for you.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
All right.

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I haven't gotten through the lecture myself, mostly because I was there and.

183
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah.

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You heard it.

185
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You heard it a lot.

186
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I heard it.

187
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So there's less of a reason to be like, oh, I can't wait to hear it because I know, so I vaguely know what.

188
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But like, do you, at the end, hype up, what was the release plan for the game?

189
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Were you going to have a whole section at the end saying, hey, play the game now?

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
No, no, I was just going to, I was just going to release them at the same time.

191
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because it was just because the game is the end of Slime and Punishment and the lecture talks about Slime and Punishment.

192
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was just going to be like, go read Slime and Punishment.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's done.

194
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

195
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Now it's like, you know, it's not, it's not done.

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So people will, anyone that does decide to go read it will see an unfinished comic.

198
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Although S Revert is like a fairly okay finale, but it's not, it's not the true finale.

199
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So, you know, but yeah, does that answer the question?

200
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah.

201
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I was just wondering, like, what was the original plan that has changed?

202
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But if it was just like uploading and releasing things at the same time.

203
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No, I wasn't, I wasn't going to add, I might have ended like a, I might have added like a bump at the end that's like, you know, check out my comic.

204
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Check out, check out the comic Slime and Punishment.

205
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You can see it on my website or something like that.

206
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But I didn't.

207
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But I wasn't going to like add a section or anything in the lecture itself.

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I do.

209
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I mean, I feels a little weird in this context now.

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I sort of wish I hadn't.

211
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Like one time I think me and Munchy like plug RFCK.

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And, and aside from that, I talk about, I talk about Slime and Punishment.

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I give it maybe a little bit more attention than I gave the other special Sonichu episodes just because I'm biased towards it.

214
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But I don't devote like a huge chunk of the lecture.

215
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I think this, it's like maybe like a 15 minute bit talking about it, which I try, I try to be fair.

216
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Because at the end of it is in the context of Sonichu, it is just one special episode among many.

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But also the Canon finale, because it was the last one ever made, LeMau.

218
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So I will be excited.

219
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay, I moved into my new apartment.

220
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Well, my temporary new apartment, and I plan to spend all of this month just grinding the game.

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Because I don't want to fucking, I feel, I feel cursed.

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I feel cursed by all the things that I had wanted to do and haven't gotten done.

223
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And releasing the lecture was one of them.

224
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And now the lecture's out, and I feel a little less cursed.

225
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But the game is another one that is cursing me right now.

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And when I finish the game and finish Slime and Punishment, I will be, most of the rest of the curse will be gone.

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And I'll be free.

228
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh yeah, baby.

229
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah, getting things done one after another.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Fucking putting out making content.

231
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah.

232
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Video is doing great, by the way.

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The video is at, it got, let me, let me, hold on.

234
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I just want to see.

235
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I checked it was like 18K.

236
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's over, it's like 21K now.

237
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hold on.

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The first day, it's funny.

239
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay, the original Sonichu lecture got like less than a thousand views on his first day.

240
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But that's okay, because like nobody knew about it then.

241
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So that makes sense.

242
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And then Tails gets trolled and Kokoro Wish both got about like 4,000 some on their first days each.

243
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This one, on its first day, it got about 13,000.

244
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Ooh, nice.

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And that was pretty good.

246
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And now on the second day, we're almost at two whole days and it is at 22K now.

247
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's having, normally, my usual videos, they have a bump at the end and then they trail off to nothing.

248
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But this one, I'm seeing it has a wave pattern.

249
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's going up and then leveling off and then going up a little more and leveling off and it's done that twice now.

250
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So it's having new bumps as people find it, I think.

251
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's very exciting.

252
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I wish, okay, people say like it's maximizing the SEO that I have it out now, that I released it when I did.

253
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That might be true a little bit.

254
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't think in the long term, it's going to make that much difference.

255
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I think if the video had just been out already, then when this story had broken and Chris suddenly went mainstream,

256
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I think people would have found the video just the same.

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So I don't think it's going to increase the amount of views that I waited this long.

258
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I wish I had just had it out this whole time.

259
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It probably would have been making me some ad revenue.

260
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I guess.

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I mean, I'm trying to think of like, I remember vaguely hearing about YouTube bullshit and algorithms and like the acceleration of views sort of makes it into like a hot video and then it'll get pushed around more.

262
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Maybe.

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If you get like the same amount of views over a longer period of time, it'll appear less.

264
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But I don't know how true that is.

265
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It seems like it makes sense.

266
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah, maybe.

267
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Like maybe if I release it when it's really, really hot and it gets a lot of views really fast, it'll be like more favored for recommendations or something.

268
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's possible.

269
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The, oh, speaking of Chris being mainstream, my mom's birthday was yesterday and me and Kazzy were sitting in the moving truck and I was like, I got to call my mom.

270
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's her birthday.

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's too late.

272
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You know, it's getting late.

273
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Kazzy was like, okay.

274
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And I called my mom and I wish her happy birthday and she says, she says like, Ben, I saw.

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I saw a news story about about that person.

276
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You always used to talk about it.

277
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It was Christian.

278
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It was Christian Weston Chandler.

279
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Right.

280
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I saw it on the news and I.

281
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Kazzy thought it was so funny.

282
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That my mom said that she called Chris that person I used to talk.

283
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I always talk about, I used to talk about it more like to your mom.

284
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I remember, I remember one time I was in college and she came to like, maybe help me drop off some stuff or something.

285
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I remember, I don't know.

286
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I think she just asked me like, what was I up to?

287
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I had been really deep down the rabbit hole.

288
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And I think I did like.

289
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You gave her a whole lecture.

290
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm basically about like, you know, this was in a more innocent time.

291
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This was pre-transition.

292
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Sonichu was still being made, all that stuff.

293
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But I was really excited about it.

294
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And yeah, I think, I don't know.

295
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You saw, yeah, she learned about Chris for me and she recognized, she just, she said that a news article just popped up on her phone.

296
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And normally she doesn't click those, but she recognized the name and was like, this is that person Ben talks about.

297
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What news was it?

298
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't know if I've seen like major news outlets talking about it.

299
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I didn't know.

300
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

301
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I thought that was weird.

302
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I was like, what, what are you using on your phone that just makes news articles pop up on you randomly?

303
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But, but something.

304
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, I have no idea.

305
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
She didn't, she wasn't specific.

306
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
She just said it just popped up on my phone.

307
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No, no further context.

308
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

309
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So that was, that was great.

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That was great.

311
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Horrifying.

312
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Horrifying situation.

313
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Nightmare.

314
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Very cringe in hindsight in the lecture.

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I mean, honestly, the worst, like I'm sound pretty bad because I'm very defensive of Chris throughout the whole thing.

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I'm very much like, you know, just let her be, you know, she's not doing anything.

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
She's just going to, she's just going to do her own, she's going to do her own thing.

318
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No one can, can change her.

319
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Like other people have tried to like scare her straight and like bullier into changing herself.

320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's never worked.

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It doesn't accomplish anything.

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Chris doesn't do anything.

323
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Chris is going to do what she's going to do and no one, it's no one else's business.

324
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But the worst is, is Jesse actually Jesse says like, I mean, she's not hurting anyone.

325
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Right.

326
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And we all, and we all nod like, that's right.

327
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's right.

328
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
No one's getting her.

329
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's right.

330
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Jesse's right.

331
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Absolutely.

332
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah.

333
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So he got the worst.

334
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He looks, he looks the worst in hindsight based.

335
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah.

336
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I hope most people recognize that it was filmed before.

337
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I mean, I think it's pretty obvious.

338
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I put a disclaimer at the very beginning.

339
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's the first thing you see, because I'm like, it's really important when people understand.

340
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I think most people will see it if it's right at the beginning.

341
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Like, like if I had put, if I had put a disclaimer at the end, nobody would see it.

342
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If I had put a disclaimer in the description, nobody would see it.

343
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I knew I had to, it has to be the first thing you see when you click on the video.

344
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And it is.

345
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh, boy.

346
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh, fucking boy.

347
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And it has not been demonetized yet.

348
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Thankfully, even though it talks about rape and incest and Nazis and stuff.

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So, I mean, I hope it, I hope it stays that way.

350
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This, this, this whole, this whole Chris development is so, is so sad.

351
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's so deranged.

352
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's terrible.

353
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I, I really, I really just wish it weren't so.

354
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I really wish this wasn't how it ended.

355
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But it is, I guess.

356
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Unless maybe, I mean, there's still some faint hope that maybe she was just like lying about it.

357
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But I don't know.

358
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah, I wonder about the police procedure and what happened to the mum.

359
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Like, if the mum was there and she's like, um, not demented.

360
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That was the word.

361
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
She's old.

362
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, I think she's got, I, I mean, I've heard, I, people have said that she's got dementia.

363
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't know how true it is.

364
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
We haven't, it's so gross and weird.

365
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't really want to look into it and I have no real like stake in it being true or not.

366
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm, I mean, at the end of the day, all we have is Chris's word and Chris's word is very suspect,

367
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
but she has told multiple people basically the same thing.

368
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And it's, and I don't know why she would lie about it really.

369
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I mean, I mean, she's weird.

370
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
She, but I don't know why she would lie about it.

371
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
She's told multiple people the same thing.

372
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
She's been arrested, which I mean, that's not really proof.

373
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I mean, I guess it has to go to trial or something.

374
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I mean, I, I guess I'll wait and see what like the trial results are.

375
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I imagine, I imagine that if it's true, like bar being examined at the hospital will probably confirm it.

376
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Probably.

377
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And if it's not true, then we'll all be able to say, oh, well, never mind then.

378
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, go.

379
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Oh yeah.

380
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh great.

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
She was just a harmless cuckoo after all.

382
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's, it's, it's really obvious at this point.

383
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And I think it like there was, I mean, you know, you have this like this delusional autistic person and like a very elderly, possibly dementia riddled or Alzheimer's having old, old person in the house.

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Like, I know it's like hindsight is 2020, but like clearly like some sort of like intervention was required.

385
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And that situation is not safe.

386
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
No, it's not good.

387
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I feel like this could have been averted.

388
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't know who, I don't know who should have done what.

389
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah, I guess it's, I mean, social services you would think would intervene somewhere.

390
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I guess.

391
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But I don't know how and.

392
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I mean, I think someone would have to.

393
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I think someone would have to like make a phone call and report a problem or something.

394
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Right.

395
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't know how it works.

396
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah, I'm not as plugged in as you on like the situation Chris was in.

397
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like, just that's the just that she was living with Barb for like years all alone since since Bob died.

398
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay, yeah, maybe he was like, like, together enough.

399
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't really know.

400
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah.

401
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I mean, I don't think I don't think Barb was demented, you know, back then it's been like a while since that happened.

402
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I think, I don't know, it seems or I would believe that maybe her mental state has deteriorated.

403
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's weird and kind of pointless to speculate on all that.

404
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

405
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Everybody wants everybody wants to everybody wants to argue about gender in the comments and I won't let them.

406
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I ban all that discussion because there's no there's no discussion to be had about it.

407
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's so annoying.

408
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah.

409
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Because Chris was a female this whole time.

410
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
She has been one for years and years.

411
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And now people try to say, you know, I can tell it's disingenuous.

412
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But the claim is, oh, you know, she, you know, we can't respect her pronouns if she did this.

413
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And it's like, why does that have anything to do with it?

414
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I think anything to do with it.

415
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I think I think people who see it as like you do it to as a as a favor as charity to the trans person sort of like shows that you don't believe.

416
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It means the transition is real.

417
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah.

418
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
If you just being nice, you're you're indulging what you see as a delusion basically is what that's saying.

419
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Those those people don't actually think that like trans is good.

420
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But this this one time we've got to know they think they think the whole thing is bad and they'll use this as a wedge to be like C.

421
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
C.

422
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah, it's bad.

423
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's like, oh, I only use the correct pronouns to look good.

424
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Essentially, I only use it because it's polite.

425
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm such a kind person.

426
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But if I don't like him, then I'll bring out the the transphobic comments because fucking they're bad persons like they deserve it.

427
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Bring out the transphobia, but I'll but I can have this shield.

428
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I have this shield.

429
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Oh, no, she's a criminal.

430
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
He's a criminal.

431
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He's a rapist.

432
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You're going to respect his pronouns.

433
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
He doesn't deserve it.

434
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's not about respecting a person.

435
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's about respecting you lost your way.

436
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Not even about respecting reality.

437
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's bigger than it's bigger than this one person.

438
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah, it is about respect.

439
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I think I think great.

440
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's about respecting reality.

441
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The correct, the logically consistent and reasonable thing to do is respect everyone's pronouns.

442
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Whatever they say they are, they are.

443
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's the only thing that makes any sense.

444
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And if you don't do that, then you are.

445
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What's the word?

446
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Dereign.

447
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I don't know.

448
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, I see it as a, I see it in the comments being like, well, huh, pronouns, Christian pronouns.

449
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I go, this is derangement syndrome.

450
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This person is ill.

451
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
This person is not well.

452
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This person has lost their way.

453
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It needs to be institutionalized.

454
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It is an on logic is common done.

455
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That it's like the among people who don't believe trends is a real thing and that it's a delusion.

456
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
They don't get like what it is.

457
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And they have no impetus to learn because they feel like, you know, anyone who's teaching it is also deluded.

458
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
They've been indoctrinated.

459
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And they're just then never going to respect it.

460
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
They're never going to change their way.

461
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And it's annoying to see because it's like, you can't argue against people who won't, who like believe that you're delusion, like delusional.

462
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah.

463
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You can't direct them to things because of, and no, impossible, impossible that I don't know everything about this thing that I've never looked into.

464
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's really, it's really just a case of like, man, so often it's like the conservative opinion is just, it's just like what you would think if you were a kid who doesn't know anything and you didn't think about it at all.

465
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And you just were like, I guess that's how it is.

466
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Like that's the conservative opinion on like almost anything.

467
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's reactionary.

468
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That's what it means.

469
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That's right.

470
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The common sense reaction based off of no information or understanding.

471
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes.

472
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The first thing you think.

473
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That's what it is.

474
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That's probably it.

475
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Always.

476
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah.

477
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm sure it all like it.

478
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You know, although that is, I think I'm kind of lucky.

479
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I made it in the comments.

480
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I said like no transphobia in the comments.

481
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Maybe that's why.

482
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But like most of the comments, the video is getting a lot of comments.

483
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Like it's must have like 600 comments by now.

484
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
734 comments.

485
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Most of them are not point, you know, pointless mystification about gender stuff.

486
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Most of it is, well, I mean, it's a lot of like, oh, the timing.

487
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah.

488
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's a lot of, oh my God, like referencing the thing and being like, oh, oh.

489
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You know, Christian, why?

490
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
People are excited.

491
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
People are excited to talk about it one way or another.

492
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And I've given them the opportunity.

493
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,000
People, I mean, I've been getting, I've been getting comments for years now being like

494
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
when is part two, when is part two?

495
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And it feels, I feel, I feel relieved.

496
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I know I was, I was holding onto it for, I was holding onto it because I thought it would

497
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
be cool to make it an event with the end of Slime and Punishment.

498
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
But even so, even though that I didn't decided not to go with that, it still feels great to have it out.

499
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And to be like, where's part two?

500
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Here's part two.

501
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
There it is.

502
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Enjoy.

503
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Enjoy your slop, you pigs from the trough that is my channel.

504
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So exciting week.

505
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Exciting week.

506
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Also moving.

507
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And then like the day after it was like, I was moving the next day and I'm like boxing

508
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
everything and then I hear that I wake up and I hear this Christian news and I'm like,

509
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
this changed everything.

510
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,500
I gotta fucking release the video and I render it and it takes all day to render and upload

511
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,000
and process and it gets all fucked up and I have to redo it.

512
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And I'm like, oh, I'm losing it.

513
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm not going to crest the wave anymore.

514
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But I finally get it out and then like, I watch the analytics for like one day and I'm like,

515
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
oh, Pog, oh, views, oh, number go up.

516
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And then I'm like, I gotta move.

517
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Now I gotta unplug my computer and I gotta get into my fuck, go rent a fucking van and

518
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
drive a van.

519
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
God, I hate fucking driving and I hate driving vans even more.

520
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
They're so big and so scary.

521
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You think you're going to hit the curb all the time because you're so wide.

522
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Jesus Christ.

523
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It should be illegal to drive a van.

524
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
How big of a van is it?

525
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm trying to imagine.

526
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Well, is it like Toy Story moving van?

527
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
No, but I don't remember.

528
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I mean, there's like a truck in Toy Story and I had like a big old thing.

529
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You haul, I'll show you a picture.

530
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You haul nine foot van.

531
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's bigger than like a mini van, but it's not as big as like a mega van.

532
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I feel like I feel like this makes it look smaller than it is, but here's the image.

533
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's it's called the nine foot van, but it's only the like the back storage area is nine

534
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
feet long.

535
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I think the whole thing is probably like 15 or more feet.

536
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It might even be like 18 foot long from like tail to tail.

537
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, I can see us.

538
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's big.

539
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's pretty big.

540
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah.

541
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah.

542
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's big and like you're sort of high up like compared to other drivers, you're like much

543
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
higher.

544
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Look really small in the front in the front window there.

545
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I did I did manage.

546
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You know, I'm complaining about it, but I did manage to flawlessly parallel park this

547
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
thing in a pretty narrow space with very little space.

548
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I did it almost on instinct.

549
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It was amazing.

550
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I really outdid myself.

551
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That was when I was unloading stuff into my new my new place.

552
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Most people came to parallel park in a normal car.

553
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Thank you.

554
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I genuinely don't know how I did it.

555
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I probably I probably shouldn't have tried, but it worked.

556
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
USA USA USA.

557
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You haul you haul.

558
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah, true.

559
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
True.

560
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Man, God, what else do I even have to fucking say about this week?

561
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Huh?

562
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't know.

563
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Anything interesting happened to you?

564
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Well, aside from illness, the illness was the main thing.

565
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I think it was.

566
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, yeah, it's not sucks.

567
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Really.

568
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That's rad.

569
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I the the red man comic from the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter samples have been sent.

570
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I have to go get them though, because I sent them to the wrong address.

571
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I sent them to my parents house.

572
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That's not too far away.

573
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's like an hour or two.

574
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But the pins are arrived.

575
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I put a picture on Twitter of all the pins.

576
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I have not I have not looked at Twitter like I woke up the day I was getting the van and

577
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I got on Twitter just in time to post that screenshot of Chris of Christine Weston Chandler

578
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
deep patroning me on Patreon.

579
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And then I like didn't look at Twitter again.

580
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Right now is like the first time I've been back online.

581
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So I got to go look at all that shit.

582
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah, it's just a big old plastic bag with all little plastic bags of the pins inside.

583
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
They look like they're trapped, but they look happy about it.

584
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So that's that's one of the many things I have to get.

585
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And that's that's about it.

586
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I've really just been trying to take it easy and get over whatever sickness I have from the side effects.

587
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm pretty sure it's the medicine, the HRT stuff.

588
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's specifically the Bicolutamide.

589
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
If any trans people in the audience know what that is, it's supposed to be trans people are listening in the audience.

590
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Stop. This is not a safe place.

591
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
No, you will be you will be bothered.

592
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You will be you'll be harassed in the comment section.

593
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm very you will be hurt by me. Yes.

594
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But like for a while, I've been using it since October, like last October.

595
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So it should not be a problem by like everyone's standards.

596
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I had checked over and over again all the different things like what could be causing me to be fucking sick right now in April,

597
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
which is when all this started.

598
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And it's not the the, you know, my diet, I've been improving that.

599
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's not. I don't know.

600
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It's all these it could be lots of things, but I feel like the most likely is just unfortunate side effects from that.

601
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So I'm going to go off of it for a week.

602
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And I sure hope my boobs don't shrink.

603
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That's the main thing is just they're just going to fall off.

604
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I know they're not. Oh God.

605
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I know the things don't happen that quickly.

606
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And I think boobs are like the only thing that don't change back.

607
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But yeah, it's a sad day.

608
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm going to try and figure out how to do it properly so that I don't get sick.

609
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But it's a lot of it's a lot of like research.

610
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And it really annoys me that it's so difficult to get like actual medical help from the NHS about gender stuff.

611
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm still on like a on a list to get to a gender clinic and I have been since last year.

612
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
There's been not even one email yet.

613
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So I've been I've confirmed that I'm in the system.

614
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm just waiting.

615
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Have you ever watched Golden Girls?

616
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
No.

617
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You know what it is though, right?

618
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Girls that shoot like spies.

619
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

620
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, what am I thinking of? I'm thinking of something from the 60s.

621
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm thinking of totally spies.

622
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Oh, you think of Charlie's Angels.

623
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Charlie's Angels.

624
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay, what's the Golden Girls?

625
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:49,000
No, Golden Girls is about it's the show about it's a sitcom about a bunch of like old women.

626
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
They're just friends and they hang out in a big house.

627
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I watched the whole series of like two years, three years ago, maybe.

628
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And it's just interesting because there isn't there is an episode in which Dorothy played by B Arthur is sick with something.

629
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Whenever you talk about your illness, I think of this episode because it's Dorothy being like, I just feel bad and tired and like I'm going to die and I can't do anything all the time.

630
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And I just don't know how to do that.

631
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And I'm like sounds like Dorothy.

632
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And the whole episode it's like she it's her going to doctors and having doctors tell her there's nothing wrong with you.

633
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You're just hysterical.

634
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You're just a woman.

635
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You don't understand your own body.

636
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah.

637
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah.

638
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then it ends.

639
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That's what it was.

640
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I was having a woman moment.

641
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Just a woman moment.

642
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Just a woman.

643
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I diagnose you as a terminal woman moment.

644
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
She does she does get a diagnosis for like chronic fatigue syndrome, something in the end.

645
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's kind of a it's kind of a happy ending because she gets a diagnosis but also bad because you just have a chronic illness that we don't know what to do about is the diagnosis.

646
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So, you know, mixed bag.

647
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I feel like I'm pretty healthy in most things.

648
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I guess I could exercise more, but I take regular walks.

649
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I eat pretty healthy.

650
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I could eat more fruit, I suppose, but it's not like.

651
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I could definitely eat more fruit.

652
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Damn, I got to order groceries.

653
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I got no food in my fucking house.

654
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Soon as this podcast over, I'm hitting up Instacart and I'm getting a big bag of frozen fried chicken to bake in the oven.

655
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Damn, I'm a genius.

656
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Did you see did you see did you see Kazi's announcement on Twitter?

657
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes, of her being.

658
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Oh, I mean, they, them being shit.

659
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I did live on stream.

660
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I didn't live right now at sites.

661
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I've been having a little trouble remembering that they are a non binary they now, but I'm sure I will.

662
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm sure I will pick it up in a Jiffy.

663
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't know.

664
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I thought that was.

665
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I thought that was funny, I guess, because Kazi has talked about like.

666
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Wearing a binder in high school, but then being like, no, I'm just kidding.

667
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And now, and now they're like, actually, I wasn't just kidding.

668
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And I'm like, yeah, that tracks.

669
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That makes sense.

670
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It doesn't doesn't.

671
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Doesn't see that.

672
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Completely surprising.

673
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah.

674
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah.

675
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I was I was talking to Kazi on the on the on the moving trip.

676
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Oh, coolest thing about the movies.

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I don't have space.

678
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I don't have a basement for.

679
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't have a basement for.

680
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
My weight, right?

681
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah, my lifting, but they their house, as in Kazi and Munchie and and and the others.

682
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
They have a great basement.

683
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Their basement is better than the one that I used to have.

684
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So we brought the rack and the weights.

685
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yes, it is a basement.

686
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
We brought the whack and the rack and the weights over and put it in the basement.

687
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We haven't assembled it yet, but we've got tools to do that.

688
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It has to all be screwed together and it's it's going to be it's going to be pretty cool.

689
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's going to get going to get swole.

690
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I my current place is like a bit of a hike.

691
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It's like a 30 minute walk from them.

692
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But the new place that I'm moving into in a month is like literally like five minutes away.

693
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So I'll just go over there and lift up.

694
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It'll be almost as good as having it in my own house, maybe even better.

695
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Because psychologically, I'll have made the walk and I'll be like, well, I'm committed now.

696
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I have to get my mileage out of this workout.

697
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Right.

698
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I could even jog it.

699
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I could even jog and get some cardio in.

700
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Everyone's always telling me, Ben, why don't you do cardio?

701
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Why don't you?

702
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Why do you lift?

703
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Why do you only lift?

704
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Why don't you do cardio?

705
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Well, maybe I will.

706
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And now that will shut you up.

707
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That will show you you cowards.

708
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I thought like you said, like I may work at jog because the basement is so big that you can jog in there.

709
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
No, it's not that big.

710
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It's like a yeah, the basement is like it's like a hyperloop.

711
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's like a Tesla tunnel.

712
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's just really long.

713
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You can use jog around.

714
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Oh, you know, speaking of the Hadron Space Collider, when I brings reminds me of something, I was thinking because, you know, my intention is still to finish slime and punishment, finish the game, eventually make a book out of it and sell the book.

716
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The I was thinking about whether, you know, you know that I think we talked about it before that that side comic I made nuts the beginning.

717
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, yes, yes.

718
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
The timeline diverges because of whether you choose salted or unsalted cashews.

719
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Close.

720
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It was it's salted almonds or unsalted cashews.

721
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Okay.

722
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yes.

723
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Very important.

724
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I was thinking about, should I just like put that in the book with the rest of it?

725
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Or should I I was thinking maybe it should be a zine.

726
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Maybe it should be its own like side zine.

727
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Or something.

728
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And I was like, I could then I could make a zine.

729
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Making zines is cool.

730
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And I could do it.

731
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But isn't it only like a few pages?

732
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Wouldn't it be like a pamphlet?

733
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's it's probably maybe like 20 pages.

734
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, it would be more like a pamphlet.

735
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah.

736
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
20 pages.

737
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's probably 20.

738
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah, because each, I mean, you know, the timeline split, there's probably like maybe there's maybe like three initial ones.

739
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And then there's probably like, yeah, I think there's probably 20 pages between all the different splits.

740
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Right.

741
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Maybe.

742
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I don't know.

743
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It would be it would be a modestly sized.

744
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It would be a modest zine.

745
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I think like thematically, I kind of like or aesthetically aesthetically, I kind of like the idea of it being separate in like a side book booklet or whatever.

746
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But like practically, I kind of like since it's so short, I kind of feel like it would be such a small booklet and so easily lost.

747
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Maybe it's more practical to just put it in the rest of the book.

748
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I feel like that makes more sense.

749
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Just put it in.

750
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah.

751
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Well, I don't know where you would put it, I guess.

752
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Probably after the beginning.

753
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
After the end.

754
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah, I would have like an in like a, it could be like the scratch intermission, just a little like intermission break in the middle flash flashback or whatever.

755
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, I don't, yeah, I don't know.

756
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah, I was I was thinking about, man, when I'm when I make that book, I'm going to I'm going to have to write a whole like forward about it.

757
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I definitely I definitely want to do the like Homestuck Hussie style, like running commentary on each page.

758
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I think I could, I think I could think of stuff to say about every every single panel, or not every every single set of four panels in the whole book.

759
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I think I could have a comment to make about what I was thinking when I drew them.

760
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You know, I mean, especially, especially the Chris, the Chris stuff later on.

761
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Like, that's that's mostly why I'm thinking it needs a forward, although I probably would have made done a forward anyway and just explain like what what is this to anyone who might for whatever bizarre reason be picking it up without knowing where it came from.

762
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Man, that's going to be great.

763
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
That's going to be so good.

764
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I wish I wish it were ready.

765
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I wish I wish it were ready to do it now, but it's not.

766
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
A long time ago, I like a long time ago now.

767
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But I think before I started making the game, I like got drunk, and I started drawing a couple more panels of slime.

768
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think I got like three done, I was going to do four.

769
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And I got drunk and I like couldn't write the dialogue and I was like confused and I think I like put them away so I have like three panels that are like maybe done I might go back and like fix them because they are probably bad.

770
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Then I was then I was like and then I never touched them again and then it was like I'm not going to I don't want to draw them until the game is done focus on the game get the game done and then draw the panels around it.

771
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yes.

772
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Oh, one more thing you mentioned diet before speaking of diet.

773
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I had a chicken sandwich at Burger King today.

774
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And it was great.

775
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Nice.

776
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Thanks.

777
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Me too.

778
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm tired.

779
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'm fatigued.

780
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm exhausted.

781
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Really.

782
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I.

783
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah.

784
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I mean, I have yours is probably worse, but I, I really was like hauling I was like, I've been like hauling heavy shit around like all yesterday and then like again for part of today.

785
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It has been rough.

786
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And I still like my numb like it's all in my room, but it's all disorganized.

787
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I still have to like put stuff under the bed and like stack other stuff in the closet and like get it.

788
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So it's not just all like lying around and like in the way of everything like fucking coffee table barely even has room in here.

789
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I saw images of the one you're going to next month.

790
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I don't know this one.

791
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
What will describe it?

792
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
This one, I mean, it's small.

793
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It's small.

794
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's got pretty high ceilings.

795
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And it's got a it's pretty unremarkable.

796
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Honestly, there's two big windows.

797
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And they look out onto a little like pavement courtyard that sort of like like the building is kind of like you shaped.

798
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Like in the middle of the you behind it is sort of this little paved courtyard that my that my windows look out onto.

799
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The I did.

800
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Oh, yeah, I showed you the pictures of the other place.

801
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I actually didn't end up taking that room that the landlord said that she recommended that I take a different room in that same building because that room.

802
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It's closet is not in the room itself.

803
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's closet is outside in the hallway.

804
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And I thought that sucks.

805
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So she she told me not OK, it's it's like $25 a month, but I have another room.

806
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It's basically it's slightly bigger.

807
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's on the first floor.

808
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And it has a like a built-in closet and like Bureau and stuff.

809
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And I was like, OK, sounds good.

810
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, this this room that I'm in right now, it's the my other room was very small.

811
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
This one is probably about it's maybe slightly.

812
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The ceilings are making it feel bigger, but like floor space wise, it's probably the same or posters.

813
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
They're not going to bother.

814
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm not going to bother unpacking like anything here.

815
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's all just got to go in the fucking truck again.

816
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
3029 days from now.

817
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah.

818
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It sucks having like a.

819
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Like a one month.

820
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
It feels like a long time while you're in it, but at the same time, if you've got something to do at the end of the month, it doesn't.

821
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Yeah, it was like there's no time at all.

822
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Is that how you felt about the Kickstarter?

823
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Um, you know, not really.

824
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I think mostly because I didn't really need to do anything.

825
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
When the Kickstarter was ended other than sigh of relief.

826
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Oh, yeah.

827
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I was going to say me and Kazzy also talked about how neither of us have started our Lord of Ghost comics.

828
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But no, that's the other thing I have to do this month in addition to the game is I have to bang that out.

829
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yes, please.

830
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah, I will.

831
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I will remind everyone.

832
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
King salmon already finished theirs.

833
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So there's there's pressure.

834
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
There's a little bit of pressure.

835
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Oh, King salmon.

836
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah.

837
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
He's drawing one.

838
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah.

839
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
King salmon is the guy who makes those like robot animations, right?

840
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
That is the guy.

841
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yes.

842
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
That guy is super good.

843
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
He used to be in my old server, I think.

844
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I haven't talked to him a while, but I saw.

845
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I saw him post a like a finished animation.

846
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I think of it was this was a while ago, but he posted like a big finished.

847
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
A gift, I think of like a robot in space doing space.

848
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah.

849
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And it was really impressive.

850
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And they think it got a lot of I think you got a lot of retweets.

851
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah, I'm glad it did because they've been doing that sort of stuff for a while.

852
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
They have their like a Tomowa comic, which is incredible on its own.

853
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But then they've been trying to learn how to animate and doing like fucking incredible little bits like that.

854
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It looked amazing.

855
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Unfortunately, the money I was offering was not quite enough for that level of polish.

856
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So it's a little sketchy, but it's still really like really good.

857
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
There.

858
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You know, man, on the on the other hand, I feel I'm glad that that animation got recognized, but what hasn't gotten recognized is a

859
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Shaddox RFC K Love Web.

860
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's got to be what hovering around like six 7000 views now.

861
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And I just think I just think that's that's like a crime.

862
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
That video is so good.

863
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It's like so high effort and it looks great.

864
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And man, I don't know, 7000 and Shaddox got like a kind of big channel like Shaddox got like 100,000 subs.

865
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
20,000. Yeah.

866
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yeah.

867
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I know they sub for other stuff.

868
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
They sub for like parody animations.

869
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And this is an original animation.

870
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I understand that like not everyone is in the market for that, but like what the fuck?

871
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
What's wrong with them?

872
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's I guess it's because RFC K the discord MMO.

873
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I mean, it feels like does everybody use discord?

874
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Does a discord MMO in and of itself sound interesting or clickable?

875
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I'm not sure.

876
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Like obviously endless war is cool once you're watching the animation, but would people click on it to find out?

877
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I don't know.

878
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I mean, but I feel I feel like I feel like people like animation though.

879
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I feel like people just like animations and this is one and it's a good one.

880
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I feel like you shouldn't have to appreciate RFC K just to like this.

881
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Yeah, I mean people who watch it really love it obviously.

882
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But like if it's not doing numbers, it's probably because people just see it and they're like, yeah, whatever.

883
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't know. I don't know what could be done to improve that.

884
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's it's unfortunate. It sucks.

885
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I honestly, I don't know if this is like, I don't want to be patronizing or anything.

886
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I almost feel like it's my fault like RFC K failed.

887
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I know that's silly, but I almost feel like my my brand my brand didn't carry the the this this work as far as it should have gone.

888
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's fucked up.

889
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:37,000
No, I I don't know whether that's really the problem.

890
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I mean, obviously RFC K is not like a big I think it's just because RFC K is not well known that and that it's like the first episode of Love Web.

891
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
They have like their introductory video about it.

892
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And it's like 59,000 views from last year, which is not that much, but it's something.

893
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I think if if it was like Love Web Homestuck, even though that's like everyone talks about Homestuck, if it was like a bigger thing.

894
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Maybe it would have got more views and got people interested in Love Web as a thing.

895
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Well, then RFC K comes out, but I don't know.

896
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It sucks to see it not be really like loved.

897
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Well, I'm not not not unloved, but like unseen.

898
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Yeah, it's, I mean, I mean, I guess I would hope that if if I mean the plan is there's going to be more love webs like it's a series.

899
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So I guess maybe people that find the series later would hopefully go back and watch the old ones if they like the new ones.

900
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Sure.

901
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah, I'm sure they will.

902
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I just want shout out to succeed.

903
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I want shout out to do really well.

904
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah, I do.

905
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's just, I mean, I know, I mean, this one took like a year to get made, right?

906
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So remember the mask and me for like information about gun girl.

907
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah.

908
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So like, man, I, I, I just.

909
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yeah, like you said, I just I just wanted to succeed.

910
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I just wanted to succeed real bad.

911
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And I, I don't know.

912
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I don't know.

913
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't know what else to say other than that.

914
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I'm just going to like, I don't know.

915
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm just going to like fucking man.

916
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'm going to try and manifest that number go up.

917
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I'm going to just like sit here and just try and like, you know, think, think about it like the secret, you know, like think about that number going up.

918
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And, and then it will in my opinion.

919
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Okay, dude, speak of number go up.

920
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I don't talk about it much because I am embarrassed about it, but I'm not embarrassed anymore.

921
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:00,000
My, my, because I'm getting like retweets and follows on my porn Twitter.

922
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Oh my God.

923
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Put porn that I draw.

924
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Oh my God.

925
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Was it, was it, is it because you mentioned it on the Noida stream?

926
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah, kind of.

927
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It's because Simsie retweeted one of them.

928
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And then I made and then, and it got it like a hundred likes and like, oh my God, numbers go up.

929
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Now I feel motivated to do another one and then I drew another one and that's also getting retweets.

930
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So that's how you do it.

931
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Wait, I gotta, I gotta see.

932
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I gotta see.

933
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Hey, big girl squish.

934
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
What about Gib girl squish?

935
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It's like you reversed it.

936
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It's like I fucking reversed it.

937
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Oh my God.

938
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It's like you fucking reversed it.

939
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Let's see.

940
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's just sort of.

941
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Slosh.

942
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I see that.

943
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That's, that's cute.

944
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
That's funny.

945
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Wait, which one did the, get the, oh the, oh, you know, I saw, I saw Simsie retweeted the, the carrying one.

946
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I saw this and I even liked it.

947
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I even lowered myself to the shameful status of liking a boob drawing under normal circumstances.

948
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I would never under normal circumstances.

949
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I, I watch them and see, I look at them in secret and shame and I would never admit to it, but just this one time I indulged based.

950
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I remember, I remember we were talking about it on the Noida stream, which.

951
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Oh, I'm so sorry you had to leave at the end of the Noida stream.

952
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I was like, we were like almost done and I realized afterwards there were definitely ways I could have gotten it done faster, but you know, I had never done this before.

953
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I mean, it's fine.

954
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I went back to, to watch the rest and you went on for a little longer than I would have been able to stay up anyway.

955
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I mean, I was already like, I feel like the amount of extra, like it was almost an hour after that that it ended.

956
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And what an ending.

957
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Even, even, I think even Simsie had to go.

958
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I think he like woke his mom up or something and he had to go.

959
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Yeah, he was talking too loud.

960
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah.

961
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But, oh man, what, what a stream.

962
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
What a stream.

963
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I mean, yeah, I spent eight hours just doing prep work.

964
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
But you know what?

965
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It was worth it.

966
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I made the sun, sun, sun get and then off stream.

967
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I couldn't help myself because like, you know, it was eight hours of prep work to get strong enough that I didn't have to be afraid of making the sun.

968
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Once I was that strong, it wasn't actually that hard.

969
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So I went and I did it again and I made the dark sun down at the dark moon.

970
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And then I was like, well, that was easy.

971
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And so then I went and I made two more sons, one regular and one dark.

972
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Wait, you did this off stream?

973
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah, I did this off stream.

974
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yeah.

975
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Wow.

976
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah, I said I would maybe stream it, but I was like, I'm there already.

977
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I'll just, I'll just do it.

978
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So then I made, so I had four sons.

979
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I made two, I made a regular son and a dark son right at the, at like the top of the, at the mountain of like the starting area.

980
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And I crashed him into each other and I did the supernova.

981
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And I did the thing where you bring the final boss of the game up to the sky and have him die in the sunlight.

982
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And that gives you achievement.

983
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Supernova, by the way, I learned that when you crash the dark son to the regular son, what it does is it like transforms.

984
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It transforms all of like certain materials, like soft materials, I think in the entire world into like liquid fire or something.

985
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And it just evaporates.

986
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So it basically just like destroys the entire world, except for like the hardest materials still like stay around in chunks.

987
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
When you say soft, do you mean like dirt and sand?

988
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Yeah, dirt and sand.

989
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Although it was inconsistent though, because I went, I did the supernova and I went over to the right and I was, and the ground was still there, like the hills that I was walking over.

990
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
They were still there, but like they weren't on anything.

991
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Like it was just like, it was just a layer of dirt that was like kind of slope like hills.

992
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And the layer went down to like where maybe it would have turned to stone and that stone was gone.

993
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So like that dirt survived, but like all the stone under it was gone.

994
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I don't know.

995
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It was weird.

996
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It erased a lot of material, but I wasn't sure.

997
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And like it disappeared a lot of the pyramid, but like the soft like door material that's easily breakable through it like left that behind.

998
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I don't know.

999
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It was it was bizarre.

1000
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And it basically is like, you've done everything you can in the game and you want to just fucking destroy the whole fucking world.

1001
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Well, here you go.

1002
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
The supernova will do that for you.

1003
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
No problem.

1004
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
And now I have the crown.

1005
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Now I have the crown on my little guy.

1006
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And it's based.

1007
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I got the pendant and I got the crown.

1008
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Nice.

1009
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
One more can you ask for?

1010
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Fuck yeah.

1011
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I'd like to do another notice, not another stream, but another.

1012
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yeah, you want to do another Minecraft one?

1013
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Minecraft.

1014
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah.

1015
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I just want to hang out.

1016
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I like the atmosphere of those where it's like, it's the same as the PCP, but there's fan interaction.

1017
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
There's fan interact.

1018
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
There's just viewers and there's just sort of no stakes.

1019
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Our viewers would never our viewers would be deeply insulted to be called.

1020
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I know that's why I changed.

1021
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Yeah.

1022
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
We're just the animals at the zoo.

1023
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
That's all.

1024
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
They come to look at us.

1025
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Yeah.

1026
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:06,000
We're freaks in a glass cage in the aquarium.

1027
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Yeah, let's do another one.

1028
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
God, I hope my fucking internet gets fixed by then.

1029
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Surely you can like, cold your land person.

1030
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Well, no, because the, I don't know if I explained it on stream that like the network that I'm supposed to connect to, it just doesn't let me connect.

1031
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Other networks in the house, I can click on them to connect and it brings it up like enter the password.

1032
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And I don't know the password, but this one, I click it.

1033
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I do the same thing.

1034
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I click it and it just never brings up the enter the password screen and it just goes to like, we can't connect to the network.

1035
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So that it's insinuating that it's, it thinks you're trying to put a certain password in.

1036
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's the wrong one or is it just not even.

1037
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I don't know.

1038
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I tried, like I tried, like I deleted like all my old network settings.

1039
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I don't have any like preferred like networks set up or anything.

1040
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So it shouldn't be like thinking I'm trying to enter the wrong password.

1041
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It shouldn't be.

1042
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I asked the guy because like the other guy that lives here, he set up the Wi-Fi and he, I asked him like, what am I doing wrong?

1043
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And he was like, I don't know.

1044
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Like all you do, you're, it's supposed to just ask you the password and I'm, it's just not doing it.

1045
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And I'm just, neither of us know what the problem is.

1046
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
So I don't know who to call about it.

1047
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I guess the modem people.

1048
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:47,000
God, I guess maybe I could, I guess maybe I could just call fucking Verizon or whatever or whoever is the, yeah, maybe, maybe that's the only thing to do.

1049
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Maybe they got some weird thing was like only certain amount of things can be accessing the modem at once.

1050
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
No, there's no way.

1051
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
That wouldn't make any sense.

1052
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It'd be ridiculous.

1053
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
That would be ridiculous.

1054
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, my head hurts.

1055
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It takes an ibuprofen.

1056
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:21,000
All I have to, all I have to eat or I'll have to drink in the apartment right now is my, is almond milk from a big case of almond beverage that I bought a long time ago.

1057
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So I'm just like guzzling it.

1058
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I will get, I will get groceries soon.

1059
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I will buy some.

1060
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I already said I would get, oh man, that like the crispy, the crispy wings, the crispy chicken wings, you bake in the oven and it comes with little sauce packets, little buffalo sauce packets that you can just drizzle over them.

1061
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
A real, a real treat.

1062
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:53,000
A real treat, I tell you what.

1063
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I got nothing else to say.

1064
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Do you got anything else to say?

1065
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Okay.

1066
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah, just follow at big girl squish.

1067
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
There is nudity on there, but you know.

1068
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Oh, my God.

1069
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Not that much.

1070
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Not that much.

1071
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I don't draw a lot of like sex.

1072
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's mostly just boobs and the occasional penis.

1073
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
That's fun.

1074
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Oh, wait.

1075
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,000
The first nudity I found was this one of like Terezi getting pinched.

1076
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Oh, yeah.

1077
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That's that's that's sweet brisk and hella resi.

1078
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
That's the sweet brown LHF, but brisk and Terezi parody.

1079
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of these.

1080
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That's my magnum opus.

1081
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That's fun to read.

1082
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Although Twitter has ruined it because they're tall images.

1083
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And so Twitter doesn't like that.

1084
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So even if you zoom in, they're sort of crunched.

1085
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yeah, it used to be on new grounds, but difficult.

1086
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I thought I thought I'd move them all over.

1087
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
You posted on new grounds.

1088
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Yeah, secretly just for a bit.

1089
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Secretly.

1090
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I see.

1091
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I realized as soon as like numbers go up on my tweets that, you know,

1092
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
what being secretive about my porn was a bad idea.

1093
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I like seeing numbers go up on them.

1094
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'll try harder.

1095
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I may even retweet my own things on give and take.

1096
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I didn't realize.

1097
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I didn't realize number.

1098
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Now that I realize number could go up.

1099
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
This changes everything.

1100
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It literally does.

1101
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I see.

1102
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh, I found iconic character, sex woman.

1103
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Sex woman.

1104
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Pretty good.

1105
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Sex woman, sex woman.

1106
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Uh, based.

1107
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Yes.

1108
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
True.

1109
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
True.

1110
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Oh, I found Femgabe.

1111
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Oh, yeah.

1112
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Okay, enough, enough.

1113
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
What's next?

1114
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
What's next on the agenda?

1115
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I guess questions.

1116
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I don't really have anything else.

1117
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Yeah.

1118
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It's mostly just been trying to get better.

1119
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So question time.

1120
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
You were, you said at first that you weren't going to be on today.

1121
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And I was, I was prepared to just do like a like solo band cast where I just like

1122
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
talk for 15 minutes about the Christian stuff and then just go right to voicemails.

1123
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So viewers, you've been treated to a bonus, a big bonus today.

1124
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Bonus of a normal PCP episode.

1125
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yes.

1126
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
But think about it as a bonus.

1127
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Think about it as a secret extra that you didn't deserve, but we're giving you anyway.

1128
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Think, feel guilty about it and go patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

1129
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1130
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And pledge some money.

1131
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Oh yeah, definitely.

1132
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Definitely pledge some money to the procrastinators in my opinion.

1133
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
That should be done.

1134
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Are you, are you have the voicemails open?

1135
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I'm ready.

1136
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
What's the first one?

1137
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Uh, it's Frost Drive.

1138
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Okay.

1139
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Uh, three, two, one, go.

1140
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Anime of the week, you guys need to watch.

1141
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Okay.

1142
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I can't believe you haven't even watched it already.

1143
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It's called freaking Monkart.

1144
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
It's like Pokemon, but they got little animals and they're driving go-karts.

1145
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
It's freaking incredible.

1146
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
The little chibi monsters get in the car and they race.

1147
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And here's the kicker.

1148
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Once they're on the last lap, the trainer send out a magical thing that makes the car

1149
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
transform into a robot.

1150
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And then the person, the little fucking Monkart puts his foot down and says, it's real.

1151
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
It's racing time is over.

1152
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's time to tussle.

1153
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
We need to fight.

1154
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And so the whole race, the whole point, the whole race is just no, because they just

1155
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
stopped racing and they fight.

1156
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
They fight every time, right before they finish.

1157
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's freaking awesome.

1158
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It's called Monkart.

1159
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:23,000
That's just a genuine anime recommendation.

1160
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It doesn't.

1161
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Well, I guess maybe it doesn't.

1162
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I guess it looks kind of like an anime.

1163
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I mean, it's 3D, which is cringe.

1164
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Was it Monkart?

1165
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Monkart with a K.

1166
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
It is spelled like Monk.

1167
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I like this show better when it was called Zach Bell and there were no cars.

1168
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I like this better when it's called Digimon.

1169
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh, yeah.

1170
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And there were no cars.

1171
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
This just looks like the sort of thing that would be like translated into the West and

1172
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
put on like a Saturday morning cartoons alongside whatever else thing.

1173
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Yeah.

1174
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Why not?

1175
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I don't know.

1176
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Reminds me of the 2000s.

1177
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Viewers, you know, feel free to take Frost Drive's recommendation for Monkart.

1178
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
For me, I don't know.

1179
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't know if I'm in the demographic for this.

1180
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Oh, next voicemail is called Based Ben Saint.

1181
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Three, two, one, go.

1182
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Ash, your post was the worst fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.

1183
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
You are a freaking freaking moron.

1184
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
A low IQ, subhuman, troglodyte.

1185
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I hate you.

1186
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
What was that in response to?

1187
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I can't remember.

1188
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:52,000
That was on May, a.k.a. Pantsu Party, a.k.a. I'm Supercute, a.k.a. Sadintrad's old stream.

1189
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
What was the stream called?

1190
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That's right.

1191
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
What was your stream called?

1192
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
The May Report.

1193
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I don't remember.

1194
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
No.

1195
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It wasn't corrupting your kids.

1196
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Was it just called Pantsu Party?

1197
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
It wasn't cockcast.

1198
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Whatever.

1199
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
It was ever her fucking...

1200
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
It's the May Report.

1201
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Whatever her fucking totally disorganized mess of a fucking discord stream was.

1202
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:37,000
She had Ash Vampire on one time, and Ash Vampire read out this thing he had...

1203
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It was him and Glink.

1204
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Glink was the other guest on this time.

1205
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And Ash Vampire had written out this long, totally deranged screed about how George Floyd and Derek Chauvin were basically the same.

1206
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
They were both bad, actually, when you think about it.

1207
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And...

1208
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah.

1209
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And so I said...

1210
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And so I just waited until the end of it, and I said that, and I think I was banned from the server after that.

1211
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh, did you hear May?

1212
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
It's engaged to Ethan Ralph.

1213
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I think I saw that.

1214
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Oh, man.

1215
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
That's so good.

1216
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
No, they deserve each other.

1217
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
They really do.

1218
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I guess.

1219
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I told Kazzy.

1220
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Kazzy was like, oh, Kazzy pogged.

1221
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
They were there with the fucking Chris Chan arrest, weren't they?

1222
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah, I was just going to say...

1223
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah, Ethan Ralph is the one who took that...

1224
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Yeah, that film, you know, the scene of Chris Chan with the cops all around her, like arresting her.

1225
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Yeah, that was Ethan, I think, on the killstream.

1226
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Who, I guess...

1227
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Because I had heard people saying that there was like a situation developing where, like, Chris had checked into a hotel, and the cops had, like, surrounded the hotel or something.

1228
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
They were, like, demanding...

1229
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
They were, like, going to the hotel to get Chris out.

1230
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I guess Ethan, who I know also lives in Virginia, must have, like, just heard it was going on and just been like, I gotta go see.

1231
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Which, I mean, you know, fair enough, I can't fault him, his initiative, I guess.

1232
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
But I was like, oh my god, that was Ethan Ralph.

1233
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Seeing on the scene.

1234
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It all comes together.

1235
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It all fucking ties together.

1236
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Why is the world so small?

1237
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Why do I know all the... Why do I, like, have all these connections while these fucking weirdos?

1238
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Next voicemail is called Tonight the Hunt.

1239
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Three, two, one, go.

1240
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Dear, oh dear, what was it?

1241
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
The brony lecture?

1242
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The gigging?

1243
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Or the horrible memes?

1244
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1245
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:14,000
It always comes down to the PCP's helpers came after these sorts of messes.

1246
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Could you understand that?

1247
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
It was really quiet and I didn't really understand it very well.

1248
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Well, they asked the question, what is it, something, something or something?

1249
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
What?

1250
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
What was it?

1251
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
The brony lecture?

1252
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The horrible memes?

1253
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I don't, I don't understand what you're saying.

1254
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I don't understand the point.

1255
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Do they just mean, like, oh, things sure are weird?

1256
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I mean, yeah.

1257
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I guess so.

1258
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Yeah, in which case, yeah.

1259
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I mean, true.

1260
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Helpers, though.

1261
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I don't have any helpers.

1262
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Well, maybe we're the helpers.

1263
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Maybe we're a hamburger helper.

1264
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
When we talk about that on the stream, too.

1265
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It really all just ties all together.

1266
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
It all comes back.

1267
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Whoa.

1268
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Well, next one is on vocaru.

1269
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
You got the link?

1270
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Oh, the vocaru link?

1271
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Yeah.

1272
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah, you got to do the URL.

1273
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Okay.

1274
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Okay.

1275
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Three, two, one, go.

1276
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Wait, how did that start?

1277
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It's a Pink Floyd bit.

1278
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
So I was about the PCP?

1279
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I was a fan of the PCP, I think you said.

1280
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Uh-huh.

1281
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Uh-huh.

1282
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
But whose worms were you eating?

1283
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I don't get it.

1284
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I thought, I thought it was, he'd eat his words.

1285
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
He made me eat his words.

1286
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But I, yeah, I don't know whose words.

1287
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Hungry for worms?

1288
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
No.

1289
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Hungry for words.

1290
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Shut up.

1291
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Shut up.

1292
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Thanks for the song, bro.

1293
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah, nice.

1294
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Thanks for the cover.

1295
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Very nice.

1296
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Good vocals.

1297
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Good quality.

1298
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Loved it.

1299
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Next voicemail.

1300
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Shit, I got to go back to...

1301
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Where did I, what?

1302
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Oh, here they are.

1303
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Oh, it's just an Imgur link.

1304
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Uh, it is.

1305
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Let's see.

1306
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Wait.

1307
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I hate being wrong, I hate being wrong.

1308
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
We've got you surrounded.

1309
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Admit the videos are yellow.

1310
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I think that's you.

1311
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
That's definitely me.

1312
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Is it DeVoo?

1313
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It closely resembles DeVoo.

1314
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
More than anyone else.

1315
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I think it looks like DeVoo.

1316
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I think DeVoo was in my corner on the yellow debate.

1317
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
So I think it's me and DeVoo.

1318
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I hate being wrong.

1319
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I hate being wrong.

1320
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Same.

1321
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I hate taking an L.

1322
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
It's the worst thing that can happen.

1323
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I hate taking an Y.

1324
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
This is like the door we came through.

1325
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
There's like P on the ground or something.

1326
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Everything's just yellow, I guess.

1327
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Just some yellow stuff.

1328
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Okay.

1329
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Next voicemail is called...

1330
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Oh, crap.

1331
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Fuck.

1332
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Okay, here we go.

1333
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
The Virgin...

1334
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Nate, do you want to read these or should I read these?

1335
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I'll read it.

1336
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
The Virgin Natehead.

1337
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Browsers 4chan in current year.

1338
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
No Nate, no watch.

1339
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Thinks it's cool to wear sunglasses indoors.

1340
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Says Gotham after every attempt at humor.

1341
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I mean, I do that.

1342
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Everybody does that.

1343
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I occasionally do that.

1344
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
That's not strange.

1345
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That's based in fact.

1346
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I'm occasionally guilty of that as well.

1347
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Is he holding little dumbbells?

1348
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Yeah, he's working out.

1349
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Sure.

1350
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Nateheads don't actually work out.

1351
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
They just wish they did.

1352
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
They think it would be cool if they did.

1353
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yeah, they hold them.

1354
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
They just hold them.

1355
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
As they walk...

1356
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Is this like Murdock?

1357
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Like green skin from Gorillaz?

1358
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Why is it green?

1359
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Because he's Nate colored.

1360
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Oh.

1361
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I see.

1362
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
He's wearing like a monk robe.

1363
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Like a friar tuck.

1364
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I read it as like a trench coat.

1365
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Oh, okay.

1366
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I don't know.

1367
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
And then the gigachad mage simp.

1368
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Mix his music with the sounds of mage's voice.

1369
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
She's just on holiday.

1370
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm sure she'll be on the next podcast.

1371
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Tried going to Lithuania, but ended up in Latvia by mistake.

1372
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,000
If you talk of a mage, he will knock your teeth out.

1373
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I don't really get...

1374
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I get it.

1375
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I mean, I get it.

1376
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I think the joke is that there are no...

1377
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Mage simp?

1378
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Well, not here anyway.

1379
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
They might be elsewhere, but there are...

1380
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Like nobody is like, oh, where's mage?

1381
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Why isn't mage on the podcast?

1382
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Maybe this person is watching the episodes back

1383
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
for the first time through or something.

1384
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
If you're a mage simp, let us know in the comments

1385
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
about the time you tried going to Lithuania,

1386
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
but ended up in Latvia by mistake.

1387
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's an easy mistake to make.

1388
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
They both have an L in them.

1389
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
They both...

1390
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
They both took an L.

1391
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
You take an L either way, basically, is what I'm saying.

1392
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Next voicemail.

1393
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Expert CWC analyst Mozilla Fennekin.

1394
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Three, two, one, go.

1395
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Yo, did you guys hear that Chris Chan did something weird?

1396
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
That's fucking crazy, bro.

1397
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I can't believe this.

1398
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
That's so weird, bro.

1399
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Have you talked about it on the PCP yet?

1400
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I think you guys are fans or followers of Chris Chan.

1401
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It would be cool if you did a podcast

1402
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
talking about the DMD that Chris Chan did.

1403
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I actually have some thoughts about it with myself.

1404
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Hang on a minute.

1405
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Let me just drink some water real quick.

1406
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
A little thirsty.

1407
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
The opposite of the piss.

1408
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Some good-ass water.

1409
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So, the Chris Chan thing...

1410
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It's pretty weird.

1411
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
True.

1412
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Trace?

1413
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Great.

1414
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Well said.

1415
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1416
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Next voicemail.

1417
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Bad comment awards show.

1418
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Two, seventy-one.

1419
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Three, two, one, go.

1420
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Please get XXX, Tentastia next, please.

1421
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Wow, that's so funny.

1422
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You did a Reddit fucking non-sequitur meme character joke.

1423
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
They should get Shrek on the podcast next.

1424
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
They should get Big Chondus on the podcast.

1425
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
You're right.

1426
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
That was really funny.

1427
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yeah, you know, I know humans.

1428
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Humans know Mike Myers and he voiced Shrek.

1429
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Maybe Mike Myers can get Shrek on the podcast.

1430
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Maybe we can get...

1431
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Can we get Charles Schultz, the creator of Peanuts?

1432
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Do we know a guy?

1433
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Who can get...

1434
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Well, I think he's dead, so we need to reanimate him.

1435
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I think we can get...

1436
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
We can do whatever needs to be done.

1437
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I agree.

1438
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
You get someone called Charles Schultz, who isn't Charles Schultz of Peanuts fame.

1439
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
What if we just found someone who just happens to have that name

1440
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
and get him on and send me Charles Schultz on the podcast?

1441
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
That's how you fucking get that SEO.

1442
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I agree, though.

1443
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I agree, though.

1444
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Haha, what if you got someone who would never be on the podcast?

1445
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
On the podcast.

1446
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Well, we won't.

1447
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
What if?

1448
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Oh, next one is PCP Bad Comment Awards show number one.

1449
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Three, two, one, go.

1450
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So there's like two waves of comments on this episode.

1451
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
There's like, there's the original from the actual upload,

1452
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
the wave of people from when the podcast first started.

1453
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And then there's people probably around the time Trixie left four months ago,

1454
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
whatever that was.

1455
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
These people just coming back and like talking,

1456
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
just crying about how great the podcast used to be.

1457
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So those are two like separate waves, so I'm just going to give out two awards.

1458
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
So the first award is the old one, the one from five years ago

1459
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
from someone, Subsonic Sparkle, saying how many channels is enough,

1460
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
which is amusing.

1461
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It's a classic because it's, you know,

1462
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
This is just Trixie's a fucking anime podcast.

1463
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Who are all these other people on Trixie's anime podcast?

1464
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
You know, they would have said Digi at the time.

1465
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You know what I mean?

1466
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
How many channels is Digi?

1467
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
For a modern example, for a modern comment,

1468
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
the modern award, we go to Bob Slap Happy from four months ago

1469
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
saying, uh, RIP this friendship simulator.

1470
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
And I don't think I have to explain that one.

1471
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Uh, that one doesn't seem that bad.

1472
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
It's basically kind of true.

1473
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Like that friendship simulator is gone.

1474
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
That dynamic probably won't come back.

1475
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Yeah, I don't mind that one that much.

1476
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It's fair enough.

1477
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I agree with the first one though.

1478
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
How many channels?

1479
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
That's a, that's a, that's a, I know who Subsonic Sparkle is.

1480
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
If they, yeah, that's a horrible comment.

1481
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And, and I'm embarrassed for them for having said it.

1482
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
You should always make a new channel every time you make a video.

1483
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Why, why, why wouldn't you?

1484
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Wow.

1485
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Another anime podcast with famous anime YouTuber Digi bro.

1486
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Imagine that.

1487
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I don't know how much worse it would be if the PCP was hosted on,

1488
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
on Trixie's channel.

1489
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
They'd all be gone.

1490
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Yeah, they would.

1491
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yeah, she would have trashed them.

1492
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Uh, where, I mean, that was never, was, did we talk about doing that?

1493
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Was that like a, a plan at one point?

1494
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I vaguely remember because somebody had to make the, the, you know,

1495
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
the YouTube channel for it.

1496
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And I think we may have talked to them very briefly about like,

1497
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
where should we put them?

1498
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Where should we put this podcast we're going to do?

1499
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Well, then it would have been Trixie's anime podcast.

1500
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It would have.

1501
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I don't know whether that was suggested,

1502
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
but I feel like it could have been, it could have happened.

1503
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Yeah, maybe.

1504
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Um, I think, I don't think, speaking just for myself,

1505
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I think me, I think me and probably Nate would have been like, no to that.

1506
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I don't think either of us would have been happy with that arrangement.

1507
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Um, so it probably was never going to happen, but yeah, maybe.

1508
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Um, next one is called Ben's Best Friend.

1509
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Three, two, one, go.

1510
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Hello, Ben.

1511
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I am pleased to hear of your progress regarding Road to Radcon.

1512
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I hope you used that week to work on your video game and that you are not homeless.

1513
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Please have a good day.

1514
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
What week?

1515
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Uh, I'm not sure what week you mean, but yeah,

1516
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I am going to be working on the game and I did finish writing Road to Radcon

1517
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and Michi is, uh, she sent me some progress pictures of the,

1518
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
uh, should I, should I show them?

1519
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I mean, should we show them on, no, I'll save it.

1520
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I'll save it until it's done.

1521
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Um, but yeah, she sent me some progress pictures of the cover and it's looking,

1522
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
it's looking great.

1523
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Uh, I, duh, I can't wait.

1524
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Uh, I can't wait to send it in the mail to all the backers.

1525
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Uh, uh, I guess I should mention, by the way, if you are a backer and you back over $100,

1526
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
you do get a Road to Radcon book in the mail.

1527
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Um, I will send them to everyone's old address that they listed on Kickstarter before.

1528
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Um, but I will send out a message to everyone on Kickstarter saying it's been a long time.

1529
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
So if you've changed address, please let us know.

1530
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So we don't send it to the wrong place.

1531
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Um, but I will make, I will be announcing that on Kickstarter, like when it's ready to go out.

1532
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Uh, I will probably like make that announcement, wait like a week.

1533
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Anyone that doesn't respond, I will probably send it to the old address that they gave.

1534
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And then anyone that does, I will change the address.

1535
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Um, and then do you know what that means?

1536
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
When Road to Radcon is out, when Road to Radcon is out and sent,

1537
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:54,000
the last thing, the last thing will be the Brad rap music video and the OVA.

1538
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And then when those are out, we get the Radcon money.

1539
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And the dojin.

1540
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Oh God, oh that's right.

1541
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Oh shit, that reminds me, I forgot the dojin.

1542
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I know, I forgot the dojin.

1543
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I sent a message to someone about that and I forgot to respond.

1544
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So I should go and respond to that.

1545
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Okay, uh, I won't elaborate at the moment.

1546
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Next voice, but the Road to Radcon, I mean the, the Radcon money.

1547
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Yes.

1548
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
It's money.

1549
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I want it.

1550
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
A big amount of money.

1551
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
We still haven't got paid for our participation.

1552
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
No.

1553
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Or reimbursed on, I think some of our flights were reimbursed, but not all of them.

1554
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I was reimbursed.

1555
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I'm pretty sure I was reimbursed on my flight and my expenses because I saved all my receipts

1556
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
and I showed Nate and I was like here.

1557
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I'm pretty sure we got reimbursed, or I did anyway.

1558
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I think.

1559
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
But anyway, next, I'm just really excited to have money.

1560
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It's been sitting around for a year and a half.

1561
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Why Nate heads be the way they be.

1562
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Three, two, one, go.

1563
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:12,000
So as much as I love this video, uh, the Nate fandom was irrevocably ruined due to the thesis

1564
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:17,000
statement of the girl in the gone video, which is a good video and a good thesis statement

1565
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,000
is very well made and is a good message and is backed well by the rest of the video and

1566
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
all that stuff.

1567
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,000
But still, when you go around talking on the internet about how to be a better man, the

1568
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:37,000
children who really, really want to be a man and be told how to be a man and not actually do

1569
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
anything swarm.

1570
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So that's why Nate heads are so awful.

1571
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Makes sense.

1572
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I think there's an element of truth.

1573
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
There's an element of like.

1574
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
There's a certain kind of person who responds in a very particular way to that kind of

1575
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
messaging.

1576
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
That's true.

1577
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Yeah.

1578
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Um, I mean, I don't know.

1579
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Yeah.

1580
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Yeah, this is, I mean, it's more to it than just that.

1581
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
But, uh, yeah, sure.

1582
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Why not?

1583
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Okay.

1584
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Next one is called sorry if you hear people in the background three.

1585
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
No.

1586
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Yeah.

1587
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Sorry if you hear people in the background three, two, one, go.

1588
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Hmm.

1589
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Cole Smitty's been pretty quiet recently.

1590
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Hmm.

1591
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I was, I was thinking, God, imagine, imagine if you were Cole Smithy and you heard the

1592
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
news.

1593
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Who's that?

1594
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
That is Chris Chan's a half brother who is also the, he's a movie critic.

1595
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
He calls himself the smartest critic in the world.

1596
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
He's not that he's not particularly famous.

1597
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Probably the thing he's most known for is, is being Chris Chan's half brother.

1598
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Um, Chris Chan has a, actually has a lot of like half siblings, but I think all the other

1599
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:01,000
half siblings were with half with his dad, but Cole is half with, uh, their mom.

1600
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
So, but Cole like hates them.

1601
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Like Cole like hates his mom and it hates that whole side of the family.

1602
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I think I don't think Cole has anything to do with them and good for him, frankly.

1603
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Um, so maybe he doesn't care.

1604
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Maybe he's just like disowned that whole mess and is like removed.

1605
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I did go and I checked on Twitter and I did see a lot of people adding him being like,

1606
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
check on your mom, bro.

1607
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Oh, bro, you should log off the internet.

1608
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It's time to log off the internet for good, bro.

1609
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Just trust me on this one.

1610
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And I cringed and I hated it.

1611
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Leave the guy alone.

1612
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
You fucking losers.

1613
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
What is wrong with you?

1614
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,000
The man has never done anything wrong his entire life.

1615
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Fuck you.

1616
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That pissed me off.

1617
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Um, next one is called a plea.

1618
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Three, two, one, go.

1619
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
This entire time I've thought that like Ben was a professional podcaster,

1620
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
but I read the papers and oh my God, it's like art.

1621
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
You can make art.

1622
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Wow.

1623
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Why don't you make more?

1624
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Um, it's hard.

1625
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
It is hard.

1626
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It's hard.

1627
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
One.

1628
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I'm making a video game.

1629
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
God, leave me alone.

1630
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
But Ben, there's not constant updates.

1631
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I want the constant updates at the game.

1632
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I know.

1633
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I know.

1634
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
No, no, I know I'm slow.

1635
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Yeah, I'm slow at it.

1636
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Like the reason there's not more is partially,

1637
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I think I'm just kind of slow at doing stuff.

1638
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Sad, but true.

1639
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:43,000
But, uh, looking forward to the game.

1640
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Game's gonna be hype.

1641
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Game's gonna be hype.

1642
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Next one is called, uh, fuck kristinewestonchandler.mp3.

1643
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Three, two, one, go.

1644
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Hi.

1645
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
It's Toy Gazers again.

1646
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Okay.

1647
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
We're releasing a fire distract against Kristine Weston Chandler.

1648
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Here we go.

1649
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Let's get it.

1650
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Hey Kristine, you're a real motherfucker.

1651
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
This was bitch about the fucking gun.

1652
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
So she ain't been signed.

1653
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
That's a bummer.

1654
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Cause Ben's saying it's cool in the winter and the summer.

1655
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Now what the fuck have I been hearing?

1656
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Never in my fucking life.

1657
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Kristine has been rewritten in 103A.

1658
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Sounded right.

1659
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Been the shit that's made me sick.

1660
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Badge Chan could not predict what.

1661
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Rather rocked off the unclean than watch for stink.

1662
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
His father slips.

1663
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I'm legit sick.

1664
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And I don't fuck around with this shit.

1665
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But I can't wait to see what happens next.

1666
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So patiently, I said.

1667
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Yeah, that was my short.

1668
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Nice emergency distract against Ben St.

1669
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Associate Kristine Weston Chandler.

1670
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
My close personal friend.

1671
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Now remember to give me money.

1672
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I'll give that an applause.

1673
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I enjoyed that.

1674
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I'll give that a dollar.

1675
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I'd buy that for a dollar.

1676
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Another fire distract from Toy Gazers.

1677
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
How can this man ever miss?

1678
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
No.

1679
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Nope.

1680
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Nope.

1681
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Next one is called Big Chicken's Egg of CWC

1682
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
or Manifesto Touch Some Bresto.

1683
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Three, two, one, go.

1684
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I feel like it is not impossible that Kristine

1685
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
was mentioned this episode with the recent goings on.

1686
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Now more than ever, it is the perfect time to have her

1687
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
on the show.

1688
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
But this begs the question.

1689
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Is it a moral thing to have her on the show?

1690
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
She's in jail.

1691
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
When was the PCP concerned with morals?

1692
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I seem to recall the phrase sex with the young

1693
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
being a particularly popular mantra.

1694
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
And yes, it is true.

1695
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I am acting on bad faith.

1696
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I am a bad faith actor.

1697
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I love acting on bad faith.

1698
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,000
We are the dreamers of dreams and the tweakers on memes.

1699
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Why would it be bad to have Chris on?

1700
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
No, I think he's saying, wait, wait, you're asking

1701
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
why it would be bad to have Chris on the podcast?

1702
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Yeah.

1703
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Why would it be morally wrong to have Chris on the podcast?

1704
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I guess people could argue we're platforming a criminal.

1705
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Oh, we're platforming.

1706
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Oh, she's going to spread all her.

1707
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
She's going to spread all her dangerous ideas

1708
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
that people are going to pick up and run with.

1709
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
No, goofy.

1710
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
That's goofy.

1711
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I mean, obviously we can't because she's in jail.

1712
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Sure.

1713
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I feel a bit weird having her on anyway.

1714
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I mean, I don't want to have her on.

1715
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I didn't think, oh, we should get her on the podcast after this.

1716
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Okay.

1717
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
If you're just talking about morally, then I don't think it would be morally wrong.

1718
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But also like, what is there to fucking talk about?

1719
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
No, it's like, like you just ask what the fuck and then they just would dodge the question

1720
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
because of course they would.

1721
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I mean, I haven't seen that video of her being arrested,

1722
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
but I guess she was shouting stuff about like the about like true love

1723
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
and the dimensional marriage and stuff.

1724
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Apparently I saw something that says that like Chris thinks

1725
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
the dimensional marriage is happening now.

1726
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Like that's what she thinks this is or something.

1727
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Maybe.

1728
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
No.

1729
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Next voicemail is called Big Chicken's Egg of Dashing Mr. Transom.

1730
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Three, two, one, go.

1731
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Tarbuck, call me.

1732
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Okay.

1733
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Just call his name.

1734
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Call Big Chicken.

1735
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Call Big Chicken, go.

1736
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Oh, Big Chicken's Egg.

1737
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I don't know what their name is.

1738
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I think they are Big Chicken and this voicemail is their egg.

1739
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I see.

1740
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
That's how I read that.

1741
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Next voicemail is called Cross They Them, a criticism of Nate's scripted content.

1742
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Three, two, one, go.

1743
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
One of the biggest appeals of scripted content is that it allows you to condense your ideas

1744
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
through the use of word choice and sentence structure

1745
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
that you just wouldn't be able to replicate on the fly.

1746
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
However, Nate seems to view scripted content as a way for him to explore

1747
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
every possible nook and cranny of whatever idea he is trying to communicate,

1748
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
even when the nooks and crannies are both unnecessary for making his point

1749
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
and just plain uninteresting.

1750
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Looking back, this has been an attribute of his writing ever since he switched over

1751
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
to primarily scripted videos starting with Why Smash Matters,

1752
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
but it's become more and more apparent because in the year since,

1753
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
his scripted content feels like it has lost track of a subject matter,

1754
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
and thus something to dissuade him from following every tangent that pops into his head

1755
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
as well as something that he can apply the theme of each video onto.

1756
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Though even the Ghost in the Shell and Kingdom Hearts videos would occasionally

1757
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
drone on about stuff that didn't particularly contribute

1758
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
to what it felt like the point of the video was.

1759
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
This is of course making assumptions about Nate's mindset towards the new style of content

1760
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
and could very well be inaccurate, but this is what it looks like to me

1761
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
from an outsider's perspective, and based on what I can tell,

1762
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I disagree with what I think are Nate's reasons for shifting towards more scripted content.

1763
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
What do you guys think?

1764
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I think that's pretty accurate.

1765
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:12,000
That sounds like a pretty well-considered opinion that I can't really respond to

1766
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
because I don't really watch all Nate's videos or anything.

1767
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I watch Nate's videos when they come out, and I have seen the Kingdom Hearts one

1768
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:28,000
because that was a big Nate thing, Kingdom Hearts 3,

1769
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and so it's finally the review, and it was a bit meandery,

1770
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:40,000
and it's hard to tell what was important to explain why the game was good or not,

1771
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:48,000
but I haven't played the game that much to know whether it was too meandery or not,

1772
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,000
but the nickel video that came out was so confusing,

1773
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:04,000
and it really does speak to not having a theme or a purpose for the video to come out.

1774
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
There's no point that's being built to,

1775
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:16,000
even though there is the aesthetic of a purpose or a point in the nickel graph,

1776
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
and it was very confusing.

1777
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I just basically said the same thing, but worse.

1778
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Cut that out, at least I just cut it out.

1779
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:33,000
At least I celebrated, highlighted, cropped, put that on the bonus episode.

1780
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I should have just said true.

1781
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
True.

1782
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Next voicemail is called,

1783
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Often Problematic, Tarbuck Transom, 3, 2, 1, go.

1784
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
They are fighting for you, but they also say something that is pro-Israel.

1785
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
They're treated way worse than, for example, Steven Crowder.

1786
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Why do you think the imperfect allies are hated more than our actual enemies?

1787
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I would put it down to the actual bad people being so clear in their wrong thoughts

1788
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:38,000
that there's no reason to waste effort trying to argue with them or change their mind.

1789
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:46,000
It is probably a fault and a failing that people do act like this.

1790
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I understand why they act.

1791
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
It's because you had hopes for a person,

1792
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
or you thought this person was good,

1793
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:58,000
and then when they do something that disappoints you, it hurts you.

1794
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:04,000
It is offensive to you in more ways than if someone you already hate says something hateful,

1795
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
you go, uh, more of that, right?

1796
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Yeah.

1797
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
It's purity testing, and I don't like it most of the time.

1798
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:23,000
All of the time, purity testing is a thing to test whether you're one slip up and suddenly everyone hounds you.

1799
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
It's like people make mistakes.

1800
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
People have misunderstandings that they carry forward and don't realize until they say something weird.

1801
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
So it's like, I don't know.

1802
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:41,000
I like to see, I like to think, I mean, I maybe am too charitable because I didn't,

1803
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I would not really jump on the, like, John Tron as an evil white nationalist bandwagon when that was happening.

1804
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Yeah.

1805
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I mean, he's pushed back on it, thinking that, oh, he's just misunderstood, or he's just sort of dumb.

1806
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Yeah.

1807
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:03,000
It gets harder to, to, like, use that excuse the longer he continues to be kind of cringe.

1808
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Yeah.

1809
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I mean, I understand wanting to assume the best, and like, no, it must be a misunderstanding.

1810
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I don't know.

1811
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:16,000
John Tron's pretty, John Tron pretty clearly says some stuff that is pretty indefensible.

1812
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Yeah.

1813
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,000
And then doesn't walk it back later when he, when he gives his quote unquote apology about it.

1814
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Yeah.

1815
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Like, it was really the only at the beginning, and only because I knew and liked his content and being on Game Grumps and stuff.

1816
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Yeah.

1817
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Yeah.

1818
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
But now it's, it's pretty clear that he's, he's not a good boy anymore.

1819
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I don't think so.

1820
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
He doesn't seem like a very good boy.

1821
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:56,000
But it sucks when somebody who is like generally like tries very hard to, to do the right thing and has their heart in the right place clearly and just has a wrong opinion about something or like a bad opinion, a bad take.

1822
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Yeah.

1823
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,000
I don't think it really affects that much, but it sucks when people like harass others.

1824
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I guess I don't have much more to say about it than that.

1825
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I get it.

1826
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
It's not good, but I get it.

1827
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Next voicemail is one cool dud, three, two, one, go.

1828
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Benjamin, I love you, but I swear to God, if you scrape cutlery to dish again, I will be leaving dead animals on your porch every day for the next five to 10 years.

1829
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Okay.

1830
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Well, I'm not, like I said, I only have almond milk to eat now, so no cutlery.

1831
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
When did you do cutlery?

1832
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Last episode, I was eating, I don't think you were on the last episode.

1833
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Were you?

1834
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
No, you were.

1835
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Did he, he had Brussels sprouts?

1836
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I don't remember.

1837
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Yes.

1838
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Yes.

1839
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
It was, it was bacon and Brussels sprouts.

1840
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:01,000
They, they must have been able, maybe discord didn't pick it up, but yeah, it was, I was eating Brussels sprouts with a fork.

1841
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
The whole time.

1842
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Yeah.

1843
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Oh, a lot of it.

1844
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Yeah.

1845
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
A lot of it.

1846
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Okay.

1847
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Next one is another one called based Ben, three, two, one, go.

1848
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Okay.

1849
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
So all the other historians are messing up.

1850
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:21,000
They won't talk about this right now because she's messing everything up in their life.

1851
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And Gibi, oh, I'm breaking good with this, but I don't really want to.

1852
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
This is awkward.

1853
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I'm not going to be very careful.

1854
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Jesus, Samuel, going on vacation.

1855
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
No cutting person out.

1856
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Ben St. based, dropping the sausage you lecture.

1857
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Ben, I hope you make a ton of money on it.

1858
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Good for you.

1859
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Oh, oh, you're okay.

1860
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I could kind of not understand.

1861
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Well, but I think like, like, oh, like Gib, that guy, Gibi, who I think sucks.

1862
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I think Gibi is bad.

1863
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I've never watched his video, but he sounds bad.

1864
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Didn't he?

1865
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
He announced that-

1866
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
The person doing the 300,000 part documentary.

1867
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
No, that's, that's, that's Gino Samuel, who I kind of thought seemed shitty, but I've

1868
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
heard that maybe he's not like I thought he was.

1869
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Like, I kind of thought, I know Gibi doesn't respect trans people.

1870
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I thought Gino didn't either, but someone on Twitter told me no, he does.

1871
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
So I'm like, oh, maybe I was, maybe I was wrong about him.

1872
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:36,000
But I think, I know, I know, like they put, I think Gibi might have said, like, I'm not

1873
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
covering Chris anymore, or like, I don't want to cover this or something.

1874
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Or he might, I don't believe that, even if he did do that, I don't believe it.

1875
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
But yeah, like Null, and Null did some shit.

1876
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Like he like posted some updates about like past conversations with Chris that he'd had

1877
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
and then he like rescinded them and tried to delete some stuff.

1878
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I don't know.

1879
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I think this is all water in the bridge at this point.

1880
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And it's all, I'm sure, I'm sure that, I think Gino might have said he wants to like

1881
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
stop doing Chris stuff or something or-

1882
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I don't know.

1883
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Maybe just jumping out.

1884
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Saying, saying their thing, trying to look good, I guess.

1885
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I don't know why they would not continue doing content.

1886
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I think that's true.

1887
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Like why, why would this make you stop?

1888
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Why would this make you stop making a documentary about just because the person who was doing

1889
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
it did a crime?

1890
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
And you're like, I don't want to, I don't want to talk about-

1891
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I don't want to platform this person anymore.

1892
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Yeah, it's not platforming.

1893
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
It's, yeah, that reads to me as like-

1894
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Some sort of virtue signal.

1895
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Yeah, some sort of virtue signal.

1896
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Like what is the point?

1897
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
What is accomplished by that?

1898
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Why?

1899
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I don't get it.

1900
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
But I don't even believe it anyway.

1901
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
They're not actually gonna-

1902
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Gibi and Gino make their fucking content.

1903
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It's all, it's based on making Chris-chan related stuff.

1904
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
They're not gonna stop.

1905
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Gino makes like $1,000 a month.

1906
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I didn't know.

1907
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I checked out his Patreon.

1908
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
He makes a lot.

1909
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Gibi, I don't know how much he makes.

1910
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
But Gibi stuff seems really stupid.

1911
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Gibi stuff seems like little, little like sort of like the quartering style videos where

1912
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Chris like rants about something, but it's something dumb that Chris said.

1913
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Like on Twitter or whatever.

1914
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Um, this is stupid.

1915
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
People, like, I don't know.

1916
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
People, like I said this before, people in the comments were asking me,

1917
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
you should just-

1918
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Would you make videos that are more about Chris?

1919
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I'm like, I don't want to.

1920
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I don't want to be like, Chris said some stupid shit.

1921
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Chris said some crazy stuff.

1922
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Here's the word on the street in the tail.

1923
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Yeah.

1924
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
A lot.

1925
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I think we were talking in my Discord the other day about how if Chris gets institutionalized,

1926
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,000
someone needs to like go and visit her and like collect her drawings and collect her

1927
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Sonichu comics and upload them.

1928
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I want them to be shared with the world.

1929
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Would she even be allowed like pencils in a place like that?

1930
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I guess it might not be.

1931
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I guess it's not like a universal thing.

1932
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
It's only for people who are likely to attempt to hurt themselves.

1933
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I don't think Chris would hurt herself.

1934
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
So, yeah, I don't see why they wouldn't-

1935
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I don't see why they wouldn't let her draw.

1936
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,000
The problem is whether she would upload them,

1937
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
whether there's any way she could get them online.

1938
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
That's why I think someone needs to go and like,

1939
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
someone has to be the guy to go and collect once a month.

1940
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Just go and drop off and pick up all her drawings and upload them.

1941
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Be her profit, her envoy.

1942
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I mean, it could be you, Ben.

1943
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Well, Nate's in Virginia, so we should get Nate to go do it.

1944
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
We should get Nate to go.

1945
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
It's him or Ethan.

1946
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
It's one of the two.

1947
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
The only people in Virginia.

1948
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Next voicemail is called It's All No Good.

1949
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Three, two, one, go.

1950
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And remember, if someone touches you in a place that makes you feel uncomfortable,

1951
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
that's no good.

1952
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
That's no good.

1953
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Absolutely right.

1954
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Can't stress enough that it isn't good.

1955
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Next voicemail is called The Dug Zone.

1956
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Three, two, one, go.

1957
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
It's called The Dug Zone.

1958
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,000
It's all about Doug Walker.

1959
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I'll look it up.

1960
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:52,000
The Dug Zone.

1961
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:59,000
My first result is for a place called The Dough Zone Dumpling House.

1962
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Hmm.

1963
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
The Dug Zone.

1964
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Oh yeah, it's on Audible.

1965
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
You know what, honestly, I would listen to this.

1966
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
This does seem interesting, and I think I might listen to it.

1967
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I might actually listen to this podcast if you can believe such a thing.

1968
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Oh, there's only three episodes, though.

1969
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
They just started.

1970
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Fuck it, I'll give it a shot.

1971
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I'm gonna listen to The Dug Zone.

1972
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I didn't watch, what was that anime everyone tried to tell me to watch?

1973
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Not Promare.

1974
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
You're a nostalgic critic.

1975
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
No, that one about the animals driving a taxi or something?

1976
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Mole car?

1977
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
No.

1978
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Mon car.

1979
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
You mean Mon car?

1980
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
No, this was a while ago.

1981
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Everyone was trying to tell me to watch this anime about animals driving.

1982
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Neon Genesis even.

1983
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Shut up, no, I don't know, whatever.

1984
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I don't know.

1985
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Wait, no, I know what it is, or do I?

1986
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Is it furries driving or animals driving?

1987
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1988
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
No, it sort of looked like a Gretzko, like it was little cute animals.

1989
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It wasn't like anime anime.

1990
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Okay, I don't know then.

1991
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Wait, anime about animals driving.

1992
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Odd taxi, first result, odd taxi.

1993
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Everyone was trying to tell me about odd taxi, I didn't do it.

1994
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,000
One guy tells me to listen to The Dug Zone, I'm all in.

1995
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I'm all in for The Dug Zone.

1996
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Okay, next voicemail is, I don't know Shreddit.

1997
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Three, two, one, go.

1998
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
It was kind of funny hearing the Shreddit guys say, oh, we know who this is.

1999
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
This is Pie Whip or some shit.

2000
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Nah, nah, nah, nah, this is Bob.

2001
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
It's always Bob.

2002
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:57,000
But I had this idea about how I'm posting these shitty,

2003
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
stupid, parasocial voicemails all the time now.

2004
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
And I don't like it.

2005
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I don't like it about myself.

2006
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
So, why did you make this voicemail?

2007
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
I realized, I make myself laugh.

2008
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Or I make, I make you make content that makes me laugh.

2009
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
And I like that.

2010
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
So, thanks.

2011
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Also, you're welcome.

2012
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Berserk Homestuck thing.

2013
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
It was a question of which should I read first?

2014
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I'm very busy and I don't have time to enjoy life.

2015
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
So, yeah.

2016
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Oh, well, I thought it was like asking which was the best one.

2017
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Well, if it's, if it's which you should read first,

2018
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
read the Eclipse arc of Berserk first.

2019
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
No question.

2020
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Eclipse arc?

2021
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Isn't that what it's called?

2022
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Is that the beginning?

2023
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Yeah, the part with Griff and Casca.

2024
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I'm almost sure it's called the Eclipse or something.

2025
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Oh, the Eclipse is the thing that happens at the end of the Golden Age arc.

2026
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Golden, is it the Golden Age arc that I'm thinking of?

2027
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Okay.

2028
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
That's quite a lot of stuff.

2029
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I mean, if you're reading, you may as well read the entirety of Berserk

2030
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
because it's ended.

2031
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:25,000
No, because it's, it's way, Berserk is way longer than just the Golden Age arc.

2032
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
The Golden Age is just.

2033
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Yeah, but it's good.

2034
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I'm saying, okay, read the Golden Age arc.

2035
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
If you really like it, then keep.

2036
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Then you'll keep going.

2037
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
At that point, reevaluate.

2038
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Okay, did I really like it?

2039
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I'll keep reading it.

2040
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Am I like, had enough of it?

2041
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Then read Homestuck.

2042
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
But I would say, read the Golden Age arc first and decide from there.

2043
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
It's, it's way easier to read the Golden Age arc of Berserk than to just read Homestuck.

2044
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Although, although, you know, you can read, you can read act one of Homestuck in like one day.

2045
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
No problem.

2046
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
A couple of hours, like an hour maybe.

2047
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Yeah, I.

2048
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Although it's not very representative of the rest of the series though, because it changes so much.

2049
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So.

2050
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:15,000
They're so long and so different that it seems weird to say one over the other is a good

2051
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
thing to start with.

2052
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I'm trying to think of which one takes longer.

2053
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
So I guess read Berserk in that way up to the eclipse.

2054
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
You'll know it when you see it.

2055
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I think, I think so.

2056
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I think that's a good recommendation.

2057
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Next voicemail is not Frost Drive.

2058
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Three, two, one, go.

2059
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Listening to the PCP has made me a better person.

2060
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
It's helped me learn, grow, and be a much more confident artist.

2061
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Because I'm way better than you guys.

2062
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:50,000
And all y'all are all making the big bucks, even though you suck.

2063
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I got the Vapers 2 Kickstarter book, and when I opened that, I said, wow.

2064
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
My little sister could have done this with her broken crowns.

2065
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:04,000
And when I read Lord of Ghosts on Tapas, I've seen better ghosts on first dates.

2066
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Uh, owned, I guess.

2067
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Uh, okay.

2068
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Next voicemail is called Rip Chris.

2069
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Three, two, one, go.

2070
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I can totally understand if y'all don't want to answer this question.

2071
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
But was May just as abhorrent and awful as she seems?

2072
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Yes.

2073
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
During the arrest of Chris.

2074
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Okay, I didn't watch that video.

2075
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I fucking hate her.

2076
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I didn't watch that video, and I don't know what she's doing in that vid, so I'm not sure.

2077
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
But May is awful.

2078
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
May is, yeah, she's, I got the sense.

2079
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Like earlier on, she seems normal enough.

2080
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:01,000
But she's been increasingly with the breakup with Trixie.

2081
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
She was bad even before that.

2082
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Sure.

2083
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I didn't see it, because I'm, I don't know.

2084
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
In my opinion.

2085
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Yeah.

2086
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
No, I'm better.

2087
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
She sort of, she sort of went back on her like trans-positive stuff as soon as Trixie broke up with her.

2088
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Of course.

2089
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Which was really cringe, and then also the other stuff.

2090
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I think she broke up with Trixie, actually.

2091
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I can't remember.

2092
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I feel like it was a mutual thing, but like, it's sad for both of them as well.

2093
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
I think, I think, I mean, this is my understanding.

2094
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
What I remember is that-

2095
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Is that May was just, May was fucking Ethan in secret for who knows how long, and then eventually she was like,

2096
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I'm leaving to go get with Ethan Ralph.

2097
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,000
She, um, I was-

2098
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
That's all you need to say about her, honestly.

2099
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Yeah.

2100
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I was, I was thinking, damn, they only moved in together.

2101
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
They only been together like six months.

2102
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
That's really fast to get engaged.

2103
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But then I was like, nah, but who knows how long she was cheating on Trixie with Ethan before that.

2104
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
So they could have known each-

2105
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Who knows how long?

2106
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
They, they, you know, this, who knows how long, right?

2107
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
It's plenty of time.

2108
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
They're good.

2109
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
They're gonna have a great, they're gonna have a great time.

2110
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
It's gonna be great just like Ethan's last marriage.

2111
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
It's gonna work out great.

2112
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Everyone's gonna be real, real fucking happy and chuffed about it.

2113
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Was he married before?

2114
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Yeah.

2115
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I know he had a girlfriend before.

2116
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,000
To the like 17-year-old, to that like 17-year-old that he got pregnant,

2117
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,000
and then he had a fucking, uh, uh, like domestic abuse lawsuit filed against him.

2118
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Or, no, it was her, sorry, it was, it was harassment.

2119
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:45,000
There were allegations of domestic abuse, but the lawsuit was her dad, uh, like, like, uh,

2120
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:54,000
sued him, or like, took him to court over like the fact that he was supposedly harassing this girl over their kid,

2121
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
who she didn't want him to have access to, or something like that.

2122
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I'm not really an expert.

2123
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
This is just what I've seen around.

2124
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Um, I'm, I'm almost positive they were married.

2125
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I'm like 99% sure they were married.

2126
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Faith was the girl's name.

2127
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Um, yeah, so, you know, and then, and then, and then there were those creepy, creepy DMs of May trying to coerce

2128
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,000
this like 18-year-old to have to have the threesome with them.

2129
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Yeah, what the fuck?

2130
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Really, really creepy.

2131
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
May is not a good person.

2132
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
We're wording.

2133
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I met May, before the breakup, I met May, and May was, in person was dull, quiet, basically just like,

2134
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
basically just pretended not to be there.

2135
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:56,000
She would sometimes laugh, and there would be like no joy in it at all.

2136
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Uh, just awful, just awful.

2137
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Um, and now she's getting married to Ethan Ralph, so, you know, destiny, I guess.

2138
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Next voicemail is called, oh, but then she messaged me after I told Trixie off on Twitter,

2139
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:22,000
we had the, after Trixie, Rage quit the PCP because I was right about everything.

2140
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Uh, and then we had the falling out on Twitter, and then she went on Twitter to be like,

2141
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I don't like Ben St anymore.

2142
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:34,000
May messaged me to be like, I'm glad you got away from that toxic person, and I didn't respond,

2143
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
because I don't fucking care what May thinks.

2144
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Um.

2145
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Wacky.

2146
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,000
She, she followed me, and then I, I didn't want her to see that I, that I blocked her.

2147
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
So I didn't block her, because I don't want her to pay attention to me.

2148
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So I just, I just soft blocked her and made her unfollow.

2149
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I don't want her looking at me.

2150
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Next voicemail is called, Nate Mates, hot take, fire emoji.

2151
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Three, two, one, go.

2152
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Nate heads, horrible name.

2153
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Why aren't you guys called Nate Mates?

2154
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
That rhymes, and I like rhymes.

2155
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Everybody, everybody wants to mate with Nate.

2156
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
There's a whole leak about it.

2157
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Also, Mikkel, more like bad video that could be summed up in 10 seconds.

2158
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
As a, as a Nate, as a Nate mate would say, got him.

2159
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Uh, Nate mates is pretty good.

2160
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I don't know, we just fell into the habit of calling everyone Digi heads, Ben heads, Nate heads.

2161
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Something head, yeah.

2162
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Um, I don't know, Nate mates is pretty good.

2163
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I'll give it to you.

2164
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
What would, what would a Ben follower be?

2165
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Ben fan.

2166
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I've only, I've heard Ben heads, I've heard Saint heads.

2167
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Um, I haven't heard, I don't think I've heard any that aren't head, head related.

2168
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Hmm, hmm.

2169
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Ben buddies?

2170
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
No, that's too personal.

2171
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Yeah, I kind of like that.

2172
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
That's funny, Ben buddies.

2173
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Uh, uh.

2174
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Can't think of anything for Gib.

2175
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Gib, uh.

2176
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Grabbers, Gib grabbers.

2177
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Gib takers, uh, I don't know.

2178
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Gib and, yeah, Gib takers.

2179
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Then they're just takin' for me there.

2180
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
All they always do is take, take, take, take.

2181
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:35,000
You can pledge to my Patreon and I will pay you money.

2182
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
I'll pay you double what you pledged to me, to be a taker.

2183
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
You know you can pledge to be a Gibber or a Taker.

2184
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Uh.

2185
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
It's like-

2186
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
New FCK but with Gibbers and takers.

2187
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:54,000
It's that meme of like, you know, the two doors and like everyone is lined up for one and no one's at the other.

2188
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
And it's like no one for Gibbers, everyone for takers.

2189
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Damn.

2190
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Really, really says a lot about society.

2191
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Ugh.

2192
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Next one is called- we're almost done, by the way.

2193
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Next one is called a soliloquy for a fallen hero.

2194
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Three, two, one, go.

2195
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Whatever happened to Kringis-Bingish?

2196
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:21,000
How could I possibly know now when to Kring and watch to Bing?

2197
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Please come back.

2198
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I mean-

2199
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Truly sad that we haven't got a Kringis-Bingis in a while.

2200
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I haven't- I haven't- I have neither Kringed nor Bing since he disappeared and I just feel so empty.

2201
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I feel nothing.

2202
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I feel nothing about anything.

2203
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I see something Kring worthy and I just can't bring myself to do it, doesn't feel right.

2204
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Ugh.

2205
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Oh, I see Oblivionfall.

2206
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Okay, I just want to mention that in the chat, in the PCB guest server, CC was surprised that we're recording on a Monday, because that's not normal.

2207
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:16,000
And then in reply to the meme about me and Davoo calling Jesse's videos yellow, Oblivionfall posted a video that I hadn't seen before.

2208
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
It's a Vsauce video called This Is Not Yellow, and the thumbnail is-

2209
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I haven't seen that.

2210
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I haven't seen- I feel like I should have seen this, because I was really invested in that controversy back in the day.

2211
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:35,000
It's- oh, it's just about how like computer screens cannot show yellow because it's made of red, green, and blue light, and there's no light and stuff.

2212
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:42,000
The Tom Scott one underneath that Eleazar posted is more directly about that sort of thing.

2213
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Incandescent like warm lighting makes things look orange or yellow, and then cold lighting from daylight makes things look blue.

2214
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
The videos were yellow.

2215
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,000
The videos were kind of- yeah, it was because there were incandescent lights in his basement.

2216
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Yeah.

2217
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
They kind of cast a yellow glow.

2218
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
He should have called his gaming channel the yellow glow.

2219
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Haven't thought about the blue glow in a while.

2220
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Yeah, most of the blue glow episodes are all patron exclusive.

2221
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Oh, shit.

2222
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I think actually all of them. I still get notifications.

2223
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I see.

2224
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Wait, like the old ones are patron exclusive?

2225
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
No, no, no, no. Any new things coming out is patron.

2226
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I see. I see.

2227
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,000
They're still kind of fun, but I haven't clicked on a lot of them.

2228
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Are you a patron?

2229
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Yeah, $1 patron. I just want to see the videos.

2230
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I think what do I patron you for? It's either $1 or $5 just so I can get your monthly cast.

2231
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
The Money Spenders podcast.

2232
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
That's the one, the Money Spenders podcast.

2233
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Next, which I'm still behind on. I don't think I've listened to the last two now.

2234
02:08:53,000 --> 02:09:00,000
We'll catch up one of these days after after I listen to the Doug zone, obviously.

2235
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Last voicemail is called Making Vidya and doing it quick.

2236
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Three, two, one, go.

2237
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Ben, now that you've been using Game Maker for a while, have you thought about participating in any game jams?

2238
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:18,000
It seems like something you might enjoy and I'd be interested in seeing the type of stuff you'd make in that context.

2239
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Everyone thinks of the big ones like the Ludum Dare, but I feel like you'd probably enjoy some of the smaller ones out there a bit more.

2240
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Like the GB Jam held every August, where you're limited to certain constraints of the original Game Boy, which I've enjoyed a lot personally.

2241
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:37,000
There's also some Game Maker focused ones like the Quarterly Jam 48 or plenty of Nisha one-off jams you can find on itch.io.

2242
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I presume you'd want to finish your current game first, but what say you?

2243
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Yeah, if I wasn't working on the current game, yeah, I think I would really like to be in a Game Jam.

2244
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I think I would rather do art than do Game Maker program.

2245
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I would rather do sprites and stuff for a game, but I would totally do something like that.

2246
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I think Crack suggested that maybe we should do a Game Jam at some point in the future, which I would do.

2247
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:13,000
So yeah, I would like to do a Game Jam eventually of something.

2248
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
It would be cool.

2249
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I see Game Jams all the time, and I'm like, I can't imagine thinking of a small idea.

2250
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
How could you do that?

2251
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Thinking of a small idea?

2252
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:37,000
A small idea for a game like, oh, you just jump and you grab fruit or whatever.

2253
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Like, oh god, but where's the lore? Where's the Dark Souls? Why don't get it?

2254
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Oh, sure.

2255
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
It's not huge.

2256
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I mean, if I made a game that was just like, you jump and you grab fruit, I'm sure in my head I would be like, oh yeah.

2257
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Actually, this girl, she's the farmer, but she's like an immigrant or something.

2258
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:07,000
This is like a temp job during a harvest festival in the society.

2259
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:12,000
In my head there would probably be, I probably couldn't avoid coming up with some lore.

2260
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's probably like every game, the creator always has more lore,

2261
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:24,000
and there's always more lore in their head than they could possibly put into the game.

2262
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I saw, oh, Kazzy had the Undertale art book that had like a bunch of pre-production sketches that Toby had done,

2263
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,000
and then passed off to artists to have them done and finished.

2264
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
And it's really funny, a lot of them are like complete chicken scratch.

2265
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
This looked like shit.

2266
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:53,000
It was really interesting to see like that, like different versions of character,

2267
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,000
and like unused sprites that never made it into the game and stuff.

2268
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Just fucking like shit drawn with a mouse.

2269
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
It was neat.

2270
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
It was cool.

2271
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
What were we talking about?

2272
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Making a video, jams.

2273
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Yeah, I can use Game Maker and I can do some Game Maker coding now.

2274
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I feel like probably I would still be best as an art role in that situation.

2275
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I feel like probably there are many people who can code much better than me and would be better as the program or so.

2276
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Ideally I would like to do a jam, and I would just be an art guy, and it would be base.

2277
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Yes.

2278
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Yes.

2279
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Shit, I guess we're done.

2280
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Wow.

2281
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Wow, this is the shortest PCP in the ages.

2282
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Only two hours fifteen.

2283
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Yeah, wow.

2284
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:58,000
So short.

2285
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2286
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:07,000
There wasn't that much to talk about other than the huge thing that there was to talk about.

2287
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
But there wasn't much to talk about about that.

2288
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Unless we wanted to get into a whole bunch of shit and I didn't really want to.

2289
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I will be making a...

2290
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:23,000
It's been a little while since I did an update for my Patreon Q&A podcast.

2291
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I will probably be doing one of those today or tomorrow to announce that.

2292
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:41,000
And I will probably have more tales of the horrors that I had to endure with moving and stuff.

2293
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:51,000
And maybe I'll get into more of the nitty gritty of responding to some of the shittier comments on the Chris video.

2294
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Or whatever.

2295
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I'm going to do a Q&A and probably talk more.

2296
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:03,000
I feel like this month was all taken up for me with house hunting and moving.

2297
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
So I feel like I didn't get to do anything else.

2298
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
It sucked.

2299
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I hate it.

2300
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
So yeah, whatever.

2301
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Nothing to talk about.

2302
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Nothing at all.

2303
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Just two hours and fifteen minutes of dead air you just listen to.

2304
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I'm hungry.

2305
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I'm going to order some Instacart groceries.

2306
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Right.

2307
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I'm going to get that chicken.

2308
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I'm going to do it.

2309
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
You can't stop me.

2310
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I don't want to.

2311
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Okay.

2312
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:41,000

about to come out.

2327
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,000
We should we should update like the the way that like the the the list the the playlist

2328
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
because I think like people have people have access to it.

2329
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
That's that should be for patrons only.

2330
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
We got to change that URL or something.

2331
