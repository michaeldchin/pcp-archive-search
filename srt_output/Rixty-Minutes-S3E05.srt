1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Fuck me and my fucking asshole, what's up everybody, it's Riksy Minutes, I'm the best guy ever here with Digibro.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, I'm still alive.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He sure are dude, so we just watched episode 5 of season 3, what was this one called? The Grand Adventure of Jerry and Rick?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The Whirly-Durly.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The Whirly-Durly.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Of course, of course, who could forget such a wonderful name.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, so this was way better than the last episode, right out of the gate, a thousand times better.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh yeah.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We got a lot of flack for not liking the previous episode.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We sure did.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It seemed like. Some people really enjoyed it.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And so many people were just like, guys, you fucking tools, obviously it was a Avengers reference, therefore all your criticisms don't make sense and are invalid.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, literally what the fuck is the difference between an Avengers reference and a Guardians of the Galaxy reference?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Literally what? Because the Guardians of the Galaxy are a part of the Marvel Universe, they're another five person team, and they're in the fucking new Avengers movie!

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So what the fuck is the difference?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think what they were, it doesn't make any fucking difference, but to these incredibly pedantic people, it's that these guys form up as a team when called upon, like the Avengers do, they're not always a squad.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Who the fuck cares?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, I know.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It doesn't make any difference.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What the fuck effect does that have on the episode?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Zero. Zero.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's nothing.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Which, and I know you haven't seen the Avengers either, have you?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, I haven't.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Exactly.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So it doesn't fucking have affected anything.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I have, and I still, I don't give a, it makes no difference.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, it's just that thing.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Like we say something that's like, not even like wrong, but like slightly maybe a bit incorrect, and so that may, allows there to be a justification for why we're just totally invalid.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Our entire point of opinions can be thrown out at that point.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't even, I can't even like process the idea that it's less correct to say it's a Guardians of the Galaxy parody than it is a Avengers.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They're literally the same thing.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You got what?

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But they're in space, yeah.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You got, like the dude who's like the human guy.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Uh-huh, yeah.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You could say he's Star-Lord.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You could say he's Tony Stark.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Either way, it makes just as much fucking sense.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yep.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're right, dude.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is the pile of ants supposed to be the Hulk, or is he supposed to be-

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like Ultraliter, that other guy?

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Vision?

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, Tree-B-Oh, Groot.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Groot.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, Groot.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, there you go.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't fucking know.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is he supposed to be Groot, or is he supposed to be some of it?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It doesn't matter, because none of them are a direct parody.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That was my whole complaint.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Anyway, forget about that episode.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, that one doesn't matter.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's move on.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So-

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This one's great.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, this episode was really great.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It was fucking great.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I loved it.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'd say I loved it.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It was everything I wanted.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This felt like a season one episode to me.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It really took me back in a way.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In a way that I really wanted.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In a way that was good, refreshing.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, and some people were asking me, because they preview the shit out of the episodes

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
before they come out.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I ignore all that.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Because back in season two, I followed Rick and Morty on Facebook and shit.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And in season two, I was watching all the trailers beforehand and shit.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And all it did was make it so I wouldn't laugh at that joke when it happened in the episode.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Exactly.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know?

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because I've heard it too recently or out of context.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And so it happened in the episode and I'd be like, oh, this is the part I saw in the

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
trailer, so I don't laugh at it.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The worst example of that was in season two and Morty turned into a car.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, yeah.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They had already spoiled that.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And had I not known that, that shit would have blown my mind to fuck.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But I knew already.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So it wasn't that- there was no impact.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I tried to ignore all that, but people bring it up in our comments anyways.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And people were asking me like, oh, are you worried?

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They're bringing back Jerry next week.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But it was Jerry and Rick.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And that, as soon as I heard that, I was excited.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Because what I'm sick of with Jerry is him and Beth.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, yeah.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That dynamic is played out.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Jerry and Rick, you can do anything with.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know?

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I thought, oh, no, that sounds awesome.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, I'd love to see Jerry and Rick.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's a great combo.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And it was.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And so it was.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was a good combo.

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It was great.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You know, just like bouncing.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Rick is just the guy with no filter who will just tell you what's up.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And, you know, we just really dive to the heart of Jerry's character here.

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And, you know, there's that scene later on where he just, like, spells out exactly what kind

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
of a guy Jerry is.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And it was fucking devastating and fantastic.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And that's the kind of shit I love.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That scene was great because it put words to, like, what our problem with Jerry is.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's everyone's problem with Jerry.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Everyone knows Jerry is shit.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But, like, sometimes, like I've seen in our comments, people being like, why are you

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
guys so harsh on Jerry?

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What the fuck?

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You know?

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And we're like, well, that's the thing.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Like, Rick kind of spells it out right here that, yeah.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like, Jerry himself is not a great guy.

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And not just because he's an idiot, because he just manipulates people to get what he

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
wants.

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He's constantly in this, oh, everyone beats up on me.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm the victim.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm the victim.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Even though he's the one who, like Rick said, it's his fault.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Beth's unhappy at this point.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I mean, it's both of their fault equally.

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But, like, he wasn't a good husband for her.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So it's not like because she's breaking up with him, he's the victim here.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's like, no, you were both bad for each other.

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's exactly right.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And you know what's fascinating about this to me?

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It really reminds me sort of a dynamic of the worst kind of, like, YouTube commenter

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
versus, like, a YouTube creator, just as an example in my life.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Like, Rick is a guy who goes out and creates things.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know, he doesn't need society to give him anything.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He creates value in his life and in those around him.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Jerry, on the other hand, is a parasite.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's a little scum-sucking shit who can't do anything for himself.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He's like a YouTube commenter.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's like a whiny, entitled YouTube commenter who just, you know, wants stuff,

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
give to him for free, and when he doesn't get exactly what he wants,

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
he'll bitch and cry and complain and pretend that he's been bullied in some way.

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Not that I really have any experience with this, but just in my experience on YouTube,

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
like, you see that shit around.

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Like, Jerry is the worst parts of humanity.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like, the people that I want to all die.

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And I only respect the people like Rick who just, they do things.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They create, they add value to the world so that the people like Jerry can live better lives.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But they don't deserve better lives.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They just happen to be there in the warm glow of the genius and the power

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
that is the Rick Sanchez's of the world.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I mean, someone like Jerry, he really preys on our humanity.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, yeah.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Like, this is where...

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's a moral parasite. He's a moral parasite.

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Sometimes when we look at Rick, like, there's clearly elements of Rick that are monstrous

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and are not advised, that are not good for him or for anybody.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You know, like, this level of, like, detachment from emotion is not a good idea.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
However, there are also elements of Rick that are there to protect us,

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that we should incorporate into our lives.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Like, being able to, like, see through this kind of manipulation of someone like Jerry.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because the average person, like, yeah, was gonna feel sorry for him.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And, like, that's how he'll fuck you.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You know?

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's how he'll...

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I really love how he brings up specifically like Jerry.

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Like, it's not like there are no victims.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You are the predator.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Beth was your prey.

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You used your pathetic little, you know, whiny existence as a way to entrap Beth

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to, like, suck the life out of her.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Who, you know, is a far more capable person than Jerry.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's the parasite.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He is the bad guy here who just used this kind of emotional manipulation in his life

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and does constantly that we see every fucking episode that he's in

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
to just, you know, be a baby, prey upon people's, like, desire to...

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You know, like, even in this episode, like, he just fucking is so pathetic

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
that nobody feels like killing him.

181
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They're just like, this is not worth my time.

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not worth my time.

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And that's what he does with Beth.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And, you know, it's great to just see it spelled out so black and white.

185
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And you know what?

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Just to get a little more...

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Actually, you know what?

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't want to say that.

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Never mind.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Never mind.

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, to go further into the episode, there's an opportunity here

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
because I've been complaining about how I wanted Jerry to just be out of the show.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But I do think there's ways to use him.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like, the reason I wanted him out, I wanted him out exactly this way

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
where he's just not in the house having the same bee plots he's had before.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We just don't want the same story again and again.

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And this isn't the same story.

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is new ground.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But there's a huge opportunity at the end of this episode

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
where Jerry seems to kind of learn from what Rick accused him of

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and the fucking other dude.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You know, like Jerry gets his shit rocked emotionally

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and he actually seems to reflect on it a little.

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And it seems like throughout the season, Jerry has kind of been like

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
taking in the criticisms people have had of him.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You know, like as it's gone on, he's kind of reflected.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I'm wondering, what if Jerry actually, actually develops as a character?

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know dude, it reminds me of when I was a young lad

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and not doing a lot with my life before I had my shit together.

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like my parents would just bring up occasionally how they needed to throw me out.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not that they would, but like they're just like,

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Nate, you're living here, you're just being a bum.

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What are you fucking doing with your life?

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And that was entirely fair.

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And like throwing me out would have been a fine and reasonable thing to do.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And that's kind of exactly what happened to Jerry.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know, you got to fucking nut up in a situation like that

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and face your shit and recognize that like he's just being placated

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
by continuing to live with Beth and like continuing to receive,

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to continue to suck on the teat of sweet life

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that comes from these better people in his life.

222
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I actually know a guy, now that I'm like thinking about it

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and hearing it like through this episode I'm realizing

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I know a guy who's just like Jerry, who has a victim complex.

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He's constantly blaming the circumstances surrounding him

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and other people being an asshole.

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But he himself is a vindictus shit who like the second,

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the second he has the power and situation he takes advantage of it.

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Just like Jerry does this episode where when Rick's retarded

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Jerry's just beating up on him ruthlessly

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
even though he would never, you know, at all other times

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
he's crying victim because of Rick's actions.

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I knew a guy exactly like that

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and he got kicked out of my group of friends for being that way.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He pissed off everyone I knew so many times

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that we eventually just had to say you can't come here anymore.

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like just like Jerry.

238
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So it's kind of the inevitability with someone like this

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
because they are so sure that everyone else is the asshole

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
that they will never process the fact that they are the real asshole.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's exactly right.

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And the best you can hope for in a situation like that

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think is that like you kick this person out

244
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
they finally have to face the real consequences of their lifestyle

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and their attitude and actions

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and like hopefully they'll become a better person

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and then like get a decent group of friends elsewhere

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
or like maybe get a family that like they've actually

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
formed a real bond of respect with.

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And you know what, maybe years later

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
they'll be, once they become a good person

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
they'll be able to come back and be like, hey man, you know,

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
hey ain't seeing a while, you know, I'm not a pathetic piece of shit anymore

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I really became a good person, yeah I'm doing my own thing now

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
don't need to, you know, drag everybody else around down with me

256
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I've got this other thing that I've developed in my own life

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you know, my own situation, my own friends, my own circle

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
that I built up with actual positive character traits

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and then you can have that kind of relationship later on, you know

260
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
but I love, I love it

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
when people have to face their shit

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that's fucked up about themselves personally

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and get over it and yeah, it's what this episode was

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and it was fucking great.

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I love that the scene of Rick hammering Jerry with all of that

266
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
is immediately followed by a scene

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
of Jerry being repeatedly slapped in the face

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
by the testicles of a monster that he's riding in the sack of.

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, that was fucking great.

270
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's what I love about Rick and Morty

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
that's the kind, that's the Rick and Morty I want

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I can deal with all the clever, the clever bickering or whatever

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
you know, like the last episode I was complaining

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that too much of it was like the snarky back and forth

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
the Rick and Morty stuff that makes me bust out laughing

276
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
is when they hit you with some, some deep real shit

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and then follow it up with a amazingly timed dick joke, you know

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The show really needs to keep that going

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
if it doesn't, like yeah, it starts to feel like

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
like a Marvel movie I guess

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
which I don't want, which I do not want

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
this, yeah, I want to keep that raw shit

283
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
keep it flowing guys

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah, it was fucking good, not to mention the fact that

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
during that scene where Jerry's just being

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
emotionally devastated by Rick

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and he's crying, he's just like literally being

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
eaten and devoured by a monster and is fucking dying

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's great, you know, you gotta die

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and you gotta deal with your shit to become a real boy, Jerry

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, it was good, hey, but you know

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
there was a bunch of other cool stuff in this episode

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How about that immortality field?

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That was pretty fucking dope.

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, cool idea

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There's a, there's a manga that is kind of all about this

297
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
like exploring this idea

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's a manga called Immortal Hounds

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
which takes place in a world where

300
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
there's like a society where no one can die

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and like people who can die can, because of like a disease

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So like the police are just hunting those people down with impunity

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
because like they don't want to spread the disease

304
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
of being able to die

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So if you can die and they can just shoot anybody

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
it doesn't matter, because if you're immortal

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you'll come back to life

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and if you die, oh well that guy had the disease

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
so fuck him, you know

310
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So it's just like constant violence

311
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and people shooting each other

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and the thing is that in Immortal Hounds

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
it's not that you heal instantly like you do in this

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it's that when you die you heal

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So if you say lose your arms

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
then you'll just be without arms

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
until you bleed out and die and then you come back

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So it does a lot of interesting things with that

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This is a less interesting usage of the concept than that

320
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but that's also in that case

321
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
it's the entire series about that

322
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah right, the fact that you can insert that into one episode

323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
as like a set piece is great

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and it's really cool and yeah

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
it's used to what little, you know

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
like the effect that they could cram into this episode

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think my favorite part of the whole episode

328
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
that wasn't directly related to Jerry's whole shit

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
was just at the end after like, you know

330
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the shit goes down and the immortality field goes away

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and the little kid who had been murdering his sister for fun

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
over and over shoots her again and he's just like

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Liz? She's fucking dead

334
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and the thing about that scene

335
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
that scene is close to

336
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
this show, I've said this before

337
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
this show is always writing on this line

338
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
between like just glib violence

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
that I would find disgusting

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and violence that's fun and breezy

341
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and this is like right on the line but I think it's fun and breezy

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
whereas in the last episode the one guy getting horribly fucking

343
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
murdered for no reason was just kind of gross

344
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and it was like why? Why did we need this?

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Like what did he do that was so obnoxious

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that he deserved to die so

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
bizarrely? In this episode

348
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
it's just some minor little background character

349
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but the fact that earlier in the episode

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Jerry had said that's just bad parenting

351
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
either way

352
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
that makes it hilarious that it happens

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's exactly right and beyond hilarious

354
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
it's actually kind of making a point

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that I actually like a lot

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
it's like yeah don't live in a fucking fan still world

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
like Jerry's just like this is

358
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the fact that Jerry immediately recognized

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that this is like stupid and irresponsible

360
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and was 100% right

361
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
yeah it's good you know he's got a little bit of wisdom in him

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
he's not a total fucking idiot

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
it's good that was really good

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
yeah it was a good moment

365
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Kill more children Rick and Morty

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
we gotta yeah and it's

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
you know they managed to make

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
horribly murdering a child funny

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
yeah

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
um

371
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
what

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm trying to think of

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm trying to think of anything other than

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
the crazy trippy scene to talk about

375
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
but we have to address it because it's just

376
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
this episode they go through

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
a wormhole and just there's

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
this total mind fuck scene where they get

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
like mind melded for an epoch

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
or something but it's a fleeting

381
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
high so it's like waking up

382
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
because I know this feel

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
of like I've had those dreams

384
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that last like days

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and it's like you've lived this other life

386
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and then you wake up and for like

387
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
five minutes

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you feel like this incredible

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
dysphoria between like your mind

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and body having like having to remember

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
who you actually are

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and like where you really are

393
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
but then it just goes away and you forget about the dream

394
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and it doesn't matter anymore and like

395
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
that was this moment of

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I have um

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
something I've always been really interested in

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
is like these kinds of time accelerations

399
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
like people who've experienced

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
an incredible amount of time would have such

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
a different perspective on

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
everything you know so like

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
in that moment after it

404
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
happened they have such this incredible

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
understanding of one another

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
that could have been I mean

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that was a whole epoch of experience

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
of them being a completely different person

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
but they forget about it so quickly

410
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
that it already doesn't matter

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you know they lived

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
an infinite number of other seasons

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
of Rick and Morty that we'll never see

414
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
that's an excellent way to put it

415
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
in which Rick and Jerry

416
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
have a great relationship

417
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
doing weird trippy shit

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
like fucking and also turning into

419
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
animals and killing each other

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and evolving and shit

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and then at the end he's like

422
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
already he just doesn't give a fuck

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
after like one second that's fucking hilarious

424
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
that's great

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that's the great juxtaposition there

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
of this shit happening and them just not giving a fuck

427
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
like that's like the good kind of nihilistic

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
stuff this does

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
it's like a fucking funny joke

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
that makes me laugh and go ha ha

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
that's good that's the good shit

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
while also being

433
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
while also not only being

434
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
a like high level concept

435
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
but also one that you can understand

436
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
in one sentence

437
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
like Rick explains he just says

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
whatever it's called

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
is a more fleeting high

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
salvia you know like

441
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
immediately we get why they're coming

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
down like what just happened

443
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and why it's not affecting them anymore

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
is all set in a couple lines

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
while you're imagining this much bigger

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
concept that they've actually explored

447
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
that's classic that's what I love about Rick and Morty

448
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that's like my favorite thing about the show

449
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
is that

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
then also one of my favorite scenes

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
is so we've got a B-plot in this episode

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
about Summer accidentally turning herself

454
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
giant

455
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
it's definitely the less interesting

456
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
part of the episode but I'm okay with that

457
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm okay with B-plots in general

458
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think it makes sense when you're trying to

459
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
split up a story

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and have more than one thing going on

461
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and we get this fucking hilarious moment

462
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
when Beth turns herself giant

463
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and it's talking to Summer

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and you can't understand what either of them

465
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
are saying like they're having this big

466
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
emotional moment but it's just

467
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
like

468
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
that was fucking hilarious

469
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
by the way do you think this was an attack

470
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
on Titan reference

471
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it just kind of looked like it

472
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I know it's kind of recent

473
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I didn't even think about it

474
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
could be for all I know

475
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
what do you think of Morty vindictively

476
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
fucking over

477
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the guy who

478
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
for hurting his sister's feelings

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I enjoyed

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
seeing Morty in that role

481
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
of like the like it makes sense

482
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
that like this guy is seeing the shit now

483
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
like he's in a place where he can easily

484
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
do this kind of stuff when he wants to

485
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
just like threaten people and

486
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
do you think Morty will eventually become

487
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Rick

488
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
that's kind of what seems to be implied

489
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
sort of

490
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
in season two we were constantly given

491
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
in fact ever since season one there's been this idea

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that he is the good Morty

493
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
he's the smarter Morty than

494
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the other Mortys

495
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
in season two he always has

496
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
these moments where like he tries to be

497
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
like more Rick like but he's

498
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
still so stupid that he gets himself

499
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
fucked over anyways but now in season

500
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
three sometimes

501
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Morty doesn't fuck up

502
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
this episode Morty had all the power

503
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Morty tricked Rick

504
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
into going on this adventure

505
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
so he could get rid of Rick

506
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
like Rick the concept

507
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
of this episode is Rick thinks he's

508
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
taking he thinks Morty is so worried

509
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
about Jerry so he takes

510
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Jerry on a fake adventure to placate

511
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Morty but Morty is actually

512
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
just wanted to break from

513
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
hanging out with Rick and so tricked

514
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
him into taking his dad

515
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
instead yeah Morty doesn't give a fuck

516
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
about Jerry he doesn't give a fuck

517
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
about Rick he just wanted Rick out of

518
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
his hair and then he's mad

519
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and you know and he's

520
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
smarter than his mom in the situation they get into

521
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
you know he's the voice of reason there

522
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and I'm just like Morty was completely on

523
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
top of his game this episode what the fuck

524
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
you know he's really getting his shit together

525
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
yeah there's no doubt about it

526
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
yeah it's an interesting idea

527
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I've never been sure if I wanted

528
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
that but now if it's

529
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
like this I kind of do

530
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
well you know I was thinking so we've seen

531
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
all these multi-verse versions of Morty

532
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
but have we ever seen like older Morty

533
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
like what he'll be like as an adult no

534
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't think we've ever explored that

535
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
we've never really got into like

536
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
future or past of the

537
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
lines of the characters which is probably smart

538
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
in terms of wanting to be able to keep writing

539
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
the story without fucking up too bad

540
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
like all the different ricks

541
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
the different dimensional ricks are always

542
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
an old man you know yeah by the way

543
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
quick aside so in this episode

544
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
we learned that Rick's got

545
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
a ton of cybernetic enhancements

546
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
all over his body and that's really

547
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
cool and I like that

548
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
it's interesting but

549
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
it's kind of weird that that hasn't

550
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
ever come up before and it strikes me

551
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
as like okay he's been

552
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in a lot of situations where it'd be really

553
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
useful to have used those and he just never

554
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
did so it's it feels to me like

555
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
someone just wrote that in this episode like

556
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
they thought it would be cool well when we finally

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
see him use one he like

558
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
opens up this massive gun

559
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to shoot a suction cup at

560
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
somebody so I think maybe they're all just

561
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
weird stupid prank

562
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
well he does that but then he also

563
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
blasts the guys head off like with the same gun

564
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but yeah it also had like the suction cup thing

565
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
um yeah

566
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't care at all it was cool but

567
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
yeah it doesn't matter

568
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
my favorite joke

569
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
in this episode is

570
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Placated Rick

571
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
like the fact that

572
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the idea that

573
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
in order to prevent

574
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
international terrorism when you get on a plane

575
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
they just inject you with something that makes you

576
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
a fucking retard

577
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
with no controversial opinions

578
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
or intelligence

579
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and that and that they did this

580
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
to Rick like he was not prepared for it

581
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and now he's just completely helpless

582
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and he's talking like a baby

583
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and it's fucking hilarious like Jerry beating

584
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
up on him while he was retarded was the funniest

585
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
shit in the world to me yeah that was

586
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
good that was good shit

587
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
um well

588
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
fuck anything else I mean we

589
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
oh you know what one other aspect of this episode

590
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
is like

591
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Beth's just like need to like

592
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
be in charge of shit like she's doing this

593
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
weird you know what she's doing her weird like

594
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
hoover like lull epic joke guys

595
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
um but then like this is a bizarre one

596
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
yeah I thought it was

597
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
kind of cool but then like so there's the whole thing

598
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that she's kind of like vying with Morty about

599
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
how like she needs to like be able to solve

600
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
these issues without her dad

601
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and it seems like it all really just stems from

602
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
the need to like like Morty sums it up later

603
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
on the episode like yeah like just stop

604
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
stop sucking up to your dad like stop trying to

605
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
just like make his life great and be super

606
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
you know

607
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and whatever like conciliatory to whatever

608
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
he fucking needs

609
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I feel like uh what's great about this

610
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
situation with Beth is that now with Jerry

611
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
out of the picture we're getting to look at

612
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the fact that Jerry wasn't all her

613
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
problems yeah you know like

614
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
up until this point it's been

615
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
like all of the bad things like

616
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
all of her emotional issues have been blamed on Jerry

617
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and now that we see that with him out of the picture

618
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
she doesn't just immediately thrive

619
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
yeah she's not suddenly like a badass

620
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
who gets to do anything she's just

621
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
horribly emotionally damaged

622
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
weirdo who

623
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
you know like instead of going

624
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and doing something scientific with her time

625
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
is like building a hoof statue

626
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
it's like what she's

627
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
she's broken you know which is interesting

628
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
uh uh because you know

629
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Rick brings up you know when he when having the big

630
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
fight with him and Jerry uh how

631
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
how Jerry ruined this

632
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
his daughter you know like this is Rick

633
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Sanchez's daughter she could have done fucking

634
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
anything and instead like he knocked her up

635
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
this fucking piece of shit

636
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
worm loser whose only skill

637
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
in life is making people pity him

638
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
which I'm sure is just the worst thing

639
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Rick could like possibly have to deal with

640
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
um oh god

641
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the fact I'm just thinking of like if my

642
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
daughter married a guy like Jerry

643
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
like Jesus Christ that would be

644
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
the fucking where I would want to murder him

645
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I would want to murder that man it would be

646
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
a nightmare but it's also partly Rick's fault

647
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
because he wasn't around that's very true

648
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
that's a very good point like

649
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that's the one who created the emotional vulnerability

650
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that probably left her open to just like

651
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
fucking around with this kid and she was

652
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
a little baby yeah so uh

653
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that sucks though you know I do wonder

654
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
did she you know the

655
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the fact that you brought up before like the fact that Jerry

656
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
disappears and it doesn't immediately solve all our

657
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
problems did she does she really have

658
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
like that much going on for herself

659
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
like I know she's Rick's daughter but it's

660
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
not like she's some kind of super genius

661
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
in her own right you know

662
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
maybe that's Rick she's been a little yeah

663
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
that's him being a dad you know just being a straight

664
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
up dad there

665
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't know something to think about I'm

666
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
going to be keeping that in mind and like see if

667
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
she shows burgeoning potential of

668
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't know magic science powers

669
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
or something I guess I don't know

670
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
yeah

671
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
well that's uh that's all I've got to

672
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
say about this episode really strong

673
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
you know not not as like

674
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
it's not one of those like brick

675
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
shitting incredible episodes that like

676
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
is just so perfectly crafted

677
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
like episode one yeah

678
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
or something or or one that's

679
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
like super unique like pickle Rick like

680
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
this is very this is like standard

681
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Rick and Morty in a good way

682
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
the last episode was like if you took

683
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
just like the

684
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
like the bog standard of the show

685
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
but like below like without actually

686
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
having anything that stands out

687
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
this is an episode that's like as good as what

688
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
should be the average for this

689
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
show I completely agree that's a good way

690
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
of putting it I should be like this should be

691
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
the minimum and above and beyond

692
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
should be the maximum I

693
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
very much agree I'd give it like a strong

694
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
eight or something like that

695
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
yeah agree all right

696
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
well that's it everybody thanks for listening
