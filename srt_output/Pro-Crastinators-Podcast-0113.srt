1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
But something happened on the way to the 20th century.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,500
The profound, the inspiring, and the beautiful

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,900
were replaced by the new, the different, and the ugly.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,400
Today, the silly, the pointless, and the purely offensive

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,500
are held up as the best of modern art.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,900
It is they who champion graffiti and call it genius,

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,400
promote the scatological and call it meaningful.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,800
It is they who, in reality, are the naked emperors of art,

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,000
for who else would spend ten million dollars on a rock

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,400
than think it is art?

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,100
Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,400
I am the best guy ever.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,200
Uh, I am French.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,400
Uh, today we're joined by, uh, Lethal Aurora Mage.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm pushed again, but this time I'm the best.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,700
First to the worst.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,200
No, that's-

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Oh wait, I said that last time.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,700
Yes.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,300
Oh, well, okay, debunked.

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,400
Uh, The Davoo is here.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This podcast emanates rich textures of aura, of satisfaction of the authority.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ah.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,400
All right, my name is Chris.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,000
Tom Oliver.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Criticism.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,700
Tom.

29
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,500
Oliver.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,600
I just got flashbacks to my art history courses,

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,300
and I wanted to vomit all over my excessive microphone.

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,500
Disgusting.

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:18,900
Disgusting.

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,000
You would have made art.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,900
Yeah, clearly.

36
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,700
Oh, it would look like a- like a Pollock.

37
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,600
Uh, Ben Sates.

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm I'm back with a vengeance

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,260
Indeed I missed one episode and I wanted and it ruined my whole life

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
My streak is broken

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,160
And muchy topics by committee rhymes with shitty

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,340
As you as you might be able to tell let's get right down to it our topic for today is

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Monsters to everybody

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,560
It's the big one. It's the big one that no that was a joke that was art in itself postmodern art

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,120
It was meant to highlight how ignorant and stupid you the masses are for loving that so much

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,520
It's it's postmodernism modern art, but mostly postmodern art. That's what it is and to get down to the heart of the matter

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,680
What do you got for us?

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,820
Urban dictionary before we read from the Urban Dictionary. I'd like to read from Urban Dictionary occult edition

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,880
At at forum dot become a living God calm

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,660
Slash Urban Dictionary dash occult dash edition slash three four oh nine six

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,780
However, I cannot because there are only two entries one is for Yahweh and the other is for God

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,520
Okay, sure. Let's see what we got as our backup here. Okay Urban Dictionary

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,660
Postmodernism a term that you keep on hearing about in college and have to look up on Wikipedia

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,360
Basically says fuck it to the search for any intellectual conclusions. Oh my god. Yeah, more complete definition than I thought

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,560
I that's actually not terrible. That makes that's so that's the worst thing. I've ever had read to me. Well, all right

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,200
That was okay. That was definition to here's the top definition

57
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,720
Postmodernism is the ultimate lubricant

58
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,320
Invented by social sciences in order to fuck every concept and structure that humans ever came up with at the same time

59
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,200
It is used as a means for social sciences to penetrate one another

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,320
What dislike modern or what kind of person you have to be you have to be some sort of conservative God or or uncocked

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,380
Well, we I think it extends beyond just hard. It's like a whole

62
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:52,020
Mindset and philosophy that article that article sounds like it was written by maybe like an ex-professor

63
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,540
But who had like a drug problem or something and completely fried

64
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,700
But he's like he's like completely he's like completely burned out after he lost his tenure and he's like a shell of his former self

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,620
And he can barely string a sense together. He's definitely never lifted a pencil in their life

66
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,180
Definitely watched a lot of Jordan Peterson. That's that sounds like the guy that I think I think you're right

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,020
Listen, okay, but it behooves us because postmodernism and postmodern art exists as a response to modern arts saying like fuck that shit

68
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,300
Dude doesn't even it's not even real. So let me just read the definition of modern art as well

69
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,860
All right, Urban dictionary modern art a synonym

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
for bullshit

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,660
All right, it's actually nothing useful for modern art and urban dictionaries

72
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,540
Let me actually just read like the first sentence on the Wikipedia page. That's actually much much more helpful

73
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,500
So modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extended from blah blah blah the six that 1860s the 70s

74
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,100
1970s and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced from that era

75
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,260
The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in the spirit of

76
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,340
experimentation and it shows like some van Gogh starry night type stuff, which is very right

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:13,500
So part of what I intended to talk about is those scribble paintings like we were referencing Jackson Pollock if you

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,980
Don't know what we're talking about Google image search that and also. Oh, what's his name?

79
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,300
Yeah, oh, yeah, also the painter guy who paints just like painterly squares of various colors

80
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,900
Who's name always escapes me just search like wasn't in the velvet underground. What's his name?

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,020
Not that are you talking about Andy Warhol?

82
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,140
No, no, are you talking about that painting that's like it's like white and it has a bunch of black lines forming squares

83
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,260
And some of the squares are like red and summer. That's what that's what I did on my best appearance in the drawcast

84
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Yeah, I drew modern art. Yeah, yeah, yeah

85
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,260
That guy so that's kind of the heart of what we're gonna talk about and the reaction to it

86
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,980
Now I'm just gonna like come right out with what I think is the crux of the problem

87
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,940
Which is the criticism and analysis of modern art remaining so

88
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,580
rigid traditionalist and

89
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,860
Classical see it's the reason why people often don't take it seriously when a professor comes up and tells you about how such

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,340
And such painting subverts the idea of

91
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,500
Art and subverts the idea of the establishment and authority

92
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,540
The reason why people don't take that seriously is it's coming from a professor a guy who went to college has tenure works in

93
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:32,140
The system and talks like the system and this is where modern art breaks down for me is when that because like I

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,900
Was like in a waiting room recently that had a bunch of modern art books

95
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,620
And I would always pick them up and think the images look cool

96
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,700
And then I want to read some analysis of it

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:47,020
So I go over to the paragraphs and I started reading and this is where my eyes start rolling like a fucking tumble dryer

98
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,420
Because it's trying to describe

99
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,340
Like post-modern art it's trying to describe subversiveness. It's trying to describe

100
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,700
Like like this escape from the traditionalist structures by very traditionally

101
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,980
Explaining it in a very literary way and it doesn't work when you try to employ this sort of

102
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,300
Tangible literary analysis to non tangible inspired art you end up with a bunch of vague sentences

103
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,660
Like what triggered Tom at the beginning of me introducing myself where they try to be like

104
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,380
Oh, it has this texture that implies this feeling of this idea, right?

105
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,100
Like we're it's like you're trying to analyze modern art the same way we analyze classical art where a lot of paintings were of like

106
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,500
Actual things and and paintings were inspired by Bible or other ideologies very explicitly

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,740
So so you could actually describe what the paintings actually are very like factually and

108
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,620
Then we get all these paintings that aren't supposed to mean anything technically and yet the analysts and the critics think they're still supposed to

109
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,260
Describe them in these tangible words and it just becomes really stupid and misses the point and makes the average consumer

110
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,460
Miss the point of the whole goddamn movement. I

111
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Got one response to all that

112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,340
Davoo is where are the fucking memes? Where are they where there wasn't well any means in there

113
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,260
I was looking for some means. I was browsing the the become a living god.com forums as I often do

114
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
So

115
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,100
So I'm searching for modern art and I can't find any topics about modern art

116
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:27,100
So I brought in my search to just art and unfortunately poor results the best thing I could find is this top is this

117
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,540
Thread on the topic of is it possible to learn martial arts from a demon?

118
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,620
The journey the jury

119
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,020
The jury's out on it. So I'm afraid that the become a living god.com has failed for the first time in history

120
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,380
Well, that sucks wait wait actually I have something to say that's relevant also

121
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,860
There is a great good. There is a great video. It is by the art assignment

122
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
You guys have ever seen the art assignment

123
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,100
Yeah, no, I have not okay. It's a YouTube series. It's like I think it I think it might be John Green's wife

124
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,180
Or something or someone that John Green knows I think it might be by PBS digital studios

125
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,940
Yeah, but it's it's the video called I could do that. Yeah. Yeah, I could do that. That's the right, okay

126
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,700
That's right. Okay. I haven't I haven't I haven't watched don't co-op my topic

127
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
I haven't watched it for a while

128
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,100
But it's about she's talking about how people say that like, you know

129
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,260
You look at a Jackson Pollock or a fucking drawing of squares or a toilet in a museum and you're like

130
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
I could do that anyone could do that and

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,140
You know the answer is like well sure you could but you didn't like and like it doesn't matter

132
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,020
Like whether you could replicate it. I said this just the other day and like a completely different kind

133
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,940
We were talking about business and entrepreneurs and I guess it's the same for art

134
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,420
It doesn't fucking matter if you could replicate the exact product that someone has made

135
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,260
Which you probably couldn't if you think so but even if you could it doesn't matter

136
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Because the point is that you didn't and the point of this art was that it was made in this context and the context

137
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,660
Is what makes art meaningful even if you did it perfectly and you did in fact just recreate it

138
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,860
Well, then that's good. How does that make the art not good?

139
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,980
The artist does not claim that he is a god for making this piece of art

140
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,220
He wants to communicate an idea or yeah, right and you would just like something similar like like take for example like

141
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,620
Photography like photography is generally considered an art, right?

142
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,220
and at least you know, I guess it depends but like I

143
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:33,300
Mean for example, like I just watched Digi's new video on Fooley Cooley a little while ago and that was fine

144
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,740
But like there like there's a moment in there where Mamimi of course is this photographer and just at the at the last episode

145
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,940
There's a there's a moment where like now to in like all these crazy events that have happened now

146
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,340
It's does his iconic standing on the rubble holding Haruko's base. Oh, great takes the picture from behind great. He does it again

147
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,860
He does what no, no, this isn't the new Fooley Cooley. This is the he's talking about the original okay

148
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,300
I haven't seen the new. Yeah. No, he just does. I was saying that I just did it again

149
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,780
No, no, this is about the original even though the new ones are out which I should we should watch those at some point

150
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Oh, yeah, but anyway, I mean just I guess I guess I guess I guess I have no choice. Yeah. Why not? Why not?

151
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Yeah, okay

152
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,060
The point I was getting at was like, okay

153
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:20,100
So so Mamimi takes that picture and like no Mamimi did not like craft the entire situation to like

154
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,180
Generate all the artistry that's in that picture of like this ruined city of like a boy standing

155
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,940
Hopefully on this hill looking at his lost love and holding her base and what not remembering her

156
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,500
But like she did capture that moment in her art. Okay. Yeah. Yeah

157
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,980
The like the important thing there is that is that it was the image is curated, right?

158
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,780
Like the image is like what to what to include in the like Mamimi probably took like a thousand pictures

159
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:52,060
And she chose to show this one. Yeah, cuz it's the best most like that people when people talk about writing like writing is the same

160
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,060
Like like the act of writing

161
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,620
I think I think this might be a mr. B tongue quote

162
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,780
But he's not the only one who said it's like it's like the act of writing is the act of like creative exclusion

163
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,740
Yeah, selective exclusion to separate signal from noise

164
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,540
You have yeah separate signal from noise because you have a character and you have you know in your mind

165
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,780
If you know if you're most if most authors probably have like if not a full idea

166
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,060
But at least some idea of this character is like entire life story, right?

167
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,460
And this character has theoretically lived an entire life full of shit that could be remarked upon

168
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,100
But you as the author you are like selecting like where do I begin the story there by cutting off everything beforehand?

169
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,540
You know, what do I show or what do I describe? What do I choose not to describe?

170
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,740
And that's what you build your story out of and like photography is the same

171
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,220
You're you're you might yeah, you might not have created it

172
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,340
But you are still doing this the selective exclusion of like I won't take pictures of these things

173
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,740
I will take pictures of this because like my aesthetic sense tells me that this is a well-composed image and it and you know

174
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,700
It means what such-and-such part of it. I think

175
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,940
behind this mindset is

176
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,220
Like human jealousy in a way because when people say oh, I could have done that and you know

177
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,580
I would have been successful. I would have earned the money like I'm not saying like

178
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:14,500
People are bad for being jealous. It's natural people are just naturally jealous of things like they even did like a test

179
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I think with kids like

180
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,420
Hold on it's not very relevant. It's a long story

181
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Basically people prefer to

182
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,620
Rather than have someone else have more things to that both of them not have at all like, you know

183
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,900
Yeah, that's a thing. That's a thing. Yeah, so it's people are very sensitive to inequality, you know

184
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,180
Justified or not it makes them make some yeah, and like because this idea existed like oh

185
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:46,540
I had I possess the skill level that this person does but they're earning like they're banking off of it

186
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,260
The seal a lot more than I could ever, you know

187
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,740
I have I never thought about doing well and this it feels like

188
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,900
Like injustice in a way. Yeah, and you know, I think that's yeah, that's definitely a thing

189
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,380
It's like reputation is where the value in art comes from which is another video by the art assignment

190
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,980
They bring up that like yeah

191
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,580
Yeah, the the reputation of specific artists right is what actually drives the prices

192
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,260
But here's the thing that is also the case in other mediums such as live performance music

193
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,860
It costs like six hundred dollars for a ticket to the Rolling Stones or Paul McCartney or other such baby boomer era

194
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:30,340
Fucking bands that have been around for 40 years because their baby boomer fucking fan base is sitting on tens of thousands of savings

195
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,400
They need to spend in a couple of years before the diagnosis start rolling in

196
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
The dreaded diagnosis right

197
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,060
Like they're just able to pump themselves full of fucking money and just pump all that money out of their fans because everyone

198
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,900
I mean, I have to go see the Rolling Stones right you have to so and it's not like some other band where the tickets are say 60 bucks

199
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:58,100
Let's not like the Rolling Stones in anybody's opinion could have like core progression and lyrical depth that is 10 times greater

200
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
It has to do with reputation

201
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,940
Okay, okay, so yeah, it has to do with reputation and

202
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Alright, so I guess someone who doesn't agree with modern art or whatever as like a concept would probably not agree with this statement either

203
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,620
But to me this is like core and I think and I

204
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,220
To me this is obvious, but you know, whatever and that is that like skill like it's it's sad to say

205
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:26,620
But skill really doesn't matter like in terms of like what art is meaningful and like what people respond to yeah

206
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,020
I mean, it's not that it doesn't matter because you have you need skill

207
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:36,340
Sometimes you need skill to execute an idea but not always and if you execute something that means something to people and affects people

208
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,980
Then it doesn't matter how quote-unquote skilled you are to two artists can be equally quote-unquote skilled

209
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:48,020
And it makes no difference if one of them use that skill to make something that people responded to and the other one didn't the reason

210
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,020
Why skill matters is because skill can help better

211
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,180
You know a communicate to the audience what the idea is so it doesn't really matter

212
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,620
How good your skill is as long as you can communicate the same ideas or statement within your art

213
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,900
Yeah, and the skills will just help you do that

214
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:12,100
So if you want to say, you know, like communicate the idea well aren't humans beautiful isn't the human form beautiful

215
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,300
So much should be good to have a lot of skills specifically the male

216
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,840
Yes, I quickly want to say I just quickly it's like the state as the saying like

217
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,380
Don't work hard work smart. Yeah. Yeah, it also applies to art

218
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,500
My three case studies for what Ben was talking about about it's more about what you're expressing than your skill, right?

219
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
First of all, there's fucking

220
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,660
M. Night Shyamalan, right who happened to make his first movie played at his strengths, right?

221
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,060
It's a movie where it seemed like his limited filmography

222
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:50,500
Which one is that the sixth sense like that that's where it seemed like it seemed like it was a stylistic choice to make the camera

223
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,940
So fucking slow

224
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,420
Which it was but then come last airbender it turns out Shyamalan is just bad at shot composition and moving a camera, right?

225
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,260
Other good example is George Lucas who like happened to have this

226
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,380
He has a great creative core that just has to be

227
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,020
Roped in to but by producers. So once he was allowed to do whatever he want that didn't work, right?

228
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,100
So he has good ideas. He had something really great to express. He just isn't very skilled

229
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:23,100
So my counter example is zoom someone who cannot fucking draw but

230
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,780
Can aesthetic more than not familiar with zoom. He makes the Toho games, right? Yeah

231
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,100
Like lots of video games espouse the idea that sheer graphical horsepower is how you make a game look good

232
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,700
Where is in other games that are all about art design say no good art is good

233
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,940
And then Toho basically says good art isn't good aesthetic is good

234
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,260
So he's someone who plays to his strengths brilliantly like he let's

235
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,980
I don't fucking are you sure that it's more that people I mean

236
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Who would argue that it's like it's good that the art of zoom of being bad is like better

237
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:07,060
It's not good necessarily the point is that he he leverages what skills he does have to his favor to great effect

238
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,500
I don't need to do is communicate the idea those skill

239
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,300
Yeah, yeah those skills are not in the artwork itself

240
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
But like the art that he does make

241
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,100
Communicates these ideas that are built right through like the the gameplay and the dialogue and the music and whatever else has has for

242
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,980
Instance zoom is trying to communicate that

243
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,940
Or at least I assume I've not played me no to home games

244
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,460
But the art I've seen is cute girls are cute and he's not having a lot of you know artistic skill

245
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:41,060
But he can't communicate that with his limited skill now could he now couldn't ask so now could he do this better with even greater skill?

246
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,340
Of course he could make a really cute girl in actuality and you would be more convinced of that

247
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,620
But it doesn't mean that just because he does not have the skill

248
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:54,020
He is not communicated the idea that you girls are cute. I was gonna say isn't toho just like a lot of wifes

249
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,940
The whole point of toho is that if you've it has anyone played it

250
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,500
I have played I have played like one or two toho's

251
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,980
Okay, I've been playing toho. It's just that you go through like you play as like a rainbow or a Marissa

252
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,300
Whatever it is you play is just like a character with very little English damn it

253
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,500
Okay, whatever you're just like some girl with little personality

254
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,300
But you're like have a kind of cute design and you just encounter girls that say very little

255
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,900
But they say enough to get a hint towards their personality and my theory is this is given

256
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,020
I this is I know everyone believes I think it's that just like having so little presented about the characters

257
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,540
I mean just a couple hints about the personality and then you fight them in a cool boss fight

258
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:45,340
And they have a cute design that gave everyone such a blank check to fill in as much as they wanted for like

259
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,580
Oh, that this is why that character is Moe lol

260
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:55,740
She's such a one of my favorite youtubers back in the day Digibroni MLP compared the toho fandom to the fandom of the pony

261
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,780
MLP background characters at least circa seasons one two and three yeah four seasons five

262
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,940
But but but okay, okay, it's not enough. It's not enough to just give a blank check cuz like

263
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,420
Nothing like saying nothing would be giving a blank. Well, they give you enough. Yeah

264
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:17,340
So like there's definitely there's something here that makes people want to like fill the back well like here's a thing

265
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,620
Here's there's a character. There's a character whose name I forget. I'm gonna see if I can find it

266
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,100
It's it's one of the toho girls and the only thing I know about this toho girl

267
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,180
Is that she?

268
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:33,220
Canonically is is actually tiny like the size of a mouse she wears a sake cup as a big ol hat

269
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,740
And she fights with a needle that is some like legendary needle sword of like this diminutive race

270
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
Is she is she hollow night?

271
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,220
She I mean it sent she was hollow night before hollow night was cool. I forget her name someone please it's like haku-jaku

272
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,540
Her name is actually hold hold on

273
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,980
I'm fucking googly to see if I can find it. Oh, it is. Okay, Sukuna

274
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,700
Shin myo Mario Sukuna Shin yo Mario. That's her name and she is adorable

275
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,460
I'm like a fucking picture of her look at her so it's just and my point is just by her design being cute and these basic facts

276
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,860
About her being a cutie and being diminutive and from this weird. She's like a princess or something look at her

277
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,140
Like this was enough to make me like this is not my favorite toho character just because of these basic facts

278
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,220
She's she's cool. That's and I think that's what's happened. I think that's what happened like everybody

279
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,460
Why is she also the games are fun? Why is there a hammer? Why is there a hammer sized for a mouse? Ben?

280
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
Do you remember Secret of Mana?

281
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,460
Yeah, remember that item you could get the flammie drum the flammie drum, right? That's right

282
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,780
That's right. Yeah, or no, there's like a mini mallet or something that turns you big or small

283
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:46,300
Yeah, there's like a there's a Japanese folklore thing. It's like a hammer that resizes you and I think that's what that is

284
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
That is a fucking

285
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
funny thing

286
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,780
Folklore

287
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,860
Luigi games too, right with the hammer up to squish fucking it is definitely a thing that I have seen in other games

288
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,300
But I specifically I remember it from Secret of Mana, right? Okay. Well, so guys, this is okay

289
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,560
I think we've made our point that like art does not require

290
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Like the artist to be the most skilled person so to that end. Let's get back to like

291
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,820
I mean, wait, wait, wait case and point fucking

292
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,540
Tails gets trolled. Well, yeah, don't watch my fucking lecture idiots. Well, I just want to plug his legs

293
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,820
He's the he's the least he's the least talented. Well, that's not true, but you know, he's clearly laserbot. Please come on our show

294
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,780
He's not the least talented, but you know, he's like there are better artists out there

295
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,500
But yet the story that he makes is compelling as fuck and it doesn't matter

296
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,980
Is it if it were drawn better quote unquote better? Would it be a better comic? No, so there you go

297
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:48,380
Well, and in fact the low quality of it enhances the majority of it and the comedy and I mean you get to see him improve

298
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,500
Which is always interesting like I mean for me seeing an artist improve over the course of their long-form work is like

299
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,300
Oh, it's fucking me. Mm-hmm. Okay, so I have a question

300
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,740
I've been listening for the last 25 minutes and and I just my my question is I rage building

301
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,260
No, no, no

302
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,620
Because my problem is that like I just as much as I want to say that like modern art is gay

303
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,700
I just need it like that's just the end of the story. I just hate it. I just hate it

304
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,780
Because I and it I'm glad we have a contrarian. I'm glad we have someone with the opposite of modern art

305
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,980
Oh post-modern art, which are we talking about? I'm gonna say I'm not gonna be so obtuse as to blanket statement in a tire

306
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,180
Genre it's just like that kind of art the kind of art we're talking about I understand it gets trolled

307
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,780
I know not tails get trolled but like like in a gallery setting and stuff. I

308
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,980
Okay, I just I don't find it appealing to me personally and I you know as much as I'd like to make a more intellectual case

309
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,060
I really don't have one but my question is is that for the last 25 minutes

310
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:52,420
We have you've all come to the conclusion that you skill doesn't really matter at the end of the day

311
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,420
And it's just you know people like what they like or whatever

312
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,940
So how do we reconcile that fact with the fact that we shit on awful youtubers?

313
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,860
I got it. I know how Tom. I know how Tom because we distinguish between

314
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,460
Art that is itself valuable and meaningful and it does not matter how that art came into existence

315
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,700
Whereas when we're viewing the artist when we're talking about who the artist is it does matter how they achieve the thing

316
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
They're trying to make which is why even though the room for example is what?

317
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,940
Yeah, I was just thinking of all time

318
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,820
I would never say that I think that Tommy Wiseau is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time

319
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,380
I think that's the important distinction here the artist separate, okay, but the problem is when we're talking about

320
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,940
Modern and post-modern art the people and the culture they do say that yes

321
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,620
Jackson Pollock is one of the greatest artists of all time. Hi. Well, he has made a lot of those it is repeatable

322
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,300
What he's done? Well, here's okay

323
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,660
I'd like to like make it clear exactly where I'm coming from on this and this it comes from something

324
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,660
I believe it was a year and a half ago when uh

325
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,340
We in the PCP chat talked about that art assignment video called I can do that because we were watching it because we had just come off

326
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,420
the coals of watching this Paul Joseph Anderson video where he's just like

327
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,420
Look at all these stupid paintings. This one's just a square. This one is just a bunch of scribbles

328
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,820
It's so stupid these people shouldn't be so famous and we're kind of like rolling our eyes like yeah

329
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,740
Yeah, we get it we get it, but then the moment where it goes from and that's uh is when he goes

330
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
This is why we need

331
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,500
Objective standards and art to make sure people like this can be stopped and it's like oh hold on there, buddy

332
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,620
Paul Joseph Anderson, that's the video game guy, right?

333
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,620
Paul Joseph Watson Watson. Oh shit. I'm getting my Paul Joseph

334
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,420
I'm not sure you said what Watson at least that I don't know am I crazy am I crazy? Okay?

335
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:45,260
I don't know the audience will judge anyway. Yeah, the YouTube guy who has the big fucking chipmunk face that he puts in the middle

336
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,060
Of the camera all the time. I feel like he used the fish island or he has the world's most bulbous face that guy

337
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
That's what yeah, um he uh

338
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,620
Yeah, so like he made the case that we need objective standards to stop these people and that's where it's like, okay

339
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,700
This is no longer an opinion thing. This is now a fucking good like socio-political thing

340
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:09,700
We have to maintain objective standards of quality and talent in order to discern the value of anything and

341
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,020
Munchie you just got done watching the clap the modern classic

342
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:21,660
Why is modern art so bad video by Prager University, which I just did a 40 minute rebuttal video to on my main channel

343
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,020
But now I'm here in this podcast a shit on me even more like it's from this guy

344
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,300
Who's like probably a Christian very like an old funny that he conservative type guy and he's a painter

345
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,540
Probably Christian right and like I went to his I went to his website

346
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,580
All right, Munchie over here

347
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,780
I went to this guy's website to look at his art and you can tell that he's like into classic style art

348
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,220
But he's not that good at it it ends up looking more like sci-fi pulp novel covers

349
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,340
But you can tell he's a classicist and in this video he makes the case for classic art being better than modern art

350
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,460
Which is fine at all except he then shits on the idea of

351
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,060
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that like shit is subjective

352
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:02,620
And that we need to bring back objective standards in order to stop these people the great art historian

353
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,580
Jacob Rosenberg wrote that quality and art is not merely a matter of personal opinion

354
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,140
But to a high degree objectively traceable without aesthetic standards

355
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,500
We have no way to determine quality or inferiority as if it's somehow like a drag on you

356
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,700
That scribble paintings and square paintings are popular like like you don't need to

357
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,540
Right, you don't need to kick out art

358
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,020
You don't like to make room for yourself like make art that you think is good

359
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,500
And make it good enough to get your own fucking attention

360
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:42,780
I I I think what he's responding to is the the the culture that has come to embrace this thing that he finds to be, you know

361
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Unvaluable and well

362
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,940
I I literally do not understand what you're saying. So you're saying why do we think why why do we shit on bad youtubers

363
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,940
When we praise modern art, uh, I mean not so it's it's just that if you're saying that the skill doesn't matter

364
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,660
Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And the execution matters. I'll tell you why

365
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,460
Because it's not a matter of the skill being bad that makes youtubers bad

366
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,660
It's that the art they make is terrible

367
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:18,220
But we do not like the art that they produce and and that that statement that you're saying implies implicitly

368
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,180
That that modern art is bad that we do not like it and we're just saying

369
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,460
Oh, you don't need skill to in you and making bad art is okay

370
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,260
When we're saying that you don't need a skill to make art that we like and resonate with we like marinara or at least I do

371
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,020
I like my art so I can explain away why the skill doesn't matter and I can explain and make an intellectual point about it

372
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,540
I'm not saying that

373
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,700
modern art is bad and therefore

374
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,420
The skill does not matter because you can make bad art and it doesn't matter the point of the matter is

375
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,940
Simply I like modern art and I don't like youtuber. Uh, you know shitty youtube reviews

376
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,580
And that's fine. You don't have to like you don't have to like modern art or anything

377
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Okay, I think I want to say like I

378
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,500
Quite dislike modern art. I will say but I will but I you know

379
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,460
I I recognize why I dislike it

380
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,620
I recognize why I dislike it and I'm fine with people creating it. I you know

381
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,100
I'm free to dislike it and they're free to create it

382
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,540
There's no issue here between me and the people who create modern art

383
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,660
Well mage that is the you have cowardice in your convictions

384
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:28,380
You should demand that the world conform to your expectations. Therefore you're you you're either a coward or lying

385
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,460
Which is it mage? Which is it?

386
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,940
Anything less is a kid

387
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Okay

388
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,940
Nate

389
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,780
Yes, I'll just bring this up and I don't know if we'll have anything interesting to say about it, but whatever

390
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,260
Come on. It's me. Of course. I will do you know

391
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,300
Did you know you probably did know that we have a

392
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,900
Like a second cousin or a cousin once removed or whatever that is a like a

393
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:01,260
Supposedly a pretty successful like somewhat famous abstract painter. I believe is his name winston. His name is winston

394
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,460
That's right. Yep. I mean should we like link him or should we say like his website or something?

395
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,820
Is it winston saint or winston bestman? I'm gonna lean towards no

396
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,300
That's a good question. I mean towards no and then maybe we'll add in the description or something. Okay, whatever

397
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,500
It it doesn't matter. Uh, yeah in winston. It's winston the girl picture him

398
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:26,620
I went to i'm at his i'm at his website and i'm just looking at his art and I gotta say you know kind of like with jackson paul like

399
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
I don't really get it

400
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:36,860
Although okay, sometimes I find I'm looking at these and some of the aesthetics are good and I'll be like, oh, that's a nice like collection of colors

401
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,820
That's a nice thing for the most part. I'm like

402
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,780
I don't like it

403
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,220
Okay, but but maybe maybe the point maybe the point is just you know

404
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460
You you combine colors and whatever and like

405
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,820
You know like most of them will not appeal to most people

406
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:57,500
But some of them will appeal to some people and you sometimes sometimes you just get lucky and find your audience of someone

407
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,460
Who is like, oh that looks neat and then they buy it and I don't know

408
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:08,220
We're behind modern art as I understand it was a rejection of these styles and forms that had been used in classical art

409
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,260
Up to that point. Whereas that guy in that video that prager you video was talking about how like no like

410
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:19,980
Images used to like capture beauty and convey grandiose messages and use technical skill and these are the things we celebrate

411
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,180
But but like our boy our boy w here is like

412
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,100
The big w. Uh, he's he's like he's just attempting to like

413
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,020
Throw images out there and I guess like see what sticks and I'm sure you made like a lot of art

414
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,220
I think that's probably what painters do. I think that's probably what

415
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,500
I quickly want to say about the you know, the whole skill doesn't matter thing now

416
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,700
The thing is like skill definitely helps

417
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
In many ways and in many in many times

418
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,100
However, it's not like it's it's not mandatory because sometimes people who are very good at

419
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,500
Executing things can just catch lightning in a bottle. So to speak and

420
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,180
That's I was actually going to ask that is it possible. Is it possible that skill?

421
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:14,380
Holds you back from experimentation and that you're and that it that no human's ability could ever rival like the kind of

422
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
Electric

423
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,180
Stumble into if you're just if you're just trying random shit hold on no

424
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,980
So one of the things that keep in mind is that one of the things I've by the way just for fun

425
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,180
I posted the links to winston stuff in the chat and I checked out we will decide we will decide if we're gonna post

426
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,180
We will judge winston

427
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,180
This has obvious skill and intent in it. You think something good. Yeah. Yeah a lot of it

428
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,940
There is skill there not saying. Oh, yeah, this is really nice. I like these colors

429
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,540
I like how the colors are mixed some of them

430
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,940
I do like there are definitely ones here that are the first paint to get the very beginning has this like cool

431
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,700
Like fucking like circle in the middle. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one talk about potential images that won't be in the

432
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,060
video

433
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,940
No, let's what we'll show this first one because it's not now. Let's edit this in we'll edit this in yeah, so

434
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,380
So I had a comment

435
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,300
That was me stretching by the way not me being frustrated by ed people

436
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
So I had a comment say I grew up

437
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:16,060
Hating Rothko mark Rothko until I saw one of his paintings in a museum

438
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,700
Like eye to eye in person, right?

439
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,660
Mark Rothko is the guy who paints just like squares, right? And it's like what the what the I remember

440
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,220
Paul joseph watzkerson

441
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:32,700
Specifically calling out Rothko. He's just he just drew a red square. What the fuck right thing is when people like analyze mark

442
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,500
Rothko when you read up on him apparently what he does is he layers his painting his paint over and over

443
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,780
And over again

444
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:47,740
It gives it a sense of depth that cannot be captured in photography and then transmitted on to a digital screen

445
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,980
You have to see it in person and when you do

446
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:58,220
People say the images feel like they they become like three dimensional the images feel like they're floating in space because they're so

447
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,780
richly textured, right

448
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,220
there is something that he is doing there and

449
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,220
uh

450
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,780
Interesting thing about both Rothko and Pollock is when you research their histories

451
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:18,940
They both started off doing actual painting like that where their technical skill is obviously much more clear where they're drawing people or stuff

452
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,820
Like they both started out, you know pretty post-modernist

453
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,180
They weren't like classicists

454
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,540
But they both started drawing stuff that you obviously could not imitate right

455
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,100
They both started off with sketches and drawing things and then devolved their

456
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:39,180
complexity more and more and more as they continued to experiment and basically just got to the very heart of why they really wanted to paint

457
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:45,500
Right, they just went to down to the bread and butter of what they actually had been wanting to express and took 10 years

458
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,780
Of stylistic development in order to get there

459
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
And what did they want to express right?

460
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,620
Well, then when you try to explain that when you hear what other people explain

461
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,300
This goes back to my problem at the beginning where they try to explain it using these very tangible

462
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,220
almost objective terminology

463
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,580
Like, you know, it's supposed to express your the human condition of the feeling of the thought of the feeling of the whatever, right?

464
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,340
uh, I think

465
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,380
Yeah, um, and another thing is that it is definitely true like okay

466
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,180
I had someone I had another comment saying, you know, if someone told me they're an artist and then they showed me Pollock

467
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
I wouldn't take them seriously

468
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,580
Right like he doesn't take he doesn't regard Pollock as real art. He's like, yeah, you know

469
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,740
Most are you know, you have to actually consider what you're doing and have a point in a theme and skill and effort, right?

470
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,060
So what I said was okay go to ms paint pick whichever tools you like

471
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,340
Select four colors that you think are good

472
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,300
And then use whatever tools you want on ms paint to make a pattern with those colors

473
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,140
The pattern cannot be symmetrical. It has to be like it has to look chaotic

474
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:55,260
But the colors have to be evenly distributed. There can't be too much red on this corner

475
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,940
There can't be too little blue in the middle

476
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,580
There it has to be evenly distributed while also being chaotic and he he came up with an image that was you know

477
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:06,220
Shitty looking but it did fulfill what I requested and he's like, okay. That was kind of interesting, right?

478
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:12,380
And I'm like, there you go, right? This isn't something you can do effortlessly the the video. Uh, why is modern art so bad?

479
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,260
This fucking funny duddy said he would go up to his art students because I guess he's a professor

480
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
and he would show them a picture of a

481
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:25,820
A Jackson Pollock painting and he said analyze this Jackson. Yeah analyze this Jackson Pollock painting

482
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,220
And explain why it is good

483
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:34,380
And then they would say oh, it's deep. It's bold and then he'd be like it's actually a close-up of my studio apron

484
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,820
It's just a bunch of smears. You've been duped

485
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,220
Uptrolled

486
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Right now. First of all, we'll just over

487
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:47,900
Congratulation people have found art within your studio. Yeah, good job. You should sell that for money, right?

488
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,100
So we'll just I'll just like sort of pass anything the fact that he presented with them a false question

489
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,300
I think I think that what that says is not anything about Pollock

490
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:04,220
I mean, it just it's just that hold on. Hold on. I think I think can be aesthetically pleasing even if there's no

491
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,660
Like there's so many things wrong with it though. I've been pouring over it for a fucking week in my mind

492
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,700
First of all, he specifically phrases it as analyze this Jackson Pollock painting

493
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,740
And explain why it is good

494
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,340
He's sure he said it was a Jackson Pollock. Are you sure about that? He said that he tricks them. He lies

495
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,620
Listen to the video. He did lie. So he did lie. Okay, and he specifically says explain

496
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,500
Why it is good. He doesn't say tell me what you think of it, right? Yeah

497
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,180
Now

498
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,660
Right, that is a bit loaded. That is when he presents when he presented the video when I first watched it, right?

499
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,340
He didn't explain it to the audience of the of the video that it was going to be a trick

500
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,060
I see the Jackson Pollock painting and I'm like, oh, I don't care for it. It looks stupid. I don't I don't get it, right?

501
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,420
It's dull. Oh, yes. It's kind of wise devout wise devout knew better. Yes. Thank god

502
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,100
Here's the thing, right? I didn't fall for the trick because I

503
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,860
I don't have a fucking art professor telling me the objective standard should be a fucking thing

504
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,940
Right. Exactly. I don't let people tell me what the fucking thing

505
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,180
This guy fucking lies. This guy fucks dude. This guy fucks

506
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:20,300
Yeah, he he is from a position of authority and telling them what you say exactly he didn't ask them to express themselves

507
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:27,340
He told them to say why it's good for people. So the people there, you know, they're trying to come up with reasons why it's good

508
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,300
They might not necessarily like it, but they're trying to fulfill

509
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,940
Right, that's the big problem with that whole thing is because he's in a position of authority

510
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,860
And this is this is like, but this is this this touches on something that I think

511
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,180
Because like I'm not a huge fan of post modern modern art whatever but like people can make it

512
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,060
I don't give a shit. It doesn't bother me. What I don't like

513
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,460
Is the culture

514
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,660
Around it because I think there's there's a lot of like the problem that I had in my experience because like

515
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,420
I went to museums during art school and shit and I looked at all this stuff

516
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,180
And that was like fine. Like I wasn't super engaged in it. That was fine

517
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:09,260
What I hated was the students and the teachers that liked it because there was this culture of of of of

518
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm going to project why this is so good

519
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,220
And then everyone is going to like the public

520
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,180
Kind of looks up to these people authority like the people in the galleries and stuff and they're like, oh

521
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,460
They know better than me. So I'm going to try and like pull the meaning out of it

522
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
Even though I don't I'm going to lie to myself

523
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
To conform to social standards

524
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:37,980
Everything everything that I have heard about the I'm no expert but everything that I have heard about the modern like fine art

525
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,300
painting community

526
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,020
Suggest to me that what it pretty much is is just a bunch of rich people

527
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,220
Are bored and decide that such and such is the new thing

528
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,900
And then it becomes really and then it becomes really expensive

529
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,100
So they can all so they can all spend their money on it and then talk about why that culture is probably really fucked

530
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:05,740
But so again, I want to reiterate my platform here is to shoot down people who who want to elect the god

531
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,820
The great leader of objective standards to overthrow this culture

532
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,820
It's basically like finding the great communist leader to overthrow the capitalist system. It's a very very ill-conceived idea

533
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:23,660
Well when divu earlier mentioned about how he rolled his eyes when he read about people trying to describe or explain the paintings and stuff like that

534
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,620
I think like for me personally

535
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,980
I know why that would hurt me a lot because like whenever I you know do art and stuff and

536
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:38,300
I I would try to like I try to imagine people trying to analyze my art on that level

537
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:45,260
It would it just so would annoy me because they're probably going to get it wrong because there's not that much thought put into paintings

538
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:50,220
It's usually like in art. It's usually a lot of emotions and not a lot of reason

539
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,060
I could be wrong. There could be a lot of people who touchfully put every single dot or whatever, but well major

540
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,980
I'm glad to say that

541
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,820
I wanted to I wanted to raise a counter argument to some of this because okay guys

542
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,620
Uh, we've been we've been shitting a lot on modern art and postmodern art. You know general not everybody, but no, we have

543
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
No, we haven't we've been defending it

544
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,060
Tom, I mean tom has okay fair enough. I haven't done anything. I just said I didn't like it

545
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,820
I specifically opened with I don't like it. Okay, you know what I'll say to those people out there who who find it

546
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,700
Invaluable or in what not? Here's what I'm saying. Invaluable means it's valuable kind of like inflammable means it's flammable

547
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,540
God damn it. I can't catch a break today. All right. Uh, listen

548
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,340
Imagine that you are jackson pollock and you're in your studio and I'm saying this I'm looked at

549
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,060
I looked up pictures of jackson jackson pollock when he's working on his shit

550
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,660
Imagine you are out there every day working for like eight hours, which I'm projecting. I'm assuming he does this

551
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:50,140
You know, he's dead now, but whatever and you're in your studio and every day you spend all day throwing paint on a canvas

552
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,740
And trying new techniques to achieve more interesting effects

553
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,380
And you do this and your art your art gallery is filled with like things that you have

554
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,100
Tested these new techniques on that you have been slaving a way to try to make this thing happen

555
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,300
And then you pick the best of the best that you think are the most evocative convey the most

556
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,860
Just you can't even describe what it conveys. It just is interesting to look at and then and and yes

557
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,340
And you sell for a tons of money because they're popular and then you have people say well, I could have done that

558
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,260
Well, I could have done that, you know, what after like a lifetime spent honing this craft of experiment

559
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,060
I'm sure there's interviews of him talking about it because it's not like this was something that like came up as a criticism

560
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,300
After the fact this is sort of like what got him popular was people huddling around being like is this even like is this

561
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,860
It's funny that we use pollock as an example though because jackson pollock became famous not even because people liked his art

562
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,980
It was because he was from new york and he looked like an all-american kind of guy and like at that

563
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,940
No, seriously at that time the uh, like the whatever art movement he was a part of it

564
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,820
It was like big in like france in europe and people like in new york

565
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,500
They wanted it to be american so there was a photo of jackson pollock wearing a cowboy hat and it looked stereotypically american

566
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,180
So they specifically chose him to make him popular and pull that movement back to america

567
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:13,500
So he was the k-pop star of his era basically that tom that tom that is really really really depressing

568
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Um

569
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Guys who the fuck

570
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,820
Thought it was an okay idea to change the topic on the day of recording gib you weren't even here

571
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,420
Why would we have to worry about what you think you're not even here piss?

572
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,500
This is the topic. This is the thing I have the most to say about and the topic was changed an hour late

573
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,420
And you didn't show up on time. Well, you're here now. What can we do?

574
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,540
He didn't think that this would be the topic. So he didn't have a reason to show up. He didn't have a reason to show

575
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,460
Yeah, that's fair. That's no, that's fair. Yeah, but yeah, so now that you're here. Are you recording?

576
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:59,180
Oh, oh, oh, you're oh, this is a topic you want to talk about. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, youtube alternatives was a piece of shit topic

577
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,100
I didn't want to do it

578
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,420
Agreed and this is the the most

579
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,500
I'm so mad. I don't this should never ever happen. Well, why why you're here now

580
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,540
I'm angry that it has happened and I'm gonna clip the mic right now. That's what I'm doing

581
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:22,460
To for brevity's sake, I'll just say my general top like stance on modern art. It's good

582
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,180
Jackson Pollock is shit and I don't like him

583
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,460
But that's where did you hear what we were saying about Jackson?

584
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,300
I jumped in and you were talking about him and he always gets brought up because

585
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
He rides the line some say

586
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,660
The the way I view art

587
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,820
Modern art or otherwise is that if it's good, I like it and if it's not it sucks

588
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,860
And the fact that it's modern doesn't have anything to do with us

589
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,660
Yeah, I think Jackson Pollock is probably much better seen in person than uh, you know, fia fucking digital

590
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,980
Yeah, media whatever

591
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,980
There's a painting downstairs in my in like a little book nook

592
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,220
Near our porch and it is I mean, it's just a bunch of fucking colors

593
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,340
Maybe I'll take a picture of it and like upload it and it can go on the screen

594
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Yeah, that's just it's just a bunch of colors and like there's some like blotches of like silver paint on it in like squares

595
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,100
And like, you know, it's whatever it doesn't it doesn't mean anything

596
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:21,580
But but the colors are deep and rich and it's like these beautiful jewel tones like kind of coming out of like a kind of black

597
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,060
sort of general black

598
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,260
Area and there's these just the silver the silver

599
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,180
Square is just kind of like cut through there and they kind of like fade at some of the corners

600
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,820
And it's like it's like the thing has been stamped with like a spiral like stamp or something

601
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,900
So it has this like this weird like like tactile like ridges to it

602
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:46,780
And I love this fucking painting because it's got like it's really just textural and like beautiful in those colors

603
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,700
I know that we've been exposing our ignorance by by just fucking mentioning like Pollock constantly

604
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,500
But he's just the one that I happened to like get treated about him. I'm super ignorant

605
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,500
He's well Pollock is emblematic like okay. I don't I don't know that much

606
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,340
I couldn't name that many like painters of this style honestly

607
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:13,580
But Pollock is emblematic as someone who is like basically all you know all aesthetic and no like no concrete like like

608
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,740
Subject matter right right now

609
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,780
That's one of the things that people brought up as one of the painting's strengths

610
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:25,100
Is that there are no like centerpieces in his paintings where your eyes are definitively drawn to which is actually

611
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:31,500
A lot harder than you think so this guy in my comment section who I I challenged to do something sort of like a Pollock

612
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,540
What he ended up doing was he made a whole bunch of very definitive shapes that he himself expressed

613
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,500
Uh, dislike with because they drove him nuts right the thing about Pollock is that they're so

614
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:48,620
Interwoven and all the shapes are so minimal and they're in themselves that there's just no beginning or end to his painting

615
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:54,140
I'm gonna I'm gonna contest that because most of his paintings are on canvas which have edges

616
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,620
So there's going to be a middle point

617
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,460
How like like if you if you want to take it to to a degree where it's like

618
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:07,100
Where does the art begin and end? He should just take like get a paint like bomb grenade and throw it into a room

619
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,460
Yeah

620
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:15,100
So the last thing I'll mention about Pollock. I swear to god is is yeah the the guy who did the the fucking apron meme

621
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,180
prank bro

622
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,580
Someone in my comments also mentioned that that fucking apron does not in any way look like a Jackson Pollock painting

623
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,300
His apron is a bunch of fucking smudges

624
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,340
And the smudges are of way too many colors all turning into a big brownie mess

625
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,460
And they're mostly cornered in the upper left corner, right Jackson Pollock's paintings are

626
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,300
splatter paintings

627
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:43,900
Not smudges with very limited well considered colors and are very evenly distributed

628
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:49,820
I so like it's not just random. I knew that it was not a painting. It was something like some sort of goading

629
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,740
I I I had something to say about that because I I saw you that what you linked it before debut

630
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,380
And I watched it and I'm like, yeah, this guy this guy's a fucking silly billy

631
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,020
But the thing he has about like art students

632
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:09,340
Faking that they're smart about things is definitely something that happens and a lot of people in the art world

633
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,860
Just sort of nobody knows what art is or what is like

634
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,460
Correct

635
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,820
But people there's this general idea that there is something correct

636
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:24,140
So people have to you know pretend constantly and they get wrapped up in their own like weakness like oh, yes

637
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,740
It's it's inspiring. It's this and that but they don't actually know what they're saying. I want to contest that

638
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,580
I I have uh, okay

639
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:37,180
This is we we've been we've frankly wasted a ton of our viewers in our time here because these are the facts of the matter

640
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,140
All right classical art modern art post modern art

641
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,780
They have one thing in common and it's that they're all equally worthless. All right, the best art

642
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,500
The best art is that that which uh, uh, achieves some

643
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:57,340
Real world impact and that is why the greatest the greatest artwork that was ever made was literally the uncle sam

644
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,180
I want you for the us army poster. That is the greatest piece of artwork

645
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:06,300
Could we just have one episode where you don't devolve into retardation one episode? No

646
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,500
I refuse that call. This is what about Aaron and me. What about gran lugen?

647
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:18,700
Well, okay, there is something to be said for inspirational stuff that that uh, that that conveys some larger truth

648
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,140
Uh, it adjoys more people point up and point for what?

649
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,940
My favorite thing is not about

650
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,460
like

651
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:32,940
Practical effect like like art is why not. Why what's wrong with art that it's not about that is my question

652
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,940
my ganda

653
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:41,420
Yeah, like you're like, no, that's okay. That was effective as propaganda, but that doesn't mean that it succeeds as art

654
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:47,420
I mean, maybe it does. The thing about that is that the art was not responsible for people joining them the the military

655
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:55,100
That that uncle sam was extremely it was provocative extremely. Yeah, but the thing is that's not the sole reason people join the military

656
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:59,100
That's not the sole. I mean like the flat the american flag is more in the context

657
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,500
American flag is more of a thing and then also like

658
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,500
Just advertising and like pushing like yeah people talking about it and you know speeches that the president said

659
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:13,420
Those are all equally going towards the same goal. You can't say that that poster is the art that made it all happen

660
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:20,140
Probably most of the classical art is the most classical art. I believe is propaganda for christianity, right?

661
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,660
Yeah, that's that's right. It depends like a majestic and inspiring. No, generally to celebrate

662
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,020
Well, well, how do you apply propaganda to that? I mean, you know

663
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:34,700
Well propaganda is it's made with us with the intent of you know, fucking

664
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,900
I don't know doing something. Well, I guess if you're like a really religious person and you make an art just because you love

665
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,100
Jesus so much that isn't immediately propaganda like I think the intent

666
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,340
Yeah, but with this fucking commissioned by the church for you to paint in their fucking buildings

667
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,220
It's obviously like trying to make the building more inviting

668
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:55,660
I I mean, I guess you could argue that that is their building that like where that I mean they are already down with Jesus

669
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,940
So like they're not trying to convince. No, they're trying. Well, no, they bring fucking people

670
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,980
That's how Christianity works. That's literally how the Catholic church writes. What's monkey's favorite thing about Nate?

671
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,580
I want to hear

672
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:12,780
My my favorite my favorite thing about Nate is that his two modes are completely memeing and no sincerity and then

673
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,940
Trying to have philosophical

674
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,380
Debates those two go together so well, dude. I gotta tell you they really

675
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:24,220
And then and then when he breaks out the insightful ideas on the podcast he says them in the most

676
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,860
Obviously outrageous and me me way that no one could ever possibly leave them

677
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:34,140
But then just keeps presenting them over and over again like that and then everyone has to slowly

678
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:39,500
Stop chuckling and be like well, Nate. That's retarded. And then I don't what are you talking about?

679
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:46,300
What are you saying post modern art? All right, like what post modern art specifically is is like look at this toilet

680
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,500
I'm calling it art. I submit like ooh gotcha

681
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,860
You are celebrating this thing because I got you all mixed up in your fucking head to be like, oh, that's art

682
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,940
But secretly I knew that it's just a fucking toilet. It's nothing you you fools

683
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,540
I tricked you like so it's basically it's just saying that like art is bullshit

684
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:10,860
But but my question is what is more valuable about classical art that like guys like that guy in that video are like celebrating

685
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,860
I agree. Okay. I think okay. Here's here's my theory. Tell me if I'm wrong and if there's a tangent final stop

686
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,620
But it's like I feel like what guys like this guy are saying is

687
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,380
He thinks that like a world where classical art is celebrated and made more

688
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:34,220
Is like better because we've got like expectations for like what beauty is and like what the world is and I can understand

689
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,820
Is the point someone like that is trying to really he just likes them

690
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,980
Yeah, yeah classical art

691
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,620
If you wanted if you wanted to do something like Michelangelo or da Vinci that requires

692
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,180
years of study

693
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,940
And which obviously he respects obviously he can not imitate. I looked at his paintings. They're not that good

694
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,460
Right. So like I think I think and like there's while you can't argue objective standards

695
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,700
There is no arguing that objectively it takes more time study and effort

696
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,740
To be a Michelangelo than it is to put a signature on a used toilet and put it in a gallery

697
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,460
And I think people if you stop looking at it at that level

698
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:17,420
Then I think a lot of people that's where they stop the analyzation. It's just like, yeah, this takes more effort

699
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,780
Therefore, it's better for a great another great counter example. There's this one guy

700
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:25,340
I don't remember what he's called or what his his comic was called, but he has this youtube video called

701
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,180
Oh, shit

702
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:32,300
The main title is something like how to not waste time on your art but the subtitle that you oh

703
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:37,660
Is the guy who's like he he's making a video how it took like 10 years to make his comic because he kept putting like

704
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,540
Insane line arts in his background. He did the comic about his trip to Japan, right?

705
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:50,540
Yeah, the subtitle of this video is from a guy who spent 13 years drawing a comic where yeah, he he used like

706
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,340
He's yeah 13 years drawing a three volume comic

707
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,860
So it's like four or five years per volume right and he explained and if you look at it

708
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,180
It's not that impressive like it's just it's just black and white like cartoony art

709
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,460
It's not like he like recreated some high-level mangaka or anything

710
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,420
It's just a guy's name. The guy's name is lars martinson. Uh, if anyone wants to look him up

711
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,380
It's a good video

712
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,100
Yeah, yeah, because because basically he explained that it took so long

713
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,860
Because he decided to use like he wanted it to look like certain styles

714
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:23,740
So he used like certain tools and pens and like inks that are like a pain in the fucking ass

715
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,300
and he also

716
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:31,500
He made all shadows hatching for yeah cross hatching decided to make that

717
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,620
Which takes super long and he drew every background

718
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:38,300
He never reused a background and sometimes he would have a very busy image

719
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,620
Even when it didn't need to be in the context of the story

720
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,500
So there you go

721
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,740
That's a good example of like putting effort and that you don't get your money's worth from it

722
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,740
Right kids remember this do not be precious about your projects

723
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,860
Get it done and get the next one rolling and you will you will get better art in the end than you would have

724
00:54:54,940 --> 00:55:00,540
Just be precious forever to change be open to failure be open to failure. Yeah. Yeah, and yeah, you know

725
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,020
It's important. It's important. So like um

726
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,180
Oh people like Pollack fucking and other people like Rothko, right?

727
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:12,300
It is true that it didn't take as much work because like what had to go into it for consideration is a lot quicker

728
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,300
Right and you can see like Pollack in his studio that they have documentaries of him

729
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,380
He's obviously focusing pretty fucking hard like he's not just being random

730
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:27,500
But the point is he did make hundreds of those styles of paintings in the span of a decade and so did Rothko

731
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,900
I believe and so it's like, okay, clearly. This isn't as difficult to make right the thing is though

732
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:38,860
They made hundreds of paintings like the prolificity does count for some those like the paintings are not an accident

733
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:45,100
Like even even if an individual like okay, it's kind of like photography like you're you're you might be capturing a moment

734
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,220
That just happened to happen. Okay. Yeah, do you know there's like there's like a grand total like don't interrupt me. I will destroy you

735
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,340
You're making hundreds and hundreds of these splatter paintings or whatever

736
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:01,100
And then you know, you're finding your techniques and and you know, you're you're you're ending up with all these products

737
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,860
And you know, sometimes you have you might have a happy accident and something looks really good

738
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:09,180
And then maybe a hundred other times it looks like crap and then you take the good ones and you're like like this one

739
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,460
Looks really good. It's got some visually is interesting going on

740
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,740
So, you know, I'm gonna present this one to my fucking fans or whatever

741
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,060
You know, it's selective exclusion

742
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,940
Curation helpful in this curation is the ultimate art form perhaps perhaps so

743
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,460
You could argue that everything is curation, I guess, but but it's like

744
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,500
What I have found is very helpful in this process is sometimes when I'm recording a video

745
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:36,540
I'll do a bunch of takes. I do this with we got it wasn't just everything. I'll do a bunch of takes of a line

746
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:43,100
I'll do like a motion several times and like I find more often than not and I'm expand this in a second

747
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,540
But it's like more often than not

748
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,700
It's not one that I expected to be the good one that when I've got it in the editing bay

749
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,420
And it's time to to make this part of the final product

750
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:56,780
I look through the clips and I I pick one of them and it's not like in that one moment where I did it

751
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,540
I had some brilliant insight necessarily, you know, maybe I did something different

752
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,100
But it's just that like oh that one happened to go better

753
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,780
And so I pick that one and by doing that for like every take throughout the video

754
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,260
You get the best of the best of the best for the whole thing

755
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:13,260
And you know, like that is the process by which you produce something that's really good

756
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,860
And I mean, yes, you can be precious with everything and do takes to get them perfect

757
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,740
And you're like that was the one but like this is another

758
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:25,100
Another curation form of makes it good. What are you just saying not to worry about it and just get it out there?

759
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,580
And I was saying you do everything five times and no, no, no

760
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,940
No, listen what I'm saying is what I'm saying is I there's nothing wrong

761
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,180
If you if you're not sure if something's coming out good or bad

762
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:38,540
Don't just accept that it's bad like there's a level of degrees here. You need to accept doing five takes of something

763
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,740
Uh, if like for example, if I'm doing like an intro to we Agua like they're they're very random and chaotic

764
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,660
And I just make whatever the fuck up off the top of my head

765
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,940
But I will do it several times because I'll know that like I probably won't get it like looking perfect one time

766
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,740
But if I have five to work with it's it takes like, you know five minutes as opposed to one minute to record

767
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:01,020
And I give myself that much more likelihood of having the material I need to work with to make it acceptable in the end

768
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,420
So, you know, did you know that Stanley Kubrick when filming

769
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,020
Dr. Strange Love or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb

770
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,860
How that movie is famous because everyone acts like a goofball in it

771
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,300
None of the actors knew that that was how the movie was going to be

772
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:23,580
During the entire process of filming Kubrick said, oh, yeah. Well, let's have some

773
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,380
Improvised takes on the script here

774
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,820
So I'm just gonna film like sort of us doing the script

775
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,620
But goofy just to kind of you know, like like grease the wheels loosen up a bit and don't worry guys

776
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,340
All of you Hollywood actors you take yourself very seriously

777
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,500
We will then film the serious version

778
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,700
Don't worry and literally told none of them

779
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:48,060
They had to show up to the fucking premiere to find out that he used all the goofy takes

780
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:54,860
Similarly to how he actually swapped out the soundtrack for 2001 a space Odyssey near the end and didn't tell the guy who made the original version

781
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,540
That that's great

782
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:03,340
And that adds to my point because it's entirely possible that Kubrick didn't realize he was going to do that until the editing process

783
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:09,340
Uh, I'm pretty sure he did no Kubrick is evil. Kubrick was an evil evil man who deceived everyone for the sake of his movies

784
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,900
Maybe he did maybe he did that's fine

785
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:16,700
But okay, I'm gonna pretend that he didn't do it on purpose and that he did in the editing bay because here's my point

786
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,260
And and what I'm saying is like a lot of the times when I've got when I when I'm just like

787
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:26,220
Ah, fuck it. I just need to get this thing done and I film the materials and I put it in the editing bay

788
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,220
That's when I'm able to be honestly like my most creative and

789
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:37,740
Giving yourself the tools to proceed and get something done. Just it allows you to play with a more

790
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,820
Narrow down

791
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,700
palette that you can experiment with and do stuff with and that

792
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:49,020
Is honestly a very helpful thing to to get something finally done it out the door and make it and and that is not something

793
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:55,660
That you can really plan out ahead of time. You can but I'd argue it's inefficient or at least that it doesn't work for me personally

794
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:00,620
So, uh, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Do you have more things to say? I hope I hope you don't feel stifled in this topic

795
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:06,140
Because if you say it's your ultimate topic, I have to hear it. Well, I don't have anything to say about film

796
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,220
I I most of what I have in like my brain is like

797
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,300
People hate modern art for stupid reasons and I hate them

798
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,220
But I don't know what you've already like discussed or whether you've gone over that or not

799
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,820
Just feel free to like risk repeating shit. Go ahead

800
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,700
I don't know

801
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:31,180
Art's good. What do you think about post-modern art though? What do you mean like the toilet on the pedestal?

802
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,140
What do you think about that? I think I think what do you think about toilets? You want to get shit?

803
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,380
Oh

804
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,420
For my shit you fat slut

805
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,660
Um post-modern art. I mean, it's the same thing

806
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,740
For me if it's good, then I like it. So like, um

807
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,420
Something doesn't necessarily need a lot of effort to be put into it

808
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,860
But if it's like they and you know a toilet is like a terrible

809
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,820
It's a piece of shit, you know lull

810
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,100
um

811
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:04,940
The worst post-modern artist or like artist I've ever seen in my life and I hate her is tracy emin

812
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:11,340
She got famous for doing like a piece where it was her bed. She had a bed with like, um

813
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,140
You know wrappers and and dust and and grime and certain of dirty duvet

814
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,140
And it was just all like in on the middle of the floor

815
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:23,740
This is what it's like for me to wake up in the morning and it was all grungy and horrible and everyone was

816
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,380
Trey tracy emin

817
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,340
Yeah

818
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
Really don't like her face

819
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,140
I've seen her also on like a few like tv shows about like

820
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:42,940
Where she's like a judge of like post-modern artist, uh, like contestant things is awful awful person

821
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,900
I not an awful person, but awful art. I hate her

822
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,980
But like um, you know her art looks like she looks like to kind of like like people who do like little four panel comics of

823
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,860
What it's like being a neurotic girl and your periods are getting all over the place and you get like 20 000 retweets

824
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,100
It's just it's just like nothing but more squiggly

825
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,340
Well, yeah, um

826
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,620
That some post-modern art can be really funny

827
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:10,060
You know, it just depends on what statement they're making and whether I agree with it basically

828
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:15,180
Um one time in in college, uh, this is this is gonna get me in trouble. Maybe

829
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:21,180
Uh, I I did a funny post-modern thing. I got like a stuff. I got a like a stuffed little little monkey

830
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:24,780
And I got some black cloth and I made it a little burqa

831
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:33,260
And and that was my project and the teacher was like, uh, okay. Why and I explained why and it was all about like

832
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:37,260
shock value being like, um, you know

833
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:42,860
It's all in the person's head. It's not a burqa. It's not like I'm saying anything. It's just like it's cute

834
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:46,140
Isn't it it's a cute little monkey and it's just so happens to be a muslim woman

835
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,300
Like what's so what's so wrong about that and they they they were okay with it

836
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:55,100
And I wrote an essay like explaining my my thought process and that was I mean in in art college

837
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:00,620
That's what you have to do is you have to explain it in a way that the teachers can understand

838
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:07,980
If you just say it's uh, it I was inspired by x and I did the same thing that I was inspired by

839
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:12,220
Can I have a mark that's high please? It's like no, that's not how it works

840
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:17,180
You gotta be smart the number one thing I learned in art school was to bullshit like that's yeah

841
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,340
One thing I really hate now

842
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:25,260
I did say that like people are free to express themselves on something and I'm free to dislike it and what I really really dislike

843
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,980
I hate to even bring it up is like a lot of this feminist quote-unquote art

844
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,460
Because a lot of it has to do with like

845
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:39,500
Periods and like they're literally plopping plopping fucking like eggs out of a vagina on a canvas to like like it publicly

846
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,940
Yeah, yeah hitting my oldie position fetish dog

847
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,980
Yeah art and then like

848
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:52,540
Painting with period blood or like putting wool in your vagina and pulling it out and making a sweater or something out of it

849
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:56,060
People have painted with shit their own shit before why I know and that's disgusting too

850
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,620
But like why does feminists aren't always have to do with periods of vaginas?

851
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,700
That's great

852
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,300
I always does

853
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:10,460
Is it is it an idea of like is it the fact that we find it gross what they're trying to like fix with that?

854
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:17,580
You know, yeah, I think the thing is like they're celebrating it. You know, they're celebrating their womanhood, but also it's it's beautiful

855
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,900
Yeah, I mean, michelle. I don't I said michelle. I meant mage

856
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,540
Oh

857
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,580
You always do that you all you view all women is the same

858
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:34,940
Yeah, one of these days I'm gonna ruin the podcast Nate yet again. Oh, please call me mom. Oh

859
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:42,300
Yeah, you'd like that wouldn't you uh, uh, I don't know what you're saying mage, but all I'm hearing is a whole lot of internalized massaging

860
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,980
That's all it's definitely a lot of

861
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:50,220
It would be a more it would be a more effective

862
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,220
Thing to do like for shock value if it hadn't become a cliche

863
01:04:54,700 --> 01:05:00,460
Yes, well at this point. That's true. Can we criticize the people who led up to the point where it became cliche though?

864
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,180
Like because they were you know, they were doing something new, right?

865
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,980
You know what on the same subject my my

866
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:11,660
My postmodern art like act would be to go to high schools and middle schools

867
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,900
And hand out cards to all the boys and the cards just has plain text saying

868
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,340
The reason why girls don't want to have sex with you despite being just as wired for sex as you

869
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:25,580
Is that they're very very insecure about their vaginas and how they smell

870
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:32,620
Scratch this spot to get a vagina smell accustom yourself to it and make yourself comfortable with it and you will have sex

871
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,940
What the fuck?

872
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,660
What the fuck's wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you?

873
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,140
How could you get a

874
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:45,020
We gotta keep the body in population up if we want to have fucking health care, right?

875
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,420
I hear yes. Okay. Yay

876
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
It all comes back to health

877
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,580
It's all about the health care

878
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,180
Scratch and sniff vagina smell

879
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,260
Yeah, that's

880
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,940
This is a okay. This is a loaded ones

881
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,340
I don't really want to get into the political issue of it

882
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:05,020
but like for like mattress girl if you remember mattress girl and

883
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,500
We can put put aside whether or not everything she said was true or like anything about it

884
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,580
But the fact that the art piece was her carrying around a mattress

885
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,860
Around her school and this was the art piece like okay to be fair

886
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:22,300
I understand that like yes, this will get people talking at her school

887
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,580
They will say what's the deal with the fucking mattress. Um

888
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,380
You know, I guess I don't know anything more to say about it. I've seen I've seen an artist

889
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,820
Which I don't want to do who had a giant block of eyes very insightful point

890
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,780
And he would go to me

891
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:39,020
He went to New York with a giant block of ice and he would just push the ice all down the street

892
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,380
And he had a guy following him like like a block

893
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,540
Like a big block of ice that you would like

894
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,820
Contain like a fishing fish and whatever in the market

895
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:52,460
And he would just push it until it melted and the the point of the art piece was to

896
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,220
To show how such a strange thing was happening

897
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,460
But nobody would ever pay attention and nobody did

898
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,340
Nobody even looked up at all at him

899
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,380
That reminds me of this uh, there's this one like tv show

900
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,180
This is one like low budget tv show on one of those low budget channels about human psychology

901
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,940
One of those like hey, it's like a human psychology show for 11 year olds, right?

902
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:20,140
But they go to a mall and they get some uh, you know, like the fluffy like theater railing you use to make queuing lines

903
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:25,660
Right, they put it in the middle of the of the mall and they put a sign that says get in this line

904
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,260
Like for no particular reason. He doesn't say for no reason

905
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,620
But it doesn't say what the reason is right and they do they put the queuing line there and it leads to nothing

906
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:40,940
And oh, yeah, yeah, the sign just says the line starts here not explaining what the line is for and they film this from above

907
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:46,220
And the line goes for hours and no one gets in so they send in one of their guys

908
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,260
An actor to go into the line to stand there, right?

909
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:55,500
So he stands there looking confident like he's ready for the fucking line, right? He stands there for a full half an hour

910
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:00,540
When finally this one guy who seems kind of bored. He's like, huh?

911
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:07,580
So he gets in the line and the moment that there are two people in the line the line suddenly explodes

912
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:13,660
So it was a test in human psychology if no one's in the line. No one's getting one guy. That's good stuff

913
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,980
There's one guy in the line

914
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,700
Some outliers will try it and once there's two people in the line the line fills up like crazy

915
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,660
And so then they just sort of like had the first guy who was an actor

916
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,260
He just started walking and everyone just started following him, right?

917
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,580
And they they led them all throughout the mall eventually jumping over like stupid obstacles

918
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:37,260
Like jumping over like a little stick or whatever or going in a circle doing jumping jacks and everyone fucking participated

919
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,820
Yeah, but okay at some point the people in the line must have been like what the fuck's happened

920
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:47,260
Like like I'm sure I think some point it changed from like I'm just bored and gonna wait in this line

921
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:51,020
Just like it must have been amusing to them on some level, right?

922
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:54,140
When it got increasing things increasingly bizarre

923
01:08:55,100 --> 01:09:02,860
Within every human's mind, I think is this two competing things of like independent free thought basically and like are just kind of

924
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,180
Relaxing ourselves into just like going with what the crowd is doing. I think those are like two

925
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,260
Primal forces that kind of jump. I heard the saying that like

926
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:16,300
An individual is intelligent a crowd is dumb something like that

927
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:17,580
Sure

928
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:22,540
What interested me about what divu said there was like he was explaining that and he said it was like

929
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:29,900
A study in psychology rather than an art piece and I think that at some point the line blur is there like what what?

930
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,180
What is a study of psychology? What is that? Can we define this?

931
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,700
Well, why don't we head over to our friends on urbandictionary.com?

932
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:43,980
Why don't we head over to forum.becomealivinggod.com?

933
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:48,940
Let me just read by the way for fun

934
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,620
Did you make?

935
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:57,020
Um, I'm chillin for it. I'm chillin for it. Let me just read the definition of psychology on urbandictionary

936
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:01,100
It's the practice of taking things we already know about people

937
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:06,140
And weighing it down with jargon until only the other people who understand it are psychologists

938
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,660
Art to me, you know, you know this guy hates

939
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,220
Jordan Pete very funny

940
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:17,020
Uh guys, I'm done. I'm spent. I've yeah. Well, I have one more thing to say

941
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:21,180
So, okay the the guy in the fucking ragu university video

942
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:29,340
He's all fucking like where did the centuries long quest for beauty and artistic and skillful perfection

943
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,460
Like go away like what happened to it, right?

944
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,140
He said it didn't just die out. It was pushed out

945
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,740
You know by the by the fucking like hipsters and shit in the early 20th century, right? Here's the thing now

946
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,540
That's yet another thing about that video that's fucking retarded

947
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:52,060
It wasn't like one day some dudes decided to change the face of art and it was all their fucking fall

948
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,940
And they could have shown up in the 19th century or the 15th century or the 29th century

949
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,740
The fact that they showed up in the 20th century

950
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:06,860
Means a whole lot in the late 19th century because that's when film was taking off and photography was taking off

951
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:11,340
It was fucking inevitably going to become like static art

952
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:19,580
Paintings and sculpting was always going to become a bunch of hipster bullshit because of film because film is where we put

953
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:27,660
Our highest priority of beauty the most effort the most skill and often that is highly diluted like when we think of hollywood movies

954
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,660
It's you know, it's a mass produced

955
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:36,060
You know machine, but when you think when you think about the directors out there whose films are extremely artful

956
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:42,460
It's like this is the height of our quest for beauty and overt obvious depth

957
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:48,300
Now right like animation and film and video games even are like the mediums where we're putting our emphasis there

958
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:55,260
So painting and sculpting they're sort of like left behind as like mediums that cannot touch people as

959
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:00,620
Deeply in nine times out of ten because there's not as many mediums. So that's why they become so weird

960
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:04,060
I don't think it's necessarily that I think the fact that

961
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:09,020
You can now watch movies at home, but arts you still have to go to a gallery

962
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,620
That you used to have to go to a cinema to see a film

963
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:19,100
And now you don't need to so now it's like less of an art form in the sense that you go out to see it

964
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:25,500
Like a theater or a play or whatever and and more that you can it's a it's a consumable product that people

965
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:30,380
you know go through in their own time wherever and whenever they like and

966
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,540
I think

967
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:38,540
I think the the the art is like um, you know in galleries and sculptures and paintings are still like

968
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,420
The same a level of like

969
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:46,380
You know artistic fulfillment you can get from it. It's just you have to go to the place where it is

970
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,420
And for a lot of people that just isn't worth the time

971
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:54,300
But the thing that it evokes is like the feeling of going to a place

972
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:58,300
Like you go to a nice countryside and you take in the environment

973
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:03,660
You see the nice blue sky and the trees and the stuff and it sounds and feels really nice and that

974
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,620
You cut I wouldn't say it's art because that's stupid

975
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:13,340
No one should say that but like that's the feeling that a painting of a beautiful landscape is supposed to invoke in use

976
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:17,820
To remind you of what it feels like to see and be in a place like that. Oh, yeah

977
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:22,460
I remember one time in the chat we were talking about what are our favorite aesthetics and you were like

978
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:26,060
I remember you hit bill you were like, oh my favorite aesthetics is this and this or like uh

979
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:30,620
Some the point is you listed a bunch of like regular aesthetics and then you one of your aesthetics was

980
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:38,380
Being in an abandoned 12th century castle. Yes. I love that. I love castles that they're my favorite art piece

981
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:45,740
By mankind. They're better than propaganda. I prefer nature. Yeah, you can definitely argue that. Well, uh, here's what I want to say about

982
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,980
Davoo's point

983
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:54,300
So so to what that guy was saying about how like it was intentionally made so that we're deviating from these objective standards of beauty and stuff

984
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:01,340
So I am agnostic about if there is some grand marxist conspiracy to like destroy the west

985
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:05,020
I I do not know, uh, whether that's true or not. So I'm putting that aside

986
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:11,660
But what I will say is to to his point to his point of how we are in fact deviating from these beauty standards

987
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:18,860
Um, I want to give him as much credit as possible. He may or may not have intended this but like I'm reading this into it. Anyway, it's like

988
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,580
We definitely are

989
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,340
Getting further away on in the art scene at the very least from objective standards

990
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,300
And as Davoo was saying it may in fact have been inevitable

991
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:32,940
But just because it's inevitable it may also be inevitably

992
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:39,180
Destructive to the human race that that's happening that is like it's possible that christianity for example

993
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:45,340
Despite being not true would just be a useful thing to keep humans in line so that we don't kill ourselves

994
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,260
It's possible. Hold on. I think we I think this is a promo for an upcoming episode

995
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,740
I think me and you Nate would be most wanting to do

996
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,660
Which would be called wake of phobia, which is what some right wing

997
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,940
writers throughout the decades have

998
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:03,100
It basically it basically means fear of the familiar fear of the home

999
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:08,460
But some right wing writers have co-opted that term to mean the opposite of xenophobia

1000
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:14,460
Sort of like whenever someone hears about a law that exists in the uk and they're like

1001
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,460
We should have that law in america too, but america's too stupid to have it

1002
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:24,380
Like how american feminists like uh are totally okay with like women being enslaved in saudi arabia

1003
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,940
Well, they're not okay with it, but like the fact that they're their priorities

1004
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:29,740
Yeah, like i mean i remember one time being in the car with like this girl

1005
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:33,260
This chick who was just like constantly be like oh man america sure sucks for this reason

1006
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:40,780
Oh, they're you could just passively mention something different about some other country and they're like, oh, that's so much better than is in america

1007
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,220
Yeah, right and i think i think it's a natural

1008
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,100
A natural result of becoming

1009
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:53,100
The the most powerful opulent nation that it starts to destroy itself from within by people who felt like they didn't do

1010
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:58,300
Anything to earn this opulence feel guilty about it and take it out in this manner. So yeah, this should be a

1011
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:02,140
I'll add wake of phobia to the topics list. We'll do this some other time

1012
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:06,300
Okay, and we will title that episode we hate white people

1013
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,460
That's what i am beautiful

1014
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,020
I feel like like um

1015
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:17,420
with like youtube videos and and and and uh like media that we consume at home or wherever

1016
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:22,540
Even music to a degree, but music still has festivals which are big and live performances

1017
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,220
but like getting out of the house and going to see art is

1018
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:32,780
Dying out a little bit at a time cinemas are now like not as big as they used to be and they need to be like

1019
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,180
Luxury in order to make any money at all

1020
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,780
um

1021
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:41,180
And I feel like with you know the young people they stay at home. They don't do anything

1022
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:46,060
They they they can get everything they ever wanted through the internet and they can get the internet everywhere

1023
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,980
so like

1024
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,140
In this time and this day in this age

1025
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:55,100
Uh art pieces that you have to go and see are more valuable than ever

1026
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:58,940
But nobody wants to go to them and I understand because art galleries are stuffy and

1027
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:05,580
And some of them you have to pay to get in and whatever and and you know not you're not going to guarantee to find as much as you could get

1028
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,980
Just googling stuff. So what but but what I think

1029
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,340
What I think is that the reason

1030
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,900
Well, I think the greatest

1031
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,300
piece of art in the modern age

1032
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,140
For this reason

1033
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,580
This is no this bad gas is pokemon go

1034
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:29,500
Now we're talking now because it combines video games with

1035
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:35,420
Being a real human in the real world and going to places and having experiences and connecting with people in a way

1036
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,660
That no other thing that you can do now

1037
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,820
Really allows you to do

1038
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:44,780
Speaking of which I've really enjoyed the gifts that you've been sending me from your local poke stops

1039
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:51,420
I've I've I've liked having you send gifts and then me google searching what the poke stop was that you send it from

1040
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,780
Be able to see where you are. That's cool. What's what was this about gifts?

1041
01:17:54,860 --> 01:18:00,300
Wait, what is this the thing in that you can trade? Yeah, mage. I I will send you a gift

1042
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,420
I think I'm gonna add people to your friends list now that i'm back in boston

1043
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:09,020
I gotta fucking get on the go train. I gotta go hard. Dude. I got it. I got it downloaded. I got it downloaded. I'm going

1044
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,540
I'm going I will definitely say it is super it is supremely art

1045
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:18,300
I remember back to the early 2000s in some kids highly decked up decorated blue room

1046
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:23,660
Him showing me all of his pokemon cards and he's like at the same age as me and then warp to

1047
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,540
14 years later being at a gazebo in virginia beach

1048
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:35,660
Seeing people huddled around playing pokemon go including a like 60-something year old woman with oxygen hooked up to her fucking nose

1049
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:38,780
I remember that gazebo. I remember that gazebo

1050
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:46,700
Yeah, the the people that you meet will play in pokemon go are mothers their construction workers

1051
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:55,820
They're all the same they are all the things that you want to see inside in this great art piece we call pokemon go

1052
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,060
Oh, you did

1053
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:03,180
I have I actually I have two things I need to say before we close out

1054
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:09,980
First is to kind of go all the way back to beginning talking about like, you know postmodernism versus classical art like the prager you video

1055
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,340
um

1056
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:15,500
I feel like those are like two ends of a spectrum of like art

1057
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:21,580
Uh, like like you have postmodernism, which I can appreciate the idea or like people can appreciate the idea

1058
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:27,100
But the execution is kind of basic, but on the other hand you have the classical art where like the execution is masterfully done

1059
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:33,180
But the the subject matter is very basic just like the bible, you know or just like yeah a portrait

1060
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,820
So like there's like this middle ground that I find the most appreciative is where you have

1061
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:41,180
skillful execution and an interesting idea and that's like

1062
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:46,380
The art I like because like as much as I can appreciate the uh the time and energy put in like a classical painting

1063
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,900
Like I don't really not really huge fan of that either because like I'm like, okay

1064
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:57,260
Right. Yeah, that's why that perfect middle ground the perfect artistic medium is shown in manga shown in exactly

1065
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:00,460
The greatest the greatest art medium. Oh, but speaking of that. Okay

1066
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,740
I needed to the one last thing I wanted to get off my chest

1067
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:09,100
Is the moment the moment that fucking uh, I hated the art world forever. Um

1068
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,620
This is a bit of a bit of a story, but I'll wrap it up quickly

1069
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:13,820
um

1070
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:19,340
Back in like the early mid-2000s like if anyone who's doing art and like college or high school

1071
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:23,420
You know that like there was like this big like if you were trying to draw like a cartoony style

1072
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:27,420
Like your art teachers hated you like this was like a meme and like whether it was true or not

1073
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:31,260
Like a good idea or not is irrelevant to what I'm about to say. Um, because like

1074
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,860
I was drawing like cartoons and shit like that was what I was into

1075
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:40,620
and I was like graduating high school going into college and like everybody gave me shit for it and

1076
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:47,980
And it was it was fucking infuriating because like I was trying to like do like realistic art to like work on my portfolio and

1077
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:53,020
Shit and everyone's like you should just do that. I'm like, uh, but it's gay. I don't like it. Um, but but but

1078
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,780
I had like a portfolio and I went to uh,

1079
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:01,820
Some bunch of schools and like they all said it was shit because like oh, we're fucking sick of anime get out of here

1080
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:05,420
It's gay. We hate you go die. So like all right, whatever so so

1081
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,620
Right off the bat fucking pissed off, but

1082
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:12,460
I end up getting into a school and I go and whatever and like the entire time

1083
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,340
It's like, okay, like I'm gonna do like the art stuff here

1084
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:20,140
And I'm gonna do my cartoon shit off the clock because like that's that's a no-go zone

1085
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,260
We can't make that happen

1086
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:26,860
Whatever and I'm taking art history class and I fucking hate it and it's supremely disgusting

1087
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:34,140
The the the culture around like sucking all these artists dicks and like like trying to like make all these things more complicated

1088
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:38,940
More haughty than they actually are and I just find it infuriating and obnoxious, but then

1089
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:46,300
2010 we get to talking about a new art movement that started called super flat

1090
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,940
Oh, no

1091
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,420
And I want to

1092
01:21:54,620 --> 01:22:01,740
And wikipedia super flat is a postmodern art movement which is influenced by manga and anime

1093
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,900
all of a sudden

1094
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:10,620
Now because it's a fucking art movement those same teachers who are like cartoons or gay are like look at this beautiful

1095
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:13,340
Inspired art and I'm like you're fucking

1096
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,260
Cuts

1097
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:18,620
Wait, wait, but super flat is not just fucking anime art, right?

1098
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:24,300
No, it's not just but the whole thing is that you look at these pieces. It's clearly inspired by that same aesthetic anime

1099
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:29,820
Yeah, okay, and and and and so it's no it's it's it's I like the aesthetic

1100
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,060
It's not like great and therefore

1101
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:36,300
I'm looking up super flat art is usually great. Take a look at this one right here

1102
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:41,980
Look at this is a little bit of anime. I think in my uh, yeah, that might be a little anime in it

1103
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,060
That might be just a bit anime

1104
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,060
So so it's just like

1105
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:52,060
My point is that this is why I hate the art scene because it's like and until it's like in the art scene

1106
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:57,100
It's disgusting, but as soon as all of these other people are like, oh, well, this is art. I guess now it's okay

1107
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,540
That is bullshit when I hate when we when we talk about these arbitrary

1108
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:06,060
Reputations that people get like I mean sometimes it's just because like they're a cunt and people relate to it

1109
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:12,060
But sometimes it's because it's someone who comes along with a style that a lot of people can do or other people can do

1110
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,220
But this one guy

1111
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:21,260
Has the nerve and or charisma to shove it down everyone's face until they're forced to accept it as the new hotness

1112
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:26,780
Similarly to what a couple of analysts did on youtube until eventually analysis became the new review

1113
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,460
Even though it used to be beaten down as overanalyzing before that point

1114
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:33,580
I don't really get super. I mean, okay

1115
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:37,820
Like it's not like I don't think that it looks good necessarily like like these just kind of like

1116
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:43,260
sprawling like series of like flat images and like a white void like I I get it

1117
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,980
Uh, I don't know seems pretty like

1118
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,780
Seems a little uh, what's the word not an frank lisa frank. That's the one

1119
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,140
Yeah

1120
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,540
All the time I I'm definitely feeling some and frank

1121
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:10,300
Is that a whale lord statue, uh, I google super flat and a three dimensional thing came up and I was like, that's not

1122
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:14,220
Well, that's just that's not good. That's not that's not well

1123
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:21,020
Well, tom funny thing you mentioned super flat because I actually learned that super flat myself just a few months ago

1124
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:28,380
Well visiting but while visiting the fine arts museum in boston mason says god in my own in my own time

1125
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,260
My own backyard my oppressor

1126
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,260
Is on display

1127
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:39,420
He there's an entire there was an entire section dedicated to him and at the museum. I realize that I absolutely

1128
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:44,780
Adore the idea of museums and I don't mind paying to see museums

1129
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:51,020
I just feel persecuted and I do not like all of the art that is in museums

1130
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,820
I like the concept of them, but I hate them all the time

1131
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,140
For instance, this is not the finance museum

1132
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:01,020
But there's another museum in boston for art called the institute of contemporary art and when I went to there

1133
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:07,660
There was a there was a an exhibit all on art created in the internet period and there's a lot of you know

1134
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:12,700
Digital art and there's a lot of shit that would be recognizable to stuff like, you know, you and me

1135
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,140
There wasn't like d.v. Narnship. There was a lot of like, you know, hip trendy

1136
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:20,860
Means internet shit that commentated a lot of marin issues and that stuff. I absolutely

1137
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:24,620
Adored I love that exhibit with all my heart and that was the funniest

1138
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,980
I've ever had at any museum ever sadly. It's over now

1139
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,020
I went to

1140
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:33,100
A museum during a con because I had a comics class as an elective in college

1141
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,340
And we went to a museum that just had comic art and they had

1142
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:41,580
Like the original cover of my favorite cover of my favorite comic on display and I like knotted

1143
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:49,580
Everywhere. I know it's great. So so I just I want to know because I've been trying to search for other similar

1144
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:56,620
Institute of contemporary arts, but I can't find any in San Diego and I want to know why I want to bang on the clouds and ask God

1145
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:02,540
Why why are museums gay and stuffy and dusty and bad because okay

1146
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:07,100
I go I go to the the the museum of fine arts in San Diego and it's fine

1147
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:12,220
And I like it and it's just all right and it has that faming pain that famous pain that I had my avatar for a while

1148
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,740
Where the guy's holding his finger up to his head and he looks like he's thinking real hard

1149
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:20,060
And it was the thinker that's embossed for my inclusion of it and not for the ponder

1150
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,780
Oh

1151
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,940
The the ponder yeah the yeah that guy

1152
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:33,500
Uh, it's fine. Oh, but where are the fucking anime? Where's the super flat? Where's the colors?

1153
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,740
Where are the memes?

1154
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:42,140
That's correct. That's what it comes down to. You should come to london and we can go to like a gallery hop

1155
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:48,700
I would absolutely love to do that. Okay. I can't I cannot stress it enough going to the finance museum seeing the tukashi exhibit

1156
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:50,460
and seeing specifically

1157
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:55,740
Uh, this is the full title of the pain by the way dragon in the clouds red mutation the version

1158
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:59,900
I painted when my professor told me to paint something myself for once by tukashi

1159
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,220
That's uh, one of my favorite frames of all time

1160
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,620
Fucking great and uh going to the institute of contemporary art seen all the internet

1161
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:09,580
I'm gonna link you. I'm gonna have to get some of this shit and I'll put in the show notes

1162
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:13,500
But it's absolutely incredible the shit I saw there. I took a lot of videos. Uh, it was beautiful

1163
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:17,180
I just I just this is all just a call to arms museums

1164
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:25,180
Please house and patronize modern contemporary art from the internet and you know just general contemporary stuff

1165
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:31,340
I like renaissance paintings. I just want more contemporary and downed earth casual shit and stylistic

1166
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:37,100
Drawings that's what I would love to have like a vlog of of of uh hippo and munchie going on a london art hop

1167
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:42,140
Actually, that reminds me back in me and digi's trip to atlanta me and ben

1168
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:48,380
We were we were walking down that one like hipster street and we just started like rating every painting and mural

1169
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:52,300
We saw out of five and then sometimes we said out of seven and out of 12 sometimes

1170
01:27:52,780 --> 01:28:00,380
And we just thought this should be a show of just the two of us go to like anything and rate the aesthetics of everything ever

1171
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:05,820
Davoo, you and I have such different have like such different uh aesthetics

1172
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:11,420
Consideration we have just have we just value. I think we value very different things. So I think that would be interesting

1173
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,380
right

1174
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:17,180
Yeah, so well next next time make it so team make it so

1175
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:21,740
Okay, and with that I think it's finally time to delete this pie. Yeah

1176
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:29,660
All right. This has all been a postmodern experiment in art that no one will ever see we actually wasn't we weren't recording any of this

1177
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:36,780
Postmodern way to do a podcast is just have a fucking link to a zip file of all of the audacity projects

1178
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:39,020
And not even converted to wabs yet, right?

1179
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:45,980
I think it's even most partners to send a screenshot of all the audio files in a folder and not give them access to it

1180
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:47,580
Yeah

1181
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:49,580
Oh, oh, oh, okay

1182
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:54,060
Uh, okay, okay, my favorite thing that I this is the last thing I promise the last thing the best thing

1183
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:59,340
I saw that instrued contemporary art, which I don't remember the name of which I think it's called my best thing

1184
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:03,820
But it was this like like like like multi series episodic

1185
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:09,580
Adventure, I would say recreate in some sort of like text-to-speech and like like go anime

1186
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:15,900
But 3d miles a little like roblox. It was some sort of like like like put directly into that to make these

1187
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:22,220
Text-to-speech robot speak things and it was a conversation that happened in real life

1188
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:25,900
Where an art teacher who was a female went on like porn sites

1189
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:32,140
Or or more accurately like like omegle chat roulette sites and had like philosophical insights with a horny

1190
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:37,980
Italian man with his dick out the entire time. Wow, and it was cool as fucking hell

1191
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:42,140
It was great. I think it's called my best thing 2011. I'm not sure though. Um

1192
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,820
That's great. I love it. I voted good shit

1193
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:51,900
The main segment of this episode's audio dialogue was

1194
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:59,580
Significantly edited and spaced out to the effect that you could generally hear what everyone has to say

1195
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:04,940
People who try to butt in but don't get an actual sentence in are simply muted

1196
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:10,540
they're their failed sentences aborted and deleted from the timeline and times where

1197
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:18,060
Three or four different people say something at once are actually spaced out to create sort of an artificial comedic timing

1198
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:26,460
I only did that for everything in the episode up to this point now that we're in the questions and fan stuff

1199
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:33,420
That's all gonna be much more freeform with much less editing just removing some of the noise not changing the timing of anything

1200
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:39,420
I guess let us know if you can notice and appreciate and value

1201
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:46,540
The difference because I'm interested in seeing how much better podcasts can be with this added effort

1202
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:51,500
But I'm not sure if its market value will result in a net profit

1203
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:53,660
All right

1204
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:55,260
Guys, let's get down to it here

1205
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,340
We got a couple of things to talk about real quick

1206
01:30:57,740 --> 01:31:02,380
As we as we recap the events since last week's episode number one on the agenda

1207
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:09,180
Let's talk about how radcon 3 arena iRL came out and it was a fucking triumph. Oh, yeah, and it was incredible

1208
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,980
Everyone loves it

1209
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:14,220
It was truly decadence truly delectable

1210
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:20,620
Uh, we had doubters out there. We proved them all wrong. There were doubters and now they are uh

1211
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:26,060
Down syndromeers. That's what they that's what happened to them. The doubters are

1212
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,460
Doubters

1213
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,220
That's you know, that would have been good that would have been good

1214
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:37,180
Uh, I don't know. I guess I just wanted to say that that was great

1215
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:43,420
Go watch it if you haven't already uh show notes. Watch the video. It's also like the last video on the channel

1216
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:48,300
It's great. Give edit it. It's incredible. I haven't been in the last couple episodes

1217
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,500
I don't know what's happening in the pcp sphere of influence

1218
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:58,620
But I know that the childhood episode has gone up which I was on and in which mage was some sort of gang warlord leader

1219
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,620
In the streets of south africa essentially

1220
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:04,220
That's that is what's happening now mage's role is actually

1221
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:09,500
We we continue that meme in the fighting episode mage is now the violent violence. That is her name

1222
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:15,500
Mage denies that she was the leader of the violent violence, but we think I just think she's trying to escape her war crimes

1223
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:18,220
But she needs to pay for what she's done. That sounds like something that the violent violence would say

1224
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,500
Yeah

1225
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,500
The violent violence like

1226
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:30,700
Addition to the canon is the best thing the pcp and its fandom has produced

1227
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,540
final

1228
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:38,460
Question final question. Have you ever seen mage and the violent violence in the same place at the same time?

1229
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:43,900
No proof positive. There we go. That if something is proven, then it's true

1230
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:49,900
If two things are both said then it's correct

1231
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,900
All right, well, I don't I have nothing else to say about that. So let's just

1232
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:08,460
I think yeah, I think we've exhausted yeah about the previous I am exhausted episode. I have some things to say

1233
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:14,780
Oh, okay. Yeah a lot of people all not all the people several people mentioned the little tension we had

1234
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,220
um

1235
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:20,780
And I I was sort of like somewhat indecisive but disagreeing with you

1236
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:28,780
But now I can firmly say I completely disagree with you after reading the comments. I I saw I saw the error in your ways

1237
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,740
I forget what was the argument?

1238
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,700
Should be allowed to

1239
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,700
Refuse service to people

1240
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:43,260
Yeah, that's right. I I I am for freedom of speech and freedom of expression, but I'm also for

1241
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,820
I'm also for

1242
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,820
um equal opportunity

1243
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,380
And like we were only focusing. Well, you're also

1244
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:58,060
Aren't you saying I mean a specific case was you can't compel people to do something if they don't choose to but you're arguing against that

1245
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:03,340
No, I'm I don't understand what's being argued here. It wasn't on the last day. All right. We were talking about um, yeah, it's

1246
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:07,980
You know, this is a fighting episode, by the way, very weird

1247
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,620
I missed but oh well

1248
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,380
Yeah, I I'd love to say about fine

1249
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,380
There's the possibility of like a town

1250
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:23,020
Where the there's just one walmart and it for some reason denies service to uh, everyone in the town

1251
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:30,300
And we were we were arguing like well, they are a company and they can choose to deny service to whoever they like

1252
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:33,900
Uh, but should the government force them to sell things?

1253
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:39,100
Oh, well on my position on this I can explain in 30 seconds is that in this reality?

1254
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:43,740
Yes, because we live in a world where this whole dream of freedom to choose what you want

1255
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:46,140
Is compromised in a million ways anyway

1256
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:52,060
Like yeah, there's a thousand laws that force companies to like have to conform to things that they shouldn't have to in a free country

1257
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:58,860
But there's a million laws forcing employees and consumers to conform to a bunch of things that they shouldn't have to do in a free country

1258
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,940
And if you only give the additional free if you only give back freedoms to companies

1259
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:08,380
You better at least be giving the same amount of freedoms back to consumers and workers, right the fucking

1260
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:14,620
The fucking structure of oppression and compromises on freedom in this culture is like a jenga statue

1261
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:18,940
And if you just take apart pieces of it haphazardly, it's gonna it's gonna crash

1262
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:21,660
I

1263
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:26,620
Couldn't tell what side you're on based on that good very fucking good

1264
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,820
You can't just decide what side I'm on you have to actually listen to me

1265
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,940
Basically what I want to say you can completely

1266
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:37,020
Compromise a person's livelihood because we were talking mostly about walmart

1267
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:42,060
But what about like public services like a bus can get you well that those are public those are government though

1268
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:48,380
That's a totally different situation kind of you know like no no no no no no no no no no completely untrue

1269
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:50,460
That is the opposite of

1270
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:54,620
It's a little it's a little hard to explain what it like public services. I think well here's the thing

1271
01:35:54,700 --> 01:36:00,620
Here's a thing where it actually gets and electricity and I think a better example than something like walmart

1272
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:05,980
The company would be something like google or the internet because that's like those are those are companies that are okay

1273
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,300
We should be clear right now

1274
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:14,060
These things are all publicly owned if you want to argue that they are effectively utilities and they should be treated that way legally

1275
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:17,180
Then fair enough, but that is not how they are right now

1276
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:23,740
Right should so you know it's relevant. It's relevant right and that's my point like should they be regulated as such

1277
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:28,140
I don't want to prolong this debate. I'm just saying that like I it's too late mage

1278
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,380
It's part two it's happening right now

1279
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,460
I wanted to make a harsh statement that I

1280
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,780
But straight up mage straight up mage

1281
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:40,300
If you if if a guy if you walk in and you want to get gay married and you walk into a cake shop

1282
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:44,620
As the as the as the thing goes and the guy says like sorry, but I don't make cakes for gay people

1283
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:47,980
Uh, like I mean it's against my religion. I think it's wrong. I have a sincere religious belief

1284
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:54,620
You think he should have to make that cake. Are you arguing for that? I said I said like all right like I said

1285
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,340
You're saying large corporations, right? Yeah. Yeah, basically that like I don't why does that matter? Why is it?

1286
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:04,140
There's a difference, but I said I don't want to like prolong this conversation. I just like

1287
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,620
Oh, I don't want to have to defend my beliefs. I just want to say them and now

1288
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,820
So I did say like there's a difference like you know, it's just a mom-and-pop shop

1289
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:19,260
It's just it just it's just that one shop in one area. No one really cares like if it goes under or not

1290
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:22,780
It's not gonna affect the economy or the people's livelihood or whatever

1291
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:28,300
But like if walmart all all of walmart decides to not sell to a certain demographic of people

1292
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,900
Well, that's gonna like screw stuff up like for instance where I live

1293
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:37,100
There's only like one as the store in the whole region and otherwise I'd have to like maybe like

1294
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:40,140
I don't know take a bus to a different town to get like food

1295
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:45,180
And what's really convenient about asda is that it's a 24 seven asda

1296
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:50,380
So if at midnight I I suddenly realize oh, I'm out of food because my sleep schedule is awful

1297
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:53,100
I can just go to house and buy some food and but like

1298
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:58,540
I wouldn't be able to do that if they decide to not sell to lefie unions anymore, you know, so

1299
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,540
So so the absolute rebuttal to that would be oh

1300
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:08,540
So people have to be controlled by law because they're so successful like um, oh, oh specifically

1301
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:13,340
There's this one uh documentary called fathead, which is a response to supersize me that brings up

1302
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:16,780
It it depends on it doesn't say mcdonalds is a good company

1303
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:23,180
But it sort of rebutts a lot of the complaints one of the criticisms of mcdonalds back when they had played places prominently

1304
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:29,420
They would argue that it's the it's manipulating children and families into eating unhealthy food and giving them money because they have

1305
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:35,820
A you know recreational activity for kids and some kids don't have access to recreational activities otherwise

1306
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:41,260
So it's manipulating their it's exploiting their needs to which the the fathead documentary says well

1307
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:44,380
The federal government didn't give those kids a play place

1308
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:47,020
The local government didn't give those kids a playground

1309
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:53,420
Ronald mcdonalds did and ronald mcdonald is to be seen as evil for being the only one who gave them one, right?

1310
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:57,180
So you can say similarly like oh because walmart is successful

1311
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:01,260
It now has to get fucked over it's similar just it's similar to like oh this happens in fucking

1312
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:06,060
Right well this happens in iron man two basically where the government's like, you know, tony stark

1313
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:11,420
You've made such good inventions that you don't any longer gets to own them, right?

1314
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:14,300
Now my rebuttal to that would be i get to to a degree

1315
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:21,020
What if an inventor just invents a doomsday weapon like okay, right now we can have a conversation which effectively is what tony stark

1316
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:25,180
Is not so so my feeling on that is because I very much feel in my in

1317
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:28,220
Let's admit the philosophy of iron. Yeah in my yeah

1318
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:31,900
The philosophy of tony stark 15 minute video, right? So

1319
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:36,140
My fucking I feel the libertarianism in my very veins

1320
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:41,580
I feel that like, you know, like you shouldn't be penalized for obtaining power and success

1321
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:49,020
But then I have to remember, you know, there's a reason why we came up with this whole freedom and uh like free economy and capitalism and

1322
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:52,860
And freedom from the government in the first place, right? It was because

1323
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,100
governments

1324
01:39:55,100 --> 01:40:00,540
Also got too successful and powerful like we didn't even really have this whole like freedom

1325
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:09,740
Thing be a thing until around a certain point of colonialism when governments became so big and bloated that they started becoming a real obvious problem

1326
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:16,780
And we were able to identify how we could do things better and at this point the concept of the corporation is becoming very similar

1327
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:21,740
They're becoming these international fucking nations unto themselves often with more gdp

1328
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:27,340
So like, you know, maybe it's time to update our philosophy on what's right and wrong because 500 years ago

1329
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:31,340
Nobody probably thought that it like the idea of a nation telling you what to do was wrong

1330
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:33,500
We had to invent that idea, right?

1331
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:39,980
And it was it's not has nothing to do with like the fact that one type of entity makes laws and the other type of entity makes profits

1332
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,300
It all comes down to one thing

1333
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:50,060
Control being conglomerated in a couple of people who have the power and the ability to to control other people

1334
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:58,380
Yeah, yep, generally. I agree. That's it's not it's not as black and white as either of us. We're saying

1335
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,460
And I'm aware of that too

1336
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:09,820
Uh on fighting one time I was six and in like

1337
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:13,900
Well not six. I'm more like it was eight and I was in the fourth grade

1338
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:20,380
And uh some high school junior tried to come up to me and fuck with me and I literally beat the shit out of him

1339
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:28,140
I'm gonna say one time one time. No, no, no, no. We are not going into fighting. That was last episode. God damn it

1340
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:32,940
This is not a rehash of the entire fucking fighting. I'm gonna show up to the episode if you want to be on it

1341
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:35,660
All right, but that being said if you want to tell one thing

1342
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:46,060
In my neighborhood it was like super lame and insecure and would be a huge whiny butt and I'd make fun of him

1343
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,860
But like not like a I don't think it too much of a bullying

1344
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:54,140
We I would just point out how pathetic he's being and he took like military class and judo and shit

1345
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:59,980
That was just wrestling and like, you know like okay you versus you okay now you versus you

1346
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,500
So it was me versus him and I don't have any fighting skills or athleticism

1347
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:06,140
I'm like five inches taller than him three years older than him

1348
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:09,740
He just like pulls me over and like throws me like just suplexes me onto my back

1349
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:12,540
And it didn't even hurt. It was on the grass, but I'm like

1350
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:18,780
Okay, cool. You've turned your fucking like impotent rage into something something somewhat potent. Good job

1351
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:21,100
But you did it you have some respect now

1352
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:26,940
Okay, okay. All right. Well good. Nate you are you are an egg. You are like

1353
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:32,300
You're you're an egg and you've got like a marker and you drew on the on the shell like angry eyes

1354
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:37,900
You got this hard out of shell and you're like, yes, I'm very tough and and then as soon as anything happens to you

1355
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,380
You're so soft. You're such a

1356
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:47,500
I'm okay with it. No, no, I'm a hard boiled egg. I'm tough inside. I'm resilient as well

1357
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:52,460
Yeah, nothing's nothing's harder and more and more resistant to damage than a hard boiled egg

1358
01:42:53,900 --> 01:43:00,300
Art people draw draw Nate as an egg. That's the new art thing. Yeah. All right. That sounds good. That sounds good. Uh

1359
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,420
Yeah, I'll make you girl

1360
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,100
Okay, funny side up

1361
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:12,380
Our document tells us that the next section is the question section

1362
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:15,340
It's a goddamn question

1363
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,900
Are the corporation co

1364
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:20,860
Policy mandates

1365
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:30,460
Way to office skate responsibility, mr. Bestman. Well, listen to this one uh at suck on my big pee pee

1366
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:40,460
All right, here we go prostate massage. Yes or no sure why not next

1367
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,380
I'll take two

1368
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:53,580
Well, uh, uh, there's a question here about i g tv. Do we want to go? Okay?

1369
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:57,980
I want to just point out my my answer on prostate massages is that they are uncomfortable

1370
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:02,540
But pretty relaxing if you're comfortable with the person doing it. Oh, well, there we go

1371
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:10,380
Is that

1372
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,260
Um

1373
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:19,580
Okay, you know, I'm not going to read this question about i g tv because I think we're going to talk about that later on

1374
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:25,180
Uh, or like next week or something. Okay that uh fucking questions bar. Who's got one? I'm going to go pull one up

1375
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,500
What do you got for us?

1376
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:32,540
Um, none of them are worthy. Why do we do this if there are no worthy questions?

1377
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:35,660
Um, well that you know why it's because you guys told them that art was the subject

1378
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:39,420
This is what you get this is what you get when you when you mentioned that the topic is going to be art

1379
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:42,860
That all the questions are boring. Shit. We've already answered in the fucking episode

1380
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,580
Oh

1381
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:49,340
No, yeah, what what does this have to do with art modern?

1382
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:57,340
They literally have postmodern sonic games remember that that weird one

1383
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:05,100
That is a postmodern sonic game. Oh, shit. Yeah sonic dreams collection. Fuck

1384
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:08,380
I like modern sonic you go in 3d

1385
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:10,940
You go really fast. Well

1386
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:15,740
I guess sonic mania is actually it is classic sonic by form

1387
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:20,380
It is just the latest the latest one. Yes, you know, so that's this good. I liked it

1388
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:24,700
Uh modern's uh martin sonic versus classic sonic is not interesting

1389
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:31,340
But what is interesting is classic mickey mouse versus modern mickey mouse and I actually have a very hard line opinion with this

1390
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:33,740
uh most okay

1391
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:41,420
Classic mickey mouse actually had a revival recently in the form of the modern disney channel on youtube mickey mouse shorts

1392
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:44,380
And everyone praises those because they are quite good

1393
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:49,740
But I actually do not like the art style because I feel like it is disingenuous to pretend that mickey mouse is not

1394
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:53,180
The modern mickey mouse and to go back on it is just jarred me

1395
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:57,340
But I saw on toontown. I cannot find any photographic evidence of this

1396
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:59,900
So you just have to pretend what I'm saying is true

1397
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:05,500
But in toontown at disneyland. There is a there's a lineup of characters

1398
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:09,980
There was a mural on a wall that depicts the gang mickey goofy donald

1399
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:18,060
Pluto and danger dolin and they are all there and they are actually a combination of the colors of modern

1400
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:20,540
Uh, the modern incarnation of the character

1401
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:26,940
But with the designs of the previous ones except the skin tone the skin that's like that's like in

1402
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,940
White so they just are white and that is the best that is the best interpretation

1403
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:35,340
Final mix how sore gets a new form called the uh limit form

1404
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,300
Which is when he gets a cool color scheme from kingdom hearts one

1405
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:42,540
It was awesome thinking of kingdom hearts too. Remember how mickey looks like fucking shit

1406
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:50,460
Here's here's my posh that right for metal gear solid right metal gear solid one is

1407
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:57,100
Modern metal gear solid metal gear solid two is postmodern mgs postmodern and mgs three

1408
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:01,580
Is classic mgs. It's it just like did it in the opposite timeline or reverse order

1409
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:07,660
Metal gear solid two is proof that postmodern art is not all bad or anything. It is uh, like the best game ever made

1410
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:11,820
A classic postmodern it should be a meme that you can apply to everything

1411
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:16,700
Yes, yes, absolutely. This question by the way about modern or classic sounding was from j hawk dx

1412
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:19,500
Just just just what he really needs the the exposure

1413
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:23,580
I know right guys. Who what's mickey? Do you like better?

1414
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,580
I don't like

1415
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:28,700
It's gotta be

1416
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,260
No, no, no when you say classic beam boat willy. I'm talking steam boat willy

1417
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:36,780
The mickey that did not have the hairline, but it had the eyes

1418
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:42,140
giant eyes like this like like like fucking stony interesting a comparison

1419
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:48,620
Look look at this straight up rat. He looks great. He looks sick. I like he's got pac-mans

1420
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:53,180
No, no, I'm not saying the pupils. I'm saying look. Yeah. Yeah. He's got the sonic

1421
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:59,820
One eye with two pupils thing going on. Is that what you're talking about now? I get it now. I understand where sonic comes from

1422
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:04,460
Yeah, by the way, uh, wait, there was another question here. What the fuck did it go?

1423
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:08,780
Uh, it was something about shit whose question was that wait. I got it

1424
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,020
Where the fuck did it go?

1425
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:16,540
Hashtag up with victor. There it is. Why is the group piss the greatest example of modern art in human history?

1426
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:22,060
Let's just dissect the art that is the group piss. Uh, it was good. That's all I have to say. Yeah, that's it

1427
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:26,700
It was my invention

1428
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:31,820
Actually, as we know the curation is the ultimate form of art and it was literally my idea to film it

1429
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:39,100
Therefore I deserve 100 of the credit for doing so disgusting get banned. You are banned from the pcp

1430
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:45,500
That's my favorite part of the group piss is that we all created our own art pieces in the snow

1431
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:50,700
That's true. That's true. It's like a time these are the rest of these questions

1432
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:53,900
These are all bad. These are all bad questions

1433
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:02,860
Okay, if you want to buy a yellow poon, do you guys think becoming mainstream is inherently damaging to the original vision of a product?

1434
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:08,380
Maybe not inherent, you know, it's not inherent, you know, it's art

1435
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:14,700
You know, it's arch that mage just had to read the words yellow poon, uh unironically and is

1436
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:23,260
Uh, you know, that's just what what a world what a world? Yeah, there it is. That's gonna come back to haunt you someday

1437
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:27,820
What was the other question? Hold on actually

1438
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:31,020
I do want to say like I forgot to answer that one, right?

1439
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:36,140
I mean there is a cracked article like six artists who became famous after they sold out, right?

1440
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:39,420
Like it was like became good including the Beatles

1441
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:43,740
They originally were much more punk before they were reigned in for having identical hairstyles and stuff

1442
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:48,060
And also I think the ultimate example is that Michelangelo

1443
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:54,780
Didn't want to paint he preferred sculpting and the church kept roping it back in to keep painting. He's like fine

1444
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:57,020
I'll paint your goddamn ceiling

1445
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:02,300
So there you go. I what if my art form is a crewing currency?

1446
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:04,860
What if that is my art?

1447
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:08,540
I think I have to draw the line on what's hard at some point

1448
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,940
I think like

1449
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,940
when once they are popular

1450
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:16,300
The greatest artists of all time George Soros

1451
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:21,260
I think when you're popular there's a pressure to keep doing what you're doing and less experimenting so like

1452
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:30,060
You could potentially but it depends on how well you do under pressure and like you have to balance the pressure and your own vision

1453
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:35,900
That's true. You have to make sure that when you get popular you're getting popular doing something you actually want to do for a long time

1454
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:38,540
If you get popular doing something you hate you're fucked

1455
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:43,980
This guy may be talking from the lens of like a series of like video games like

1456
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:49,580
The first one was small, but then it gets big and and it changes as it goes along

1457
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:55,500
Then they changed like like because like there's no way the original vision of a part of like if a project

1458
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:57,740
Sorry, um exists

1459
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:03,020
And and then it becomes mainstream. It hasn't changed at all. It's just like people's perception of it

1460
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:05,260
and I and to

1461
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:11,740
And to tom's point like he got popular, you know doing like the pony videos that he from his own words hated doing

1462
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:18,300
So like that's no fucking good. Uh, you know, that's not gonna last and uh, and it didn't so there you go the second question

1463
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,020
Tom

1464
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:27,020
Fuck sometimes you can really trigger 2013 memories in me, man

1465
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:33,020
Um, I got nothing else to say about anything. Oh, major. What's your other question?

1466
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:35,020
Uh, uh

1467
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:38,380
Bitter for bitter bitter thorn

1468
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:42,940
Yeah, if you had to choose between being deaf or being blind for one month, which would you pick?

1469
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:50,380
Oh for one month. Oh, all right. Oh, um, that's a softball version of this question. Yeah. Oh, I like this one much more

1470
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:52,220
um

1471
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:58,700
Well, uh, having been deaf kind of in one ear for more than a month. I would definitely pick being blind

1472
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:03,660
Because but what about the devil, you know, you know might be better than the devil

1473
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:07,180
You don't know. I choose death for sure. Just because I I choose death. I just want to be dead for one

1474
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:08,620
That's what I would go with

1475
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:14,540
No, I'll choose blindness because um, I have musical talents that I can use to entertain myself and

1476
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:18,380
People will do things for me because there's no way I could do things by myself

1477
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:23,420
I mean, I choose I choose death for the exact same reason because if I was deaf, I could still draw

1478
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:25,420
But if I was blind exactly same, right

1479
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,780
Yeah, exactly. So like I would I would pick death because I could work on like

1480
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:33,580
Yeah, I could work on shit for a while if I was blind. I couldn't I couldn't make a video if I was deaf

1481
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:38,380
All right, I mean that's a tough one. That's a blessing in disguise. Fuck making videos. It's gay

1482
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:38,860
True

1483
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:42,780
I probably do use visual stuff significantly more than audio

1484
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:44,220
But like i'm thinking of myself right now

1485
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:47,100
I like when it comes to work like like vision would probably be the more important one

1486
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:52,380
But when I when I think about like what would the world be like to me if I was either deaf or blind

1487
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:57,020
And I'm just like what would make the work like I'm thinking about the nightmare of living through a month without this thing

1488
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:02,540
That I've had my whole life and I think not having sight would be more bearable than not having audio

1489
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:05,420
Yeah, I don't know what I mean. Yeah, because hippo you have a whole big song

1490
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:10,300
I mean, hippo has a lot of he he makes the case that that being uh death would be more

1491
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:16,300
I can't listen to my ASMR if I don't have hearing. I can't do it. I have I can't because your brain is accustomed to hearing

1492
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:19,980
24 seven your eyes are accustomed to sometimes not seeing yeah being deaf

1493
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:23,180
We take something away that you're much more used to I would agree

1494
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:25,660
It's just I'd also like to get shit done in that month

1495
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:31,740
Also, I've heard rush Limbaugh said that being deaf will piss people off because people can't relate to that fact

1496
01:53:31,740 --> 01:53:35,580
Like if you can't see it's easy for people to figure out what you're not getting

1497
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:40,060
But if you can't hear especially if you can barely hear because you have implants

1498
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:43,900
People are going to get pissed off that you can't ever like understand them properly

1499
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:46,300
Well, I don't interact with anyone

1500
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,700
So it's fine

1501
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:54,460
Exactly, you know, I can test this but it's so fucked up the one acceptable form of bullying is against deaf people

1502
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:57,580
One day. Well, we'll get over that that hurdle but for now

1503
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:01,500
Fuck you if you're deaf. You can't even hear what I'm saying asshole. Oh, I see

1504
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:04,300
Got him. I mean, that's that's funny

1505
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:10,620
Um, no, I I love you. Uh, anyway

1506
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:13,740
Wait, I think that's

1507
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:18,300
I think we're no, I think we're done with questions

1508
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:22,860
I don't I'm not even sure why you were directing that. Is that a me?

1509
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:26,140
Uh, well

1510
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:32,380
I I choose not to comment. All right, moving on moving on

1511
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:39,580
It's time team for the pcp theme contest. Everybody's favorite part of the week. Oh, it's time to get right the fuck

1512
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:46,220
How many have this right? Let me let me count real quick. Correct. Uh, sorry. What was that mage? Was that mage, right? Yeah

1513
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:49,900
Oh, yeah, that's right. We're doing the fan art last. That's true. Which we we've got some good ones

1514
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:56,060
Uh, let me just count real quick about one two three four five six seven entries. Oh my god

1515
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:59,820
Boy, so let me all right. Let me see if this works in the easy way here. All right

1516
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:02,780
Let me I'm just gonna fucking do the bot here. All right. Let's see. I'm gonna play right now

1517
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:08,300
Let's see if this fucking thing works this one that I'm I'm linking is from at alien observer

1518
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:12,700
All right, give me a sec to make sure this works play. All right. Here we go indeed

1519
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:18,780
Oh, okay, that did not work. Let me let me fix this. I gotta get it from the actual thing

1520
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:22,380
Nope, stop. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Uh, and here we go

1521
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:25,900
Play

1522
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:32,940
I can barely hear it. Yeah

1523
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,540
boring

1524
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:36,540
Right right click on rhythm and turn up the volume

1525
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:41,260
Whoa

1526
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:51,420
Is this a real one or is this like ripped off from somebody it feels like two pro, you know

1527
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:01,020
Uh, wait, wow, I heard me. Oh shit. Yeah, why are you talking? We can't hear you

1528
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:07,660
Whoa

1529
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:13,740
All right, this is pretty great. Yes, this is nuts

1530
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:17,340
All right feel like well bear is now

1531
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:20,060
Damn

1532
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:22,060
all those game drops

1533
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:23,980
Um

1534
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:30,540
Dude, well, it's funny. I didn't know that anyone that fucking low register watched us. That's cool

1535
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:36,620
Was that was that fucking blowing out the mic for all you guys too? Was that like clipped as fuck or was that just

1536
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:39,180
No, no, that was

1537
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:45,580
That is pretty impressive. But yeah, I'll listen to it again. We should I mean damn

1538
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:48,380
Okay, we should because I could not understand anything

1539
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:55,020
All right, that was like the most well produced one. I think we've got I feel like some rad con four like like montage

1540
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:58,460
Of us like slow walking together could be said to that, you know, yeah

1541
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:04,460
Oh, totally dude. Yeah, by the way, this is akazi on soundclad dude. It was fucking sick. I can tell you put a ton of work into it

1542
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:08,700
Oh

1543
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:11,020
As opposed to the

1544
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:17,020
Um, I mean, I feel bad like I don't really think it works as like an intro or anything

1545
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:18,700
But I really liked it

1546
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:22,140
Ben that I could hear that fucking shit. Turn it down. God damn it

1547
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:29,900
Yeah, Ben. Are you retarded? You can't play music out of your soaker when you're recording through your microphone

1548
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:32,700
I think you have brain damage. This might be the best one yet

1549
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:40,380
I supremely disagree, but I need to explain explain yourself explain. Yeah, well, I guess I I guess we haven't

1550
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:46,780
It is like the best produce. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me let out my case. It's the best produced and it's specific

1551
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:49,260
and it's high energy

1552
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:53,820
I mean, you're not wrong. It's got like all the things that we want going for it

1553
01:57:54,940 --> 01:58:01,180
I gotta be honest. It's it's the vibe. It's the vibe that I yeah, no, like I don't think of it as high energy

1554
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:07,260
I think of it more as like chill energy and I don't know. I'm not like against I'm not against chill

1555
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:12,860
I'm not against chill by the way, but it doesn't have a melody like it doesn't have a catchy melody

1556
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:19,740
Uh, and I also like I'm I'm any any theme is going to probably lose a bunch of points if it has vocals at all

1557
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:21,820
I think something just

1558
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:25,740
There's there's disagreement there's disagreement

1559
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:30,300
Yeah, and then even within that category, you're almost certainly going to lose a lot of points for me as to

1560
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:32,460
An intro would actually want to have if it's like

1561
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:39,340
Like the lyrics are like explicitly referencing what the pcp is and name dropping it like I mean the worst is if it

1562
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:42,140
That is good. I like that

1563
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,780
I mean, I'm gonna respectfully

1564
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:50,780
Like no, I totally get the idea that like a theme song references the people. I get it my tastes. I don't like that at all

1565
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:53,820
I just heard like lyrics that I would prefer

1566
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:59,660
All of my favorite theme songs are theme songs that don't directly say what the fuck the show is

1567
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:03,580
But kind of abstractly say it like a cruel angel's thesis or the south park opening

1568
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:09,100
Look, we're not okay, not gonna take you back to the past. This is me

1569
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,500
I'm gonna say baby galeon

1570
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:14,060
I am

1571
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:22,220
It is too late it is too late in the game for us to like grab a song

1572
01:59:22,540 --> 01:59:26,540
That will become like indelibly linked to us and like an iconic piece of piece

1573
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:31,820
I just agree. It's all about whether or not we lose it for you. We've already had 8 000 episodes without the song

1574
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:36,940
Uh, I just don't I think it would be I think that's too much to hope for that

1575
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:40,620
We find like the perfect okay, I don't I don't even care whatever the point

1576
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:47,180
I mean like you know what it's it's kind of a cruel angel's thesis to say this but fucking pro crastinator by endless jess

1577
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:52,060
Already basically did this like it's it's more in line with what I say what I'm saying here, right?

1578
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:54,060
All right

1579
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:58,860
Audience I just want to say in last episode. I just want to say audience don't

1580
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:04,940
Bend once to discourage you from making a classic pcp theme. I say no if the song is great

1581
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:07,020
It will become classic. I

1582
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:12,700
Okay, um, I think that this is very very good and I like it a lot

1583
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:18,620
But I kind of agree that the endless jess theme is very like yeah, that's that's us

1584
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:26,220
So why not how about here's the thing take the melody from that and turn it into whatever thing you're doing

1585
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:29,020
What I

1586
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:31,100
Turn the melody of like don't

1587
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:37,660
Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't and make it more like that but like like faster and better and gooder

1588
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:43,980
What's the point of that

1589
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:47,740
Because it's it's the melody that people recognize

1590
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:56,700
Yeah, we get the same melody with a better vibe maybe but I want to ask about what jessy thinks of that

1591
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:04,860
He gave it to us. He can't indian give it away. Oh my god

1592
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:09,500
I want to hear what people interpret us as and like

1593
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:15,820
I mean, it's worth a shot. I mean, I I think this is way more fun having people just like don't you think it's a little

1594
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:20,380
Late in the game to like start putting like stipulations on what is or isn't acceptable

1595
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:26,140
It's just about what we like. Yeah, that's right. That's right

1596
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:32,780
Every single time this section of the show comes up everyone debates if it's a good section or not if it has called

1597
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:35,420
What are the rules?

1598
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:41,740
I feel so bad for heroes like akazi who have slaved away and worked really hard on something and this is good

1599
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:44,940
This is a clusterfuck of a

1600
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:54,380
Really bullshit isn't it everyone shut up. We know we know this segment is a clusterfuck. We know okay. We know right

1601
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:56,460
I like that. I

1602
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:58,460
Nothing I have ever said

1603
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:01,900
On this segment. Do I intend it to be a hard and fast rule in my mind?

1604
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:08,940
Like it's all like suggestions, but like I will upvote whatever I think truly deserves it and it can break all the rules

1605
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:13,260
I've stipulated. All right. He just here's what's going to happen. There will be a time

1606
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:17,340
I think we established that the cutoff for the themes was I think the end of july. Is that what we said, tom?

1607
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:19,420
Yeah, really? Oh, shit. This is doomed

1608
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:23,820
So we said the july you say it's doomed, but we've already gotten good. Okay, whatever. It doesn't matter

1609
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:27,660
The point is by the july 31st is the cutoff date at that time

1610
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:33,900
We're done and we will go through all of these and we will pick our favorites and we'll decide what's best

1611
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:37,660
And then we maybe we'll do a final round or something. We will figure it out

1612
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:41,820
We'll just take it all covers and we're trying to we're this is us trying to do our best to give you

1613
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:45,900
The tools to make something that we will accept. That's I mean, that's how I'm thinking about it

1614
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:51,900
So, you know, fuck it. We got we got like six more to go akazi. Great job. This was awesome, uh, but band

1615
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:57,020
All right, peace to be themed. All right, where the fuck is this, right?

1616
02:02:58,060 --> 02:03:02,700
Okay, this next one, uh, give me a second. This is from um, oh wait, this is a meme one

1617
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:07,900
Okay, this one will not be accepted. Should I even play it? Should I even play it? Well, I don't know. I don't know until I've heard it

1618
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:13,580
Well, I guess we better play it then and find out. All right, let's uh, here we go, uh, play

1619
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:18,300
A go it's gonna be retarded

1620
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:22,540
Wait a minute

1621
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:27,420
Oh, wait a minute. It's it's okay. It is it is

1622
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:30,060
Windows stop stop stop

1623
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:39,340
Stop this needs to stop right now. Okay. Okay. Stop. Um, it is windows xp startup sound one million times ear rape warning

1624
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:43,020
That's what that was. All right. I forgive me for what's going on. Yeah

1625
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:45,820
Next I don't know why that was even the question

1626
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:51,020
I I think there was put there's a meme and I should have known better. All right, so here we go. This is another one

1627
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:54,620
All those years on fortune still can't see it coming

1628
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:58,380
Okay, our next one is from a

1629
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:00,380
Excelular or at cx

1630
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:04,620
7001. All right, this is called uh, welcome to the pcp dimension

1631
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:10,700
Here we go fucking play right now go

1632
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:17,900
Oh wait, I think I have to oh, okay. Sorry. I have to skip you really you really forked it. Hang on. Hang on

1633
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:21,020
Here we go. Come on. She shut up play

1634
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:45,980
That's it. I want that to go on for longer. That was the intro to a theme

1635
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:50,140
No, yeah, wasn't that used before somewhere? I thought it was no no no

1636
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:54,380
I mean like it feels like the intro to a drop that doesn't happen, but I do

1637
02:04:59,020 --> 02:05:01,660
I would say it isn't really appropriate as what we want

1638
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:07,340
But personally if I was in charge of a podcast, I would find that so fucking funny and how inappropriate it is

1639
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:08,300
I would vote for it

1640
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:12,780
Didn't you just get finished saying that a thing can break all the rules, but if you like it you'll still support it

1641
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:16,540
Well, the hero for the fucking thing it breaks. That was one of the rules. That's what I'm saying

1642
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:22,060
Dude, Ben. That's literally what I'm saying. I'm saying it's so fucking funny and how inappropriate it is. I'll totally use it

1643
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:27,020
I would totally vote for it. I mean wait, but but it's just awesome guys. This is fucking awesome

1644
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:31,020
And it would be great. I would be I would be I would be happy to have this as our

1645
02:05:31,580 --> 02:05:36,700
Enter to our podcast. Well, I don't think it fits the tone of our show, but I do like it. Yes, it does

1646
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:43,020
Well, that's fine. Anyway, point is point is I'm still not super big on it because like what hippo said

1647
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:47,020
I was expecting something more so like if just if this dude could expand it to where after that

1648
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:50,940
It's like 30 seconds of like kick ass catchy techno

1649
02:05:56,060 --> 02:06:00,220
At the end of the vocals it kind of burst open into sort of a base drop and then that faded out

1650
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:04,460
Hold on. Ben. That's the reason I know 30 seconds is too long. I know 30 seconds is too long

1651
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:09,340
Here's the thing though 30 seconds that can then fade out to the podcast

1652
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:13,420
You see right because it would be an approach it would be weird if it like cuts out all at once

1653
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:18,620
And then we start talking you have it fade out as the talking begins and 30 seconds gives you enough leverage to use that

1654
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:20,940
You'll probably almost never hear the full 30 seconds though

1655
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:26,060
I mean, yeah, he's just saying to have like a buffer. Uh, okay, so he

1656
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:33,500
Let's just ask Teddy Lee. Let's call up. Uh, who's that? Who's that guy who just died that edm artist guy?

1657
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:36,140
Next all of them

1658
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:41,740
Yeah, let's call the skrillex. Okay. Here we go. Next one is from uh at sandisky

1659
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:45,900
This one is called a pcp songoo hashtag pcp theme

1660
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:53,580
The description says this one goes out to my homie. That's what it says. Uh, so let let let us play it now. Here we go

1661
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:00,060
Okay

1662
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:03,260
Yes

1663
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:06,460
Oh, there he is

1664
02:07:19,580 --> 02:07:21,580
Nice

1665
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:28,780
I do like I don't know if I like as much as the last one, but I do like it

1666
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:32,460
Yeah, I don't like it as much. I mean it's it's getting closer like it is it is melody focused

1667
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:39,660
But okay, the melody is just a little bit too goofy for me. Like it was kind of perfect for me. That would be my theme

1668
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:42,300
Yes

1669
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:48,940
What what if we each whoever was hosting the episode had their own piece? Oh god. I mean, all right. Let's let's not let's not open that door

1670
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:54,140
I mean, you know, we can each have a separate single for each of our character themes, right?

1671
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,980
It's like uh, there was there was a thing that the one piece episodes did

1672
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:02,060
Every one piece episode had like a break in the middle with a commercial break and during those breaks

1673
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:07,500
They would pick one of I think up to nine, uh, like the little uh intermediate tracks that would play

1674
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:13,100
That would be and all the all the members of the star had crew had like a little there would be an animation of them and their own theme

1675
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:18,460
And uh, uh, you would be like whoever was like most relevant to that episode generally would be like the person

1676
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:24,620
Here's what we do. Here. We have to change and evolve the the piece of people in contest. Here's what we do

1677
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:26,860
You now have to make nine separate

1678
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:33,500
From the character and they have to fit every leitmotif into one cohesive track that is both iconic

1679
02:08:33,740 --> 02:08:35,580
You have to do it. Yeah

1680
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:40,780
Just like my boy you need to have to be intelligent and nihilistic like so great and powerful

1681
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:45,260
Yeah, basically basically like condense s descend into like 30 seconds

1682
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:48,940
Yeah, please do that all of you you fools

1683
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:56,220
Uh, good work. Sorry. I don't appreciate that. All right. Next one's up is from at larkin loafin trap or arkin

1684
02:08:56,940 --> 02:09:01,980
This is what is this one? Just hashtag pcb theme entry. Okay. Here we go. Uh, let me fucking disconnect this

1685
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:04,460
Play and go. Here we go

1686
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:26,300
Oh

1687
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:28,860
Hey

1688
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:50,700
Oh my god, yeah

1689
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:52,460
Dude

1690
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:58,460
Guys, I know that I've been I've been pooping this entire idea and then I'm against it on every level

1691
02:09:58,620 --> 02:10:01,020
But that was kick ass. That was fucking

1692
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:07,260
Okay, oh my god. This is what we've been waiting for. This is what it's built to you all doubted me

1693
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:11,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to be a downer. It's not that it's not that I don't think that kicked ass

1694
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:13,020
But I do

1695
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:19,660
Kind of I do kind of mind that it does not reference like what the pcb actually is in any meaningful way

1696
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:27,820
Ruins your life. Oh, no, that's what's good. That's why it's good. The pcb is such a weird nebulous thing

1697
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:30,540
You're such a weird nebulous thing

1698
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:37,500
They've re-context like they just reference to dog pcb. Yeah, I like it. It's funny. I like it. It's funny. I do like it. I do like it. I do like it.

1699
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:44,140
Okay, but if we're talking about cons if we're talking pros and cons for me a big one big con of it is that it is not about

1700
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:46,940
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay, but but but

1701
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:51,180
Um, somebody sees like on youtube. There's this video

1702
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:58,780
PCP colon some random topic. I like going to think that with that intro that it's about drugs even if

1703
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:06,220
The drugs are not available. I think I know you guys have repeatedly brought up that you aren't really fond of the whole reference to drugs

1704
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,300
I think it is literally

1705
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:14,300
Negligible and just a funny goof and I don't think anyone's going to be confused. Oh my god a podcast called pcb

1706
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:19,020
Obviously, they're talking about this incredibly illegal dangerous drug. That must be what's going on here. No, you're right

1707
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:20,220
I don't think it's possible

1708
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:22,300
But I'd love to see if someone can somehow

1709
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:27,500
Abstractly not not like hammering in too much but tie it into the pcb from fucking bakuman

1710
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:32,620
But there is no bakuman opening theme because it could never be an anime. So I wouldn't even know

1711
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:39,180
You'll never have a good theme just like the pcb and bakuman because we'll never be an anime. We're too controversial

1712
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:41,820
I'm a total tangent here, but wouldn't it be cool?

1713
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:46,460
You guys if they made a bakuman ova where they just animated like all the series

1714
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:48,860
Oh my god, I would be so awesome

1715
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:54,220
I would not I want otters 11 right now. I was just gonna say I would pay so much money to see otters 11

1716
02:11:54,780 --> 02:12:00,940
Yeah, it's it's the best one by far. Um, well arcane. I mean needless to say, uh, incredible

1717
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:03,980
Yeah, I think that was the best one so far. I love it

1718
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:05,740
Amazing

1719
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:08,300
Don't fucking yon at me you piece of shit. Go to sleep

1720
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:10,940
Yeah, go to sleep fucking die

1721
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:27,820
Uh, okay, we got another one up. Uh, this one's from uh shit

1722
02:12:28,780 --> 02:12:30,300
Gavin Watkins

1723
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:36,940
Gavin, thank you the Gavin Watkins at yo, I'm hydra. So I guess he's also hydra. And here we go play immediately

1724
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:40,300
All right

1725
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:55,260
Oh, this is cute

1726
02:12:58,940 --> 02:13:00,940
Midi instruments, hell yes

1727
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:04,460
Oh, yeah, well an instrumental of an adventure time song

1728
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:08,220
I would say if I had to pick any of the ones that we've seen so far

1729
02:13:08,300 --> 02:13:12,620
I mean, okay, I would go for the the fucking dark island of nine souls one whatever the fuck that one was

1730
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:16,460
But like if I had to pick a normal one like that would be the one I picked like I'm not like

1731
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:22,060
Super great on it, but I'm assuming the person made this specifically reflecting all the things that I was saying

1732
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:26,620
I wanted in the theme and they tried their best. I mean like I don't think I could I mean I couldn't do any fucking better

1733
02:13:26,700 --> 02:13:30,700
So good job there again. I like I like it and it sounds good

1734
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:33,180
But it doesn't it doesn't strike me as

1735
02:13:33,820 --> 02:13:35,340
Right cp song

1736
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:40,140
Yeah, I mean either but like it's at least it's at least somewhat in the right direction that I want at least

1737
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:45,260
So like not that the tone is wrong or anything. It just it could be a song for a lot of things

1738
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:47,580
Yeah, it could be a song for a lot of things. Yeah

1739
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:51,660
I mean, I don't think it's necessarily a detour like the fucking dick show theme or even like

1740
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:57,900
John Tron's theme, right? It's become his because it's John Tron not because it's a super distinct song

1741
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:00,460
That's that's fair

1742
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:05,420
I remember I used to be pretty obsessed. I really wanted like a theme song and I kind of have one with well for me

1743
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:07,020
A map of I guess not really anymore

1744
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:11,100
Uh, uh, I wanted one that was like like John Tron's and like I knew this the whole time

1745
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:14,940
But really it was that like I wanted like to be

1746
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:19,660
Famous like John Tron and just have a theme song that like was associated with that

1747
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:21,900
It wasn't it wasn't like anything magical about the theme

1748
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:24,220
He just fucking grabbed it off of like Newgrounds music portal

1749
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:29,900
You told me that Ben and I spent like weeks hunting Newgrounds because I wanted to be like John Tron

1750
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:32,540
And like find a theme on there and like it's not bad

1751
02:14:33,020 --> 02:14:37,580
You can go in there like that's how I found the music for the the the champion game that I made

1752
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:39,660
I just went in there and I and I found a

1753
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:43,660
Artist who had like their music was in there and listed as like yes

1754
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:48,380
Anyone is allowed to use this music if you give credit. I was like, okay, sweet. That's so awesome. Yeah, it's fucking sick

1755
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:55,900
Uh, okay. Well, we got we got one more for this round and this is from uh on the youtube is leos enigma

1756
02:14:56,380 --> 02:14:58,380
It's called should be surfing

1757
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:02,060
TPC theme submissions should be surfing. Wait, what was there to let me get there?

1758
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:06,540
It was uh dog of power. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Here we go and begin

1759
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:18,300
I'm hearing a lot in my right channel. Yeah, not so much in the left

1760
02:15:26,860 --> 02:15:28,860
Oh

1761
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:33,820
Okay

1762
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:38,860
I'm not losing it leos you're losing them

1763
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:43,020
Hey

1764
02:15:43,020 --> 02:15:49,260
This is I mean, is there a lot of am I am I crazy or is there a lot of the same note over and over again?

1765
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:52,060
You're not wrong. You're not wrong

1766
02:15:52,140 --> 02:15:53,500
Uh

1767
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:56,460
Leos, uh, I think that was a little simplistic for what I'm looking for

1768
02:15:56,620 --> 02:16:02,300
Yeah, I mean, would would you blame me leos my hero my friend for for choosing one of these other god kings compared to

1769
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:05,180
I will say I offer it. I'm just kidding dude

1770
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:11,580
I do like in general the idea of a podcast intro that employs the aesthetic of a like

1771
02:16:11,820 --> 02:16:14,060
Juicily plucked stringed instrument

1772
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:18,460
But it would I wouldn't want it to be about like, you know unique notes being played like, you know

1773
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:25,260
Just a very simple but nice and just melody and also that that aesthetic would never work for a podcast with seven people on it

1774
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:30,300
Well, I don't mind what he was going for but I don't think the execution was quite there

1775
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:33,100
Uh, it was you know, he just he this guy plucked a guitar

1776
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:37,100
I mean, I I made demos of guitar stuff when I was practicing he plugged it in he recorded himself

1777

And you know, you didn't do anything else to it. So yeah, what's that one?

1778
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:45,500
What's that one fucking improvised like 10 second guitar thing by the guitarist from red hot chili peppers

1779
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:50,220
It's just like it's just like really good 10 seconds of guitar improv. It's so fucking good

1780
02:16:50,220 --> 02:16:55,820
I'd put it on a podcast even if the podcast was totally different. So be as good as the guy from red hot chili peppers

I don't know what you're saying. I can't don't worry about your words

1803
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:46,140
And and of course, uh, also did you there moving on?

1804
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:52,140
Next image, uh, before we okay, this is the one I wanted to point out, um

1805
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:55,500
I'll I'll put this in the fucking in the main chat here. Just so you can see it

1806
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:59,980
This one of just of ben living the alternative lifestyle

1807
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:03,340
Yeah, last week's episode

1808
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:06,540
Why didn't he add me with this?

1809
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:11,020
I he well, he just put it at the I mean because he listened to the episode obviously it's also ugly

1810
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:17,020
By the way, this is this is uh at ill die 314. Oh wait, maybe dude. Yeah, I would this is fucking

1811
02:19:17,660 --> 02:19:21,340
This is true or I would I would legit frame this. This is excellent

1812
02:19:22,140 --> 02:19:24,140
How he explains it

1813
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:31,260
Yes, it's because there's nothing going on here. That's what makes it beautiful. Yes. What does it mean to live the alternative?

1814
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:34,460
Indistinguishable

1815
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:40,220
Like the alternative lifestyle is pretty much defined by whatever it is that I do

1816
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:44,940
That's true and it gives gives right it means to lean against an invisible chair

1817
02:19:45,180 --> 02:19:47,180
That's what it means

1818
02:19:49,980 --> 02:19:53,740
It's because you're you're so poor you just have to pretend you have

1819
02:19:54,460 --> 02:20:00,700
A chair sitting in the first place and you your high tier it's fourth dimensional consciousness manifested out of nothing

1820
02:20:02,140 --> 02:20:04,140
In in crowd I'm proud of myself

1821
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:09,980
These are these are great. I love that one. Okay. Now we're getting into the themed section of our program here. Oh, yes

1822
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:12,780
All right guys, so we went we went just before oh my god

1823
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:21,260
The idea of the violent violence has uh has really taken off and a bunch of fan art has been drawn at our request of mage

1824
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:27,100
Slaying in vicious gang warfare and being the leader in a in a third tribe. We know she is

1825
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:31,100
post apocalypse a hellscape that is Lithuania

1826
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:38,460
Indeed, so I never knew that Lithuania was an extension of endless war, but apparently it definitely is it's definitely

1827
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:43,180
Okay, so look at this first one. So like corrupted purple slime leaked over there and shit went really bad

1828
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:47,180
Oh, yeah, too. Totally. Okay. So look at look at the first one. I like the links for art

1829
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:53,980
Okay, so this is I think the first one we got um already look at that jojo power pose mage. Yes her nail covered bat

1830
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:58,140
The so okay now if I'm reading this crap, so that's a very endless war right there

1831
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:04,860
With her light purple there. That's the violent violence versus the indigo interlopers or whatever the fuck we called him

1832
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:08,380
Uh, that that's the ones who were dead on the bottom. Am I wrong? Yes, is that right?

1833
02:21:08,940 --> 02:21:14,220
Man, I really really wish I'd been on the fighting podcast. It sounds like it was a great time

1834
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:18,300
God damn it and the tiger's oh

1835
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:24,700
Oh, so it was in the fighting episode where the whole mages violent thing took off and became its own lore. Oh, okay

1836
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:29,180
It's true. It's true. We went on like the discussions about mages like brutalities

1837
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:33,580
Well, that's good. The only one on the fighting podcast who actually fought

1838
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:36,140
It's true. It's true

1839
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:42,540
I'm glad that I finally fucking incited a good pcp meme by like at like bringing this up because I remember two years ago

1840
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:45,340
I was the one who fucking said she got about the yellow thing

1841
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:51,580
Well, isn't it tom who said literally the violent violence? I believe I did coin the term but mage was the one who gave it life

1842
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:59,340
So this one by links is my favorite pcp fan art ever. It's so dynamic. It's uh, I love mages pose here

1843
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:04,220
I absolutely love it. What's up with the tigers are tigers a thing?

1844
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:10,940
From the discussion. Yes. Uh, like yes, I said like that's the true actually listen back

1845
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:12,780
I'm not gonna

1846
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:18,220
Yeah, we don't want to ruin it for you here. Okay. You're really gonna experience in line. Right?

1847
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:19,980
If I was like

1848
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:21,500
Yeah, go ahead mage's uh

1849
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:27,500
Links's art is so good at like carefully controlled derpiness like the derpy look on mage's face in the center is perfect

1850
02:22:28,220 --> 02:22:30,620
Her incredible dominant pose. It's amazing

1851
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:35,820
And I just love how she's just so like plainly feminine as well with just like a plain

1852
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:38,380
A skirt

1853
02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:43,660
Yeah, it's very cute looks like a girl who like goes to school

1854
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:47,340
But then like on her way home from school. She picks up her bat and you know, yeah

1855
02:22:47,660 --> 02:22:52,300
Takes her tiger. It's it's like in the it's like in fucking like japanese mage and shit

1856
02:22:52,300 --> 02:22:56,300
Yeah, exactly. You've got just like cute girls who are all so badasses, you know, generally. Yeah

1857
02:22:57,020 --> 02:22:59,980
It's a good aesthetic. I love it. All right. Well, this one's a winner

1858
02:23:00,620 --> 02:23:05,580
Obviously, uh, way to fucking go links for art. This is the best one. Okay. Wait a minute. Maybe those are links

1859
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,660
Because this person's a links. I mean, I don't fucking

1860
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:11,180
Hard to say

1861
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:15,180
Okay, so the next one is from uh never paint. Uh, let me link it fucking here in the main thing

1862
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:27,020
This is this is also my new favorite pcp fan art of all

1863
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:34,140
Also, if you look at the pens, it's not very big. That's like drawn pretty small and they got all that detail. That's true. That's pretty impressive

1864
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:38,860
Excuse me. Um, but you did not use the correct the hexadecimal value for mage's artwork

1865
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:43,740
I would please like it if you would correct this. Oh, I am lethal aura mage. Please do not disrespect me

1866
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:49,420
That's right. You got it. You didn't go out and buy the hexadecimal pens that you can get correct hexadecimal value

1867
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:52,140
So there's a lot of details in this one and I think a lot of them are references

1868
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:56,300
Like I see a drug needle. I think and I remember her referencing drug needles in the childhood episode

1869
02:23:56,860 --> 02:23:59,420
Uh, oh shit. I didn't even know there's also what looks to be like

1870
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:05,180
There's a yo-yo on the ground or a prostitution house in the back skull vandalism skull graffiti over there

1871
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:09,740
Right, but there's also like there's also a building that has a flag out with like a heart

1872
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:14,620
I'm assuming it's like a whorehouse or maybe a warehouse or something. What's kind of presumptuous?

1873
02:24:15,340 --> 02:24:17,020
I don't know

1874
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:20,140
Yeah, as ben with his heart avatar obviously a prostitution

1875
02:24:20,140 --> 02:24:25,100
Yeah, please. No, no, no, quit heart shaming. But let's depart his fellow heart users

1876
02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:27,740
The stop sign that I threw stones at

1877
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:29,580
Oh

1878
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:31,580
Is that oh, yeah

1879
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:37,100
Is that is that a lithuanian stop sign though? Is that what they look like? I recognize it as a stop sign. Okay

1880
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:43,340
Oh, yeah, no, no. Yes. Okay, so sorry not a stop sign the sign, but it was a triangle. Sorry

1881
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:47,260
I I didn't mean it as I just I just got so excited about this

1882
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:52,460
I like you know, you know what that sign says it's got a black dot in the center a danger rocks will be thrown at this sign

1883
02:24:52,540 --> 02:24:54,780
Watch out. There's lots amazing. Um

1884
02:24:55,580 --> 02:25:00,300
Like both both never paint and links are on my fucking rolodex

1885
02:25:00,300 --> 02:25:06,460
If I want to go around shopping people to like hire commission people to do illustrations for something in some point in my career

1886
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:09,260
Like these people are top on my fucking list

1887
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:11,580
Fuck

1888
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:13,820
Yes

1889
02:25:14,380 --> 02:25:19,020
Very nuanced and it's in its references. There's so much going on there. I'm I'm I'm actually it's so dense

1890
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:23,340
There's so much going on. There's so much going on because I was for the shit like I never owned a yo-yo

1891
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:25,420
I always wanted a yo-yo

1892
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:27,580
Oh

1893
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:33,900
Fucking dope, dude. I just love how like it's all like it's fucking wrecked like all these. Yes. This is like wrecked buildings

1894
02:25:34,220 --> 02:25:36,220
It's so cool. This is urban

1895
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:42,700
It absolutely is. Uh, so okay. Next one is from our boy l1 cas lue with some underscores

We got the post cold war tigers more tiger memes excellent

1899

And I hope he doesn't feel bad that like we were taking him after the two like masterpiece arts like this is good

1900
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:03,180
Like, you know, I hope it doesn't feel too shown up. But like this is pretty cool

1901
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:09,500
The expression is really good. The expression is great. Yeah slames slames has like a very like rough like pen

1902
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:14,700
I quite like it a lot. He goes with the theme. I like how in the background it sort of looks like

1903
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:20,220
The pain's coming off sort of sort of that sort of look. Yeah. Oh, it's yeah

1904
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:26,300
Oh, it's a bit grungy look. Oh, it's it's yeah, it's a tiger. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Okay. I didn't notice that

1905
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:30,300
Those eyes are intense. It's fucking awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1906
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:35,340
He's using his photoshop skills. It's a great effect. It's beautiful. Beautiful. So true

1907
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:39,180
Well, I don't have much more to say about this. I love the the goofy city in the background

1908
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:42,460
But okay, and we I think we mage just posted this one in the thing

1909
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:47,260
Uh, they they always seem to roll in right around when we're recording. We get a bunch more. Well, they know we're recording

1910
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:53,660
It's time. Look at this one from at miski from miski. Miski's really good. And I fucking love this

1911
02:26:54,220 --> 02:26:57,420
Fucking solid snake mage urban warfare killer

1912
02:26:57,580 --> 02:26:59,420
She's just fucking

1913
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:01,900
Oh, shit. I was wondering if this was

1914
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:07,740
I just love how there's just oh, yeah, this like there's just so many different ways to interpret metal gear, right?

1915
02:27:07,740 --> 02:27:10,460
Like it's all the same concept. We have these videos all the same pocket

1916
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:17,020
Yeah, because at one point mage gets banned from her neighborhood and has to sneak around everywhere and hippo specifically said it's now metal gear

1917
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:19,340
And here it is

1918
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:23,100
Oh, shit. You know, I love it. I love the color. This is so good. I love how the

1919
