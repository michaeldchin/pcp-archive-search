00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey, welcome back to the Rowdyfuckers. It's been a while, but we're back and we're playing...

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,100
Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers!

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:23,200
Rowdyfuckers Cop Killers!

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:36,000
Hey, last time we played Frog Fractions and Tadpo, a commenter. I asked if anyone would buy me Frog Fractions 2, and they did.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,600
So, thank you, my friend. Thank you very much. And now we've got a goddamn... Wait, was it Tadpo? Oh my god.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,800
I might look it up later and confirm that I have that name right. Anyway, this is Frog Fractions 2, but not really,

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,600
because Frog Fractions 2 is actually hidden somewhere in Glittermint and Grove.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,400
So, this video, we're going to be Rowdyfucking... Rowdykilling some copfuckers.

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,100
Wow, I'm trying to search for the answer to the rawt of VK and Frog Fractions 2.

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,900
If we find Frog Fractions 2, then so be it.

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,400
But we can't have been oh well.

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,900
Yeah, it's really not.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,200
We're going to call this a Frog Fractions 2, regardless if we find it or not.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,700
Yeah, I mean, guaranteed. That's a guarantee. I knew that going into this.

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,900
Alright, I'm just going to start a new village.

16
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,800
What is Grythermint and Grove? What is this game?

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,600
It's a game where... Oh, Cosmic Field sounds good.

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,700
You play as a bunch of fairies. You're a bunch of fairies in a land.

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,700
And you have to build a fairy land.

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,800
And I think some trees are growing.

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I actually have no idea. I tried playing this before.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,900
I tried playing this before and I couldn't really figure it out.

23
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,100
I know that I need sparkles. I need to collect more sparkles.

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm going to build a house. I'm going to build a house in this little flowery tree right there.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Is this game an epic, funny joke like Frog Fractions or is it an actual video game that just happens to have Frog Fractions 2 in it?

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think this Grythermint and Grove is an actual game that you can just play if you want to.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, that's horrible.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,500
No, no, no! My house fell out of the tree.

29
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Here. That looks solid.

30
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:48,100
I wonder if maybe there were people out there that bought Grythermint and Grove just because it looked good

31
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,100
and never realized that Frog Fractions 2 lived inside of it.

32
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,100
If you bought Grythermint and Grove because you thought it looked good, get your fucking eyes checked and also get a lobotomy while you're at the doctor's office.

33
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,100
If you haven't gotten one already.

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
Get your shit together.

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Oh, welcome to Cosmic Field. The fairies need houses to sleep and you can build them in the tree tops. Okay, done.

36
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
Maybe I'll build one more?

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
Sure.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Try building a sight orb so you can see farther from the wagon.

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,700
Oh my god.

40
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
I'll put it over here. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,700
I'll build two. I'll put two sight orbs.

42
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
You know what? This actually looks kind of cool and I like it.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Yeah, same.

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,300
I was too hard shot at it the first day. I'm actually down.

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Yeah, don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a game by the way it looks and plays and feels.

46
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Yeah.

47
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,300
I'm going to turn this...

48
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,300
It matters if you decide you like it or not arbitrarily based on nothing.

49
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:54,300
Yeah, it's just what you feel in your heart and your heart is a fickle mistress, as they say.

50
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm going to turn you up and I'm going to turn the game volume down because it's drowning me out.

51
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,900
It's probably a good idea.

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,900
All this atmospheric harp music is just really cramping my style.

53
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,900
Hey, is it okay if Popeye's chicken sponsors, right?

54
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
Are you down with that?

55
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Oh my god.

56
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
You're down, bro.

57
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,900
I'm so fucking down with that.

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
When I was a little kid, I always liked to have Kentucky Fried Chicken because I thought it was good.

59
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
I just like Fried Chicken but then I realized Kentucky Fried Chicken was horrible.

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I've been itching for another fast food chicken place and I just didn't know that any others even fucking existed.

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,500
You know, Popeye's Chicken opened and it was a revolution.

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,500
You know, I've eaten nothing but KFC in terms of Fried Chicken.

63
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I only ever had KFC until very recently.

64
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
One time I had Popeye's.

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,100
One time I was traveling and there just happened to be a Popeye's so I got to experience it.

66
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
I was like, oh shit, this is really good.

67
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,100
But then never again until both Digi and Jackie both swear by...

68
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
What's the racist one?

69
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
What's the one that hates the game?

70
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Both Jengles?

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
No, no, no. The one that's Chick-fil-A.

72
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Chick-fil-A.

73
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
I hate Chick-fil-A too, so I'm down with that part.

74
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why I went.

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:24,700
All right, so it looks like my little fairy town is growing nicely.

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Now I think to find frog fractions too, I either have to go up into the sky and like grow my trees,

77
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,700
or I have to go down and like...

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,700
I think I have to use fireworks to explode the ground and like mine down into the earth to find frog fractions too.

79
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,700
I don't think that's what fireworks are used for, normally.

80
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,300
No, but well, who the fuck asked you?

81
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,300
What did you do for 4th of July speaking of fireworks?

82
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Well, I went out and saw some fireworks.

83
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Actually, actually, here in, well not in my town of Ackworth, but in Kennesaw,

84
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Kennesaw, Georgia, there was like...

85
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,300
I heard there was going to be like a fireworks show and I heard there's going to be like some shit,

86
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,300
there's going to be like a party or whatever, like a block party, and we went.

87
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:20,900
Me and Jackie went and there was a big, there was like a huge fucking street festival with like a big stage show.

88
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,900
There was like a big old stage show and it was fucking impressive.

89
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Did a powerful wizard come out onto the stage and show you his tricks?

90
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Tricks with an X instead of a K and a C?

91
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,900
I mean, I couldn't really see the stage, I couldn't see the stage because it was just a C, it was just a C of humanity.

92
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Yeah, same, same, it's pretty good, it's pretty good when the getting's good.

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Humanity, Dark Souls, this game is the, this game really is the Dark Souls of video games.

94
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
Trying to find frog factions too, and this...

95
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh wow, it's Dark Souls!

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,500
It's Dark Souls of fairies, it's the fairy of Dark Souls and you know,

97
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,100
I really wish that another fucking note...

98
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Oh, I was just wishing, I was just wishing for a little speech bubble to come and tell me what to do and now here one is.

99
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,100
Try planting a thimbleberry bush to grow more food for winter, the more sunlight it gets, the more fruit it'll grow.

100
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:29,100
This game knows its target demographic too well, to the point it's disgusting.

101
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Thimbleberry bush, here we go, I'll plant it right here in this nice little sunny, grassy knoll.

102
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,700
I actually stepped foot here and corrupted it with my seed.

103
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,700
Spread your seed, spreading your seed across this fairy land.

104
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,700
You're building too much to left, go to the right, you're gonna hit corruption that way.

105
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,700
I mean my goal is to go up, but yeah...

106
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Why did I build this thimbleberry, I've already got thimbleberries, I've got so many thimbleberries,

107
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,300
it's just outlandish, how many thimbleberries I have.

108
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Plant a hairy potter bush.

109
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,300
I only have thimbleberries, it's thimbleberry or nothing.

110
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Go to the store and buy a hairy potter.

111
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,300
I have to build a store, I have to build a store before I can...

112
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
Oh, a pantry, a woodshed.

113
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,300
Alright, well I've got wood, I've got a bunch of wood, so I'm just gonna put a woodshed right there.

114
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Alright, we're on track, we're on track to find frog fractions too, and we can finally get this sequel to the last rowdy fuckers cop killers gone.

115
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:45,900
We can unlock this special DLC content that we want to talk about, but we just can't because we're not on frog fractions too yet.

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're saving the good stuff, we're saving the good stuff for frog fractions too.

117
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:58,900
If we ever find it, which we might just not, so we might just not be able to get to talk about that stuff, which would be really funny, very funny.

118
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, our content will die with us, all that potential entertainment will just go right down the drain, right down the drain of eternity.

119
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,500
And you know what, that's how I want it, that's what I like.

120
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,500
The right of fuckers cop killers is the cutting edge of petrol-

121
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Petrol-based military accoutrements.

122
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,100
I do not know this guys, but the right of fuckers cop killers are people who made the petrodollar, we created it.

123
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,100
No, I don't have enough sparkles to build another site orb.

124
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
How do you get sparkles?

125
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,100
I have no idea, I have no idea how to get sparkles.

126
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I built a woodshed, I'll build a pantry I guess, not enough wood, okay I gotta chop down, I'm gonna chop down, oh what the fuck is this?

127
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Three extra fairies have arrived, alright sounds cool.

128
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,700
I'm gonna cut this tree down, there we go.

129
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,700
It might be like resource management, you might be building too many buildings for your current population of fairies.

130
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,700
It's like a Civ 5 city where you want to get all the luxury resources, but you don't have enough population to sustain those good tiles.

131
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:19,700
I don't know, I just don't know, what do fairies need, what is required for a fairies life cycle to continue?

132
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
I just don't know.

133
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,300
How can they suck dude, just build stuff that sucks and fucks?

134
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:33,300
How do we get, like I think they want sparkles, I think they want sparkles, but like, whence, whence cometh of the sparkles?

135
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Not, I don't see any, I don't see any forthcoming.

136
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,300
Maybe if I built some fireworks and like exploded this treasure chest down here, maybe some sparkles would come out.

137
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Wait what, crystals, okay I can get crystals, I can get food, why am I short on food, look at all the fucking berries on those trees.

138
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,900
I planted these thimbleberry bushes and like, they're just not taking advantage, so I'm just real disappointed.

139
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Maybe you should click on them to harvest them yourself, or is...

140
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Oh no, oh no I don't want to do that.

141
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Okay, cancel, cancel.

142
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,900
A thimbleberry bush would like fertilizer, do I have fertilizer?

143
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,900
Not enough sparkles, okay, fertilizer takes...

144
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Cast light, cast light costs food.

145
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Reveals a fogged area like a sight ore, but only for a little...

146
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Fireworks take sparkles, torches, torches reveal darkened areas underground, sparkle hut,

147
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,500
it's giving you more space to store sparkles, oh yes, oh yes that's what I want, that's what I fucking want.

148
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Do it bro, smash that shit, smash that fucking tree.

149
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:49,100
That's gonna take all my crystal, and I might need to mine more crystal so I can build more sparkle huts.

150
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Build crystal vault, vault gives you more...

151
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Oh no, I should have just built a goddamn vault, should have just built a goddamn vault.

152
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
It's too late now.

153
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Okay, that's fine, it's fine, it's all good, I don't need wood for anything else, I think I've got all the houses I need.

154
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,100
God, the strategy, this is the deep and involving strategy that is glittermint and grove, it's just engrossing.

155
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Why doesn't the president of every single country just play this game to understand how government works?

156
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:21,700
It's new, it's new, and new ideas take time, new ideas take time to percolate and spread throughout the population and reach the top.

157
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Change doesn't come from the top down, change comes from the bottom up, change comes from the bottom changing the top so that things can change from the top down.

158
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,700
This is the definition of a libertarian government, this game right here.

159
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Oh, I've got so much room for sparkles now, I've got so much room for sparkles, but how do I get the sparkles?

160
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Rules, uh, gathering, oh gatherings, what?

161
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Okay, it won't tell me how to gather sparkles, but I can gather sparkles.

162
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Just try everything.

163
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Remember when, remember when all those pony guys got really mad at us last time?

164
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,700
We can't talk about that yet, Ben, we haven't reached frog fractions too!

165
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Oh god, but I'm just itching, but I'm just itching, it's the most interesting thing that ever happens.

166
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:21,700
No, we'll ward off that interesting topic for when we reach frog fractions too, with how much anime I saw.

167
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Oh, that's right, you've been at Anthrocon.

168
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Yeah, I've been at AnthroExpo.

169
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,700
I've been at Bronycon, I've been all around at Bronycon.

170
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Yeah, man.

171
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Yeah, I bet lots of people were really mad at you about Rowdyfuckers Episode 4.

172
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Oh my god!

173
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
I bet you were just getting lambasted left and right.

174
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:56,700
Yeah, dude, I met the president of the Brony's FNGR, he was a populist, and he split the vote, so he got the populist win landslide victory.

175
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Yeah, naturally.

176
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,700
And he was like, fucking, I'm gonna play you in basketball, and he killed me in basketball.

177
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Oh no, how embarrassing.

178
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
If you die in basketball, you have to leave Bronycon.

179
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,700
If you die in basketball, you die in real life.

180
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Well, it did.

182
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Why are you at Davoo's channel?

183
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Wait, what?

184
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Why are you at Davoo's channel?

185
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Oh, I don't know, I just had Davoo's channel open.

186
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Type in how to get to Frog Fractions 2.

187
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,700
I know how to get it, like, in general.

188
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,700
In general, it's not good enough, also, I can't see what you're typing.

189
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Uh, no, no, see, like, I know how to reach Glitterm, or how to get to Frog Fractions 2, but I know that to do it, I need to get sparkles, and I just...

190
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Oh, okay, here we go, here we go.

191
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Uh, Grow High.

192
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Oh wait, there's, oh, I didn't see that, there actually is a secret way to get to Frog Fractions 2 immediately.

193
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Oh yeah?

194
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Yeah, yeah, it's like, we can cheat our way there if we want.

195
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Um, no, Grow High's calculation is not about cheating, that's what the PCP race is for.

196
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Yeah, okay, I'm just gonna, viewers, pretend you didn't see that.

197
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Um, okay.

198
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Uh, invest in things that get you more sparkles, like prisms and sparkle huts.

199
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Um, you need to be gathering other resources, wood and crystal to do this, so chop down some trees in mine for the required goods.

200
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
I got some wood for you.

201
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Where?

202
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
I could really use it to, like, build a house out of.

203
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,700
It's my wood, I'm selling wood, here you go.

204
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,700
Yeah, you chop that yourself, you chop that yourself.

205
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh my god, I can't flare it through the computer's screen, it's too tiny.

206
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Other than, it would have worked if it was just big enough, but it's just not.

207
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Oh noooo.

208
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Wait, hang on, hang on, prism, oh, build a sparkly prism and a beam of light and it will turn the light into sparkles, oh okay.

209
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Incredible.

210
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,700
This game is about the American economy, it's like, you know, it's, it's like, what would you call it?

211
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,700
It's like a movie, but, like a real movie with facts.

212
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Yeah, like a film.

213
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Yeah, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a, it's like a keynote, basically.

214
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Yeah, yeah, it's a keynote, I was just gonna say.

215
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,700
It's real Kino. It's real. This game is a tone piece, as it is.

216
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
Yeah. Period piece.

217
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,700
It's a tone period piece. Wait.

218
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Daisy Charmedew, cheerful. Yeah, that's my favorite.

219
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Twilight Sparkle.

220
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Utopia Petal Glow, also a good fairy.

221
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
There's Daisy again.

222
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Blossom Gentlemeadow is my friend, personally.

223
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Oh shit. Oh dude, I'm getting...

224
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Okay. Yeah, I'm generating an outrageous amount of sparkles right now.

225
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Oh shit. You're rigging the system, dude.

226
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,700
Oh wait, wait, wait. I need 20 sparkles? Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?

227
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Yeah, I managed to build Christ of Yours, dude.

228
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I need... Okay, I need to get a crystal. I need to get crystal.

229
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,700
I think I need to mine for it.

230
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.

231
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Uh...

232
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Okay, here's what you do.

233
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
I gotta blast it with fireworks.

234
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Oh shit. Oh my fucking god.

235
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Okay, I got some crystal, but not that much.

236
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I just need more crystal so I can make more prisms so I can generate more fucking sparkles.

237
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
It's all about the sparkles, really.

238
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Yeah.

239
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Oh man, I'm actually really...

240
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
It's gonna be a well-oiled machine.

241
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
I'm actually really digging, glittering it and grove.

242
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Yeah, it's actually pretty fucking sick.

243
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
I'm actually really enjoying my time with these fairies.

244
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Oh, I kind of blew the roots off of these fucking thimbleberry bush, but it looks like it's managing just fine.

245
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Excellent.

246
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,700
By the way, I do not know how long this is going to take.

247
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,700
It could be like a really involved process.

248
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Oh, what's this? Oh, three extra fairies have arrived. That's fine.

249
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Oh my god. Here, here. I'm gonna give my anime expo rant.

250
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Yeah, yeah, please.

251
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Yeah, yeah, please.

252
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Like it's 3,000 views on YouTube and then it starts like a controversy.

253
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,700
I don't know. I don't know what's that. That's what that's like, by the way.

254
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
I don't know what it's like to start a YouTube with controversy.

255
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
No.

256
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
It would probably be insanity.

257
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,700
It's probably just terrible and not something that we here at the Rowdy fuckers cockpills would ever want to fuck around with.

258
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,700
That's just my personal assessment.

259
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Yeah, you know. You never know.

260
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
No.

261
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
So I went to an expo with Nate and Digi.

262
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Yeah.

263
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,700
And I was real jealous, by the way. I was seeing you guys' tweets.

264
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,700
And I was like, you know what? Like when you guys asked me if I wanted to go,

265
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,700
I remembered that like BronyCon was never really that good.

266
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,700
It was only good because we were hanging out with each other.

267
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,700
And then I saw, I was like, oh, no, this is dumb.

268
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,700
But then I saw you guys hanging out with each other and I was like, oh yeah,

269
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,700
BronyCon was bad except it was really good that we were hanging out with each other.

270
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Yeah.

271
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
It all came, it all came together for me.

272
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
I put the pieces together.

273
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Yeah.

274
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I campaigned hard, at least hard in the sense that I sent you like two messages confirming that you didn't want to go,

275
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
which is my definition of hard.

276
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Well, you know, I was, I mean, I still am hard up for cash,

277
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,700
but I was like much more hard up for cash around that time.

278
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
So like at that point it was like not even a quit.

279
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Like even now I would be, I still don't know if I could justify an expense like that.

280
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
But like at the time it was like definitely out of the question.

281
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Oh no, my thimbleberry bush is dying from a lack of light.

282
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Oh my God.

283
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
What a goddamn shame.

284
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
I need more, I need more houses.

285
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Oh fuck.

286
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
God, it's so fucking hard.

287
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
This game is just too fucking hard.

288
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,700
It's, it really is the dark souls of video games.

289
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I know, no kidding, no kidding, bro.

290
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Dude, did Tim Buckley make this because it reminds me of a video game for one reason or another?

291
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Like a big fucking branch just fell.

292
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,700
A big fucking branch just fell out of those um,

293
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,700
just fell out of those trees and like,

294
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
can we get some of that wood please?

295
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Can we get some of that wood please?

296
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Actually, I'm gonna cut off this branch.

297
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Ooh, that's a...

298
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,700
It behooves you to know that for literally every single day of the con,

299
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,700
at least once I said I wish Ben was here.

300
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Oh, munchie.

301
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Oh man, yeah, it makes me wish I'd gone.

302
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Makes me wish I'd gone.

303
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Oh man.

304
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
But you know, but you know, I'm hoping,

305
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I'm really hoping that like, oh, look at all that wood.

306
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,700
I'm really hoping that we can get Radcon 3 to happen before too long.

307
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
We can talk about that in private later,

308
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,700
because there's like, you know, there's things going around.

309
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,700
I think, I think it might be sooner or later than later.

310
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
It like, it should be.

311
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
At least in great sense.

312
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
The last one was like six months ago.

313
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Yeah.

314
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,700
What was there like six months between the first one and the second one?

315
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
I think so.

316
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
So like, I think it's, I mean, it was, that sounds right.

317
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
I don't know.

318
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
I think it's time.

319
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Like, it's fucking, it's time.

320
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,700
It's time for, it's time for a woman, is what I'm saying.

321
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
I could talk about that on the show.

322
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
I don't know.

323
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Do you think the other guys will mind?

324
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,700
If we just go like, like hard into the fucking like,

325
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,700
financial like, logistical like, problems of Radcon?

326
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
Um, no, I don't think so.

327
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,700
I mean, we want, I was just watching Davoo.

328
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,700
As you saw, I was watching Davoo's latest video and he was talking about how like,

329
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,700
just how important like full disclosure is and like, he's right.

330
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,700
So yeah, let's, I mean, I guess let's just fucking go into it because I'm interested

331
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,700
because like, you've been saying, it sounds like it was a topic of discussion at,

332
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,700
at, at, um, Anthro Expo and I'm, and I'm curious about it.

333
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Uh, yeah.

334
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,700
So, uh, if, if, if, if you're in Nate and you're watching this and you're shaking

335
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
your head like, oh, like those fuck, those motherfuckers,

336
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,700
then please take us out of the PCP, please.

337
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Yeah.

338
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Yeah.

339
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah.

340
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Yeah.

341
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Yeah.

342
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Anyway, so yeah, uh, uh, it was only day three where I brought it up to Nate or maybe

343
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
it was two, whatever.

344
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Anyway, uh, we were talking about it and we basically just talked about how, uh, like,

345
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
the PCP headquarters is basically like, at least from the way we were talking about,

346
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
it's like almost guaranteed to be Atlanta.

347
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
That's where we all think it's going to be.

348
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,700
I mean, I would really like, oh, everything, shit, everything's fucking falling.

349
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
Oh, no, oh, cause it's fall.

350
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Oh, okay.

351
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Yeah.

352
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
It just became fall.

353
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Um, all right.

354
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,700
I mean, that's, that's great for me cause that's where I am.

355
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
And like, I've wanted that.

356
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Like, I hoped that that would be the case.

357
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Like back in the day when I was considering whether I was going to move here or not.

358
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Like I hoped that everyone would come with me and like we would have fucking PCP headquarters

359
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,700
here, but it didn't seem like it was going to happen.

360
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
Uh, so like what's, what's going on with that?

361
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
What are people saying?

362
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Uh, well, Nate's reasoning is literally just that you are lazy and probably won't want to

363
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
move.

364
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,700
Um, well, I mean, there's reasons not to move besides being lazy.

365
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Sure.

366
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
Oh no, a ferry left cause there was nowhere to sleep.

367
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
I need, I need another house.

368
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
I need another house.

369
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Prano.

370
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Uh, but yeah.

371
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,060
Uh, and just like, like this wasn't like a part of the discussion, but I later found

372
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,700
out that like there's like a ton of fucking anime people based in Atlanta.

373
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,700
And I'm assuming that's going to be at least a little bit.

374
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Uh, and I mean, I, I mean, I know there's nine own econ.

375
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
There's a ton.

376
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,700
There's, uh, I don't know any of their names.

377
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,700
There's like the wave motion camera.

378
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Wave motion cannon.

379
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Yeah.

380
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
And I don't know anything about him, but I've heard the name.

381
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Yeah.

382
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
I, I don't know anything about them.

383
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,700
And I don't think I've heard the name ever, even besides the ones I just said.

384
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
There's, there's a ton of people.

385
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
A ton of people came up to us and said they're based in Atlanta.

386
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Uh, econ's there.

387
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Do you know who econ is?

388
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Were you there?

389
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Yeah.

390
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Yeah.

391
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I hung out with you.

392
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Yeah.

393
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
We're like friends now, I think he's like a friend.

394
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,700
You and him?

395
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Well, I think all of us were like, he's like a friend of the show now.

396
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,700
I mean, I saw that he, I saw that he put a video out on Nino's channel.

397
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,700
I know, which is, I know what did you, what did you wanted him to do?

398
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Um, and I thought, I watched it and I thought it was fine.

399
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
We thought it was fine.

400
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,700
All he did is just like, we hung out a lot.

401
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,700
He kind of warmed his way into the, uh, hang out with us a lot, which is fine.

402
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Yeah.

403
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Uh, but yeah, but yeah, the point is there's a ton of people down there.

404
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Did you say it was the best place he saw on the trip?

405
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
Did he?

406
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
Uh, well, good.

407
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Yeah.

408
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
I mean, it is a pretty fucking cool zone.

409
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:31,700
I mean, in my humble opinion, uh, in my humble, I haven't seen it, but it's like, I don't know.

410
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,700
It just feels like that's where the gravitational pull is.

411
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,700
I just, it just feels, I'm really, I'm super, I'm super excited to hear that.

412
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm super excited to hear that.

413
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
And fuck, fuck Nate.

414
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
I don't want to move because I'm lazy.

415
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Oh yeah.

416
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,700
Like, like it's just a question of like, oh yeah, I would move, but I'm just, I just

417
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
don't feel like it right now.

418
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Well, he did, he didn't mention your laziness.

419
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,700
I don't know if he thinks it's just because of the laziness.

420
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Well, I mean, I am lazy.

421
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,700
I mean, I am lazy, but like, that's not, that's not the deciding factor here.

422
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
All right.

423
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,700
Sorry, Nate, if I missed this up to your point, though, I don't think I did.

424
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Though, I'm fairly certain I didn't.

425
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
Yeah.

426
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Yeah.

427
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Me too.

428
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Uh, yeah.

429
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:21,700
And, uh, I haven't been there, uh, I kind of, I like my home city a lot, though, like,

430
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm not married to it.

431
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,700
It's more just like, oh man, I'm not going to be here for the first time.

432
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
That's going to be fucking crazy.

433
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Um, I don't know.

434
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,700
I mean, I haven't lived, I haven't lived in my hometown for a long time and I don't

435
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,700
miss it, but, uh, you know, I mean, I guess everyone's deciding factor on me not

436
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
wanting to move to Atlanta.

437
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I'm just saying that's going to be like, oh, crazy.

438
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
It's just a note.

439
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Yeah.

440
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,700
Yeah, fair enough.

441
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Come on.

442
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Get these crystals.

443
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Okay.

444
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
I got a few.

445
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Okay.

446
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
I got a few.

447
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Uh, yeah.

448
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Okay.

449
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Uh, I remember Nate, like, like the last day before Nate left, we were discussing, uh,

450
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,700
that like the deciding, like, like the two things that we need to do in order for

451
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,700
ACON 3 to happen is get hippo over through any means necessary and find a good place.

452
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,700
Well, I think, I think we need, well, we need to find a good place.

453
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:25,700
I mean, I think ideally we would like go fund, do like some kind of fundraiser, like just

454
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,700
to pay for tickets, like plane tickets for everyone.

455
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Cause like, I mean, I guess we wouldn't need to do that.

456
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,700
But like, I mean, I mean, monkey was saying like, who's going to pay for transport.

457
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,700
And like, like if it's in Atlanta, I don't need transport, but like I understand that

458
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,700
like for other people, it would, it would help.

459
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
So.

460
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,700
I think the only person that we need to fund is hippo.

461
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
Oh, yeah.

462
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Which also is funny because I realized I'm fairly certain that this is not completely accurate,

463
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,700
but it was funny just to hear, uh, did you explain the car ride that like the plane ride

464
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
for hippo is around like a thousand dollars?

465
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,700
And that's the same amount of both ways for me to go to Radcon.

466
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,700
Oh, so, so you, so like you paid that much last time.

467
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Oh God.

468
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Well, I hope it was worth it.

469
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
It was.

470
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
It was.

471
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
Okay.

472
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
Okay.

473
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Good view.

474
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,700
Yeah.

475
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Uh, I, I need to start, I need to start growing these trees vertically.

476
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,700
How do you do that?

477
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Like this one is looking re, I think fertilizer.

478
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
I think fertilizer is, is how you do that.

479
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
That's not realistic.

480
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
At least I don't think.

481
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Here we go.

482
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Here we go.

483
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Oh, there it goes.

484
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
It's getting real erect.

485
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Oh man.

486
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Yes.

487
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Yes.

488
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Did you say that your house is not good for Radcon three?

489
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
My house is not big.

490
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
Like it's.

491
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
That's, that's not the problem you said.

492
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
He said it was just too open that way.

493
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Like there was no like.

494
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
It is.

495
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,700
It is extremely open.

496
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,700
There's like, there's like one main, there's like, like there's, it's two stories, but

497
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,700
like both stories are like basically the same room.

498
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
And then there's like one side room.

499
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
And then there's a bedroom.

500
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Like that's awful.

501
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,700
It's not, it would not be a great place for like.

502
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,700
Did he also said that he, we could theoretically use his house.

503
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Or I guess his parents house now.

504
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Um, I mean, maybe so.

505
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,700
But he said his parents would like still be there.

506
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
What does it mean?

507
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
There's not enough sparkles.

508
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Oh, so I don't know what he's thinking.

509
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
But anyway, that's, I guess that's on the table.

510
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Really?

511
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,700
Uh, we see you get hippo and we need to get a place.

512
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Those are the only two things.

513
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,700
And, and, and Nate, you know, he has to take what is like Nate, uh, like four C's that

514
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,700
Radcom three will happen at least next year, like January next year, at least.

515
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Well, that's, that's like a million years from now.

516
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
Next year is like a million years away, dude.

517
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
That's true.

518
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700
That's not, that's not acceptable.

519
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,700
Uh, I mean, sure, but I don't know if any of us can afford it.

520
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:16,700
I mean, I, I might be able to question Mark.

521
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Hmm.

522
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Hmm.

523
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,700
I've just been, I've just been, I mean, I've got, I mean, I've got somewhat selfish reasons

524
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:32,700
because my greatest regret in life is that at Radcom two, I did not record another lecture.

525
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
Yes.

526
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Did you mention this?

527
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
And like, yeah.

528
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
And like my sonnachu lecture is like so fucking big.

529
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,700
I mean, you know, by my standards, uh, um, my sonnachu lecture got so big relative to

530
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,700
everything else I've done that like I wish I, I, if I'd had two, I feel like if people

531
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,700
had seen that I had two videos all the time to be like, Oh, this is a thing this guy does.

532
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,700
But like now it's like with only one, it's like an isolated incident.

533
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
The point being is that I just, I just want to do another one.

534
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
Like I just really want to do another one.

535
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,700
I think it'd be good.

536
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,700
I think it'd be big.

537
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
I really like the first one.

538
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,700
And I let that opportunity slip away at Radcom two and I don't want, and I want to rectify

539
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
that.

540
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
Yeah.

541
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
I probably, I probably do one on tails gets trolled.

542
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Funny you mentioned that.

543
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
So like, yeah.

544
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Uh, because like at the, at the breakfast table where we were discussing how we need

545
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
hippo in the house.

546
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,700
Uh, I, I mentioned that you were thirsty for Radcom three and did you was like, yeah,

547
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
he just wants to get another lecture for money.

548
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
I was like, nah, dude, he just wants to see us, dude.

549
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,700
He was like, no, he told me that's what he wants.

550
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Well, it's both.

551
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,700
I mean, I do.

552
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,700
I mean, I would want Radcom three regardless, but yeah, that is, that is the thing that

553
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,700
I was like, God damn it.

554
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,700
I'm, I, I fucked up Radcom two never again.

555
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Um, yeah, it was cool.

556
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
It was real cool.

557
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:54,700
It was my fucking, it's a, like it's, it makes me mad because like, I'm in like one

558
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,700
or two fucking shitty discord groups for like comic people.

559
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Yes.

560
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
I've been recognized in there.

561
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Yeah.

562
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Yeah.

563
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,700
I've been recognized in there not for my comics, but for my fucking son of two lecture.

564
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Like, like, oh, you're, you're the son of two guy.

565
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,700
I'm like, yeah, sure.

566
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Have it your way, buckaroo.

567
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Damn.

568
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
But whatever.

569
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Still.

570
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
It's, I mean, it's good.

571
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
It's good.

572
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
No, I'm not mad.

573
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
I'm not mad, bro.

574
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Not even mad.

575
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Not even slightly mad, bro.

576
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
That is your real name, bro.

577
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,700
So other than Radcom three, like immediately, just like the HQ.

578
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Yeah.

579
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,700
The plan for me is the following.

580
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:45,700
The only two, like much like the Radcom three, the only two prerequisites for me, uh, moving

581
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,700
to Atlanta is finishing both high school and investigator.

582
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Those are the only two things I need.

583
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,700
And then I will become a literal God who can do anything.

584
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,700
I, you know, I was just thinking about investigator the other day.

585
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
As was I.

586
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,700
And I thought, like, okay, you know what, I'm not going to ask about investigator because

587
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,700
I feel like if there's going to, if there's details forthcoming about investigator, Munchy

588
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,700
will share them.

589
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,700
And I don't want to, like, prod about it or anything.

590
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,700
Uh, I mean, what details do you mean?

591
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
What, what, what details did you?

592
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Well, like, like, like how, like how, like how it's going or like, whether it's, whether

593
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
it's getting done or anything like that.

594
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
It's getting done.

595
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,700
Just.

596
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
Okay.

597
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Here.

598
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,700
I'll go like, I haven't been trying to be like close about it.

599
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
Like, like close chest about it.

600
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Yeah.

601
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,700
I just, I just haven't thought to talk about it.

602
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Yeah.

603
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:43,700
The reason investigators taking so long is because I don't like writing things.

604
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
I just like to draw things.

605
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
I understand.

606
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
I agree.

607
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
I, I have so much.

608
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,200
I mean, it's not like, it's not that I never have a hard time drawing, but like, I always

609
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,700
have a hard time writing, writing, writing, like, I mean, I don't write like a script

610
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,700
out, but like when I go to write the dialogue into a page, like I struggle with it a lot.

611
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
And it's hard, man.

612
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
It's hard.

613
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
It's hard work.

614
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
It's hard shit.

615
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Yeah, man.

616
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
I.

617
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,700
Making decisions is difficult.

618
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Like.

619
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,700
I feel it.

620
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:22,700
Because the idea of investigator, the entire comic is based off of a character design.

621
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
That is what it was originally like.

622
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,700
I made, I made the main character one day.

623
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Just doodling.

624
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
I was like, I should make a comic out of this.

625
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Yeah.

626
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Yeah.

627
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Whereas in there are ideas in my head for like stories instead of like a design where

628
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,700
I think like if I wanted to, I could, I could make another comic if I wanted to.

629
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,700
And it would probably be easier because I have like a story in my head.

630
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
But I don't want to.

631
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
I want to make investigator.

632
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,700
But it's hard for me to like make a plot to like stick to.

633
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
So that's really all.

634
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Because if you've ever convention, convention me, at least on a good day, then you know that

635
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
I can, I can draw very fast.

636
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
It's one of my strong suits.

637
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Uh, so.

638
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,700
True.

639
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,700
I think drawing of investigator will take, will like be a month.

640
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,700
Like on ironically, it will be a month.

641
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
I, I got you.

642
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,700
I got you.

643
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Uh, the only problem is figuring out, because I have, I have ideas.

644
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
I have a ton of ideas.

645
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,700
But how am I going to turn those ideas into words on a page?

646
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
And it's not just like the, how do I write it?

647
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,700
But like what plot points do I keep in?

648
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
How do I make this coherent and, you know, good?

649
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Instead of just a loose collection of like, like, I have a ton of like, oh man, this

650
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
shot's going to be so cool.

651
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
It's going to convey this, this and this.

652
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:51,700
But like, how will I fit that scene into a comic story wise?

653
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Um, it's hard.

654
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Oh God.

655
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,700
Can I, can I cut there?

656
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm scared.

657
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
I'm scared to cut in the wrong spot.

658
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
Okay.

659
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
Right there.

660
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
Right there.

661
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Cut that.

662
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Um, yeah, dude.

663
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,700
Well, I mean how much, like how much of the plot do you have like hammered out?

664
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,700
Uh, like, I'm going to go low.

665
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,700
I'm going to estimate low and say like 33%.

666
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
But that doesn't account for all the like, just scenes.

667
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Like I, I can't overestimate.

668
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
I can't underestimate, rather.

669
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,700
How, I will, like how many, like how much of it is inside of my brain?

670
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Like in a sort of like goop that like is just a ton of like DNA codes of like different

671
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,700
scenes, all completely randomized.

672
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,700
And so it's like, I know more about, but what I actually have like hammered out like into

673
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
words, describe what is less.

674
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,700
So you've got like, so you've got like, so you've got like plot ideas, but I'm saying,

675
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,700
I'm like, like, is the, so like what you don't have is like the connecting tissue that like

676
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
gets you from one to the other.

677
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Yeah, basically.

678
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Yeah.

679
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,700
Yeah.

680
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
I understand.

681
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
I understand.

682
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Oh, I mean, fuck.

683
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
Fuck.

684
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,700
You could always just like go the like, go the route of like, it doesn't even have like

685
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
an overarching plot.

686
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Like it's just like a bunch of like short, real short comics about the character.

687
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,700
I thought about that, but I don't want that.

688
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,700
I don't want to do that.

689
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
Yeah.

690
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
You want, you want it to be like a real story.

691
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
I want it to be a real boy.

692
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Yeah.

693
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:30,700
And it's like, I, I, I don't like investigator is coming.

694
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:37,700
There's not ever a moment where I just like, I'm always thinking about investigator always.

695
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
I'm never like forgetting about it.

696
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,700
So I don't know if that's an issue for anyone, but yeah, don't think that I'm ever like forgetting

697
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,700
that an investigator exists because I'm always trying to do it.

698
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Like, like at an expo, I was surrounded by people in a Japanese restaurant and I was

699
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,700
just staring off into space and I was like, hmm, this would be a pretty cool location

700
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
investigator.

701
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
Do you?

702
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Ah, I got to get those, getting those creative juices flowing.

703
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,700
Yeah.

704
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Yeah.

705
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
Yeah.

706
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Yeah.

707
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Getting that goo.

708
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Just getting all that goo.

709
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Getting that important slime going.

710
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
It's a, I love it.

711
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,700
I don't want to say any plot points because then it will be awful.

712
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,700
That would be the worst possible thing.

713
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Just know I'm working on it.

714
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,700
It will, it will be here by 2018.

715
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,700
That is a deadline for myself.

716
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
And if I don't, then kick me out of the PCP.

717
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,700
This isn't a fucking joke.

718
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Kick me out of the PCP.

719
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,700
It's not here by 2018.

720
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,700
I want to kill myself every day because I thought champion would be done before the

721
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
end of 2016.

722
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
And yeah, yeah, it's funny.

723
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,700
It's funny how much I hate myself.

724
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
Oh God.

725
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,700
No.

726
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,700
At least you don't have nose locks, dude.

727
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I don't have nose locks weighing you down anymore.

728
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Oh yeah.

729
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,700
I have, I have been, I have been drawing more the last little while and it's, it's good.

730
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,700
It's good.

731
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,700
It's good, but like, man, I got into, I got into a groove of not drawing it that much.

732
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,700
And now it's like, I keep like wanting to draw that same amount.

733
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,700
And I'm like, no, no, I can be drawing more because I've got time now.

734
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
You know what I mean?

735
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Oh shit.

736
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,700
Oh shit.

737
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Oh no, there's nothing to eat.

738
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,700
Oh no.

739
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
My fairies are going to starve.

740
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
They're going to starve.

741
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
It's a fucking famine.

742
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Uh, uh, okay.

743
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
I got to plant, I got to plant a seed.

744
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:32,700
I got to plant a seed, grow a little seed, grow a little princess, 12 new pennies.

745
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Can't plant seeds during winter.

746
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
Oh my God.

747
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Oh God.

748
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
No.

749
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
I've, I fucked up, Munchie.

750
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
Holy shit, dude.

751
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
I fucked up.

752
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,700
I can't.

753
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,700
I should have built a pantry.

754
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I should have built a fucking pantry.

755
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,700
If I, God, God, if you can hear me, Gaia, God of fairies.

756
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,700
I'm not a praying man, but please convince me you're real.

757
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,700
If you can hear me, like if you, if you just let my fairy tribe last through the winter,

758
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,700
just let them, just let them.

759
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,700
Oh wait, wait, wait.

760
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,700
I know what I can do.

761
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,700
Maybe there might be food in these treasure chests.

762
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
I mean, it's worth a shot.

763
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:16,700
If you can let my fairy colony last through the winter, I will give myself over to the

764
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,700
police.

765
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,700
If you help our fairies through the winter, I will draw like the first like letter of

766
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Christ in the Roman alphabet and lead my men into battle.

767
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,700
And if we win that battle, then I will convert to Christianity and like do all the shit that

768
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
I did.

769
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
I forgot who I'm referencing, but I, someone did that.

770
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,700
It's a, Munchie, it's a miracle.

771
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
That chest had food in it.

772
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,700
Oh my God.

773
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,700
Gaia fucking answered my prayer, my ardent prayer.

774
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Oh my God.

775
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
I'm going to convert to Christianity.

776
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,700
Yeah, bro.

777
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,700
What's in this one?

778
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,700
Sparkles.

779
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
All right.

780
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,700
That's fine.

781
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,700
I'll take those two.

782
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,700
Oh man.

783
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,700
Okay.

784
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
Cool.

785
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,700
It's a good thing I had those extra sparkles lying around to power those fireworks.

786
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,700
This guy is actually really fucking cool.

787
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Yeah.

788
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,700
It, it actually looks like I'm going to eat those words.

789
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
I'm going to eat those negative words I had to say.

790
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
It looks like shit, but it looks cool.

791
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Yeah.

792
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Truly.

793
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
What do you mean not on a fucking sparkles?

794
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,700
You dumb ass.

795
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,700
You fucking dumb ass.

796
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,700
You damn ass.

797
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Like how many do I goddamn need?

798
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Oh, we need 60 now?

799
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
Oh, each shit.

800
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Oh, each shit you fuck.

801
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,700
That's going to, that's not acceptable.

802
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Whatever.

803
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
We're talking about investigator.

804
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,700
Oh yeah.

805
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,700
We're talking about investigator.

806
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
It's coming.

807
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,700
I don't think I actually need this crystal vault.

808
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Do I?

809
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
No, I'll leave it.

810
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Why not?

811
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
It's not, it's not hurting anybody.

812
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Oh, I can demolish this.

813
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,700
I can demolish this site orb.

814
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,700
Did I ever, did I ever talk about anime expo or did I just talk about radcon?

815
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,700
You only talked about anime expo in the context of the discussion about radcon and PCP headquarters.

816
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,700
Yeah, I'm just going to, I'm just going to fucking like, like vent about anime expo.

817
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,700
Like the entire trip.

818
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Please.

819
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,700
Because I really want, oh god, it fucking costs food.

820
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Jesus.

821
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
Why the fuck would it cost food?

822
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Yeah.

823
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,700
Please.

824
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,700
Okay.

825
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,700
Please.

826
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Tell me all about anime.

827
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,700
The only thing I know about anime expo is that you taunted hippo with pictures of risque cosplayers and it was really great.

828
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,700
I called him a drool master.

829
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,700
It was really fun.

830
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,700
You called him a drool master, which is true, which is an accurate assessment.

831
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
And yeah, it just seemed like a real good time.

832
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Yeah, here, I'll just, here, I'm just going to say all of what happened during anime expo.

833
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,700
I'm just going to give you the story so you can live vicariously through past me.

834
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
Yes.

835
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Please.

836
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
So I got there.

837
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
I got there and I meet Digi.

838
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
And I have this whole speech recorded.

839
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,700
Here, here, hold on.

840
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,700
Let me read the speech that I wanted to tell Digi.

841
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Okay.

842
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,700
Again on my phone.

843
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Real quick.

844
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,700
Fill the radio, fill the radio with fucking shit.

845
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
All right.

846
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,700
All right, all right, all right, all right.

847
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,700
You are entering an alien world consisting only of pain.

848
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Welcome to the new extreme.

849
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,700
I want you to know that it was your own doing that led you to this fate.

850
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,700
All the hatred and misfortune you have cast upon this realm has manifested itself into

851
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,700
a strange and disturbing cosmic being of dark powers.

852
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,700
It has come time for you to learn the true nature of those formidable demons you have unwittingly unleashed.

853
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,700
By the time we're done with you, you're not going to need antidepressants.

854
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,700
But I only got like half of it and then he just hugged me.

855
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,700
Well, I mean, pretty good.

856
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,700
Yeah.

857
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
I think the point probably got across.

858
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Yeah, probably got across.

859
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Message received.

860
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Excellent.

861
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Oh, look at all this crystal.

862
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Look at all that crystal.

863
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,700
Dude, just fucking slam that shit with your fireworks, bro.

864
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Fireworks and quotes double entendre, bro.

865
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,700
Here we go.

866
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,700
Here we go.

867
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,700
I'm going to blast it this way.

868
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Yeah.

869
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,700
Damn, nigga.

870
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,700

871
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Fuck it needs.

872
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,700
Okay, I'm going to plant.

873
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I'm going to plant a thimbleberry bush.

874
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,700
I'm going to plant a thimbleberry right there.

875
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,700
And then I'll put a site orb in said bush.

876
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
You know what?

877
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
I have made very little progress.

878
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
It feels good.

879
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Like I need, it does feel good.

880
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,700
Like I need to be going up.

881
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,700
Like I know that frog, I know that frog fractions is somewhere up there in the sky, somewhere

882
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,700
up there among among the firmament.

883
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
The ozone.

884
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,700
But yeah, but like, you know, it's hard.

885
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,700
It's hard and it's alluding me.

886
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,700
It's hard growing up and nobody understands.

887
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,700
I know.

888
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,700
Fucking hell.

889
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700

00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:48,700
This text, it's personal text.

1012
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,700
Weird.

1013
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,700
Anyway, so yeah, six more fairies have arrived.

1014
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,700
Oh, that's just what I needed.

1015
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,700
So that's literally incredible.

1016
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,700
That is like the best experience the entire con.

1017
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,700
It's fucking great.

1018
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,700
And that was like the first day.

1019
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,700
First day.

1020
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,700
Yeah.

1021
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,700
Okay.

1022
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,700
Okay.

1023
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,700
I wish pin was there.

1024
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,700
I wish it was great.

1025
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,700
It was insane.

1026
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,700
Oh, no, me too, man.

1027
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,700
Damn it.

1028
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,700
It would have been great.

1029
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,700
Oh, shit.

1030
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,700
And keep in mind, I was sneaked in because I didn't have the right badge for it.

1031
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,700
It was supposed to be like an interesting thing.

1032
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,700
Only Nate and DJ were supposed to be allowed in.

1033
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,700
But I just got in.

1034
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,700
I just, I just was allowed in because I was with them.

1035
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,700
It was great.

1036
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,700
It was incredible.

1037
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,700
The best night of the entire con by far.

1038
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,700
Besides the Gimp is better than Photoshop night, which happens later.

1039
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,700
Gimp is not better than Photoshop.

1040
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Gimp is the worst thing that ever happened.

1041
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,700
Dude.

1042
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,700
I hate Gimp.

1043
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,700
It's awful.

1044
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Ben.

1045
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,700
Gimp can do everything Photoshop can do, but better and for free.

1046
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,700
No.

1047
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,700
No.

1048
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,700
No.

1049
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,700
Dude.

1050
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,700
No, dude.

1051
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,700
Yeah, bro.

1052
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,700
It just, it just ain't so, dude.

1053
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,700
It just ain't so.

1054
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,700
Are you going to use Photoshop?

1055
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,700
No, I don't use.

1056
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
I can't use.

1057
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,700
Actually, I hate Photoshop.

1058
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,700
I can't use it.

1059
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
I use Manga Studio.

1060
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,700
Manga Studio can do everything Photoshop can do, but better and free if you steal it like I did.

1061
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,700
Well, here, I'll get to that later.

1062
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,700
Okay.

1063
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,700
That's the first night.

1064
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,700
And then we wake up and we go to the con.

1065
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,700
Or also on top of the fucking swanky, like soiree.

1066
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:28,700
We also got free vouchers for that hotel for free breakfast every night of the, or every

1067
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,700
day of the fucking con.

1068
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,700
Free breakfast.

1069
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,700
Hot dog.

1070
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,700
Hot fucking dog.

1071
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,700
It was fucking insane.

1072
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:40,700
Me and Nate's easily best part of the con besides the rooftop swaree and Gimp is better

1073
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,700
than Photoshop.

1074
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,700
So that was great.

1075
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,700
So we go there, we get some nice grub.

1076
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,700
It's great.

1077
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,700
Literally every single day of the con, I got way too much on my plate and I couldn't eat

1078
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,700
it all.

1079
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,700
It doesn't matter because it was free and it was great.

1080
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:00,700
So we go there and almost instantly re-realize this is pain.

1081
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,700
This is a hellscape.

1082
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,700
This is the world-

1083
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,700
What the con itself is.

1084
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
Yeah.

1085
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,700
It's just so fucking huge dude.

1086
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
It is so huge.

1087
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,700
It's Xbox huge.

1088
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,700
The con is Xbox huge.

1089
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,700
Oh no.

1090
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,700
It's not that.

1091
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,700
In every conceivable way a person could possibly mean Xbox huge.

1092
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:29,700
There's so many guests and then the con itself, like the convention center itself is huge to

1093
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,700
support that many people.

1094
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,700
It is a behemoth.

1095
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,700
It is too large, it's too big to fail.

1096
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,700
It's like a big bang.

1097
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,700
It's like the Titanic.

1098
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,700
Fucking hell.

1099
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:49,700
Imagine you're in like a huge room and literally like you are constantly bumping shoulders with

1100
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:57,700
sweaty, like either a horribly obese fat guy, a horribly anorexic skinny guy, a sexy

1101
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,700
cosplayer or a horribly fat woman.

1102
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,700
That's those are the four kinds.

1103
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,700
The four kinds that are around.

1104
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,700
Sick.

1105
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,700
Oh I got a cosmic field has grown into a neighborhood.

1106
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,700
Look at all these new friends.

1107
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,700
See if you can get 20 fairies.

1108
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,700
I need to start cutting down trees because I need to build a palace.

1109
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,700
I need to build a fucking palace is what I need.

1110
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,700
That's really going to bring all the fairies.

1111
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,700
That's really going to get me some traction here in the fairy something.

1112
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,700
I'm going to cut down this whole tree except for, oh God, there it goes.

1113
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,700
It's fucking crazy.

1114
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,700
Oh yeah.

1115
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,700
Oh yeah.

1116
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,700
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

1117
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,700
Oh look at them.

1118
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,700
Look at this.

1119
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,700
I'm playing at four times speed right now.

1120
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,700
Fuck really?

1121
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,700
Yeah.

1122
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,700
It was going too slow.

1123
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,700
Because when I was waiting for fairies to get here, because they all left in the winter,

1124
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,700
I was like, it's time to accelerate.

1125
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,700
There we go.

1126
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,700
Go faster.

1127
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1128
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,700
S bit accelerate.

1129
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:03,700
My strategy now is I'm just going to grow this one tree really tall and hope that it reaches

1130
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,700
frog fractions.

1131
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,700
That's a good idea.

1132
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,700
That's like, I think it's the best idea.

1133
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,700
So yeah, that's horrible.

1134
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,700
And we also quickly realized that all the panels are awful.

1135
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,700
Oh, sure.

1136
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,700
The only two that are good are both of the trigger panels because trigger is a cool anime

1137
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,700
studio.

1138
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,700
Yeah.

1139
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,700
Yeah.

1140
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,700
I forget if it's this day or the next day.

1141
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,700
It's probably the next day.

1142
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,700
I actually know it's that day.

1143
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,700
Yeah, it's that day.

1144
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,700
I'm pretty sure.

1145
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,700
Maybe.

1146
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,700
I don't know.

1147
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,700
Fuck it.

1148
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,700
We just hang out basically.

1149
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,700
I don't think there's anything cool that happens on the first day, like at all.

1150
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,700
Oh.

1151
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,700
Okay, yeah.

1152
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,700
We fuck around for a little bit together and then we branch off.

1153
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:52,700
I see in the place how to draw manga, study with industry people.

1154
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,700
Oh, I would have fucking gone to that.

1155
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
I would have gone to that in a goddamn second.

1156
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,700
Yeah, I think that sounds cool.

1157
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,700
It does.

1158
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
Yeah.

1159
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,700
So I go to where it is, like 30 minutes before, no one.

1160
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,700
Oh, cool.

1161
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,700
So I walk up and say, hey, this is for the manga, right?

1162
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,700
And he was like, yeah, but you have to go wait outside for it.

1163
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,700
I am like, what?

1164
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,700
Yeah.

1165
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,700
I like the convention.

1166
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,700
Okay.

1167
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,700
Ooh.

1168
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,700
Yeah.

1169
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,700
Sounds good.

1170
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,700
Promising.

1171
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,700
Promising.

1172
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
Yeah.

1173
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:26,060
So I go like, it's like, like outside, but like still in the convention center, technically,

1174
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,260
it's like, not like, not like on the street, but like there's like, it lays like an, an

1175
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:39,700
above ground, like bridge sort of concrete outside area, just hang out and there's, and

1176
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,700
there's like a couple of food trucks and like the crowd.

1177
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,700
Yeah.

1178
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
That's like where all the cosplay stuff is.

1179
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,700
Sure.

1180
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,700
So I, I'm built, I'm building this palace.

1181
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,700
I'm building this palace.

1182
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,700
Not enough wood.

1183
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,700
How much do we need?

1184
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,700
Oh, we need 36 wood.

1185
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,700
Okay.

1186
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,700
I'm pretty close.

1187
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,700
I'm pretty close.

1188
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,940
So I stand in line and I realized that this line is pretty long and I start having a glimpse

1189
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,540
of fear in my heart that I might not be able to get in, but it doesn't matter.

1190
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,100
And yeah, there's a little backstory here.

1191
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:12,180
I brought my homesick book because I thought it would be funny if I saw Andrew Hussie at

1192
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,180
an expo because I thought that was just like an out of like an out, like there was no way

1193
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,180
that was going to happen.

1194
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,940
But I left it in the hotel room.

1195
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,500
I just like brought as a joke to say to Digi, though I don't think I, I even remembered

1196
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,940
that was the original, the original purpose of that homesick book that I brought because

1197
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,140
I have a book one of cause it's sick was just, yeah, I have, I wait, no, I don't have, I

1198
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,820
have all of problems, Luth, but I don't have any of the homesick.

1199
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,820
They're sick.

1200
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,380
I have a commentary by Hussie on them for great.

1201
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,940
I recommend them how many are, how many are out now three and I don't think there's gonna

1202
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,940
be anymore.

1203
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,940
Oh, what?

1204
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,940
No.

1205
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,340
Oh, I want the whole fucking thing.

1206
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:52,940
Yeah, it would be great if they're, I mean, I don't, it just seems like why would he?

1207
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,940
Yeah.

1208
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,940
Yeah.

1209
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,500
I mean, I would buy them, but I don't think anyone else.

1210
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,500
I would.

1211
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Yeah.

1212
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Yeah.

1213
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,500
But like, we're not normal.

1214
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Yeah.

1215
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,020
I bought that like as like a joke, funny, huh?

1216
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,220
So I leave it at, I leave it at the hotel.

1217
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,220
Yeah.

1218
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,300
So I'm sitting in line, just, you know, hanging out.

1219
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:15,020
I keep in mind, he's hippo said like, go to MS, when we see a risk a cosplayer, get

1220
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,380
a picture because I want to see Riska because I'm a fucking bitch.

1221
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,380
I am president.

1222
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,380
Yeah.

1223
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,380
A degenerate.

1224
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,380
Yeah.

1225
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,740
I'm president of the Tavros fan club.

1226
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,620
So I see like out of the corner of my eye, I see two Riska cosplayers.

1227
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:35,460
I think, oh man, well, I don't really want to get out of this line, but I'll have to

1228
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,900
make sure to flag those guys down later because I want to get for hippo and I'm really, really

1229
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,700
debating if I should get out of line because I feel like, you know, this line isn't going

1230
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,700
anywhere.

1231
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,740
I'm not going to be able to get in, but I still have that sliver of a, well, I might

1232
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,740
be able to get in.

1233
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,500
You know, you never know.

1234
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,980
So I wait, wait, wait, wait, is this still for the manga panel?

1235
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,980
So for the manga panel.

1236
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,980
Okay.

1237
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:01,460
So I brush it off and say, you know, I'll try and get them later.

1238
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:07,740
Then I see with them a man with big lips in a yellow shirt.

1239
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,740
No fucking way.

1240
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,740
No fucking way.

1241
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,580
Oh, I only see the side of his face and he has a fidget spinner.

1242
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,580
No fucking way.

1243
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,580
Dude.

1244
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,660
Are you kidding me?

1245
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:25,180
And I say to myself, that guy looks a lot like Hussey from this angle, but I mean, there's

1246
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,180
no way.

1247
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:32,580
Just like, that's pretty funny that that guy, there's, there's, I mean, it would be ridiculous

1248
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,580
if it were him.

1249
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,220
So clearly it can't be.

1250
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,220
It can't be.

1251
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,220
Yeah.

1252
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,220
There's no way.

1253
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,220
Yeah.

1254
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,980
Then, uh, you know, they, they, they leave.

1255
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,140
I only see this guy from the side of his face and they don't, they walk away the risk

1256
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,140
and all.

1257
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,140
And okay.

1258
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,140
Sure.

1259
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,140
So then the line gets in.

1260
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1261
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,140
So, sorry.

1262
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,660
This mystery person was hanging out with brisket cosplayers.

1263
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,660
Lol.

1264
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,660
Okay.

1265
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
Cool.

1266
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,660
Yeah.

1267
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,660
Uh, it was great.

1268
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,660
Uh, so, so yeah.

1269
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,420
So they walk off and, uh, so I'm like, okay.

1270
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:10,940
And then I stay in line and then we get like, it, it takes a long, like the panel is late.

1271
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,820
This will become a writing theme at literally every single panel.

1272
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:22,500
So I attended an expo was late by at least 15 minutes, right?

1273
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,700
At least if not like 30.

1274
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,700
Yeah.

1275
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,700
Yeah.

1276
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,700
Yeah.

1277
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:35,340
Uh, so I, we, we get in the lines marching and then, uh, the line just stops, but the

1278
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,980
staff doesn't say like it's full.

1279
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,540
It just stops.

1280
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,980
So we wait there again.

1281
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,980
It's late.

1282
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,140
It's, it's late against, it's still late by like 15 minutes.

1283
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,780
And then I wait, uh, an additional 17 minutes.

1284
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,060
And then the staff says, Oh, Hey, by the way, we just got word.

1285
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,220
The, uh, the room is full.

1286
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,220
You can't get in.

1287
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,220
It's a, yeah.

1288
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,220
They're closing the doors.

1289
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,220
Yeah.

1290
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,220
Bastards.

1291
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,220
Yeah.

1292
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:06,380
So we walk out, uh, keep in mind, I'm sweating as is everyone because it's fucking blistering

1293
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,860
and we're outside and no one has any water.

1294
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,660
So we're just sitting there fucking sweating our asses off.

1295
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,660
So I walk away.

1296
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,660
Yeah.

1297
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,580
And then I see a risk of cause player, not the same one, just a one.

1298
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:21,780
So I walk up to where I get a picture for, for hippo.

1299
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:27,900
And then I see, I turn my, I turn my head and I see a like a confederation, a league

1300
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,500
of Homestuck cause players, like at least 30.

1301
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,860
Now if you're a homestuck fan, 30 homes and call players probably seems like nothing because

1302
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:39,900
at cons, you know, in the hay day, there were fucking in the hay day, it was like, there

1303
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,300
were like more homestuck than anime is exactly.

1304
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,300
It was insanity.

1305
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,700
But you know, I, there were a lot and they were doing a shoot.

1306
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,140
So I got all the, I got all the risks there and it was pretty cool.

1307
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,820
I got to see everyone.

1308
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,860
I basically didn't like any of their cause plays, you know, really, I'm pretty, I'm

1309
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,860
pretty picky.

1310
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,860
That's unfortunate.

1311
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,860
Yeah.

1312
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,860
Yeah.

1313
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,860
Yeah.

1314
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,860
I would be too.

1315
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,860
Yeah.

1316
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,540
Like why fucking Homestuck Cosplay if you're not gonna, if you're not gonna fucking do

1317
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,540
it right.

1318
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,540
Yeah.

1319
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,540
Bitch.

1320
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,540
Anyway, anyway.

1321
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,540
So, so yeah.

1322
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:16,980
I began to walk away and, and I think back to that guy in the yell and I think, huh,

1323
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:21,580
well, if that was Andrew Hussie, first of all, that's crazy, but I wondered if he was

1324
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,580
here.

1325
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,740
That would be, that would have been funny.

1326
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,140
So I started walking away and then I see another risk of cosplay with a Tresi.

1327
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,020
Just there, there were a couple of risk is there.

1328
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,460
So I walk up to her and say, Hey, I can't get a picture.

1329
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,460
And she's like, yeah, sure.

1330
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:39,260
And then after I take it, she says, Hey, did you see Hussie here earlier, by the way?

1331
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,260
And I was like, uh-huh.

1332
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,180
Yeah.

1333
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,180
Yeah.

1334
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,180
And she's like, yeah, we got a picture.

1335
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,180
It was hanging out here earlier, like a couple of minutes before that one, uh, manga panel.

1336
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:56,500
And I was like, Oh, no, no, tragedy.

1337
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,780
I got my Homestuck book signed.

1338
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,900
Wait, wait, you found him?

1339
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,900
No, no, no, no.

1340
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,340
That's what she's saying to me.

1341
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,340
Oh.

1342
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,340
Yeah.

1343
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,340
Fuck.

1344
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,340
Fuck you, buddy.

1345
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,700
God damn it, Munchie.

1346
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,420
I am just, I'm just triggered as hell by this, by this tragic tale.

1347
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,020
What a bunch of bullshit.

1348
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,140
Fucking Hussie.

1349
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,140
Thanks Hussie.

1350
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,140
Thanks for everything.

1351
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,980
First, you fucking give us this anti-climactic bullshit ending and then you don't even sign

1352
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:32,580
Munchie's fucking book that he, that he brought to the anime expo to Anthro Expo for you to

1353
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,580
sign.

1354
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,100
It just makes me mad, man.

1355
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,060
It just makes me feel, just makes me, just makes me wonder what it was all for.

1356
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,820
It was, it was all for nothing.

1357
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:44,780
So I miss meeting, and I later confirmed on Twitter that someone took a picture with

1358
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:49,900
them and posted he was indeed having a fidget spinner and he was wearing a Minion shirt.

1359
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,940
He would.

1360
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,980
Anyway, so I don't meet Andrew Hussie.

1361
01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:00,460
And to those of you who don't know the Munchie lore, you think, okay, you didn't see one,

1362
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,500
you know, like author, a con.

1363
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,500
Yeah, yeah, no.

1364
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Big deal.

1365
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Yeah, that's, that's not, it's not like that.

1366
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:14,620
What is my favorite piece of media ever created?

1367
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,060
Not Kuiper Bowl.

1368
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,420
It is my favorite piece of media ever.

1369
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,420
And not only Homestuck.

1370
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,900
The problem with Sooth is up in my favorites as well.

1371
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,540
I love, I see, I'm not a fucking JoJo Brony.

1372
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,740
I've seen all of Andrew's stuff.

1373
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,220
I read all of his stuff.

1374
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,900
I went through all of the Teen Special Olympics.

1375
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,780
I've seen Wisdom of the Crown, Anna Don't Stop, all that shit.

1376
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,580
I've seen all, inappropriate time for him.

1377
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,580
Everything.

1378
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,740
Ryan Quest, oh, I guess that's not that weird, but you know what I mean.

1379
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:47,300
I'm a big, very big fan of Hussie.

1380
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,460
I love him.

1381
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,500
I model my entire life after him.

1382
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:56,620
I, his work has touched me in ways that no other work has ever done before.

1383
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:00,980
And I missed him because I didn't want to get out of line of the How To Draw Manga

1384
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,980
panel.

1385
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,780
I'm so fucking sorry, dude.

1386
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,380
That's like the saddest thing.

1387
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,980
That is like the saddest fucking thing.

1388
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,500
I don't even want to draw a manga.

1389
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,980
I want to draw Homestuck.

1390
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,780
Yup.

1391
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,580
That's the dream.

1392
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,580
That's the beautiful dream.

1393
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,580
It's not fucking fair.

1394
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:28,500
My heart, my heart goes out to you, munchman.

1395
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,420
The tragedy, the tragedy, oh, what is it?

1396
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,180
The tragedy is indescribable.

1397
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,180
What is it saying?

1398
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,180
What's the Homestuck line?

1399
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:38,480
The tragedy is, you know what I'm talking about?

1400
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,580
Like the tragedy is palpable or like the tragedy is indescribable?

1401
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,580
I think the tragedy is palpable.

1402
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,580
I think that's it.

1403
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,580
Yeah.

1404
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,580
Something like that.

1405
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,380
Some Homestuck bullshit.

1406
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:58,280
By the way, I've completely lost, I've completely lost what small handle I once had on this

1407
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,780
fucking fairy game.

1408
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,140
No, it's just, I mean, I grew this tree as big as

1409
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,300
it'll go, as it'll go, and I didn't find frog fractions.

1410
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,300
I almost said Homestuck.

1411
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,300
It's basically Homestuck.

1412
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,300
Where is it?

1413
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,300
Where is it?

1414
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,300
Where?

1415
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,380
I mean, you just need to go higher, I guess.

1416
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,140
I guess I just need to go, oh, you know what, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to fertilize

1417
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,140
this tree.

1418
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,300
Can't fertilize dead plant, eat my fucking ass.

1419
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,300
So that's in the first date.

1420
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:33,100
Well, not at the end of the night, but we do some other stuff, doesn't matter.

1421
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:38,900
So we, Donald the Second, oh, I think we meet up with Econ that day, and we just hang

1422
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,900
out.

1423
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:46,260
Donald the Second Day, we immediately go to the Yuri on Ice panel, because that panel

1424
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:51,560
is, you know, Digi likes that show, and I've seen a little bit of it, seems fine.

1425
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,560
So we go there.

1426
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:57,760
And I'm just going to copy what he said, because he's the anime guy, and he explained

1427
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,980
what was wrong with it good.

1428
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:09,060
At Otacon, quote, from Digi, quote, okay, this is me, this is Digi talking, at Otacon,

1429
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:12,500
there would have been a Sato Yanamoto panel, I think that's her name, the person who made

1430
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
Yuri on Ice.

1431
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,100
But basically, it was just full of fangirls, is the point, it was full of awful Fujioshis,

1432
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:23,020
they were fucking weird, there was like a slideshow before the panel, and it just was

1433
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,020
showing.

1434
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,100
I mean, that's who I, that's the kind of person I would have, I would have naively

1435
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:31,460
imagined would go to a Yuri on Ice panel.

1436
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:37,100
So basically, they just scream, and the person, you know, the creator, they're like, their

1437
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:41,020
mic is too far away from them, so we can't hear them.

1438
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:47,820
And all of the questions are just super fucking like, what inspires you?

1439
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,580
And then she was like, by skating.

1440
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:51,580
Cool.

1441
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,580
Good answer.

1442
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:58,540
And everything she said was just like wave of fangirl screens, so it was awful.

1443
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,540
So we leave that.

1444
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:00,540
Yeah.

1445
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,820
Actually, I think that was day one, that might have been day one, oh yeah, okay, that was

1446
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:04,820
day one.

1447
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:11,700
On day two, we go there, and there's like a shitty like voice actor panel, we see the,

1448
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,860
we sit in line for the, like we sit in the room for the trigger thing, because they don't

1449
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,020
clear rooms, so our strat was just to go to the earliest panel and then just stay in the

1450
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,020
front row.

1451
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,420
And it worked, worked flawlessly.

1452
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,140
Econ stage was some C2, shot to Econ.

1453
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:31,660
So we get there, we see the Fooly Cooly 2 and 3 panel.

1454
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:36,340
Oh yeah, I heard that the trailers, that the Fooly Cooly 2 and 3 trailers are out, haven't

1455
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:41,060
seen them, don't want, I don't want to think about them, makes me mad.

1456
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:46,180
I don't know anything about anime, is my response to those panels, I don't know what

1457
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,860
Fooly Cooly is.

1458
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:48,860
Yeah.

1459
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,740
Well, it used to be good.

1460
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,740
Okay.

1461
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:58,100
That's all you need to know, it's a thing that I used to, I would have wanted it, maybe

1462
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,340
one time in my life I would have wanted this, but not anymore.

1463
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,340
Yeah.

1464
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:08,780
So we see that, and then we see the trigger panel, and trigger, here are the anime that

1465
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:15,820
I've seen, Gurren Lagann, Kill a Kill, Panty and Stocking, The Jojo Animes But Those Don't

1466
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,380
Count, Avan Galeon.

1467
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,380
Noticing a trend.

1468
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,420
Yeah.

1469
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,940
And Popey the Reformer, that's kind of an outliner, but I just like ones.

1470
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:24,940
Yeah.

1471
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,940
Of course.

1472
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,540
We all, we're all with the other ones.

1473
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,140
I'm deep in the Juggler culture.

1474
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:33,980
Anyway, so trigger is the only studio that I actually know.

1475
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,220
I only know about Gainex and Trigger, I mean, obviously I know the names of the ones, I

1476
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:46,420
know Kyoto Animation, you know, Shaft, I know the names of shit, just because I've been

1477
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,740
around Digilaw, I know a little bit about anime, but you know, I don't give a shit about

1478
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,540
any that's not trigger.

1479
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:53,940
Yeah, of course.

1480
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,940
I mean, who would?

1481
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,940
I agree.

1482
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,940
So we go to that.

1483
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,940
It's pretty good.

1484
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,940
Yeah.

1485
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,940
They didn't ask three new shows.

1486
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:07,420
The only, even though it was late, as, you know, the fully coolie one, and every other,

1487
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,740
even though it was late, it was fun.

1488
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:16,340
We were first, we were like, like, the trigger like posted a tweet of the crowd, and I was

1489
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:19,380
literally like front and center in the photo.

1490
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,380
Like, oh, on the official trigger Twitter, trigger Twitter.

1491
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,380
Yeah, good.

1492
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,380
Um, fucking cool.

1493
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,380
Yeah, I would have gone to that.

1494
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,380
I would have been excited for that.

1495
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,380
Yeah, it was cool.

1496
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:33,380
Although, you know what, you know what I'll say about trigger, um, uh, fuck trigger,

1497
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,820
um, I've given up on them, they suck now because I watched Luluko and everyone told me Luluko

1498
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,340
was really great and I watched it and I hated it.

1499
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,340
Really?

1500
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,340
Yeah, it was dumb.

1501
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,340
It was boring.

1502
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:46,940
The purpose was to be like a fucking mishmash of other trigger shows, but it was just a

1503
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,940
fucking mishmash of other trigger shows.

1504
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,940
Why did I need to watch it?

1505
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,940
I don't know.

1506
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,940
I just thought it was terrible.

1507
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:52,940
I mean, not terrible.

1508
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,140
Oh, well, I got through the whole thing and I was like, well, that was a waste of my

1509
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,140
time.

1510
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,140
Did that just say autism on your screen right now?

1511
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,140
No, it said autism.

1512
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,140
Okay.

1513
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,140
It came autumn.

1514
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,140
I thought it knew what I'm talking about.

1515
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,140
No, no, no.

1516
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,140
Soon.

1517
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,740
They'll all know soon.

1518
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:10,340
My plan is I want to get into anime somewhat.

1519
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,340
Why?

1520
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,180
Just a little bit.

1521
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,580
So my plan is to one day just watch all Gainex and trigger shows and then only watch like

1522
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:18,580
normally shit.

1523
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:21,780
So I can have a cursory understanding of what's happening.

1524
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:24,620
I mean, anime must be good for something, right?

1525
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,380
Like anime must have some appeal.

1526
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,380
Maybe.

1527
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,380
Maybe.

1528
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,380
I don't know, man.

1529
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,980
I don't know about all that.

1530
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,380
Yeah, I want to do that.

1531
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,380
But anyway, we saw that.

1532
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,780
That was pretty good.

1533
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:42,180
Then we, after that, it was basically just nothing.

1534
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:45,180
Like, we don't, like, here's the thing.

1535
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,020
The con is awful.

1536
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:51,180
We don't want to ever be at the con, ever.

1537
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,180
Yeah.

1538
01:08:52,180 --> 01:09:00,180
Like, I had a great, years ago, I had a great time in Baltimore, the weekend of Otacon.

1539
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,980
And I didn't go to Otacon.

1540
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,980
And like, I was just there.

1541
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:08,260
Like I was just there at the time and like saw people who were there for Otacon.

1542
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,180
And that was like 75% of the appeal anyway.

1543
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,180
Yeah.

1544
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,180
Exactly.

1545
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:21,180
I hate, I hate these, where, I'm just, okay, like I want to fucking, I want to fuck, I

1546
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:26,060
chopped all the branches off of this fucking tree and now I can't like, I can't like ascend.

1547
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:30,420
I have to fucking WV ascend this tree.

1548
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,980
And uh, what is this, pantry?

1549
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,980
Maybe we should just restart.

1550
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,980
I mean,

1551
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,740
Maybe you fucked too much about the early game.

1552
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,740
I don't think so.

1553
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,900
I think it's just like, it's just slow going.

1554
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:48,860
Uh, I just, I just, hang on, maybe if I, maybe if I fertilize this tree a little bit, oh

1555
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:49,860
it's dead.

1556
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:50,860
Oh my god.

1557
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:56,020
Oh no, that one's not, I mean, it says it's not dead, but it's not growing.

1558
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:58,780
All right, whatever, this one, this one will grow.

1559
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,020
This one will fucking do me.

1560
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:09,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, bigger, bigger, higher, more, big tree, big tree, big tree, uh, building's

1561
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:10,940
side orb.

1562
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,940
No, I'm all out of sparkles.

1563
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:12,940
I should build more prisons.

1564
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,940
Do it Iceman.

1565
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,940
I should build more prisons.

1566
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,940
Do it Iceman.

1567
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:16,940
What?

1568
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,940
Do it Iceman.

1569
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:18,940
Uh.

1570
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:19,940
Do it Iceman.

1571
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:20,940
Do it.

1572
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,500
I just, I know it's up there.

1573
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,500
You know what?

1574
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:29,460
Maybe I should, maybe I should be refocusing my efforts and trying to dig down to it.

1575
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:36,500
But like, it's just, there's like so much shit down there, like, I don't feel safe.

1576
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,500
Are there like enemies in this game?

1577
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,500
No, I don't think so.

1578
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
All right, you know what?

1579
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,500
Forget the trees.

1580
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:47,500
They're hard and they're finicky and they're needy and they don't like them.

1581
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,500
They're bitches.

1582
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Um, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, there we go.

1583
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good.

1584
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,500
Okay, we're going, we're going underground.

1585
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
We're going down.

1586
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,500
It's winter time.

1587
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Oh, I have no food.

1588
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Um, shit.

1589
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,500
Fucked.

1590
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
What happened to my fucking thimbleberries?

1591
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,500
What happened to my fucking thimbleberries?

1592
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,500
No, no, but like, why am I, why are my stores so low already?

1593
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,500
I, I, like, I built so many pantries.

1594
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,500
Like, I built two extra pantries.

1595
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,500
No clue.

1596
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,500
Okay.

1597
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,500
We're going down.

1598
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,500
We're going down.

1599
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,500
This is gonna be tough.

1600
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,500
This is gonna be tough and I don't think we're gonna survive.

1601
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
Great.

1602
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,500
I don't think, I don't, I don't think most of my fairies are gonna stick around through

1603
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,500
the winter.

1604
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,500
But that's all right.

1605
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,500
You know what?

1606
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:36,500
Only the, only the true believers.

1607
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
Oh, sweet food.

1608
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,500
Um, that'll help, like, two guys for a minute.

1609
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Yeah.

1610
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,500
Uh, shit.

1611
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,500
All right.

1612
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:52,500
So, so most of the time we just spend, like, time in the hotel room just fucking around.

1613
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,500
Yeah.

1614
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:58,500
Oh, except we couldn't for a little while because Nate was, was, was talking, was talking

1615
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
to his girlfriend.

1616
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,500
Does he have a girlfriend?

1617
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,500
Oh, he doesn't want to call her a girlfriend.

1618
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,500
It's based, like, like for all intents and purposes.

1619
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Just, it's his girlfriend.

1620
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
Is it someone I know?

1621
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,500
Uh, I don't know.

1622
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,500
I mean, it's public.

1623
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,500
He talks about it.

1624
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
So I guess I don't feel too bad.

1625
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,500
Michelle Tobis.

1626
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,500
Oh.

1627
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,500
Oh.

1628
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,500
Does, do I know that person?

1629
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,500
I don't know.

1630
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,500
Do you?

1631
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,500
No?

1632
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,500
Okay.

1633
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
I mean, I wondered, okay, cool.

1634
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,500
That's news to me.

1635
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
Does he, does he talk about this on his Twitter or something?

1636
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,500
Yeah.

1637
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,500
Well, I mean.

1638
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,500
So I haven't been paying attention.

1639
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:40,500
I mean, I'm sure he's intrigued stuff and I think he said it on a podcast or something.

1640
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,500
I don't know.

1641
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,500
Maybe he hasn't said it publicly.

1642
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Maybe.

1643
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
I don't know.

1644
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,500
I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if this is true and I just don't know about

1645
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,500
it, you know.

1646
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
I feel like, I feel like he hasn't said it publicly.

1647
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,500
That's believable.

1648
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,500
That's believable.

1649
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:01,500
But yeah, but just to clarify, he does not call her his girlfriend.

1650
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,500
And so it's not like a first story thing.

1651
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,500
But you know.

1652
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,500
All right.

1653
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
Like.

1654
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
But it's functionally, that's what it is.

1655
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,500
Yeah.

1656
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,500
Functionally, that's what it is.

1657
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,500
Okay.

1658
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,500
Fair enough.

1659
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,500
Yeah.

1660
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,500
Gotcha.

1661
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,500
Come on.

1662
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,500
Come on.

1663
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Times four.

1664
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,500
I'm times four.

1665
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,500
I'm times four fast forward playing.

1666
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,500
I just, I just need, I just need to dig.

1667
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,500
I just have to dig and just wait for winter to be over.

1668
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,500
Oh, the fairies are leaving.

1669
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Oh, the fairies are leaving.

1670
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,500
Oh, shit.

1671
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,500
Get fucked, dude.

1672
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Like how they don't leave or die.

1673
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,500
Or, I mean, they don't die.

1674
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,500
They leave.

1675
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,500
I actually might like lose this game.

1676
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,500
You might.

1677
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,500
Everyone might, everyone might leave because I'm out of food.

1678
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,500
You might have to restart.

1679
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,500
I might have to restart.

1680
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,500
Fuck.

1681
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,500
Oh.

1682
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:54,500
I've got like shit tons of sparkles though.

1683
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,500
Like I've got my, my sparkle game is on point.

1684
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,500
Hmm.

1685
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Oh, wait, some more.

1686
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,500
Oh, twinkle fancy heart came back and she brought food.

1687
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,500
Oh my God.

1688
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,500
What are you saying?

1689
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,500
Well, she brought like, she brought like four food, but I mean, I'll take it.

1690
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,500
Yeah.

1691
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,500
Yeah.

1692
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,500
It's pretty good of her.

1693
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,500
Pretty good of her.

1694
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,500
Twinkle, twinkle fancy bum.

1695
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,500
Twinkle fuck.

1696
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Twinkle, twinkle fuck.

1697
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,500
Okay.

1698
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Now we got food.

1699
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,500
Now we got food.

1700
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
It's only a matter of time before everyone comes back.

1701
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,500
So don't wait.

1702
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
And look at these, and look at these berries.

1703
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
We got these sweet berries over here on this, on this.

1704
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,500
It's spring.

1705
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Yeah.

1706
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,500
Yeah.

1707
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,500
I uncovered this tree.

1708
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,500
It's spring now.

1709
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,500
Yep.

1710
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,500
We're good.

1711
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,500
We made it.

1712
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
Hey.

1713
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,500
Oh.

1714
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,500
Nate, hanging out with a girlfriend was the worst part of the con, except it wasn't.

1715
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,500
Why?

1716
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,500
It was fine.

1717
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,500
There was no actual problem.

1718
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Oh, damn.

1719
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,500
Fuck.

1720
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,500
That's not what I wanted to hear.

1721
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,500
And it was good for him.

1722
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,500
All right.

1723
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,500
I don't care.

1724
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,500
Cool.

1725
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,500
Cool, bro.

1726
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,500
There was that shit.

1727
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,500
Are you on, what day are we on now?

1728
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,500
Well, like on day three.

1729
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,500
He met up with her.

1730
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,500
How many days was it?

1731
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,500
Four.

1732
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Okay.

1733
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,500
But day four was negligible.

1734
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,500
Negicable.

1735
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,500
Negicable.

1736
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,500
Negicable.

1737
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,500
Hello.

1738
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,500
Hello.

1739
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,500
This is Christian Weston Chandler, creator of Sonichu, the electric hedgehog poker.

1740
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,500
Here to tell you.

1741
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:26,500
Here to tell you that I am feeling good and my stress due to the trolls and internet bullies

1742
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:32,500
is currently negligible.

1743
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,500
I'm going to kill you.

1744
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,500
Fuck.

1745
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,500
Yeah, yeah.

1746
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,500
That's fine.

1747
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,500
That's good.

1748
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,500
Actually.

1749
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,500
So yeah, just a ton of shit happens.

1750
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,500
We go to a Japanese restaurant.

1751
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,500
I think about investigator and how cool it is.

1752
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,500
Oh, you met up with Sai.

1753
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,500
No.

1754
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,500
No.

1755
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,500
Cider.

1756
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,500
You know I hate Sai, right?

1757
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,500
I don't know how anyone feels about Sai anymore.

1758
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,500
I mean, I hear people saying they love Sai.

1759
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,500
I hear people saying they hate Sai.

1760
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,500
I don't know how much of this is real.

1761
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:05,500
How much of this is just some kind of Truman show Eskipa Sai.

1762
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,500
I fucking hate Sai so much.

1763
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,500
I see.

1764
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,500
I see.

1765
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,500
So much.

1766
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,500
What did he do?

1767
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,500
He's literally the worst PCP fan.

1768
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,500
He's so fucking bad, dude.

1769
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,500
I mean, he's a good boy.

1770
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,500
He's so fucking bad.

1771
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,500
He does his best.

1772
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,500
Oh, a hexacomb seed.

1773
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,500
I don't know what that is, but it's exciting.

1774
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Frog fractions, where you'll be, I'll go.

1775
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Where you'll be, I'll find you.

1776
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,500
Yeah.

1777
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,500
We met up with Cider.

1778
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,500
I would never talk to Sai ever.

1779
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Earlier today, Jesse and Digi and Nate and Monkey all recorded a thing about Monkey's

1780
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,500
book, and Monkey wanted to bring Sai on, but me and Jesse just would not allow it.

1781
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,500
We just wouldn't let that happen.

1782
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:14,500
Monkey is a big Sai supporter for whatever reason.

1783
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,500
Yeah, it's awful.

1784
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,500
There's something going on there, if you know what I mean.

1785
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,500
You know what I'm saying.

1786
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,500
It seems a little...

1787
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,500
Sai?

1788
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,500
More like, oral cum shot on my right, bros.

1789
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,500
Yeah, bro.

1790
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,500
Yeah, bro.

1791
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,500
Sai fucked.

1792
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,500
That's the opposite.

1793
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,500
He's a sexy man with a girlfriend.

1794
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,500
Yeah.

1795
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,500
Yeah, man.

1796
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,500
I want to meet Sai's girlfriend so I can ask why.

1797
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,500
What's wrong with Sai?

1798
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,500
Observe his actions.

1799
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,500
Observe him.

1800
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:59,500
Observe his habitat the way he is, the way he acts, the things that he say.

1801
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,500
Observe him do.

1802
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:05,500
I won't, but I'll take your word for it, I guess.

1803
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:10,500
Everything about him is a perfect storm of horrible things.

1804
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,500
He is the alpha and the omega of horrible actions.

1805
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,500
He is awful.

1806
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,500
Observe.

1807
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,500
He has no redeeming qualities.

1808
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,500
I mean, he is what he is, you know?

1809
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,500
He is what he is, and no more and no less.

1810
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,500
He's less than the sum of his parts.

1811
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,500
Jesus Christ.

1812
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,500
He doesn't deserve to exist.

1813
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,500
I mean, I see it.

1814
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,500
I see it.

1815
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,500
I see it.

1816
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,500
He's the light on reality.

1817
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,500
He's the lord agents of our session.

1818
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,500
Terrible.

1819
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,500
Terrible at Pokemon.

1820
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,500
Terrible at Pokemon.

1821
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,500
Just an embarrassment.

1822
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,500
So bad.

1823
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:40,500
Please let him in.

1824
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,500
And him now.

1825
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,500
Before.

1826
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Before.

1827
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,500
Before.

1828
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,500
Before.

1829
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,500
Before.

1830
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,500
Before.

1831
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,500
Before.

1832
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,500
Before.

1833
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,500
Before.

1834
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,500
Before.

1835
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Before.

1836
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,500
Before.

1837
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,500
Before.

1838
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500
And him now.

1839
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,580
Before.

1840
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:02,840
Before the charade can go on any longer.

1841
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,980
Listen, Maiden, listen to this.

2020
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:58,260
cannot stop laughing for like 20 minutes afterwards loudly in the middle of

2021
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:02,420
like a mostly quiet panel and like there's like a guy that like in front of

2022
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:05,500
us just says hey I know you're not enjoying this penalty please be quite

2023
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:09,020
for people who are enjoying it and like we try and supple we just can't we can't

2024
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:17,500
stop laughing about I know you're not enjoying this panel how did he know it

2025
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:21,580
seemed like you guys were having a great time yeah they get another question so

2026
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:25,660
you guys work for Pixar what was that like and then I lean over and say they

2027
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:30,660
made the fun of us for using gimp even though they are just Photoshop loyalists

2028
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:35,020
they're wasting their money for gimp can do anything for sure can do but the

2029
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:42,780
better and for free oh man I wish I'd been there it would have been great so

2030
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:48,840
yeah we go home her to the hotel and literally from like 11 no let me from

2031
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:53,460
like 12 to 2 in the morning we stay in bed with the lights out trying to go to

2032
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:58,580
sleep but we can't stop making gimp jokes but how great gimp is about how

2033
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,740
like like immaculate of a program it is and how we're gonna install Linux and

2034
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:08,580
like get gimp to get the most like pure open software experience of all time and

2035
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:12,140
how photoshop is a piece of shit it's only for industry loyalists and then how

2036
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:17,060
gimp is like like like the populist vote and it's gonna like like change the it's

2037
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:22,060
like it's like the Bernie Sanders of drawing programs yeah free open source

2038
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:26,820
knew everything I'm gonna do but better and for free there's no point in not

2039
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:34,460
ever and for yeah well sure I mean even even if it can't send our text if you

2040
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:38,140
learn how to center it yourself that's better because you get the experience you

2041
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:44,220
get the industry knowledge yeah yeah it's it's like I mean I mean using gimp

2042
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:48,860
is like it's like wearing the master Roshi turtle shell when you train like

2043
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:53,980
you just become a better warrior yeah yeah and it's for free it's for free so

2044
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:59,020
yeah there's no so so what's your excuse what's your what's your excuse you

2045
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:03,340

2048
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,340
news like all news is biased so you just have to you just have to believe what

2086
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:49,460
that I guess yeah replicated in over the internet but it wouldn't feel the same

2087
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:56,740
it's just talking about like real shit like real shit bro you know yeah I mean

2088
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:59,560
that's what that's what friends do right you sit around and talk about real

2089
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:06,460
shit yeah and yeah you know like being in the PCP being in the PCP like all the

2090
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:11,620
PCP guys are like my good friends and compatriots and stuff but you know it's

2091
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:16,820
outside of Radcon we don't get to like hang out and and and just fucking be like

2092
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:23,700
IRL friends very much which is a little sad and getting sad thinking yeah I mean

2093
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:29,420
and even like it's just not in our nature I don't think to like just call

2094
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:35,540
each other no it's really not like like I really am like sometimes I feel bad

2095
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:39,500
like sometimes I feel guilty sometimes I feel bad like I never just like I never

2096
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:44,700
just like I don't know like Skype munchy or hippo right it would be like how are

2097
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:49,100
things going but then like I mean none of us do it like none of us do that I we

2098
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:53,180
just kind of we just kind of like passively like no that one another are

2099
01:41:53,180 --> 01:42:00,260
like allies yeah and can be called upon in times apparel it were a league I mean

2100
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:04,740
yeah I mean my friend Ethan do you know who that is he's like even cartoons

2101
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:11,620
Ethan cartoons no that's a good guy anyway it doesn't matter like like he is the

2102
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:19,140
only guy who I still like play video games with yeah like a relica like an

2103
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:24,140
like an ancient relic like yeah I like it's not even that much anymore which is

2104
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:29,180
a shame I really enjoy it like sometimes if the mood is just right I will like

2105
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:35,940
play a video game with someone and I can imagine that's not what any of you do

2106
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:40,020
and it's not like I even do it a lot I do like maybe once a week at the very

2107
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:46,020
most I mean I pop into Pokemon showdown every once in a while but I don't that

2108
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:50,860
doesn't feel like playing video games that's just like a thing other than that

2109
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:54,380
like yeah I never like I almost never play video games like once in a blue

2110
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:58,180
moon I'll like try out some new game that I saw on state on sale on steam or

2111
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:02,820
something well I meant that I will like we'll get into like a Skype call and

2112
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:08,460
like like talk to each other and play a game you know you know what used to be

2113
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:14,780
like that is me every now and then mage used to like message me on Skype and

2114
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:18,980
ask me if I wanted to watch anime with her and every now and then I would do

2115
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:23,580
yeah yeah that used to happen like god I want that that used to happen like a

2116
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:29,580
bunch but I don't know me and mage haven't I mean it's not even not just mage

2117
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,940
but like ever like everyone but yeah we haven't we haven't done that in a while

2118
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:38,460
should we I mean that's something we should do I mean it was it was fun

2119
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:43,300
once in a while like pretty often I'd be like cuz like you know I don't actually

2120
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,380
really yeah we're busy guys and like frankly you know we don't really care

2121
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:52,260
that much about anime so it was just so so I wasn't doing it like for the

2122
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:56,340
anime I was just I was just doing it I would just do it for like you know

2123
01:43:56,340 --> 01:44:01,020
friends actually you know what back in the day me and mage had a couple of like

2124
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:05,980
real heart-to-hearts and God man it's been forever yeah that was like that was

2125
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:10,620
like two or three years ago that seems like I barely sometimes I forget that

2126
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:16,020
even happened but it totally did yeah I think last time I did that over the

2127
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:23,700
internet was like four frog fractions one like yeah me too like after our

2128
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:29,820
fractions over we continue to talk shit but about different people yeah we talked

2129
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:34,340
a lot of shit that day it was great I had a lot of fun doing that that was

2130
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:40,100
fantastic yeah me too and I've kind of I've been I've been missing it actually

2131
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:45,660
like that's I mean one I just I just love the ratty fuckers cop killers brand

2132
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:50,100
and want to contribute to it in any way that I can but also it was yeah yeah it

2133
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:55,140
was magical and here we are and here we are finally back how many it's been like

2134
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:59,700
two months or more something like that yeah that's yeah we yeah I want to get

2135
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:04,020
we want to make more make more ratty fuckers hang out with my my boy Munchie

2136
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:07,740
it didn't get didn't get to hang out with you at anime expo and that's real

2137
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:13,140
sad but whatever we can we can make up for it would it be on the internet like

2138
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:20,380
cost-effective at all to like not just me you like in general for like for any of

2139
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:26,980
us to meet halfway would that be worth it like at all like like in Texas

2140
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:35,140
somewhere or something I think that probably it's cheaper like for no I

2141
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:40,140
think probably it's cheaper like I mean but for two people it's probably cheaper

2142
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:45,460
for like one person to travel and the two of them to split the ticket costs

2143
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:51,220
meeting in the middle is it's a nice idea I don't think I don't know how much

2144
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:55,340
it would actually say yeah I don't think it would but I figured you know I might

2145
01:45:55,340 --> 01:46:02,660
as well ask yeah I just I do I want it I want so bad I just want to do me too

2146
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:09,820
yeah I mean I think I think we could I mean you're talking about are you talking

2147
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:13,820
about Radcon 3 or are you talking about anything Radcon anything you know one

2148
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:22,500
one whatever anything you know monkey was monkey was bummed when it was

2149
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:26,540
discussed that like we were all gonna move out of Digi house because well at

2150
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:30,540
the time it seemed like we were gonna move to Austin Texas and he was like

2151
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:34,940
well don't do that because right now you're only like a couple hours away

2152
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:39,180
for me and if you move to Austin you'll be like six hours away from me because

2153
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:42,860
at the because at Digi's house it was like a long but not an unreasonably

2154
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:47,260
long drive like for him to just come visit but now it's like even worse now

2155
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:50,180
it's now it's we're all just like scattered to the winds and there is no

2156
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:57,020

2164
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:47,420
not every day I mean like we've got the PCP but the PCP isn't really hanging out

2165
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:54,620
it's not the PCP is it's great I love it as a vehicle to podcast and to hang out

2166
01:47:54,620 --> 01:48:00,540
like it is nice to talk to people that way but yeah like we can't we can't do

2167
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:04,100
the real shit there because it's very first couple is the only place where we

2168
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:10,620
get real real shit yeah yeah we don't we can't we can't you know cuz we're

2169
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:17,860
all on we're all on on the PCP we're all like being as as we're all going at it

2170
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:25,580
real hard we're all jousting it's all jousts of words yeah and a clash of

2171
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:33,580
ideologies your weird utilitarianism versus being good yeah yeah yeah being a

2172
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:37,540
real person being being a human

2173
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:50,100
hang on I gotta take a I gotta take a long slow sip of my mio energy nice by

2174
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:56,060
the way shout out to Nate yeah when I was a when I was a wee boy like just

2175
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:04,180
watching the PCP or yeah like wait you knew us before the PCP yes okay okay

2176
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:10,380
we'll go on sorry yeah yeah all right like I always like kind of knew at least

2177
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:15,180
I thought I knew who I would have like chemistry with and who I wouldn't like I

2178
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:19,860
knew from the first burning con that me and you were good and I knew me and did

2179
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:24,660
you were good and I thought you know I can get along with hippo and a few

2180
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:30,300
people but I me and Nate are like great together we we are we have great

2181
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:35,300
chemistry together and I knew before in an expo and like I knew that at radcon

2182
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:39,460
and ever and ever since then everything we've been in has been really great I

2183
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:48,180
really really enjoy Nate so shout out to Nate I love him a lot me and Nate you

2184
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:54,540
know like ever we still we still have like no plans to fucking hashtag max

2185
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:59,660
revive tbap and do a ben and Nate thing because like tbap was founded on the

2186
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:03,980
ben and Nate chemistry and it has like it has never never again has it been

2187
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:11,900
capitalized upon or used for fucking anything and it's fucking sad yeah maybe

2188
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:16,700
if maybe if fucking wee PCP years like fucking took the time out of our days to

2189
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:20,020
talk to each other maybe we could maybe we maybe things could happen you know

2190
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:23,900
maybe this you know this isn't even like a group-wide PCP thing this is like

2191
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:31,460
this this is like maybe and bitter but like I'm I'm I don't know man like hit

2192
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:35,300
like hippo like hippo and Jesse have the have the have their podcast their

2193
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:39,180
their pony cast like hippo and Nate have the have the po-d cast and like

2194
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:47,420
monkey and Digi have the whatever and I'm like man and I'm like man you know

2195
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:51,180
like it's not really like this but it feels sometimes like everyone else is

2196
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:54,020
doing all this is doing all this interesting stuff on the side and I'm

2197
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:58,340
just stuck on the sidelines but then I remember that like no not really everyone

2198
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:02,340
else is pretty much only has like one or maybe two things going on and like I've

2199
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:05,460
got the I've got ready fuckers cop killers I've got I've got ready fuckers

2200
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:08,860
cop killers I've just let it lie fallow for like two months because I don't know

2201
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:14,700
why so let's not do that yeah yeah ever since I was crowned chancellor of the

2202
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,780
PCB draw cast I've I've been coming with plans for like a schedule for the

2203
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:24,860
draw cast oh god yes more draw cast I would do a draw cast like at least once

2204
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:29,220
a month that's my plan once a month yeah a draw cast once a month and rowdy

2205
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:32,980
fuckers cop killers like twice a month you want twice a month I'm down twice a

2206
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:36,420
month are you down I thought we talked yeah I thought like once a month would

2207
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:42,180
be like the bare minimum yeah okay yeah I'm down with that okay cool I mean I I

2208
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:48,100
do love right fuckers cop killers we do need because I hate the green PCP one

2209
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:54,140
not that I was aesthetically bad but just that it is the PCP I mean we're

2210
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:58,940
like I mean different guys completely different yeah no really there's no

2211
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:02,780
relation to the to the Ben St. and Munchie of PCP fame

2212
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:08,180
different universes this is us this is us unfiltered unfiltered I just I mean raw

2213
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:14,180
I just use the I just use the green was was rowdy fuckers cop killers the first

2214
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:20,820
show to use like a palette swap yes okay well it seemed like a good idea at the

2215
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:25,220
time it was but then but then it became never but then the convention became

2216
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:30,860
adopted that like other shows got their own color palettes and yeah this is this

2217
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:36,420
is not this is not like a draw cast which is just the PCP but withdrawing

2218
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:41,420
this is this is the real shit this is the raw shit you know and I don't think

2219
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:45,780
any of us thought that it would like I had no idea in my mind that I would ever

2220
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:49,980
even be on the PCP channel again after the recording the reference cop killers

2221
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:57,900
oh that's right that was before you were on the PCP I forgot about that okay yeah

2222
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:03,100
me after that recording what he'd never that was like the first time you guys

2223
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:07,980
talked right yeah I think I think he was just kind of baffled I think he was

2224
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:14,500
just kind of like what do I even say to all this it was good um yeah a rowdy

2225
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:20,020
fuckers cop killers deserves its own channel branding branding oh shit it's

2226
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:25,260
own shit I don't think so just yet not just not yeah yeah I like it would be

2227
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:28,940
pretty cool but like not yet soon soon that's that's a straight that's a stretch

2228
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:36,380
goal dude Ben can you fucking imagine PCPHQ every like other week week like I

2229
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:39,460
come over you have to come over to mine and like we record reference cop killers

2230
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:44,860
in person and like chill out can you imagine that sounds that sounds like

2231
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:52,940
pretty much the most fun I can imagine in this lifetime I would like that a

2232
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:58,980
whole bunch yeah I would I would be way into that and I think man oh man it sure

2233
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:02,860
is exciting it sure is exciting for me to hear that like Atlanta seems like the

2234
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:08,940
spot cuz that's just like like I moved down here to Atlanta kind like kind of

2235
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:11,900
hoping that like other people would following but with like the full

2236
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:15,460
knowledge that it was not necessarily gonna happen that I might just end up

2237
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:20,660
coming on my own and that would be what it would be what do you think about like

2238
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:28,580
like I am not sold on Atlanta merely because I have not been there what do I

2239
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:32,460
think about Atlanta I mean like like what would you like could you even

2240
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:36,940
possibly consider like moving to a different part for the HQ I could like

2241
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:45,020
a different city or are you like nailed down to Atlanta I'm I'm I would say I'm

2242
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:59,300
I would say I'm pretty nailed down it would have to like I would I mean I'm

2243
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:08,780
gonna say I'm fairly nailed down yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean and for me I can go

2244
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:17,740
anywhere at least yeah do time I can go anywhere yeah I mean if fucking people

2245
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:22,700
came and lived around Atlanta I mean I would be really excited and not like not

2246
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:27,180
just for my own sake like I think Atlanta is a pretty good choice like you

2247
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:31,340
know I mean there's there's people there's good people there's anime people

2248
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:35,940
and like it's just a pretty cool city it's got I mean I really like I haven't

2249
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:39,060
spent like a ton of time in the city proper but the time I have spent there

2250
01:55:39,060 --> 01:55:42,100
like you know there's a good fucking there's good public transit which is

2251
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:45,380
like a big deal for me like that's what like that's pretty much what makes a

2252
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:50,020
good city for me is like good public transit and like there's a subway and

2253
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:54,420
there's just like some cool fucking downtown zones and like there's you know

2254
01:55:54,420 --> 01:56:00,340
cool bars and whatever and it's just I mean like I really liked Boston and I

2255
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:04,740
think Atlanta pretty much has all the attractions that Boston had so you know

2256
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:11,940
thumbs up for me I'm like I'm sure when I if I ever go there if when I ever go

2257
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:18,660
there I will be pretty down but I I know it's pretty like like well duh but I

2258
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:23,300
kind of like my home city I'm kind of like yeah I'm pretty yeah I'm pretty in

2259
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:30,100
favor of it I mean I would be I wouldn't I could had a complete sway I would like

2260
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:36,020
to live I would like to live in San Diego all my life I would really like to

2261
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:43,060
visit San Diego I'm gonna shill San Diego real quick just shill it real quick

2262
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:47,540
first sure dude go for it it's a coastal city which is a big thing for me I

2263
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:53,220
don't know how much it is for anyone else but I really like the ocean okay I

2264
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:57,060
don't really care about the ocean but whatever whatever there's a lot of other

2265
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:02,420
like podcasts were based here there's there's a sleepy cast and it's like close

2266
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:06,180
to LA which is where you know everyone is but it's not in LA so it's not super

2267
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:10,660
expensive or anything or hard to get around in it's like it's close enough to

2268
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:15,460
LA to where like okay if I ever need to meet someone LA I can do it I can I can

2269
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:20,980
do it but it's not like to the point of where it's gonna be always crowded and

2270
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:27,460
so in LA people like meme a lot about it it is a meme city it is expensive and

2271
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:31,540
you know congested but that's only because there's so much shit to do there

2272
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:36,820
that like there it is warranted to want to be there a lot there's a ton of

2273
01:57:36,820 --> 01:57:43,220
talent there and it's for the pcp like as a business I know I don't mean any of

2274
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:47,860
the only people who give a single shit about like growing the pcp at all but

2275
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:51,700
if we ever wanted to be issues about that that would be a great location do it or

2276
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:59,620
or you know anywhere like like population center would be great and uh yeah so it's

2277
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:04,820
close to that and plus there's just a ton of like places to hang out there and I

2278
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:07,620
know there's like a ton of places that there's oh in a city there's gonna be

2279
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:11,940
tons of places to hang out but uh there's like a lot of like varied locations

2280
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:15,380
there's a lot of rich there's a lot of poor places there's a lot of rich places

2281
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:19,540
very very it's it's a very varied city so if you ever want to like hang out with

2282
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:22,660
homeless people you can go out to the yeah go to the homeless people place if you

2283
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:25,780
want to hang out with rich people you can go to the rich people place it's very

2284
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:30,740
diverse in a lot of ways and it's pretty cheap if you know where to go uh there's

2285
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:34,580
some like you know free food play like it there's just a lot of varied places you

2286
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:38,580
can go so you can uh fucking hang out a lot and I know like the back of my hand

2287
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:43,940
there's a lot there's a lot of interesting unique places that I guess like I'm sure

2288
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:47,700
there are places like that it landed but I just don't know about them so I don't

2289
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:53,700
know mm-hmm and uh yeah I'd love I'd love to visit I'd love to come visit uh

2290
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:57,060
fuck it man yeah it'd be really great if I could

2291
01:58:57,060 --> 01:59:01,700
fucking uh get out there at some point oh and we could chill in your home city

2292
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:08,100
and also there is I don't like there is from my perspective good public transport

2293
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:12,820
like like there are a lot of but stops is there bus stops around but but stops

2294
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:17,380
is that the is that the city with all the trolleys uh no i'm thinking of san francisco

2295
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:24,660
but there are okay fuck me it's like it's for the same thing about is san francisco

2296
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:29,460
but like there are trolleys here and it's kind of like like trolleys are kind of like a meme

2297
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:38,100
and in coastal cities like they all have them yeah I mean I I think I think living in in like a

2298
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:44,820
big city is is pretty neat although like I think digi is more of the mindset of like

2299
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:51,380
not in not living in a city but like you know close enough to one yeah that that's another thing

2300
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:56,980
I kind of live on like the outskirts of the city so I live near like where houses are that are

2301
01:59:56,980 --> 02:00:02,260
very similar to digis in the so far that they are kind of isolated but so like there's like a ton

2302
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:07,460
bus stops near there so you can get to the city very easily there's there's a lot of like

2303
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:12,980
not like rural or like not even suburban by any means but there's like there are there's

2304
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:18,180
like a heart that there's a core of the city that's very easily accessible like via bus stops and

2305
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:27,060
stuff uh or like uber or whatever from like outer sort of uh outer layered houses that are pretty big

2306
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:37,620
from what I can tell yeah like I think I think that's the kind of vibe uh that like digi for

2307
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:41,940
instance is going for like I'm just bringing him up because like I know we talked about like what

2308
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:48,820
kind of place um he wanted to move to and uh like when we walked around in Atlanta like we went to

2309
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:54,260
Atlanta and hung out with econ and I know and that was and that was all good but like digi seemed to

2310
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:59,940
more enjoy the like like like we hung out in like a little town center in marietta and like got

2311
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:04,980
some bubble tea and that was cool and uh like we went out like we went out oh we went out on a

2312
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:11,380
fucking jackie showed us all this like hiking trail that like led up through this like hilly grassy

2313
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:17,460
field and like we stumbled upon like a junkyard and like yeah we played with all this secret

2314
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:25,620
junk um it was cool as hell um yeah and that was like not like a city experience per se

2315
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:32,180
but it was like uh you know like a suburban like a suburban georgia kind of kind of feel there and

2316
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:36,580
that was good everyone everyone had a real good fucking time real good real good goddamn time

2317
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:42,340
real good time talking real good time that sounds cool I I do want to see it I do really want to

2318
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:49,060
like see Atlanta uh I don't have the privilege of being digi just like drive across the United States

2319
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:57,060
but one day I know I know right yeah same uh because I don't feel comfortable super like hard

2320
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:02,500
selling in San Diego because I just don't like I I have lived and like seen a lot of cities

2321
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:07,540
but not living I've seen a lot of cities and I've lived in a couple but it like I still don't I don't

2322
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:13,700
this is the problem with me for like politics or like anything just animate anything even if I

2323
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:19,380
have seen a lot of something I will never ever feel like I am capable of talking about it ever

2324
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:25,780
unless I know god because like because like you know you're not an expert so like surely

2325
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:31,940
someone else knows better you know but like but not really yeah and like like the thing is like

2326
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:36,580
like to some extent like every city is pretty much the same yeah like any like any city would do

2327
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:47,700
yeah I feel similarly yeah um but if if if if everyone moved to Atlanta it would work out

2328
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:52,020
it would work out for me it would work out for me personally pretty well yeah so so that's so

2329
02:02:52,020 --> 02:03:02,980
that's my that's my vote oh there's also a ton of like like it's gonna sound really fucking like

2330
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:08,420
not a selling point but there's a lot of like hipster nerd shit here but not no that's a that's a

2331
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:13,460
huge selling point for me actually oh okay good it is for me to that's all but I didn't want to sound

2332
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:20,260
like I'm a hipster nerd even though I am I am a big fucking hipster nerd dude yeah I'm the biggest

2333
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:25,060
and the most shameful there's a I'm just I'm embarrassing there's a ton of like indie comic

2334
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:29,860
book places and like and like like used game stores and like a ton of that kind of culture

2335
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:35,940
especially in uh like more outer parts of San Diego there's a ton of that even the city though

2336
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:45,060
ton of it good that's what I want well that's all pretty sweet uh yeah but we just need to like

2337
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:50,100
trade places for little us we can live in each city because really like like even like I don't

2338
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:54,580
even know like like I know I like it here but I have no idea if anyone else would like it here

2339
02:03:55,540 --> 02:04:02,980
so um we just need like we should just have a rad con here or in Atlanta just we need to have

2340
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:08,500
before like before we move everyone like a place we should move like we do a rad con someplace and

2341
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:12,420
then like just and see the like fucking around indoors we should do that for like a couple days

2342
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:18,660
but then just also just like look around the city any any excuse any excuse for a rad con

2343
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:26,740
three is um is good with me I just wanted I would have wanted to host it if I just had the house

2344
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:37,540
yeah same I am I've been thinking of looking into like like venues or like some kind of like space

2345
02:04:37,540 --> 02:04:43,460
like like a like a studio space that could be rented for like a couple days or something

2346
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:50,660
because yeah like my house is not my house is not like people could stay here to a certain

2347
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:59,300
extent but like it's not it's just not gonna do it like for actually like hosting the the event uh

2348
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:07,940
yeah unfortunately but there I mean but now like well unless unless digi's house ends up being

2349
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:13,940
available and we do it there uh then like that's true no matter where like no matter where we do it

2350
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:22,100
there's gonna be the question of like what what fucking locale is it held in uh yeah when we do

2351
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:26,500
do the pcp headquarters which I view that as an inevitability I don't know if anyone else does but

2352
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:33,700
I feel like it's just so genius I hope it I hope it's an inevitability like I want I want that to be

2353
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:39,300
true for a while there I'd kind of given up on it yeah like when did like when digi said

2354
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:44,500
because because because when I moved here like I said I hoped everyone would follow

2355
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:49,860
but then like when it was when digi was like no I'm going somewhere else and I'm moving somewhere

2356
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:54,260
else and I was like well I didn't think that it was well first I was like oh no shit it's gonna be

2357
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:59,300
somewhere else and then it was like nobody knew where it was gonna be so I was like oh it looks

2358
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:04,420
like it's it's just it's just not happening after all and like did or divus moved back to Missouri

2359
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:09,140
and he's just there and he doesn't seem like he wants to go anywhere anytime soon and like Jesse's

2360
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:15,300
in michigan and he doesn't seem like he's going anywhere but um but lately it's been seeming

2361
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:20,660
like lately I've been getting my hopes up again uh it did feel a super dark there for a little bit

2362
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:27,300
but it's like like the like the worst thing about that is that people would just we would all think

2363
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:31,860
that it wasn't gonna happen so we would lose hope but I know the Nate desperately wants it I desperately

2364
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:38,820
want it and I'm pretty sure I desperately wanted to and yeah yeah yeah uh I'm very very pro I want

2365
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:44,420
to go gung-ho patreon I want to start from a young age and I want to do patreon I want that that is my

2366
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:52,020
goal yeah uh I mean I want to be a guy it's good fucking it's it's cool it's cool and it works

2367
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:58,340
somehow somehow out of doing of like moving to like the pcphq you know like dude just just go to

2368
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:05,380
college bro just go to college go to art I mean I go to whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa go to art

2369
02:07:05,380 --> 02:07:13,380
go to art college uh I mean I mean if he was I thought he was gonna give you like I mean I

2370
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:18,660
thought he was gonna be like giving you the safe like no like like do do the do the smart do like

2371
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:23,300
the conservative thing like get a degree get a get a stem degree so you have something to

2372
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:28,500
fall back on like that would be all be fine but no don't don't yeah don't follow your dreams go to

2373
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:37,060
art college like come on come the fuck right on well anyway uh yeah anyway basically no

2374
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:44,020
yeah for real I do I know someone who's going to art college and they're like dude am I eight for

2375
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:48,980
going to art college and was like I don't want to say yes but yes I don't want to say yes but

2376
02:07:48,980 --> 02:07:56,820
almost definitely yes yep yep sorry sorry about that but uh that's that's how it is

2377
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:07,220
get fucked art college students do this yourself they did they asked for it they wanted it and

2378
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:13,380
they got it uh awful anyway I want to move in with someone because I don't I mean I don't like

2379
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:19,380
my my my prediction is that like I will have like a bin sized patreon by the time I'm like uh

2380
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:29,380
ready to move which not sustainable from when I hear yeah yeah yeah um my fucking I need I need to

2381
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:36,420
do something like I really need oh I okay my patreon has been staying pretty steady for a while

2382
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:42,180
which like on the one hand is good because it I'm not scared that it's going to go away

2383
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:47,940
but on the other hand it's not good because it's stable at like a level that's too too low to like

2384
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:55,140
completely support myself comfortably yeah so I really need I don't I really need to like do

2385
02:08:55,140 --> 02:08:59,220
something like I think I just need to like increase my output for a while like finish up

2386
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:03,620
champion fast because like every day that goes by the champion isn't done I want to kill myself

2387
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:09,940
and um and then I think I'm gonna like I think I'm gonna start like kick starting uh like while

2388
02:09:09,940 --> 02:09:15,220
I work on vapers three I think I'm gonna start kick starting like paperbacks of like vapers one

2389
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:22,420
and two yeah and oh I got merch I got merch did you see my fucking pin no dude I put a I put a

2390
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:28,340
picture in the discord oh I did see that I did see that yeah yeah yeah I got I got a hundred of them

2391
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:33,300
what yeah I got a hundred of those and they're gonna feed they're gonna be uh kick starter

2392
02:09:33,300 --> 02:09:39,780
rewards I want that I want that I want to dude I'll fuck I'll give you one what fucking yeah yeah

2393
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:46,100
I mean I I've got a hundred I'm definitely gonna keep like you know I'm gonna give one to Jackie

2394
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:50,500
I'm definitely gonna keep one for myself I'll probably put aside a few to just like give to people

2395
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:55,940
and then I'll give I figure I'm gonna give the majority of them away well I'm gonna give as

2396
02:09:55,940 --> 02:10:00,180
many as I can away as like Kickstarter rewards and then I'll I'll probably won't get rid of all of

2397
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:05,700
them and then I thought maybe I'll start I'll start kick starting my I'll start kick starting my older

2398
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:11,860
comics and like maybe get a little bit of like buzz because like you know that's how you get famous

2399
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:16,020
as you make money in comics like that's how people notice you is if people fucking fund your kick

2400
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:22,260
starters um so maybe get a little buzz but by that and maybe start going maybe start going to cons

2401
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:26,660
maybe start going to like smaller cons and like boot and like we're like like manning a table and

2402
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:31,300
like selling pins and selling merch and like selling prints or something all that shit that I never

2403
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:38,020
wanted to do but like whatever I I won't do that too but sounds it sounds like cool to me not like

2404
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:42,740
that it sounds kind of you know you know I go back and forth on it sometimes I think it sounds

2405
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:46,500
like fun and it sounds cool and I'm like oh I'm missing out like that's what that's what like

2406
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:51,940
that's how your that's like how you have your fun and like make comic friends but then other times

2407
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:56,900
I'm like oh what a fucking hassle nobody's gonna buy nope nobody's gonna buy my shit so why do I

2408
02:10:56,900 --> 02:11:06,980
bother yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's me I'll uh I I almost feel like don't get me a poop up pin

2409
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:15,220
and then I will I will kick start I will kick your start um cool yeah I mean well one one way or

02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:33,220
like the next day I will get it to you uh yeah and I don't want to increase it all but I'm gonna I

2417
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:10,020
you're yep yep yep you're my steak and potatoes my kidney beans and rice my shrimp and grits epic

2418
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:18,020
epic epic I want fucking Radcom 3 so bad I want it too I mean like we've been saying like we've

2419
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:25,220
been saying here today the PCP has felt a little like distant recently like it's felt it hasn't

2420
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:31,380
really felt like there's been much like camaraderie and like I miss that you know what I mean yeah

2421
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:38,420
yeah yeah so I don't know maybe it's maybe it's foolish to think that like that kind of that

2422
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:44,100
could be recaptured by radcon 3 but like I I hope I would like it honestly I would like it very much

2423
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:49,540
if you want to make if if you want to like if if we want to go into google doc stuff this and like

2424
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:54,500
write up like it like a like a contract if if you wanted to I would be fine with like maybe like

2425
02:12:54,500 --> 02:13:00,180
once a month just like not record anything and just like hanging out and like doing something yeah

2426
02:13:00,820 --> 02:13:07,460
they're just together yeah I would be fine with that is this is this obsession is this obsession

2427
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:14,180
with like we not doing anything unless content comes out of it like surely that's insane yeah

2428
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:20,900
like surely which we're fucking we're off our our rockers okay like like on one hand I like

2429
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:27,380
to like make things like I do like like right away it's cool it's it's it's satisfying it's

2430
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:32,740
satisfying when like doing a thing leads to content like it's satisfying to put it out and

2431
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:40,340
be like yep here's a thing here's a thing that was made but like it can't like surely surely

2432
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:47,620
everything's not supposed to be like that yeah uh yeah god the the fucking I think it was something

2433
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:52,260
like like we would do something to end next but I think I think it was like us staying up for two

2434
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:56,820
hours talking about how gimp is cool like what did you said something like yeah I wish that was

2435
02:13:56,820 --> 02:14:01,300
recorded it might have been something else but I thought like no I don't want that to record that

2436
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:06,020
should have been recorded this that that was for us that that was for us this this is our time this

2437
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:12,740
is our time god damn it yeah this isn't this isn't it's not for show this isn't for this isn't for

2438
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:19,540
this isn't for the pcp wiki archivists to like make a page about and like speculate about or

2439
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:30,020
anything yeah uh such a shame fuck I mean such a shame yeah but you know it if if you if you want

2440
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:38,660
to I'd be fine just like get into a call sometime yeah um I would I would like that with you I would

2441
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:45,300
like that with like a bunch of pcp maybe I would like to I would like to like hang out with like

2442
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:52,100
you know hippo and like mage maybe we should like start like a new group like just we spend

2443
02:14:52,100 --> 02:15:02,020
off into like p like like pcp2 real friends yeah wait wasn't that didn't we talk about that one time

2444
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:08,180
oh yeah wasn't there like an idea to like split the because like the pcp was too much of like a

2445
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:13,540
formal thing and it's like we need a second pcp for us to just actually like be friends that was

2446
02:15:13,620 --> 02:15:18,500
like a couple days before frog fractures or maybe afterwards and and and yeah it was around that time

2447
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:27,300
tensions were yeah tensions were so fucking high dude it was insane yeah yeah I feel like things

2448
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:33,060
things have cooled down things have cooled down since then but now it's just kind of like dead

2449
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:39,620
I don't feel so I I I like the pcp I like I like the podcast part and like the group part I'm

2450
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:45,220
I'm down I'm I'm I'm the people who like I think give a single shit about like preserving

2451
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:49,300
the podcast part and I mean I like both

2452
02:15:52,580 --> 02:15:59,380
do I do I care about the podcast aspect of it or I don't know but like the idea of us being like a

2453
02:15:59,380 --> 02:16:06,340
league of gamers that like oh hardcore together I don't I don't really care about the podcast itself

2454
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:12,260
but I like I deeply care about the idea of all of us as like a league of allies like a league

2455
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:20,820
a league of content creating allies who create content together yeah yeah like yeah that's that's

2456
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:29,060
why yeah that's like that's what we were meant to be and and you know maybe maybe fucking hanging

2457
02:16:29,060 --> 02:16:35,860
out in ways that like aren't specifically for the purpose of making content would fucking facilitate

2458
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:41,700
us being a league of content creators in like an indirect way you know what I mean I think that like

2459
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:50,980
like I think the problem with the pcp isn't it like maybe a little bit but not people are like

2460
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:56,260
look a lot of people are like complaining about the wrong things like I don't think the actual

2461
02:16:56,260 --> 02:17:02,340
structure of it itself is the problem but we're just thinking about it like we're not thinking

2462
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:08,260
about it right we aren't being real people we're being weird and that's fucking up the experience

2463
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:15,300
for ourselves like yeah like like like if it was just like each week we just pop and like do a funny

2464
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:20,100
little podcast because I like doing the podcast I think it's funny and I think it's enjoyable to

2465
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:27,380
get feedback yeah it's scary and yeah I think if that was just that we didn't like like I'm not even

2466
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:30,260
one of these people who's like yeah we shouldn't have done the patreon because that makes it too

2467
02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:39,140
formal like it it's not Nate does all the fucking work he does yeah I don't like for like after the

2468
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:45,060
patreon started I was kind of afraid that like it was gonna get really like what's the word like

2469
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:49,620
tense about it but like it didn't yeah like nobody really like it's not enough money that anyone

2470
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:58,980
really cares that much yeah and uh I just like think like we just need to stop acting the way

2471
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:04,740
we are about it we just need to like remind ourselves like yeah we're friends first we don't

2472
02:18:04,740 --> 02:18:12,500
we don't need to record everything we can just have fun and exist like like we should have a sort of

2473
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:18,100
avenue like like the PCB headquarters will be great for this but in the meantime we should have

2474
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:24,340
like uh were you there for the the PCB congress that was like less like like less no I Nate

2475
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:29,380
Nate told me that that was coming and then I fucking forgot and missed it well that that was

2476
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:33,540
like the first I mean it was still like about business and the PCP but we didn't have to

2477
02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:39,380
record or anything it was just us talking about like real shit and sure there was a yeah there was a

2478
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:45,060
like a while back when like it was up in the air like where we were moving like we had just like

2479
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:50,180
an informal call with like me and Jackie and Digi and Nate I think was there and maybe DeVoo I don't

2480
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:54,580
know and that was fun like that was that was it was just casual like I mean yeah it was it was a

2481
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:59,860
it was like a formal call for like a business reason I guess you could say but yeah it wasn't

2482
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:06,580
recorded and it was good yeah anyway I think we gotta have something like like that maybe not we

2483
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:11,700
gotta but I think like like Jesse and all the people who are like nay saying about the PCB I get

2484
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:16,820
it like I'm well you know I don't want to say I get it and be like no you fucking don't know like

2485
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:21,620
no worries well I know where he's coming from yeah I know where he's coming from yeah and

2486
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:28,580
I agree we need to stop being so like dependent on creating content constantly but I don't think

2487
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:34,420
that's I think we we are the kind of people who just like to create content I don't think yeah

2488
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:40,020
necessarily pushing ourselves so much to do it it's just kind of natural and we we we need to

2489
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:46,420
push ourselves not to is the thing at least maybe a little bit I think we need to and I think we'll

2490
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:51,700
get into the groove of it dude just not dude dude yeah what yeah like I'm thinking about it

2491
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:58,660
and yeah what if we just had like maybe like a bi-weekly or something just like a fucking

2492
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:04,820
not yeah just like a fucking like a pc pizza party or something where we all just like fucking

2493
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:10,020
showed up and just like hung out in a call and maybe played video games or didn't and it doesn't

2494
02:20:10,020 --> 02:20:17,540
matter or something yeah something like like it's not streamed it's not recorded that sounds really

2495
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:23,380
good and you know what you know what I've been feeling I I'm gonna push for it too because I've

2496
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:28,580
been like I don't know like I haven't I don't know whether I've been the only one feeling this way I

2497
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:32,900
can't imagine like I can't be the only one that's been feeling like kind of isolated and like we're

2498
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:39,140
not really like in touch with our fucking identities as like as like a group of content creating

2499
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:46,020
friends anymore you know uh so yeah I'll push for I'll push for that too yeah that sounds cool and

2500
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:54,500
good I like it offline I have I have friends offline and uh yeah I am basically the native of that

2501
02:20:54,500 --> 02:21:02,260
group I am the one who like anything yeah like sustain it uh so yeah like like like every month

2502
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:07,540
or so I will like I will like plan a party at my house and I will like make a whole like

2503
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:11,060
invitation with like a ton of fucking it it will literally be like a Nate best guy ever

2504
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:14,340
every video we have a ton of fucking like flash and fluff to it like a whole bunch of

2505
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:18,500
fucking reaction images in the background just like yeah I'm like like a whole like dedicated

2506
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:23,860
like like a fucking like like paragraph like this week it's for mitzvah themed I'm going to be I'm

2507
02:21:23,860 --> 02:21:28,660
going to convert to Islam because I love Islam so much bring your Quran so you can beat me to death

2508
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:35,380
with them please god I love I love Jews so much all right and I'll just say like yeah just bring

2509
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:40,820
pizza like like bring money for pizza or something and we'll just hang out and uh like usually I'll

2510
02:21:40,820 --> 02:21:44,580
stream that but not because I feel the need to it's just like all like none of my friends are

2511
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:50,020
like content creators or anything we just you know the thing is kind of cool and so you know yeah

2512
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:58,260
yeah uh so yeah uh we uh do like like I'll just organize that and then uh it will be great they'll

2513
02:21:58,260 --> 02:22:04,580
come over and we'll just hang out we don't have to like like and and like last time we like spent a

2514
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:10,500
lot of it like off the air just talking about real shit and it was fantastic uh and I loved doing

2515
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:16,180
that and I don't do it a lot just because you know I'm I'm working a lot and we all are working but

2516
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:24,980
we can make time I truly believe that all this can make time for this and I think I yeah I 100%

2517
02:22:24,980 --> 02:22:32,180
agree because like yeah like like like if I'm like in the middle of work I don't want to like

2518
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:36,820
take time off like when I'm trying to work to do this but like if it's if like I know it's coming

2519
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:42,340
in advance and like it's like a thing and like it's planned like a couple hours or whatever is not

2520
02:22:42,340 --> 02:22:48,420
like a huge it's not a huge ass and like it's worth it and like it's just something that I want to do

2521
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:55,220
I think us like the problem isn't that we are doing the the podcast but the problem is that we only

2522
02:22:55,220 --> 02:23:01,220
talk through the podcast yeah yeah the problem yeah the problem is that that's it yeah and that's

2523
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:07,700
not like a real thing yeah like that's like that's not that's not the real shit like you get here on

2524
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:13,780
the rowdy fuckers cop kill is patreon.com slash rowdy fuckers cop kill yeah I mean I don't know

2525
02:23:13,780 --> 02:23:18,980
like what the fans think but like I honestly come out and say I don't know if I'm friends with a lot

2526
02:23:18,980 --> 02:23:24,500
of people here I mean I would desperately like to but we just there's no I can't just say like

2527
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:31,460
hey you just want to talk and hang out like that's just yeah I agree like I like we taught like we

2528
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:37,620
talk in the pcp but outside of it it's like like you know like I have so much like like I have so

2529
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:44,420
much shared history with like digi and jesse and hippo but we don't yeah but we don't like hang out

2530
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:50,020
or talk and like that makes me real sad and like I think I don't know like I don't know if they feel

2531
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:54,260
the same way maybe they do I don't know either maybe it's maybe it's maybe it's selfish to kind of

2532
02:23:54,260 --> 02:23:58,020
hope that they do feel bad about it but like that would make sure make me feel better if they did

2533
02:23:58,740 --> 02:24:05,220
and um yeah let's all be friends guys like I never talked to I'm just gonna name drop people

2534
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:12,740
because you know real shit I never talked to like jesse or devoo or or uh tom or mage or anyone

2535
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:18,260
and I would like to but what am I gonna do just ask them to hang out they're busy and

2536
02:24:18,980 --> 02:24:23,460
we right right right like that like that's how like that's how it feels but it shouldn't feel like

2537
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:28,100
that yeah do you know what this is really refreshing because I've been thinking about this

2538
02:24:28,740 --> 02:24:33,700
and I've just been feeling like it's my problem but it's not my problem it's everyone's okay oh thank

2539
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:39,460
thank fucking christ yeah I think about this all the time thank god okay okay good I mean if we are

2540
02:24:39,460 --> 02:24:42,900
alone in this then this pocket's gonna seem really weird if someone else is watching yeah

2541
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:49,620
oh Jesus like imagine if nature's like like Nate's like life like I imagine like Nate's just

to Tom and uh like you know I like to change that Tom if you're listening let's let's do something

2553
02:25:55,860 --> 02:26:00,100
spicy bro we were gonna do the spicy bro pack but we didn't have time to the anime expo which is a

2555
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:11,540
like spicy bros is like my way of like like it's almost like my way of like coping with like the

2556
02:26:11,540 --> 02:26:17,860
pcp it's like it's like if I was just about someone you can tell like I like we are actually friends

2557
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:22,420
like we are actually like good friends together like that's why I'm with you because I want people

2558
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:26,420
to know that it's like not we we just aren't in a chat together we just aren't in the pockets

2563
02:26:50,980 --> 02:26:55,380

2564
02:26:55,780 --> 02:27:00,820
were working on it before and then I like didn't follow follow up on that for a while the intro

2565
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:09,540
is fucking very very nice yeah is it very clean it will get it will literally kill you if you

2566
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:17,700
aren't careful it may legitimately kill you okay good like I'd say like since you guys are fans of

2567
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:22,180
the piece of the reference cop killers if you're watching this then lower your volumes and like

2568
02:27:22,180 --> 02:27:30,660
don't look at the screen only only the ratifuckers cop killers loyalists who have made it this far

2569
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:39,460
into episode five spared my well no well yeah we spared your rat oh fuck and you know what yeah

2570
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:43,380
you know I'm not even gonna remember I'm not even gonna remember that tip like I'm still gonna I'm

2571
02:27:43,380 --> 02:27:49,300
still gonna suffer your wrath even though I had the option not to it's like like like like there's

2572
02:27:49,380 --> 02:27:53,700
like a song that will play and like there'll be like a little bit like of a slow just like like

2573
02:27:53,700 --> 02:28:01,140
buildup and then like the moment you hear like the do then you will literally die you will cease to

2574
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:07,380
exist you will like like because when that starts then then the visuals happen and then the audio

2575
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:14,340
happens and you will be dead you will die gotta say I'm feeling gotta say I'm feeling pretty excited

2576
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:19,780
about it then been looking forward to seeing that for man it was I mean I want to see the video

2577
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:23,620

2578
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:29,060
that was radcon yeah yeah it was radcon too because you weren't at radcon one oh man because Victor

2580
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:37,620

2583
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:56,500
god damn it yeah that's that's even harder because Victor isn't even in the pcp

2584
02:28:57,620 --> 02:29:03,540
no like um you know it's really it's a real bummer and I'm gonna make myself maybe sound like a big

2585
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:09,540
fucking loser right now but like it's real sad that I feel like we don't like we're not like

2586
02:29:10,420 --> 02:29:17,540
really close in the pcp because like the pcp is like my only friends yeah the pcp is like my is

2587
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:23,140
like my whole fucking friends group and now to feel to feel like to feel like oh it's I feel so

2588
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:28,420
isolated from it and to feel like oh it's so like it's it's gone it's gone kind of silent and like

2589
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:35,700
or not silent but like I'm no longer in touch with it it's like oh no yeah no oh god yeah I have

2590
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:42,500
offline friends and I have other online friends but I do couldn't I I do consume not pcp media but

2591
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:50,500
like I do consume being in the pcp way more than the other people uh yeah I mean I doubt any of

2592
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:54,740
my other friends will be watching this but if you are I do enjoy talking to you it's just you know

2593
02:29:55,700 --> 02:30:02,500

2594
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:08,340
of natural uh chat even though he he me and Ethan are best friends chat to Ethan I he doesn't watch

2597
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:23,860
but I don't want to be gay so I can't date you that is not a joke that is legitimately how I feel

me too man me too hippo is I wish I wish I were I wish I were fucking

2606
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:24,900
hippo's one of the people that when I think about the fact that like we don't actually

2607
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:33,220
talk that much I feel like oh no yeah yeah yeah yeah we we gotta talk like and even like it's not

2608
02:31:33,220 --> 02:31:37,300
even just that like it's being recorded like that's like a weird thing but like due to the

2609
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:44,180
effects we can't talk about like shit there's a talk about like oh oh fucking oh I I I love

2610
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:57,620
star trek so much oh her funny you know a chucky cheese oh yeah yeah yeah it's all like it's all

2611
02:31:57,620 --> 02:32:03,940
like done with a purpose but like we don't who fucking needs who fucking needs purpose purposes

2612
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:10,900
for the week yeah and and none of this is like anti-pcp at least from like my just no my stance I

2613
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:16,020
am not against doing the podcast fans no I'm gonna drop out no I'm not again I'm not against it but

2614
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:21,220
it's a bummer that like that's all that's been going on lately yeah exactly yeah that's how I feel

2615
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:29,860
it's great uh yeah so just I don't know if anyway I think like did you and Nate listen to the last

2616
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:38,740
one I think so if you listen to this I I love you guys yeah yeah you're good you're all you're all

2617
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:42,740
you're all a bunch of cool guys I mean well they listen to that one because it had because it had

2618
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:47,860
fucking uh pony shit in it but then again maybe they'll listen to this one expecting it to have

2619
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:52,820
to have more pony drama which of course it can't because we haven't found the legendary

2620
02:32:52,820 --> 02:32:59,140
frog fractions to yet yeah yeah yeah I mean I think that's all I really have to say about the

2621
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:06,020
pcp I think I don't know man just uh just what we've been saying I love I love them they're my

2622
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:13,940
they're my best friends and um they're my best friends and uh I hope that the reason why I have

2623
02:33:13,940 --> 02:33:19,140
not been hanging out with y'all more is not that you all secretly hate me and are conspiring against

2624
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:25,380
me uh I can only pray that that is uh but that is so yeah like people like people like

2625
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:32,900
monkey I like I think I would have a lot of fun with if we just talked yeah yeah he this little

2626
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:37,060
secret little secret inside the secret inside munchies paranoia I secretly believe that both

2627
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:43,300
monkey and jesse hate me though I have no evidence I just suspect that that is the case I have no

2628
02:33:43,300 --> 02:33:50,740
reason to believe that I secretly who do I think secretly hates me well I'm pretty I'm pretty sure

2629
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:59,460
tom hates me but um that's that's for reasons um um mom I think I think monkey just pretends to

2630
02:33:59,460 --> 02:34:04,740
hate me or maybe that's but maybe that's just what I tell myself to feel better um maybe maybe he

2631
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:10,580
keeps you as a friend as like a size situation yeah yeah but like a reverse size situation

2632
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:18,340
where he says he hates me but he actually likes me yeah yeah I'm sorry sig I'm not I'm not and and

2633
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:24,420
then jesse I feel like me and jesse never I don't think jesse hates me I'm not sure I think jesse

2634
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:30,740
like probably like I think jesse probably I feel like maybe me and jesse kind of feel the same way

2635
02:34:30,740 --> 02:34:34,660
we're like we like each other and we think each other are cool but we don't really know what to

2636
02:34:34,660 --> 02:34:41,220
say to each other I think I mean that's how I feel about him and I feel like it's reciprocated

2637
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:46,820
but I guess I don't know because I've never like brought it up or anything and I just have no idea

2638
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:52,100
what tom and mage feel about me like what's what's whoever I mean I have no reason to believe negative

2639
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:58,820
uh I wonder if I don't know yeah I don't know I don't know I wonder if you are in like a good

2640
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:04,340
foot but we have not talked since ride con two we we hit it off I feel I feel I don't know if

2641
02:35:04,340 --> 02:35:08,660
davoo's gonna like like fact check me here but I got to I think we hit it off pretty good

2642
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:16,500
me and davoo me and davoo have like talked a little bit in the chat because like I was

2643
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:20,660
asking him about like his housing situation after I moved and stuff because I was interested

2644
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:24,580
because I was like interested to know how the whole like moving back in with his parents and

2645
02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:28,260
getting his girlfriend over there and like getting there in place like I was I was a bit invested

2646
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:34,820
in that narrative so I tried to follow through on that um I wonder if I wonder if mage is like I

2647
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:40,660
wonder if mage would have any has any interest in like in like fucking getting our old things

2648
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:46,180
going because like I felt kind of bad because she would like half the time she would ask me if I

2649
02:35:46,180 --> 02:35:50,420
wanted to watch anime and sometimes I'd be like no I don't feel like it or no I don't feel like

2650
02:35:50,420 --> 02:35:56,660
spending the time only once in a while would I be like yeah sure let's do it I wonder if maybe

2651
02:35:56,660 --> 02:36:01,380
she eventually was just like well he more often than not says no so maybe he just doesn't doesn't

2652
02:36:01,380 --> 02:36:12,420
want to or maybe she just found something better to do yeah yeah yeah yeah we just we gotta do

2653
02:36:13,460 --> 02:36:18,420
I think also a little bit this this might seem contradictory to what I was just prescribing

2654
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:24,340
but I think the like didgy with funky social social media podcast like jesse and hippo

2655
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:29,620
doing that shit I think a key to helping this would just be doing one-on-one podcast with more

2656
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:36,180
people maybe maybe not like that wouldn't solve it but I think that would like okay there was a

2657
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:40,340
there was a kick for that for a while like there was like like monkey and mage made one and that

2658
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:46,180
was weird and random and I didn't listen to it but I was surprised by its existence was it oh was it

2659
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:53,620
oh well that's too bad um yeah there was the pody cast and the pony cast and that was all

2660
02:36:53,620 --> 02:37:00,580
that's all I guess the pody cast is still going um I wouldn't be I wouldn't be a verse to do in

2661
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:06,740
more like one-on-one oh yeah and then me and divu did uh uh uh destructive criticism which

2662
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:11,540
everyone hated uh everyone hated because I was mean to some video game which fuck those guys

2663
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:15,460
their video game was gay it was just it was just another game made again I don't feel

2664
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:22,340
bad about anything I said um but it was good but it was good fucking like doing a thing with

2665
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:29,940
divu because I'd never like one-on-one it's good like I like fucking talking with the pcp guys and

2666
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:36,100
and getting getting to know everyone because they're my friends exactly like I've known

2667
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:42,260
all of you for like what like five years no I've known did you I've known did you for five well

2668
02:37:42,260 --> 02:37:50,500
well what was the first brony con that we went to was it brony con 2014 13 I'm fairly Jesus christ

2669
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:57,300
okay so that's like four years then Jesus fucking christ my life my life munchie where is it gone

2670
02:37:57,300 --> 02:38:06,820
and like we haven't we just I mean okay you guys have talked way more than I have like like I'm

2671
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:12,420
you know I don't I don't want to forget my place here I am the new guy I am like you know

2672
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:20,500
I'm I'm I'm not bonafide pcp original member here but I guess I I I mean but we were talking

2673
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:26,740
we were talking about you and we knew you even in the early early days yeah I mean the first words

2674
02:38:26,740 --> 02:38:31,220
you ever spoke to me you the first words you did ever speak to me was I've heard a lot about you

2675
02:38:31,300 --> 02:38:38,980
so I guess that means I had I had oh man nostalgia I mean where were you were you going

2676
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:44,740
somewhere with that no no I just oh well yeah it's just like I feel like we like we like I feel like

2677
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:51,380
we know each other less than we should for being in this stage of our like time wise our relationship

2678
02:38:51,940 --> 02:38:57,060
not not just not just me and you I feel like me and you like know each other way more than we

2679
02:38:57,060 --> 02:39:02,820
know me I mean I mean I think I think at this point I would say that I mean other than Nate but

2680
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:07,860
like that's a different thing like me and you or like you're you're the one that I'm like the closest

2681
02:39:07,860 --> 02:39:13,940
to in the piece really like you're you're yeah yeah I mean I mean I mean I mean like I lived with

2682
02:39:13,940 --> 02:39:19,780
digi and stuff well I mean I lived with digi I don't mind I'm not gonna get mad we would we would only

2683
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:28,660
hang out occasionally I don't know I mean I mean I don't know no I think I think I think you're

2684
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:35,140
by you're my pcp you're my pcp bestie I feel similarly I feel and I'm not just saying that you're

2685
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:39,220
not you're not just you're not just saying that you don't have to say no I'm not just saying I

2686
02:39:39,220 --> 02:39:47,860
by far know you know most oh and I enjoy it the most so I mean like I mean like I mean I don't I

2687
02:39:47,940 --> 02:39:52,580
don't do anything like I don't do anything like rowdy fucker cop killers with anyone else so like

2688
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:59,460
you know what that there's there's your there's your evidence my my my my pcp tier list for who I

2689
02:39:59,460 --> 02:40:07,940
know and like love the best is as follows uh you then digi then Nate and then I forget the rest

2690
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:16,820
um yeah mine would probably be you I mean Nate is like off the list Nate's Nate's like a different

2691
02:40:17,380 --> 02:40:23,700
league yeah um there'd be you yeah probably you digi oh and then and then hippo and then and then

2692
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:29,780
hippo I can't I can't forget hippo well probably you and then digi and then divu because like I

2693
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:34,580
lived with digi and divu and I was closer with digi than divu but you know we were still roomies

2694
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:40,260
and then you know I don't really feel like I know hippo much better than I know like

2695
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:46,100
Jesse really you know yeah you know I have hung out I have hung out with Tom like at his house a

2696
02:40:46,100 --> 02:40:53,380
couple times really oh yeah yeah I did I did like twice I think maybe three times yeah yeah um he

2697
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:57,940
he just invited me over to like for with some of his friends for like game night one time my tire

2698
02:40:57,940 --> 02:41:02,420
exploded one time I popped a tire on the highway driving to his house and my dad had to come out

2699
02:41:02,420 --> 02:41:07,540
and rescue me but it didn't work and we and we just called AAA and then but it got fixed early

2700
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:12,420
enough that I still just like on my newly replaced tire I just like kept going and like went to Tom's

2701
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:19,620
awesome yeah so actually actually I probably know Tom like pretty well well I mean not not that well

2702
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:26,500
because you know we don't actually talk that much but like tier you know it would probably be it

2703
02:41:26,500 --> 02:41:37,460
probably be you and then either like digi and then mage and then Tom and even though Tom even though

2704
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:43,860
Tom hates me and Tom probably Tom probably thinks that I hate him but I don't um yeah anyway and and

2705
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:51,220
like yeah and keep in mind I I want everyone to be a tier that's what I want this is not like yeah

2706
02:41:51,220 --> 02:41:56,260
I don't yeah yeah I yeah yeah this is not a who do I like the best this is like a how how well

2707
02:41:56,260 --> 02:42:02,980
exactly how fucking up on each other's dicks yeah and I want to be up on everyone's real bad

2708
02:42:02,980 --> 02:42:10,980
it would make me real happy yep hippos minecraft stream is the closest thing that I think I like

2709
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:15,780
like we have to like just a hanging out because even though it's a stream it is I've actually

truly realize that me and Nate are like good like like like if we actually want to we could totally

2727

do a one-on-one podcast Nate if you're listening I'd be down but I don't know what we could do

02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:17,300
yeah um yeah man me and Nate really should do another show you should we just we just uh we just

2729
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:25,300
hate each other so intensely it's just such a barrier to things like to progress you know

2730
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:30,100
I would just be so I would just be such good friends of this guy if only I didn't fucking hate him

2731
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:35,620
yeah yeah yeah true just shame that's how I feel yeah that's how I feel about everyone

2732
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:43,860
in the pcp yeah uh you know the pcp I think I said all we can the pcp's been one community

2733
02:44:43,860 --> 02:44:47,780
we've grown pretty distant from but I think there might be another community that we've grown even

2734
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:55,300
more distant from for maybe one or two reasons yeah maybe maybe yeah and I think I've even I've

2735
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:59,460
even been like noticing I've been noticing some of them like on Twitter and on social media and

2736
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:04,100
stuff and we've had some we've had some run-ins with I don't know what what we what we've done

2737
02:45:04,820 --> 02:45:09,060
you know yeah and and what could we possibly have done we're just living our lives yeah

2738
02:45:09,060 --> 02:45:12,980
we're just being nice guys just just loving our friends just just just just just passionately

2739
02:45:12,980 --> 02:45:17,220
ranging about how much we want to be good friends with everyone just you know it's it's weird to

2740
02:45:17,220 --> 02:45:22,420
think about that that we can have any and somehow and somehow they find fault they somehow they

2741
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:28,660
