6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,160
Yowواoo

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,680
Completely different solved none pointers

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,400
These complimentary songs. Welcome to the Pro Crastinators podcast.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh no, it wasn't Cranstonators podcast. I'm my fucking with my volume. Why am I so

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,200
Too quiet or too loud? I don't know whatever. I think my volume will automatically adjust

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,080
I'm Ben Saint and this is Gibb and take. Hey gays

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,080
We're after after finally having a good episode last week. We're back to the regular post death

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
PCP arc to people

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,560
Nothing happening. It's you've got a you got a you know, it's like

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,680
Forced scarcity is like manufactured

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,520
Scarcity of the of the good episodes. You can't give them too many

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
No, then they wouldn't get excited

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,240
Then then they wouldn't pop then they wouldn't Pog when the episode was good they get used to being good

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You know

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,040
And it all credibles once everyone's Poggin, no one will be you know, it's like that. I remember I remember

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,640
True when what happened this week?

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,600
What's what's on the what's on the plate? I felt like nothing

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,000
happened

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,040
For me. I was so confused that it was Saturday yesterday. I thought it was like Tuesday

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,520
I thought it was Wednesday. I thought nothing had happened because nothing had happened

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,520
I've been playing Minecraft and listening to Sean videos

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,080
Like an idiot Sean. I love Sean. Yeah, he's the only he's the only I think he's the only breadtuber that I still

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,480
Listen to and only because he puts out like one video every two months

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,320
Not only because of that also because he's a genius and he's never said anything. I disagree with ever his entire life

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,080
Incredible it is incredible. I

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Tip my hat to him

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
I

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm like that every week every week

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,360
like Thursday is coming around and I'm like

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,400
It's it hits midnight on Thursday, and then I'm like, oh, it's Friday. Oh wait the episode is coming out today

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,720
Okay, wait shit. That means we gotta do another one like two days from now. No, and then

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,800
It's all yeah, it feels like feels shorter and shorter the walls are closing in

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,920
The the time is just goes speeding right along faster and faster

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
my

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
My debt my own mortality approaches. I don't know

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
necessarily like

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,480
Age I think and like in macro scale the age like

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Minutes feel shorter or whatever

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,600
Years feel shorter the more years you've experienced you start coming and they don't stop coming

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,600
but like

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,360
For when you don't notice an entire week purse. I think that's more just you haven't been doing

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
Unique things each day. I've been doing basically the same thing every day

48
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,480
And that's why I feel like I didn't realize

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
That the days had gone by

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,780
Yeah, I think that's an element for me, too. I spent I

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,920
Worked I worked on the I worked on the game some more this this week not as much as I want to but I mean that's every I never I never

52
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,440
get to spend I

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,520
Never get as much done as I wanted to

54
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,600
I spent a lot of this week arguing on Twitter

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,420
I

56
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
It is with that was annoying

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
I've been very angry

58
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,960
This week. Yeah, I had a lot of things to be angry about I had that. Yeah, I had that fucking

59
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,160
I mean, I guess I guess the most descriptive word

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,720
I guess you could call it would be a debate with that that fucking guy with that my

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
my my fellow

62
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Crystorian spit

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Dylan Thomas

64
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,240
fucking

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,760
Got a lot of got so many fucking kiwi farmers and psychopaths and my mentions all week long

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Because they hate me now

67
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,000
Because I was arguing the

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:56,200
The crazy the disgustingly transphobic opinion that Chris is trans because she says she's female

69
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
That's that's a

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,760
But then I don't like that's what that's what then that's what

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,080
That's what transphobes want you to say they want you to

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,920
Say that she is one of them one of the trans people because she's bad

73
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:23,560
And if you say that she is a trans just cuz she says so then they can make fun of them

74
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,760
They can say trans people bad Ben. You are

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
That was a real gremlin moment

76
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,920
Hashtag gremlin moment, right? Oops. Oops. Sorry everyone. Just have a little gremlin moment right there. You know what I'm saying

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Oh, man, I had a really there was that one one

78
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,320
particularly angry live live wire that I got into a big thing with yesterday, but like all week

79
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,480
I've been getting all these all these retweets out of nowhere

80
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm just all the random DMs from people just like, you know, calling me a faggot or whatever and it's like, okay

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,760
I'll thanks see see I got one today from a just from a guy whose

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,160
Twitter avatars just stand from South Park saying you are cringe. So, you know that ruined my day

83
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,360
Another one called me soy that one hurt a lot, you know that one really stung I

84
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,560
Try not to let it show sometimes but when people say when people see the soy inside

85
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
No, I try so hard to hide it

86
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Yeah, so, you know like you said

87
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,800
When when you spend your time doing a lot of repetitive shit

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,520
It goes by really really bad the times that's arguing on Twitter the time just flies by

89
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,360
Hours go by and and I'm just like what what have I done? What have I done a lot of time?

90
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm reading tweet arguments you've been having and being like thank God, it's not me thank God

91
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm sorry about that. Jesus. No, no, I mean like I've been seeing what you've been going through and it's like

92
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,560
I know it must suck. It must suck just reading them. I don't I mean, I really shouldn't engage. I really engage more than I should

93
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,440
Yeah, I guess I'll briefly touch on that

94
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,400
Debate that quote-unquote debate itself the the gist of it. Okay, I don't necessarily recommend anyone go watch

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,760
It's not that funny. It's short and it's frustrating and it's infuriating

96
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,760
They basically the argument went

97
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Dylan I

98
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,120
Say I say Chris is a FEMA is a trans woman because she says so because that's what being trans is

99
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:14,360
Identifying as female Dylan says Chris is not just transgender. Chris is also transsexual and Chris

100
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,200
did weird Chris and Chris did weird stuff about being like Chris tried to be

101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Transsexual what whatever that means in a weird way that is not typical

102
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,160
like the time where she she cut her her crotch and the time where she like

103
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,040
drank some like menopause medic medicine or something and

104
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,640
He said like therefore she is not

105
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,640
Transsexual because those were odd things to do and I was like what what are you talking about?

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm talking about gender and he was like no, but she's a trend shut up. Stop changing the subject

107
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,200
So we went but I was like no I'm talking about gender and he was like, okay

108
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,720
So they he just he he had the same like two arguments that every one of these these two likes non arguments that every one of these

109
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
People have they all think they're so smart

110
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,040
Repeating the same like bullshit. It doesn't fucking isn't relevant. What was it? His two things were like one

111
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
She is not

112
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,480
She says she's trans, but she also says that she's a goddess and a son of two

113
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,960
therefore she can't

114
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Be trans because she said some other things that are false and

115
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,720
To like she said she is faking it. She said she's a fake

116
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,440
Faking a being a woman or she said she would fake being a woman to get access to lesbians

117
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,280
This this second okay

118
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:49,000
The first one is like a totally spurious like if you say one thing that's false nothing else you say can ever be true

119
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,900
Yeah, that's like that's real. That's really obnoxious. It doesn't make any sense. It's terrible

120
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,680
The enough said about that the second one

121
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Okay, everyone says this everybody has this same point. They say Chris admitted

122
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,560
Chris admitted that he's just he's just faking it Chris admitted that he is just doing it to get lesbians, okay

123
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Everyone says this so much that I just assumed it was true

124
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,800
When someone when someone actually tried to show me that evidence to show me that quote

125
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,360
It is like one thing it is like one time that Chris said she would like to

126
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
She would like to pretend to be a girl

127
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,360
Like and then described like a scenario where like

128
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,840
She had like a slumber party with other girls right to like get less to have like a lesbian slumber party or something

129
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:49,320
She's yeah, she's it was ten years ago. It was like ten years ago. Oh, so just like yeah, like

130
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,120
Foreshadowing that's the evidence. That's not every that's so stupid

131
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,900
Everyone is everybody says the same thing. They all just accept it. They're like, oh, she said it one time

132
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,580
One time she said, yeah, I would like to pretend to be a woman

133
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,100
I mean, I don't have a lesbian slumber party. It doesn't surprise me at all like their arguments are based off of

134
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,740
Mostly just hearsay and they'll believe it as soon as possible just because

135
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:21,780
They hate her and they are so convinced. Yeah, they just they're so convinced by that bullet in my gum

136
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,900
They are so convinced and so so many of them repeat that same point that I I

137
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,020
Honestly thought that the evidence that there would be more to it than there is

138
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,860
but like, oh my god, just

139
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:43,380
Gee, I can't I can't imagine I can't imagine a scenario where like gee, I don't know someone who later on

140
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,060
Realizes that they are a girl or just had to be that they want to identify as as female

141
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,660
I can't imagine a scenario where before they make that decision. Maybe they joke about ha ha

142
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,380
What if I did that or think about what if they did that?

143
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,460
Like I can't that that would blow my fucking mind right there

144
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,660
It's so weird cuz like if that was the even if that was true though, it's it's like

145
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,900
The right like the autonomy of it still wouldn't matter it still wouldn't matter

146
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,340
How do you even know that it's insincere you can't judge that from the outside you can just assume

147
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Based on you know, I don't know

148
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,900
Nothing really

149
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,460
You're just guessing and even if you could tell for example like

150
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,660
It's so like getting into like the minutiae of like philosophically, what does it mean to be a gender or

151
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,980
To like identify as this or that if you do it for X reason is it invalid?

152
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,740
I mean

153
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,940
Yeah, that's a that's a philosophical question

154
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,060
That is not like an obvious yes or no answer, but they're not using it like that

155
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:00,220
They're just using it as like a cheat like a you know, it's it's just another bullet. It's like it's like I got you

156
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,380
Oh, she did it for this reason. Well, you can't do that. You can't do that for that

157
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,980
That doesn't I've just decided that like anybody I don't like transitions because they want to have lesbian sex instead of

158
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,140
non-lesbian sex

159
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:19,300
You know is I not actually trans, you know, I just think that like if you want if you are you know

160
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:27,420
If you are a quote-unquote trans woman. Oh, and you want to have sex with other women

161
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,980
You can just scoot right along there buster

162
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
No, no, it doesn't count

163
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
It just doesn't count and

164
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,700
I doesn't annoy me. It's just sort of a

165
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,460
Notable that like so many of them they have you know

166
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:57,260
The that meme that's like the two people talking. I think it's like a a version of like a

167
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,060
Progressive comic whereas a person's like here's how to just

168
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,300
Correct someone when they make a wrong pronoun

169
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Oh, oh the the oh

170
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:15,820
He and then the lady says she she says like she raped her mother. Oh, excuse me. She raped her mother. Yes

171
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,460
I know they I feel like they post that as if it's like a slam dunk

172
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,340
They they put yeah, they post that as though it's like ha ha

173
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,980
Wouldn't it be silly?

174
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,940
Wouldn't it be like obviously this is what you look like and I'm like it's just right. It's just correct

175
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,700
Yeah, like I literally just right. I feel like they just they they they can't

176
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
separate the idea of

177
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,420
respecting

178
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,620
transness and pronoun usage

179
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:52,620
Concept and they literally and defending they're like they're like from rape accusations cuz we don't it's like it's all or nothing thinking

180
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,100
It's it's all they all they all are like imagine

181
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,260
Imagine defending rape imagine thinking. Yeah, like rape is okay. I'm like, what are you talking about?

182
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:07,020
You're you're delusional. You're you're having a fucking schizoid episode right now. Like you're literally just making shit up

183
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,020
It you don't live in fucking reality. You imagine it's like. Oh, this is a male murderer

184
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,300
Mmm, probably a female actually. I don't respect their gender. I'm gonna call them a oh she

185
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,020
Wow, I don't want this one to be one of my cis people. So I'm gonna yeah, it's bad

186
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,020
I don't think for this murder to be

187
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,560
He doesn't get he doesn't get to be a cis male anymore now. He's a

188
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,060
Rapist or whatever, you know, like criminal of gender like it's so

189
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,300
Transparenly like a transphobic B. Like like I don't know

190
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,260
Distraction like they just are doing every every realize it maybe

191
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,700
Going through every murderer in history and retroactively deciding that they don't that they don't deserve human respect

192
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,540
And therefore I get to decide that actually they were all trans women, you know, because I'm such an ally

193
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,820
And I just think that would be better that way, you know, oh

194
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,140
man

195
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:14,220
Wait just to okay. So the thing about the the quote-unquote debate with that fucking guy is that

196
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,280
he he tries to get I he tries to um

197
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,500
You know, he does all these things about like oh

198
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,580
Chris, I don't think he actually said like Chris doesn't have trans dysphoria

199
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:34,460
I'm not sure if he actually said that but I I got him on I asked him like what makes a trans woman a woman and

200
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,220
I he's he I got him to say he I didn't even have to get it out of him. He said he was like

201
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,140
Okay, I thought he was gonna go the like the the truce camera

202
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,980
I thought he was gonna say like oh they need to be diagnosed by a doctor. They need to have medical dysphoria or whatever

203
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,140
No, he didn't do that. He said

204
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,460
Being a you know identifying as a woman makes you a woman. I was like, okay

205
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,980
So Chris identifies as a woman

206
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:08,540
therefore QED and like as far as I'm concerned as soon as he said that the argument was one because that's the point if

207
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:16,860
Making if being trans is is the same as identifying as trans if identifying as trans makes you trans, which it does

208
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,620
then

209
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,220
Chris does that

210
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,500
Therefore, she is a trans woman and it's as simple as that but then he but then he spent then he he spent the next like 10 minutes

211
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,140
Because the video is only like 15 minutes long

212
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,100
Then he spends the next like 15 minutes being like oh, but she says she's a son of you too like oh

213
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,260
But she also says she's a goddess. Oh, but the other thing and like it's all irrelevant

214
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
It's all completely aside the point

215
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,460
So I just called him an idiot. I called him an idiot and I and he was like and I you know

216
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,980
I said it I called him an idiot. I said he was being transphobic by doing that

217
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,700
I said all these things and the comments are just like Ben's resorted to insults Ben

218
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,980
Said Ben called him a name. Therefore. He must have lost the argument because like that just means he was losing

219
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
but I like I

220
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,420
I

221
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,980
Don't know the the the comments on that video are terrible. They're all like it's I mean it's all his

222
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,060
Viewers, so I guess I shouldn't expect them to be good, but it's really fascinating how like

223
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,220
The the majority of the comments are like

224
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,620
There it's like it's turf true scum shit. It's the same like hmm

225
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,780
Ben is so it's I it's like Ben is soy and not just an event her

226
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,420
Yeah, because he chafed at me call he chafed at me calling him a turf because he was like

227
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,620
Do you know what a turf is?

228
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,300
That's the means of feminists the f stands for feminists, and I'm not a feminine

229
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
Literally is one of those

230
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,100
The the the the comments are all most of them are just

231
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,100
Either an insult to me or saying like you know Ben was mad. Therefore. He's he lost lol

232
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,380
How how childish how childish of him to to to use a word a mean word

233
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,620
oh

234
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,020
There was there was the part there was the part where he was like

235
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:16,300
Ben you there are trans people that disagree with you and you disagree with them you're invalidating them

236
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,780
By doing that, and I'm just like mocking with it

237
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,060
Do you we do trans people agree with me because like he this was he's literally doing like a

238
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,060
Trans people like my trans friends say that it's okay. It's okay for me to be a tur

239
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,740
It's okay for me to be a tur

240
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,580
Okay, anyway

241
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:43,020
So yeah, that was like oh he he made he made a voice Ben made a voice that he was like making fun of the other guy

242
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,860
With his voice like that's childish and therefore he lost. He is a user

243
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
He is soy

244
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,620
Anyway, most of the comments are they're either just yes

245
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,660
They're either just insults to me about that or they are like actually it's transphobic to say Chris is

246
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,540
Trans because Chris is bad and you're saying that trans people can be bad and you that's bad. It's transphobic to say that

247
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,700
so actually Ben is the transphobic one right like that that a lot of it is like that shit and

248
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:21,140
Then but then these these people who are there to like ostensibly because they care about trying in a stupid and backwards way

249
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,540
That doesn't make any sense and and defeats itself

250
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,180
But like they are attempting on some level to be like pro trans rights

251
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,860
But they're right alongside like the other maybe like 20% of the comments that are just like ha ha lal you're both wrong

252
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,060
Trans people can never can never be meant a man can never become a woman

253
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,340
What makes you a woman is the ability to give birth this whole thing is yeah, that was really

254
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,380
They're all just open. They were like some of them are just openly like not fuck trans people. They're fake

255
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,860
They're all faking it. They're all delusional. They're all they should all be in a mental hospital like

256
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:58,140
Would you see your who you fucking are see who you're in the fucking on the side with look around you?

257
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,240
And let's see who is who is on the same side of this debate and be like oh wow

258
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
I'm arguing the same position

259
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
That the people that hate me are arguing

260
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,540
Just a whole okay to Blair whites

261
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Yeah

262
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,460
self-hating

263
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,180
Maybe indirectly, but definitely not helpful to other trans people

264
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,220
They called I called one

265
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,740
true scum trans woman on Twitter. I

266
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,780
Called her Blair white because she was doing the same thing. She was saying they're like

267
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,540
Chris doesn't get to be trans. She's not a real trans person

268
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,580
It is this is this is only hurting real trans people when you let someone be one of them because they say they are

269
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,620
And I called her Blair white and she was like she she said

270
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:53,020
Like the fact that you think that calling me Blair white as an insult shows that you're the real bigot

271
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,540
And then we got into it

272
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,660
And then we got into an hours-long argument and later on I go and I look at I look at her

273
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:07,500
Her timeline and on her time was she she made a couple posts about you know how the woke mob were bullying her, right?

274
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,500
She made a couple posts about that and one of them was like

275
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Why do the why do woke ease?

276
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,980
Think why do woke ease think that calling me Blair white is an insult. I would love to look like her

277
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,300
Right, I'd be so happy if I looked like her. Why do they think it's an insult to call me that?

278
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,620
And I'm like wow you know about what you look like you literally just don't understand you

279
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,100
I don't know what is the disconnect here. I don't know why you can't

280
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,460
It's like she's like pro Blair. It's like she doesn't even know what Blair white believes

281
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,940
It's like she like saw a picture of Blair and is like that's a pretty trans woman

282
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,000
I wish I looked and like that was it. It's like now. She's like a flip probe pro Blair

283
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,780
Or something. I don't know

284
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:05,740
Very that was like I did that was that like on Tuesday or something. I did that it was so cringe the whole debate was I

285
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,540
mean in my opinion like I

286
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,380
Got him. I got him to make the argument for me my arguments airtight. You can't be defeated

287
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,340
He he agrees that identifying as trans makes you trans therefore it follows that

288
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:27,500
Chris is a trans woman because she identifies as such none of the other bullshit that he tried to say or that anyone tries to say like oh

289
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,140
One time she said she was gonna fake it one time

290
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,040
You know she does all this other stuff blah blah blah none of that matters none of it pokes a hole in the main argument

291
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,300
People people complained at me like oh, but then it was bad optics of you to insult him. It was bad

292
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,460
I don't know. I don't care. I still won my argument won if you if you think it was bad optics

293
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,300
Even though my argument is self-evidently right then like I don't know whoops. What what can I do?

294
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,020
He did he did he did the he did the whole thing he did this is a pet peeve of mine

295
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,900
This isn't just him a lot of people do this and not even on this topic people do this in a lot of context in my life

296
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
I have had many people

297
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:17,060
Do pull this card on me where like I insist on my side of the argument and like

298
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,880
For saying that I am right and for saying that I have reason to think that I am right

299
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,460
They say like oh you're arrogant

300
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,420
Because that's so arrogant of you to just assume that you're right like

301
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,660
You moron he's I'll use him as an example

302
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,740
But you know it is if this goes for any like you fucking moron

303
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:46,620
We're having this argument because I think one thing I happen to be right, but I think one thing and you think another

304
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
How stupid are you?

305
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
That I'm like that I like

306
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:58,660
Insists on what I think and you're like that's so arrogant that you think you're right like what do you think?

307
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,860
Moron you fucking imbecile like what are you talking about like

308
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:10,100
To to like hone in on that like it's a point that you can add to your tally of like winning

309
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,740
Like Ben there were comments that were like Ben is just Ben just cares too much about being right

310
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,460
You know like Ben is just too he's just too focused on whether he's right or not like what what do you think?

311
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm here to talk about what do you think?

312
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,940
I'm here for what did you expect me to say?

313
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,860
Fucking idiots, man

314
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:37,580
It's all you know all all those all those comments and all the DMs and all the ads that I've been getting on all

315
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,580
Though and all the snarky retweets I've been getting

316
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:47,020
It's been a lot, but at the end of the day. I just remember like this is all it's all Kiwi farmers

317
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,820
They these are this is the crowd

318
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:56,540
All of my most negative and like most disgusting interactions that I've ever had online have been

319
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,180
When it's something to do with Chris and a bunch of people like

320
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,100
And a bunch of people get mad at me and they all act they all act this way

321
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,460
This is the worst it's ever been but it has it has happened to other times before and it's it's always this great

322
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,820
It's this like Chris Chris following Kiwi Farms crowd

323
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
They're they're just they're just nasty

324
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
They're just nasty people. They don't care

325
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,300
They don't care about anything. They'll just

326
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,940
And I just don't I just don't have any respect for them. I don't take their opinion seriously

327
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:34,460
There was one one thing I want to mention and this was very funny. It was that same person that said, you know

328
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,220
Calling me Blair White makes you the real big it wall

329
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
She she said

330
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,060
She she said that I because it was like because I didn't know

331
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:53,700
When it was something like when Chris said that that thing 10 years ago about like how what if I pretended to be a girl and had a

332
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
lesbian slumber party

333
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Totally not an egg thing to say

334
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,180
She she because I didn't know like that line

335
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:08,260
She said like you got to like learn your chrystery like you're you're a turn you supposed to be a chrystorian learn your chrystery

336
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
lull and then and

337
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,060
Then like mere posts later

338
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
So she says like

339
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,300
Chris identifies as a son of two and all son of two are male therefore

340
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,380
Chris is not a woman or something

341
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,180
And I'm like, okay first first of all, it's really obvious

342
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,420
It's really obvious that when Chris says oh, I'm son of two now

343
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,300
I'm magic hand now. She is role-playing as another

344
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,300
Character that is not her while like she herself

345
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:46,940
She still thinks considers Christine the person to be female like it's really obvious that that doesn't shouldn't conflict

346
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,780
Those are like two separate things, but whatever aside from that

347
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,900
Learn learn your fucking chrystery you nerd there are I just put out a lecture

348
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,780
I just put out that you should watch my lecture actually because it clearly explains that there are definitely female son of

349
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,380
Choose and male rosa choose. This is like

350
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,180
Uncontroversial and she she said she said

351
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:15,700
That's not that's a retcon. That's not widely accepted as cannon and like what are you fucking talking about?

352
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,660
It's in the comic. This is literally it's literally

353
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,460
I know it's it's common to say to accuse like Chris people of like being as dumb as Chris

354
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,900
herself

355
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,940
But like that is literally as dumb as something Chris

356
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,980
That is basically like what Chris tried to do with slime and punishment where she she said like that's not the cannon

357
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,700
This is the cannon. This is her being like no, no, no

358
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,380
Like Chris's only certain parts of Chris's comic actually count like the other parts don't count like those aren't cannon

359
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,580
Like you fucking moron you imbecile you Rube

360
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,700
I

361
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,100
Couldn't believe it. I just I

362
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,380
Just can't fucking believe these people. I have nothing but disdain for them

363
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,260
They their opinions are less than worthless

364
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,700
I just get I just get more and more convinced that I am right the more I see what kind of person disagrees with me

365
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,660
Yeah

366
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:18,820
At the very beginning I was wondering like how many people were like, oh, you know the news came out and they're like

367
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:26,220
Just the first thing they hear just happens to be like should we care about the Chris's gender?

368
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
I mean they

369
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:34,940
They're doing some weird shit right now and people like instinctually might be like, oh geez. I guess that I guess it may be not

370
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,420
But no, they seem to all be kind of already fucked

371
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,340
They they really seem to like have a lot of problems

372
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,940
They went into they went into it with a with an image. Yeah, if you if you don't know

373
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,860
Okay, I understand if you don't know anything about Chris and you hear this person

374
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,260
Identifies as a woman and raped their mom

375
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:06,020
I guess like I can understand why what pops into your head is some like Buffalo Bill asks asks serial killer, right?

376
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
And you're like, oh, well

377
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,140
Why would I?

378
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:18,780
Take their word for it, right like sure, but if you if you know anything if you if you understand anything about Chris

379
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,460
It's not very hard

380
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,380
It's not very hard to see to make to see the

381
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,860
Logical idea that like Chris did these bad things, but also is like very sincere and

382
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,380
Serious about the the gender thing, right? Like whatever else you might think about them

383
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,700
It's just

384
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,860
Simple it's just a simple concept that a certain

385
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,260
category of people

386
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:55,580
Just simply doesn't have it in them either intellectually or spiritually to wrap their minds around and for that I pity them

387
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,980
Yeah, what what else

388
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,540
What else is there to say oh

389
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,860
Man a half an hour in I didn't expect to spend that much time on it

390
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,100
We never have to talk about it again, which I think we never have to talk about it again

391
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,540
again that

392
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,540
People ask me should should I watch the debate and I was like probably not it's not that funny

393
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,940
It'll just make you mad like no one no ground is gained

394
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,340
If you want if you just want to hear me like loudly and repeatedly

395
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,220
repeat

396
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,500
The truth that could the correct argument that you can't be that wins

397
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,820
I guess you could if you wanted to but there's probably no need

398
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,020
Yeah, they're yeah, you're right now. We never have to talk about it again. What a shit show. Oh

399
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
well the the I

400
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,660
Mean I I don't I mean I hesitate to call it harassment, but the the harassment has has is slowing down considerably

401
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:10,940
It'll probably be a thing of the past pretty soon. Yeah, it's still they'll get bored. I mean, yeah, it's it was just you know

402
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,820
It's not it's funny not even a 20-minute video, right?

403
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,140
It's it's funny that sometimes

404
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:23,860
Sometimes someone will be like DMing me or adding me or having like a real they seem like really angry at me and

405
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Like as soon as I stop engaging

406
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,780
Maybe I'll check if they were particularly vicious. Maybe I'll check their timeline and I'll see like

407
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,380
immediately they just went back to like some

408
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:40,300
like just having a totally unrelated conversation or like just retweeting hentai or just like

409
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,500
There was one guy who like immediately like immediately after we stopped talking

410
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,940
He went and like retweeted some hentai and was like, hey, I want her to do that to my dick

411
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,700
What are you? Okay? I guess this was really serious for you

412
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,140
That guy whatever it doesn't matter I

413
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:06,180
Could I could spend I could probably spend this whole episode going into the minutia of that guy was being a great

414
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,940
This way this lady was being a hypocrite in this other way. I

415
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,380
I have been doing a little something this this last week past week

416
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,100
I've been streaming some more on

417
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,340
Streaming don't give it up give and yeah

418
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
Streaming I was streaming

419
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,540
Dark Souls

420
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:34,180
Randomizer run where you randomize all the items and all the enemy placements and it's really fun because uh

421
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,660
You can have you can do lots of different like settings so you can make

422
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:48,020
You can make it so that the buses are replaced with different buses, but they try to like make it unique

423
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:55,060
So you're not gonna get like 20 like see the scale this is through the playthrough. You can get like you'll see

424
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,540
maybe one of each

425
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,940
bus like just in the wrong place

426
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,140
Hmm and also you can have like random enemies spawn boss it as bosses instead

427
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,180
At a as at a percentage and it's just it's been really fun

428
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
It's good. Yeah, but wait

429
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,860
You play you play Dark Souls like hundreds of times. I played it. I played it like once I

430
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,100
Played it once just once you played it for the did you you you weren't uh in the dark

431
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:34,540
No, I was not in the Dark Souls right and frankly, I'm glad I didn't because I saw what Nate had to do to win that shit

432
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,540
And I'm like

433
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,620
That was like a skill-based execution that must have taken like a ton of practice

434
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,740
That I never could have imagined

435
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,220
You both you and Nate love to like grind to tears to get the perfect time

436
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Stupid little PCP show

437
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,020
Honestly, yeah

438
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:02,860
You can help yourselves. It's it's a shame. It's a shame that like nobody watched the Kirby race

439
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,580
I think I grinded so much to win that Kirby race

440
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,620
Nobody else took it as seriously as I did but I fucking

441
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,660
That was more. I mean the the Pokemon race was not really about I mean, I did grind

442
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,900
I did do the Pokemon run over and over and over again

443
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,860
You know, you know, I actually was probably about equivalent. I spent a lot of time

444
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,740
Actually spent a lot of time grinding on on both of those

445
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,260
What was the other one? There was the Dark Souls race the Pokemon race the Kirby race and there was one more, right?

446
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:37,260
Uh, was there one more? I don't I think we had plans. I can't remember. What else we did. Yeah, we talked

447
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I thought we did another one in between

448
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,780
Pokemon and Kirby let me have a go look

449
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,100
Mmm

450
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,820
Those those videos were were good. They're memorable

451
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,940
They're yeah, they're good videos

452
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,420
Yeah, but

453
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,420
I mean for me

454
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,300
They were very work-intensive like I spent I spent like all week

455
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,180
For both of them grinding that shit

456
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,260
uh

457
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,980
The the Kirby one I had to discover the like

458
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:15,980
The the strat of like um getting getting like the randomized like mix-up power and then timing it perfectly to get the exact power

459
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,980
You need for that section is like

460
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,180
You just got to do it over and over and over and over again until you get it right and then you got to execute perfectly

461
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,700
It was fun though. Yeah, we've already we only did I do like grinding

462
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,860
I do I do I do

463
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,220
I do like I guess I kind of do look just like grinding shit out. Yeah

464
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,300
Uh, I guess okay. I guess you only did three. So yeah, the last one's 2017

465
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,340
That's the Kirby race

466
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Wow four years ago

467
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,460
It was it was it's like been a constant thing not not constant

468
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,740
But like every so often I'm like, ah shit those were fun

469
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,260
It sucks that no one can agree on what game to do next

470
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,540
We we did agree on what game to do next we were gonna do doom

471
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,340
um

472
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
But that was like a long time ago

473
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
I mean

474
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I see I would still be the editor for that I guess because I like doing those

475
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
They're fun to like time everything up

476
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,460
But then they would just be you versus tom, which I guess is not a terrible thing

477
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,700
But tom would

478
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,140
Tom would I I mean tom is more familiar with doom than I am so probably probably he would win

479
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,540
I'm also just I'm bad at first person shooters also. So yeah, tom would probably win and like only two people is not as

480
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,140
It's not as good as like six. I think we already have like six people on the pokemon race

481
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,100
Yeah, there were four people in the dark souls race, and I think there were like three on the Kirby race

482
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,660
It was Nate munchie and you yeah

483
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,060
Mike my Kirby strat was like so advanced. It was such

484
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,780
My pokemon strat too. I guess was also extremely advanced. Yeah, you did the funny glitch thing

485
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,660
I did the funny glitch Nate I

486
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,340
Nate Nate like also did the glitch thing, but he only did like the simple version

487
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,340
I did like the full version like the full rock through walls, which is like

488
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:15,260
It was fun the fun that I got to show that I mean I still think about sometimes how like

489
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,580
When I was doing like practice runs of the block brock through walls glitch

490
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,140
I had that weird visual glitch that like turned me

491
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,620
They're like warped the world and then like turned my sprite into the old man sprite for a second and then like

492
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,940
Powered off and I like am so sad that I wasn't recording because it was such like a

493
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,380
Weird creepypasta sort of sort of glitch moment

494
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,140
Oh, I turned into an old man and then the whole world went like white and then it and then I died

495
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,740
It was like the end of fucking synecdoche, new york spoilers

496
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
um

497
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,580
cynic yeah

498
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
Yeah, um

499
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,900
Yeah, I don't know. I mean

500
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:01,660
We could maybe get like have the same like we got gamers tavern. He's a gamer cyber shell is a gamer

501
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740
Maybe we could have like a pcp guest

502
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,740
race

503
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,820
Including ben and tom

504
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,820
If four people were down to play are you not down to do a doom race?

505
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,180
um

506
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,380
Doom I I mean I guess I could but I like editing them

507
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,140
Actually, no, I did the dark souls one didn't I I participate that yeah, I could I could do doom sure

508
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,060
Well, if if four people if four people were

509
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,380
Down and committed to like yeah, we're doing this doom race. Yeah, I would I would do I would do the doom race

510
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,180
We'd have to think of the rules of like where we go and what version of the game

511
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,980
Um, but yeah, that should be I think it should be tom

512
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:45,020
I think tom proposed the idea and I think he had an idea in mind for it

513
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,740
I think he's it was like first level and just um

514
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
Or something he he had a proposal

515
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
When he when he pitched the the doom idea

516
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,060
if yeah, if

517
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,020
I'm just I'll write me in as like potentially down

518
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:08,300
Write me in as down. I am I am in if if three other people are in and we say we're doing this then I will I will do it

519
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,700
Stay tuned for that it may be maybe maybe

520
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,740
I'll I'll I'll take it in right now

521
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,140
I'll add everyone

522
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,660
I can't believe those three bonus episodes are still not out

523
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,900
I think it's

524
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,500
I think tom's just hasn't gotten around to uploading them. I shouldn't I shouldn't

525
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,420
I shouldn't I shouldn't point the finger, but I think it's literally just like they are made and just like

526
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,420
well

527
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,420
Someone needs to upload them, but also

528
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,860
I said that like we need to

529
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,340
like change the like

530
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,860
url

531
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,860
or change like the um

532
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,420
the um the um

533
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,620
Change because like a lot of like former patrons still have access to the

534
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,860
Videos and we need to like change it so that like, you know only the patrons

535
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,420
Yeah, like to change the url or just like or I think tom proposed like

536
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Instead of making it a playlist that is potentially like the url can be potentially copied and passed around

537
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,860
Make it like a a patreon master post that just like links to every episode

538
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,820
And uh and have that be

539
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,940
The the like the way they're they're accessed

540
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,300
I think maybe that's what we should do is someone will just need to like rewrite

541
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,700
That the patreon post I guess god, I mean, I guess I could just

542
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
I guess I could just do that

543
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
it was just

544
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,740
So, uh

545
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,020
Yeah, okay, so I should

546
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:48,300
I guess I should probably just go do that and then we can have those three bonus episodes and then there'll be no problem

547
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,060
Including the one where I grant and rave to cybershell for four hours about how much I hate Tracey

548
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,380
Oh, that one's good. I like that one

549
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,140
I always think that that that way you you were thinking just then

550
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:09,740
Like like oh, I've got all these things to do. I say out loud to myself or on stream or just somewhere like, oh, yeah

551
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,140
I really have all those things to do

552
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,140
and it's just followed by like

553
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:21,420
The the the like the deafening silence of me deciding to not do them anyway, even though I'm not doing anything. I like

554
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,540
Uh, yeah, so many things I've got to do. I've got to do those things

555
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,860
I'm trying to be positive and affirmative and be like, yes, those things must be done. I will do them

556
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
And now I'll do those things

557
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,060
I mean, you know, there are

558
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,820
In any given week, there are a multitude of distinct things that all you know, uh, uh are

559
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,740
On that level where I'm like, I guess I got to do that. I guess I should do that. Okay. I better do it

560
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
And these things conflict with each other

561
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,300
Um, for me, it's mostly the the the phantoms revenge game which

562
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,660
I finished, okay

563
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,340
I made

564
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,820
I made a cutscene. This was like one of the things that I had to do is like I had to

565
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,860
I basically had to program

566
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:18,700
A cutscene I made one of them. It's like very rough. It's like I sort of like roughly blocked it out and in its basic like timing

567
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,860
So it's not a completed cutscene, but I have one cutscene

568
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,740
Like made enough that it counts and and I consider that to be a win because this is like, okay

569
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,620
I can use this template of how I made this one

570
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,900
I can use this to make I think there's like

571
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,580
Three or four more that I have to do and I can be like, all right

572
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:46,620
I could basically copy and place this template for how I did it and just and then go back through them and just kind of

573
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,500
You know, fill them out with like the actual nitty gritty of like how I want the sprites to move around and animate and stuff

574
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
Which is it's a lot of work, but uh

575
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,380
Having having the the bear the blocks in place

576
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,540
Makes it feel like oh the game is not in an unplayably broken state the game is like

577
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:13,500
Technically playable and there and it feels like it feels closer to being done having it this way

578
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
uh, yeah

579
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,700
uh, man

580
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,780
I can't believe it's been eight months of me making this piece of shit

581
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,860
Okay, it gives me vertigo gives me vertigo when I think about it like that

582
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,700
Dang months. Yeah the fuck I feel like I don't know I've been

583
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,220
Like stationary

584
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,100
For the whole year

585
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,220
Even though I have done things. It's not like a lot

586
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:50,620
Lord of Ghost Kickstarter was the only one big thing and even that was mostly just making the page

587
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,740
Yeah, I

588
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,340
I feel like that I usually when I'm like I

589
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,620
I

590
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,020
Yeah, I always feel like what have I actually done this year

591
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,940
What when I actually try to think about it like there are things that I have done

592
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,220
But like when I first think about I'm like the year went by and I didn't do anything

593
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,860
The whole like most of the year is gone and I like didn't do anything. What what am I thinking?

594
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:22,380
It's it's not completely true. My birthday has already happened this year. That doesn't make sense. It's already like summer is nearly over

595
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
Yeah

596
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,260
Summer has come at last

597
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,180
The year has gone so fast

598
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:40,940
Wake me up. I'm gonna cry when September ends. You know how you know what that's how to do

599
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,540
That's how it be sometimes then october ends and then november ends and then

600
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,260
Oh christmas time true true. Um

601
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,140
Um

602
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,300
Have I mentioned

603
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,780
I'm throwing out this there. Have I have I talked about my bit?

604
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,500
on twitter

605
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,820
Where I will pay people to unpledge from Trixie. Have I talked to mention that on the pcp?

606
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,140
I don't think so

607
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,940
Okay, I want to make that I want to announce that here again. Nobody's taken me up on this offer

608
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,780
I don't understand one one guy took me up on the offer

609
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,660
And then I think most people who pledge to Trixie do not follow ben saint on twitter

610
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:32,060
I know I know I know but one one guy was like I was gonna unpledge anyway

611
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:37,100
I'm good. I have a one. I'm a one dollar pleasure and I was gonna unpledge anyway, and I was like great

612
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,580
I'll give you two dollars to do it now

613
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,780
And then the next day

614
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,940
I saw her her pledges went down like 15 dollars and I'm just I'm something like if that guy

615
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:55,340
Whoever that was if they had just told me if they had just told me I'm gonna do that

616
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,340
I would have given them

617
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,340
like 20 bucks

618
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,540
Just just to say that like I paid him to do it

619
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,980
It would have been worth it to me. I wouldn't I would have loved it. We all everyone would have benefited nobody loses in the situation

620
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,540
um

621
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,260
How many man-outs have gone into Trixie?

622
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,140
spite do you think?

623
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,660
Well

624
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,580
I mean

625
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,580
Jeez, let me let me think

626
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,900
Since like march or whatever

627
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,220
It's been like five months

628
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,460
Probably spend a few hours a week on it

629
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
so

630
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,420
so uh

631
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,460
How many how many phantom's revenges could have been made with that?

632
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,340
A small fraction of one that's a small fraction of one

633
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,420
um

634
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,020
I I

635
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,380
People people people get on my case people get on my case on twitter and they're like ben this is ben

636
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,820
This is this is too spiteful ben. This is like no

637
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,700
It's not about the amount of spite don't for me don't attack don't attack the patreon ben

638
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,380
No, she needs that money ben like no, she's in a she's in a rough spot

639
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,540
You know, she's she's going through a rough time

640
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,700
You know, you can't like that's her like that's her her her livelihood

641
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,700
I'm like, oh my god, you fucking idiot you fucking simp g

642
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,180
Yeah, if someone didn't have if someone didn't have

643
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:29,900
Their patreon money in addition to their like, you know ad revenue and their sub-stack revenue and their

644
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:37,500
And like all these other like passive streams of income that the average person doesn't have if she were to lose a small fraction

645
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:44,940
Of of that like god. I don't know what she would do. I don't know what she could possibly do

646
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:50,300
Right like living with her parents not paying rent getting an allowance

647
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,020
On top of all these other free money

648
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,060
That people just give her that she just makes from the internet like it would be like, oh my god

649
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,460
what if she

650
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,740
Do like like

651
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,900
That would just be it would be it's it's tragic like if you can't you can't do that you can't do that

652
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,300
It's not it's it's it's cruel. It's cruel ben

653
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,780
You're going after her livelihood fuck off

654
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,300
god

655
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:18,940
Yeah, I imagine like imagine imagine not having that imagine having to like get a job or something

656
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,100
Like what damn if if she had to get a job or something like that would just be the worst thing imagine

657
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,180
That would be the world fate worse than death honestly

658
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,060
It's back to the radio shack

659
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,260
Um, um, wait, no, what was it? This is the target

660
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,900
She worked on a target. Yeah, yeah

661
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,980
target full circle one

662
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,580
One person. I mean, that's what I want. I mean, I I joke

663
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,820
I joke because I I don't actually have the power to make that happen

664
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,060
But if I could snap my fingers and make that happen, I would that is what I want

665
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,740
Uh, let let there be no ambiguity there. Um

666
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,620
Uh, uh one guy one guy really offended me

667
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,660
I hope he's not listening now because I don't I don't really care to call a person out

668
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,700
But I I do want to mention that there's one train of thought

669
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,340
one person was like

670
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,340
G ben, you know

671
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:19,260
I think your criticism to her valid, but I just can't help but wonder like what if she kills herself and commits suicide

672
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,660
over this bullying

673
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,660
frowny face

674
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,900
He didn't he didn't exact he didn't exactly phrase it as like a

675
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,260
You were actually kind of like killing her

676
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:39,660
You were actually kind of like forcing her to kill herself ben like went by by like being mean to her on twitter

677
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,140
But like the implication was there

678
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:48,220
And I went off on that guy because I think I think that's a genuinely like a genuinely like diseased way to think like

679
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
I think that was like some sick

680
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,580
sick shit

681
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,860
to say

682
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:57,340
On the internet. Yeah to put that on someone like casually as well. I think I read it

683
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,500
It was like he it was just it made me feel nauseous. Oh, I don't

684
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:07,260
Oh, uh, like when you confronted them, they were like, oh, I didn't mean anything

685
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,300
I was just saying it could happen. You know that guy did

686
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,140
I told them that I think he's a sick fuck and he needs therapy, which I do

687
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,060
Um, and he he like kind of apologized, but like frankly

688
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,780
It was a tepid apology

689
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:25,100
When like he needed to be like he needed to be like ashamed of himself

690
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,660
And like he wasn't he wasn't

691
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,940
Significantly like disgusted and embarrassed with his own

692
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,940
Uh behavior

693
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,380
So I kind of felt like I I wouldn't call admission accomplished there

694
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,860
Uh, I didn't quite I didn't quite impress upon him

695
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,580
like just

696
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,180
just how like

697
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,180
vile

698
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,180
Uh, such such behavior is

699
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,220
But oh well, you can't you can't win them all

700
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,180
Uh

701
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,180
Yeah, I mean

702
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,180
With regards to people giving you shit about it. I don't really mind the spite

703
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,860
So much as the fact that you are wasting time on it because it's not doing I mean

704
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,740
I guess you could say I guess that's that one guy

705
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,380
Unpledge, but I feel like people are unpledging

706
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:20,460
For other reasons than ben sainte. It's like funny tweet. Well, obviously obviously because they're not even they're not even

707
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,420
Coming and telling me and getting their fucking free money

708
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,220
Yeah, it's free real estate

709
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:34,220
I don't know you say you enjoy it. Maybe you do. Maybe it's fine. I just I feel like such things are

710
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,340
Are just bad generally like being on twitter a lot

711
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,380
I I is clearly not a good thing to do

712
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,820
I understand

713
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,500
Yeah

714
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,020
I mean

715
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,260
If I could just if I could just be

716
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,100
You know a perfectly logical rational person

717
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,060
Probably the thing to do would be like, you know, if I don't like someone

718
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,860
I just shouldn't

719
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,420
Well, you know, it was kind of spurred on this week by the oh, yeah, the big reveal tricksy finally

720
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:13,900
tricksy finally, uh, was disgusted enough with the people that like her content to just announce like

721
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,540
Oh, yeah, I deleted it the brony lecture. It's gone. I deleted it. Fuck you. You're never getting it

722
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,020
So, you know, this was, you know, there was a moment of like renewed like

723
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:32,460
About that. So that that kind of kicked me that kind of kicked me into back into high gear with it this week. Um

724
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,340
You know, I mean you're you're right

725
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,260
It's like the I think it's the the buddhist saying, you know when

726
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:45,820
Holding on to anger is like being being being spite is like, uh, it's like

727
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:53,180
Yeah, it's like holding on to a hot coal in your hand thinking that like you'll you'll throw it at someone, right?

728
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:59,100
Something that is like, uh poisoning yourself hoping that they'll die or something

729
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,580
Yeah, yeah, something like that. I understand

730
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,900
I understand but since since I'm not a rational a fully rational being

731
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,140
Um

732
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,260
I am I am gonna I'm gonna be mad

733
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,340
I'm gonna be mad because I I truly don't think it's uh acceptable

734
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,220
The way she's behaved and so I might as well. I don't know make a funny bit out of it

735
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,660
If there's if there's nothing if there's no way or out of it, I might as well

736
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:34,300
I might as well make it into I might as well make content out of it. You know what I'm saying

737
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:42,380
Yeah, no no wasted content here like I can't I can't like moral moral like high ground this because I

738
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,780
I find it funny as well

739
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,740
It would be it would be I I think it's I think it's really funny

740
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,540
I think it's really funny that I can litter that it that one guy actually took me up on it

741
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,300
I wish more would but I the fact that even one

742
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,180
Did it I'm like, okay, that that's

743
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,900
The the bit was worth it was worth it

744
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,220
um

745
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,180
Off offer still open though offer will remain open offer will remain open until

746
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,620
She is back to working at target or bagging groceries

747
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,580
That is the end game unironically

748
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,420
It is the end game, but I know that I I know that I don't have the power to do it alone

749
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,300
So you you have to you all have to lend me your energy

750
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,860
Yes, you have to lend me your energy with this one. We have to do it together

751
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
comrades

752
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,460
Well

753
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,460
Yeah, brony lecture brony lecture deleted

754
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,900
Oh, I there was a funny thing. Um, I had I had made

755
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,620
Before she announced that like I deleted it. It's never happening. Well, uh

756
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,020
I had made the the the tier list the lecture tier list

757
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,740
And I had I had thrown in the little easter egg in there where I just I didn't mention it

758
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,220
But I I put a fake I made a fake thumbnail and I put the fake thumbnail

759
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:07,740
Of the brony lecture into the tier list and I put it in my in like I put it in a rank

760
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,340
Just so that like anyone who was making it would be like wait a minute

761
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,340
Which one is this which one is this and some some people actually fell for it

762
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,820
some people actually were like oh wait wait the bro like

763
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,380
They they recognized what it was and they thought it meant that the that that was out

764
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,820
um

765
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,820
sign and that and that yeah

766
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,420
and then I um

767
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:36,780
And I I I changed my I changed my twitter handle to brony lecture truth there and I I started posting like conspiracy posts about like

768
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:43,260
Wait a minute, but but it was referenced in it was referenced in the the the tier list

769
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,940
It's in the tier list

770
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,940
Which was before she said that she deleted it. So like where did it go?

771
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,700
Like why did why is there a thumbnail like there wouldn't be a thumbnail if it weren't posted somewhere?

772
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,180
Oh, who who's hiding the truth?

773
00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:01,900
Um, it's a covet. It's a covet 19 vaccination conspiracy. It's bill gates. It's bill gates trying to silence her

774
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:09,180
Uh, okay, it's deleted because he has the power to like delete files off of any windows computer

775
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,100
Yes, true true. He has the map the kill switch

776
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,580
Uh

777
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:21,340
I had some fun with it. I had some fun with it. Um, but boy am I upset

778
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,220
I I kind of I kind of thought

779
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,780
You know this whole time I have known like there is a chance that Trixie has deleted

780
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,940
The the brony lecture and just never thought that it was worth mentioning

781
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,980
Uh, but I I decided that like on the off chance that maybe she hasn't

782
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,820
Maybe it's worth needling her about like, um, you know

783
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:48,220
Why not post the brony lecture? Your channel is in the fucking toilet. A lot of people want to see the brony lecture

784
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,540
Why not post the brony lecture?

785
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,580
Um

786
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:58,380
But you know now now I guess it I guess it the I guess she was that was just so offensive to her that now

787
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:04,700
She's she's confirmed that no it's gone. It's gone. I just write it. Um, so you know, I feel like mission failed

788
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,780
But there was a really deleted it like when she left the pcp in a huff

789
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,620
Maybe

790
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,660
Maybe yeah, probably because that was when it was being discussed

791
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,620
And she just never mentioned it because why would she I guess?

792
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,660
Yeah

793
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,660
Yeah, probably

794
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,780
Again though, you know, she said when she left she

795
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,060
Said on twitter

796
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,660
She made it sound like she left because I was insisting on the brony lecture

797
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:39,660
That wasn't why she left she left because she left because I said her channel was tanking and that riley was uh

798
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,220
Was was scamming her

799
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,460
Which in hindsight

800
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:49,820
I I don't I don't think I don't think I think that riley is a scammer anymore. I think he's an opportunist

801
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,540
and I think that he was

802
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,300
Leap leaching off of her true, but like I don't think I don't think he like had a plan

803
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,860
I don't think he like knew what he was doing

804
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,540
Uh, they just they they just they just tanked the channel together

805
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:13,820
On all of their own but both of them genuinely thinking that they were like rational people doing their best

806
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:19,260
Incredible if you can that's I've changed my stance. That's what I think now

807
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,820
Lamar

808
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,300
Yeah

809
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:30,700
Very very very frustrating though to see I mean she to see here like to see here kind of kind of twisted and manipulated

810
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,460
Like that. I don't know but whatever. What what would I expect?

811
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,980
Oh, what if she but what if she what if she sure would be sad if she

812
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,420
Killed herself and committed suicide ben because of you

813
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,620
Sure would be sure would be fucked up

814
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,580
If she were to kill herself because you bullied her ben and it would be your fault

815
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,300
Hmm, wouldn't that be fucked up? Ha ha ha just kidding, but seriously though

816
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,980
Sad sad sad stuff, um

817
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,940
Okay, what what else is what else is on the fucking docket for this week?

818
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,220
I got nothing. I'm sorry. I've got I got like I got locked in my apartment

819
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:21,100
Oh, my my door knob fell off and I was literally locked in my apartment for

820
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,820
several hours

821
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,460
Until my roommate came home and we were able to like

822
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:32,940
Do like a two-man like like he manipulates the latch from the outside and I and or like no

823
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,860
And I I manipulate the latch from the inside and he pushes the door open

824
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:42,700
From the from the outside what I'm mixing up, but you know what I'm saying that we finally did manage to get the door open

825
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,260
So now we can exit and enter

826
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,180
It wasn't that long, but for a while there. I was just like well

827
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,340
I'm fucked the reason why

828
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,180
Uh, I it was when I was I was trying to check my mail

829
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,980
Was when I realized the door was broken

830
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:05,900
I was trying to check my mail because I was waiting for the arrival of the next thing that I want to talk about

831
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,900
Which is my new credit card

832
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,980
My new credit card, which is the coolest thing that I am obsessed with

833
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:17,180
I love credit. I love my new credit card. I love credit cards. I love credit card churning

834
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:22,620
Uh, this is my new thing. This is the the best thing that's happened to me. This is like, um

835
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:27,580
I I feel like when I when I feel like I just bought a shiny new like, you know

836
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,060
A vinyl like anime figurine like a new piece in my collection

837
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,860
I genuinely feel like I like I'm like admiring it sometimes and I'm like, yes

838
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,340
I feel like it's the same feeling as when you play cookie clicker

839
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,020
And you buy like an upgrade you buy like a all like

840
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,020
Oh, if I if I buy this if I'm saving up for this upgrade

841
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:57,260
If I'm saving up for this upgrade and I finally get it and now I get like a passive 5 bonus to my cookie production

842
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,460
Yes, I saved up for it and I got it. Um

843
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:04,700
A passive bonus like oh, this is gonna pay for itself. Um

844
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,980
I again, what's the churning thing you like use it up real quick

845
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,540
No, no

846
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:17,420
churning refers churning refers to yeah to getting new credit cards

847
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,740
Just to like

848
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:25,340
Obtain like the sign-up bonuses and then like getting it getting the sign-up bonuses and then just like

849
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,340
Getting a new card and and repeating the process. So like yeah

850
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,940
The new the new card. I just got it's it has a

851
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:39,500
If I spend like a certain amount within the first three months, I get a 200 dollar sign-up bonus

852
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,300
and I'm I got it now because like

853
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,580
Road to rad con is is being printed

854
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,860
And this is this is why I was looking for the card because I was like, okay road to rad con is is ready to be

855
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,420
It's ready to be printed. I need to pay for the printing

856
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,260
I want to do it with my new with this credit card

857
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:02,380
So I so I because I have to spend that money on this print stuff

858
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,860
You know, I'm gonna get reimbursed out of the rad con fund

859
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:11,900
But if I spend if I do it with this card, then that money will go towards my my spend amount

860
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,260
Which will qualify me for this free 200 dollars

861
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,740
of of free money

862
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,340
for spending money

863
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,940
um, so

864
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,940
Yeah, this was this was my strategy

865
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:27,180
and uh, uh, it's not illegal or anything. It's it's just uh

866
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:33,740
It's it's just like optimally gaming the the credit card system

867
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:38,140
So do you have to get a credit card with a different bank or something?

868
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,260
Surely they would notice if you're just doing it over and over again

869
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,060
Well, you can only do it so often

870
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:49,100
Like yeah, you will you will generally not just be approved for an infinite amount of credit cards

871
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:53,020
They will like they will start to decline you if you apply for too many too fast

872
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,460
um

873
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:59,420
But uh, this was the first one I applied for in a while. It just so happened to be with the same bank as the last one

874
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:05,500
Um, just because this one happened to offer a a can be a sign-up bonus that I could qualify for pretty easily

875
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,260
uh

876
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:13,420
It also okay, okay, let me explain the difference the difference between my two credit cards is my first one

877
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,380
It did my first one did not have a sign-up bonus

878
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:24,220
But I got my first one right before I was going to print the um the the vapors two books

879
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,300
um

880
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,260
And it was because it would give me two percent cash

881
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:33,580
It gives me two percent cash back on everything anything I buy with that card

882
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:37,180
I just automatically get two percent back as credit, right?

883
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,940
So every everything is just uh is two percent cheaper

884
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:47,260
The new card there's the sign-up bonus, but also on top it the first one was called city bank double cash

885
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,140
The second one is called city bank custom cash

886
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:58,620
And the city bank custom cash the way it works is it's when you buy stuff with it. It categorizes the things you buy into like, um

887
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,380
Categories, so they're like, you know groceries

888
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,860
Uh uh streaming services

889
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:11,500
Uh transportation, uh, you know stuff like that it categorizes it into categories

890
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:16,780
And then it picks whichever category you spent the most on that month

891
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:21,260
And then the first five hundred dollars you spent in that category

892
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,900
It will give you five percent cash back on and then one percent

893
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,980
It'll give you one percent on all on every other all the rest that you spent that month

894
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,100
So

895
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,820
The optimal play now I have these two credit card and I have to

896
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,220
Combine them in a way to get optimal cash back

897
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:41,100
The way to do it is to pick what i'm going to spend most of my money on which I think most

898
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,900
Most months would probably be

899
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,100
groceries

900
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:49,660
So I will buy all my groceries with the custom cash

901
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,100
I probably don't spend five. I don't spend five hundred dollars a month

902
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:59,580
On on groceries, but I spend the most so maybe I'll spend like two or three hundred or something on groceries

903
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:03,740
And I will get five percent back on that two or three hundred dollars

904
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,620
Probably not three hundred. Well, I will get five percent back on that much

905
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:14,540
And then I use my other card for everything else and get two percent back on everything that i'm not getting five percent back on

906
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,380
That's

907
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:20,620
And like the more the more cards you get the more you can like maybe kind of like min max

908
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:27,260
Like what your strategy is to get like the the the optimal cash back reward very very specific credit card for just

909
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,980
netflix or something

910
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:35,660
Yeah, genuinely. Yeah, like maybe you have a card that just has a deal with amazon and they offer like

911
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,340
You know five percent cash back only on

912
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,740
On streaming services

913
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:48,140
So you just get that card and you don't use it for anything except you just you pay for your streaming services with it

914
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:51,020
And then you just get five percent off your

915
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,060
Streaming services and the only the only problem is you just have to remember to pay the bill

916
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,820
um

917
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,100
I mean with most most most of the time with with churning like

918
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,100
You get a card you get the cash back the signup bonus

919
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,060
And then you either cancel it or you just never use it again

920
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,380
So you don't have to worry about about paying it back. You just like oh, I got the bonus. I don't need to use it anymore

921
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,860
Don't no no worries

922
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:23,340
I don't know this is like genuinely fun and like fascinating in sort of the way that maybe like fantasy football might be to some people

923
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:31,020
Where you're like meticulously like looking at stats and trying and trying to be like oh, how like how how will this work?

924
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,020
Like what's what's my strategy here?

925
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,340
Uh, uh, um

926
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:41,180
I don't know it's fucking epic is what i'm saying my new credit card is fucking epic

927
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,980
I uh

928
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,140
The idea of like

929
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,300
Taking care of all of that stuff though

930
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,500
I don't know. I'm not I'm not like that

931
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,100
I think it's it's fun. It's fun for it. This is like

932
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,060
when when I heard about churning I sort of

933
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:05,260
What when I realized when like I kind of knew this but when it clicked that like wait a minute

934
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,020
if you

935
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:13,100
If you like manage your credit cards and stuff if you like if you like do your your commerce in a certain way

936
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:17,260
You can just make it more efficient in a way that is effectively just free money

937
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,140
And like as soon as that clicked in my mind. I was like

938
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,620
why don't I just

939
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,260
Do that in every in every way that it's possible to do it

940
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:29,580
And I went down the rabbit hole and I found out about churning and I was like, why aren't I churning?

941
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:36,140
I probably should have been churning. Well the the reason why it's only now that I'm getting my second credit card

942
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,900
And I haven't been churning this whole time is because I've I've been waiting for

943
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,020
Something to require me to make a big part. It was the reason why I got my first one is because I had to make that big

944
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,300
It was like a thousand or two thousand dollars to print all those books

945
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:51,660
And I was like, well, I might as well get two percent cash back on those on that printing those

946
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,900
And then now now now it's now it's the I have to do the rad con stuff

947
01:08:55,900 --> 01:09:00,540
And I'm like, well, I might as well use this rad con expense to qualify for a cashback bonus

948
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,100
I should definitely do that for

949
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,300
The lord of ghosts things I still have to order

950
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,820
The only thing I have right now is the pins but all the comics and the plush needs to get it's

951
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,620
Got to get it's

952
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,700
When I

953
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,700
You know, I made it into my 30s

954
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,580
Only you're ever using a debit card

955
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,820
I never use a credit card because everyone told me all the fucking boomers in my life told me

956
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:27,980
You know

957
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,820
Don't don't charge stuff to your credit card. Don't get into credit card debt credit card debt

958
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,420
Will fuck you and like yeah credit card debt will fuck you

959
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:40,300
But just don't ever get in credit card debt. Just use it like a debit card and pay it back immediately

960
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,620
And then there's no there's no risk of that at all and as long as you're doing that

961
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,860
Paying with credit is just better. It's just strictly better

962
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:53,100
And even more so if you're getting like cashback on it. So

963
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,420
like

964
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,620
Yeah

965
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:00,220
Everything you buy you should be using a credit card that gives you benefits

966
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:07,740
And even more so with like the the big expenses and stuff like printing books and and you know like and business stuff

967
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,460
Um

968
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:17,020
I'm I don't I'm I'm not sure what my next cards. I'm gonna wait a month. I'm gonna try and wait a month and then

969
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,780
No, I don't know I'll have to

970
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:26,140
A lot of a lot of the cards that have bigger sign-up bonuses have like very hard like requirements to hit like

971
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,420
They'll get like they'll give you like 500 dollars in credit

972
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:34,220
But you have to spend like nine thousand dollars in the first like

973
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:38,540
Three months and I'm like I'm not gonna do that, right?

974
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:44,140
So on rslash churning, there's a big huge like spreadsheet of like, okay

975
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,140
Here are the most

976
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:51,340
Here are the most optimal way to like churn to get the maximum cash benefit rewards

977
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,900
But there's there's two problems and there's two things that like kind of ruin this chart for me is that one

978
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:00,860
By far the most efficient like credit card rewards

979
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:05,180
You can get are in the form of like travel miles like like free miles with airlines

980
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:09,820
That's the best like value for money, but I don't travel and I don't use like air travel

981
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:14,780
So it sort of would be pointless for me to to to do those cards that do that

982
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:19,580
Unless there were some way to exchange them for cash, which is is not always the case

983
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:20,860
um

984
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,380
And then the second one is that yeah some cards just have really high requirements

985
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,260
Like you have to spend nine thousand dollars and three months. I I can't do that

986
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:32,540
So even though those are like the most efficient ones, I have to kind of like skip over those and just be like, okay

987
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,340
But like what can I qualify for? Oh, okay

988
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,980
city bank custom cash

989
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:42,620
I have to spend 750 dollars to get 200 dollars back. Yeah, I can do that. That's easy

990
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:48,780
So I don't I don't know what my next churn is going to be but like I'll I'll have to I'll have to mall

991
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:55,100
Let me know in the let me know in the comments if you've got any recommendations for uh for cards with easy cash back bonuses

992
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,620
And sign up bonuses that I can qualify for on a budget

993
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,060
It's uh, it's like it's like, uh, it's just like outsmarting

994
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,700
It's just outsmarting the banks

995
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,260
That's what it feels like

996
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:13,740
They're they're like they offer they offer you these they offer you these tempting little nuggets and they're like

997
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:19,500
Well, um sign sign my bargain sign this this bargain young man

998
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:24,300
Sign this this deal with the devil and and and we'll give you yes

999
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,100
We'll entice you we'll entice you with free money

1000
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,820
But you know they do this with the expectation

1001
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,580
That you will like fuck it up

1002
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,900
You will violate the terms of the contract and then they can be like, aha. There was a secret clause

1003
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:41,420
Now you're now you're in debt to us for life now we get your soul now you owe us all this interest

1004
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:44,060
But if you if you just if you just

1005
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:49,020
You just don't you just don't fuck it up. You do it exactly by the rules you beat them at their own game

1006
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,980
You can just get free money out of them

1007
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:59,020
And it's so based this is my new fucking thing. This is the new credit credit card podcast

1008
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:07,580
Oh speaking of boring speaking of boring money shit that nobody wants to hear about. Uh, it's time for ben's bitcoin crypto corner

1009
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:15,900
Update uh, everyone was wrong everyone was wrong to criticize me. It has in fact risen slightly

1010
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,620
Since I bought yes, I did notice

1011
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,540
So it was go it was trickling down, but it had another

1012
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:26,620
Not a huge spike, but it spiked up above where it's still

1013
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,900
It's the trend is still overall bearish. I am

1014
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,100
I am considering that like maybe

1015
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:39,740
This is made like like trading volume is kind of low. So maybe that means that this is a

1016
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,700
temporary peak

1017
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,140
And that it is

1018
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,740
bearish

1019
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,740
It is relative in fact bearish

1020
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:53,500
Uh, bearish bearish means it's gonna go down bullish means it's gonna go up. Oh, okay. Yeah, I

1021
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:56,060
I mean last

1022
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,980
Last episode

1023
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:01,740
I thought that it it it it definitely had slowed down

1024
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,780
And then it was go and right after the episode

1025
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,020
It went down, but then it's shot up again a little bit only on bitcoin though

1026
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,660
On a theory it's just been going down

1027
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,580
Really?

1028
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:17,020
Well, not totally it did go up at the same time as bitcoin, but didn't go quite up

1029
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,580
that much

1030
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,620
So I guess I'll post the graph

1031
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:25,420
It's not so bad that I sold

1032
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,580
But I am worrying. I'm you know, you can't help but worry. They're like, oh shit

1033
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:35,900
What if it does explode out of nowhere with no warning and no like you couldn't have been expecting that to happen

1034
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,700
Yeah, and then I would have missed out on on all the money, but

1035
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:41,260
This is this is um

1036
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:45,500
Yeah, so I I bought in I bought in like last week at around

1037
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:51,420
47 k and now it is it has been hovering around like 48 49 k

1038
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:57,260
Uh this week. So, you know, it's up a little bit. It's not a huge gain or anything. Um,

1039
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,180
It could it could crash at any moment. It could crash at any moment

1040
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,940
But like yeah, like is is it gonna crash?

1041
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:10,540
Is it gonna go to 100 k before the end of the year? Like either one of these things could happen

1042
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,220
and

1043
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,420
yeah, like

1044
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,100
Sure, like investing in bitcoin is risky because it's volatile

1045
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,580
but the the flip side of that

1046
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,140
The flip side of that is that

1047
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:30,700
Like not being in the this is this is the catch 22 not being invested is kind of just as risky because if

1048
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:34,060
You don't have bitcoin and it explodes

1049
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:39,340
You've lost money just as surely as if you were invested in bitcoin and it crashes

1050
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:45,500
I mean, I guess it's not exactly the same because in one case your absolute number is going up versus down

1051
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:50,060
but in terms of like in terms of like opportunity costs like

1052
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,220
They're they're cut. They're pretty similar, right? So this is how I'm like

1053
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,540
I feel like

1054
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,060
I don't know the future

1055
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:05,260
It could crash it could grow to it could just keep growing and growing it could explode again. Um, I feel like

1056
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:11,820
Maybe maybe this is cope, but I feel like the the sensible thing to do they say diversify your assets, right?

1057
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,180
like

1058
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:16,140
If I if I have some a little bit of bitcoin and it crashes

1059
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,500
Well, I lost some money

1060
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:22,780
But if I have a little bit then if it if it if it explodes then I didn't lose out. So I feel like

1061
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,740
I don't feel like I'm being um

1062
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,340
too, uh, too, uh, uh

1063
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,540
Unreasonable

1064
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,260
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah

1065
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:41,100
Well, your reasonableness makes sense. Yeah, yeah, yeah explainable

1066
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:45,020
Next next week it might go to 20 and I'll be like, well

1067
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,140
Shows what I know

1068
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,780
God, I hope not

1069
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:54,300
I mean if it does, I'll be happy because then I'll be like, ah, Pog it's so low

1070
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,420
Pledge get get back in

1071
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:03,020
I feel I feel so shitty because I was I was looking at it casually like last

1072
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,820
In July I saw it going down to

1073
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,660
I saw it approaching 30 and I considered maybe I should buy in when it hits 30

1074
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,860
But I I was like, no, I think it's gonna keep going down

1075
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:19,820
I'm gonna buy in when it hits 20 and then low and behold it hits 30

1076
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:25,980
Hover's bounces back and has just been steadily climbing since then and has almost hit 50

1077
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:30,860
If I had if I had just bought in then if I had just bought in then when I was thinking about maybe doing it

1078
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:37,020
You know, that's just how it is. That's just how I go. I would I would have been like I would be at fucking

1079
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,220
Fucking 160 percent or whatever

1080
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,580
My profits would be skyrocketing

1081
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,700
I'd be a regular brad garling house

1082
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Uh, but uh, it is what it is

1083
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,220
It is what it is unfortunately

1084
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:56,620
So, okay, that's all I have to say about that. Oh, but on the last

1085
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,380
subject

1086
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:03,500
On the on the subject of money on the subject of gold. I did a noita

1087
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,460
Challenge run. I did a no gold run

1088
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,900
Uh, where I did not obtain any gold

1089
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,940
and it wasn't

1090
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,420
That hard it was kind of hard

1091
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:20,220
But I was I was trying to do a pacifist run for a while and that was really hard

1092
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,860
because

1093
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,780
The pacifist run is annoying because there are some things that will

1094
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:30,700
Usually count as you not killing something

1095
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,180
like

1096
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:39,660
Kicking kicking an object into some an enemy and crushing them with it. I don't think that counts as

1097
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:45,340
Killing them but throwing something throwing a tablet out of your inventory and crushing them

1098
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:50,540
I think that does count as a kill as or as a deliberate kill most of the time

1099
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,100
Or at least some of the time

1100
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,820
and i'm not and i'm not exactly sure of the rules because

1101
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:05,180
It it's not always consistent like whether something counts as a double as a as an environmental kill and and gives you double gold or not and it's like

1102
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,580
The thing about the the pacifist run is

1103
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:14,140
You you can't even you can't even kill the final boss you you have to

1104
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:18,540
You have to get the final the thing from the final boss

1105
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:25,660
Not kill him and then make your way to you have to make your way to the like win zone on your own

1106
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:30,540
Which is actually very difficult like like you have you would have to um

1107
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:37,580
Dig your way you have to dig your way to it through all this stuff. You need black holes. You need like advanced stuff

1108
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,660
so you you have to be like

1109
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:43,420
Doing the pacifist run you have to be prepared not just to win the game

1110
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:46,540
Which is relatively easy, but you have to be doing like post endgame

1111
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:47,820
like

1112
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,500
you know like

1113
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:54,700
Game manipulation or not game manipulation, but like environmental manipulation stuff in order to actually

1114
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,660
Reach the place where it will count you as having

1115
01:19:58,780 --> 01:19:59,660
gotten

1116
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:04,860
You know the pacifist run so that one was too hard. So I set my sights down lower

1117
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,620
I needed the no gold around and I got it baby. I fucking got it. So

1118
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,780
mission

1119
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,780
Accomplished

1120
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:17,740
So i'm rich in real life, but i'm poor in noida. That's that's the takeaway

1121
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,220
Wow

1122
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,940
Wow, I know what you did. I understood

1123
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,340
I really did

1124
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,100
Is that I you're being sincere, right? No. Oh

1125
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,540
Okay, I genuinely wasn't sure

1126
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,100
Okay, um

1127
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,620
I just didn't get any gold. I just beat the game without getting any gold

1128
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:45,420
You didn't get any gold for sure. Imagine just imagine what that entails and that's what I do. I can't purchase any

1129
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,340
drinks

1130
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,340
Can't purchase any no can't buy any wands

1131
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,340
you you can

1132
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:56,700
You can't buy wands, but you can steal spells and this is what I did you you can if you

1133
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,940
Because like when you get to the holy mountain the wands are floating

1134
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,180
You can't move the wands, but the spells

1135
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,700
They're in like the shop area and you can buy them

1136
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:11,900
But if you dig the ground out from under them they fall and if they fall out of the holy mountain

1137
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,220
They become free and you don't have to pay for them

1138
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:19,740
So I did I did some of that where I like used luminous drill to dig them out and then just pick them up for free off the ground

1139
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,180
That's a bit of a

1140
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,660
I mean, it's not a cheat. It's in there deliberately, but that's a bit of a

1141
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:26,540
kind of like

1142
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:29,260
A cheeky little strap that they let you get away with

1143
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:35,820
Uh, I didn't use it that I think I used it for some drills or something to like speed up my rate of fire

1144
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,540
Oh, no, there's a chainsaw. I found a chainsaw in a in a and I was like, well, I need that

1145
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:45,020
And then I got and then I got a and then I got a chainsaw running with triplicate bolt

1146
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:47,660
and then I with a mana re recharger and then I was just

1147
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,780
machine gunning out like triplicate bolts in a fucking

1148
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,500
Blast and then I found and then I found a glamour. I found a green glamour spell

1149
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:57,580
So instead of shooting out little little green

1150
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,300
Bullets I was shooting out like green like

1151
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,620
Like like energy like beams like green little little sparkly energy beams

1152
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:08,620
Uh, and then I went up to I went up to uh, what's his name? Um, um,

1153
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,100
Cole me I went up to Cole me and I was

1154
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,260
Was eviscerated him

1155
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:18,460
Uh, that was that was those were the those were the days. That was uh, that was a good one. No, I'm done

1156
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:23,820
I'm done with noida. I'm done with all the things I had on my little uh talk about list. So

1157
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:31,660
I don't know. We could go to voicemails or what? Yeah, I I feel kind of stupid. I didn't have anything to talk about today

1158
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,100
I'm not not not feeling very good either

1159
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:38,060
Mmm

1160
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,060
What a what a terrible episode

1161
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:44,860
What a terrible episode. Oh, I'm so sorry about the terrible episode everybody

1162
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,820
It's okay. As always. I carried as always. I carried us over the finish line

1163
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,620
Uh, I brought I brought the heat

1164
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:55,180
Uh, uh, uh, you know

1165
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:04,060
I had you know, I get it. I don't worry. I got enough twitter arguments to to this week to to fill a whole episode

1166
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:10,140
No wasted no wasted content. Oh, you should you should get even even more twitter arguments

1167
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,740
So you have even more content. That's what it's all about, baby

1168
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,180
This is what it's all about. This is what it's all about is just building

1169
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:25,660
A lifestyle that reinforces the the toxic and like useless behavior that I that I want to be engaging in

1170
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,740
That I am addicted to engaging in I need to build my life around

1171
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:39,580
Incentivizing myself to continue to do those things like like making content out of complaining about obnoxious twitter arguments that don't accomplish anything

1172
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,700
Um, that's how you fucking do it

1173
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,820
Yeah, let's let's let's go to voicemail

1174
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,420

I'm infiltrating the leak of Nate fuckers right now. They have just taken over cobble

1188
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:43,260
I was in their base, but I got locked out because I had to take a leak

1189
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:46,460
I'm scared Nate heads

1190
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:50,860
They have a metal gear designed to beat other metal gears that are designed to beat other metal gears

1191
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,140
It's called metal gear sex

1192
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:58,700
I can't believe the united states let it get into the hands of the league

1193
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,900
I'll do my best to stop them

1194

01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:27,660
God, I hope I hope the tally band doesn't know that they all want to fuck Nate without fucking execute them the mouth

1199
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:33,100
Uh, oh, yeah, how do we know the league of Nate fuckers is not the tally band

1200
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,900
Have we ever seen them in the same room

1201
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,460
No

1202
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,700
Now there's a

1203
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,660
True

1204
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:48,860
I it could be true. So it's true

1205
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,900
That's that's how it works. That's all I could

1206
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,780
Chris could have Chris could have 10 years ago

1207
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:03,500
concocted a plan to to uh to pretend to be a woman

1208
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,380
And and then executed it flawlessly

1209
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:12,300
And even in private when no one was looking over the next 10 years. It could be true. So it's true. Oh my god

1210
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,420
I just what I pointed that one lady

1217
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,340
Genuinely get help

1218
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:46,700
Get help. Um, the next one is a youtube link. Um

01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:54,540
Oh, it's it's that pardon jesse's video where he yells at the thing

1221
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:02,380
And let's just says funny words directed it towards certain individuals

1222
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,780
Well, I mean

1223
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,340
He sure did

1224
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:08,780
He sure did

1225
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,980
It's funny

1226
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:14,140
My hands are not entirely clean in this regard and I cannot throw stones

1227
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:15,980
Um

1228
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:16,780
Same

1229
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:22,140
What what can I say? What what can I say? I mean, uh, oh, this this is called at poorly aged stuff

1230
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:27,020
Sure. Yeah, but point point made point made

1231
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:28,860
um

1232
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:32,300
Okay, next one is called the ruthless aggression arc

1233
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,860
uh, wait, um

1234
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:39,580
I mean to download the why did I download that one? It was just a youtube link. Uh

01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:42,940
No, no rename. No delete it for my files

1236
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:48,780
Okay, next one is called the ruthless aggression arc three two one go

1237
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:55,340
It's time for a new tommy j arc because we're bored. We're bored of the last tommy j arc

1238
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,820
Everybody's obviously bored of it. Oh

1239
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:05,980
Oh, we ate this up. We ate this fucking pcb comment show shit up up the last seven times

1240
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:12,220
He did but this time it got old anymore. It got old. I'm sorry. This is a minute 30

1241
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:17,820
This is a minute 30. We actually didn't want you to do anything at all. Well, well, you know what?

1242
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:22,700
You know what? This is a narrative. It keeps fucking going. I keep doing this shit

1243
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:26,860
And it it always has to do not understand the concept of it got old

1244
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,860
The longer it goes the older it becomes the fucking mystic marbles guy

1245
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:37,740
And there's some other repeat offenders these people who in the who are just like, okay. Yeah, okay. I get it other people made

1246
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:44,220
Other boy smells that weren't as annoying. So why are you the only one that people get not the only one?

1247
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:49,660
Why are you the one that people are annoyed at currently? I don't know. Okay. I stopped listening. Uh, all right

1248
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,700
reflect on yourself

1249
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,740
Next one is a fast upload link

1250
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:59,180
and um

1251
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:03,820
ineffectual versus intellectual I will say that

1252
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,820
You know what?

1253
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:12,620
I wasn't gonna mention it, but I don't I don't care anymore. Tommy j sent me a dm on twitter wherein he claimed that like

1254
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:18,380
basically he was only pretending to be an annoying voicemailer and like

1255
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,980
It was all a bit. He was playing a character of a terrible voicemailer

1256
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:28,060
He did a very good job. He did a really good job

1257
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:38,300
Uh, so whatever it's fine. Uh, whatever. No, it's it's fine. It's great. Okay

1258
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,540
Just

1259
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:45,660
Just I don't know. I don't want to make too big an issue of it. I don't want to like I don't want to call

1260
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,940
Him out. He's not a fucking terrible person

1261
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:55,020
Just because he made a couple annoying voicemails, but like have a little have a little humility and just like when people say like

1262
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,020
I'm sick of this bit

1263
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:59,020
Just be like, okay. Sorry

1264
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:07,180
Just have a little humility about it. I think that's what's what's missing here. Okay. Um, next one is called ineffectual versus intellectual

1265
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,420
three two one go

1266
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:17,980
You an ineffectual all the best like deals all the best situations you get in life because like you knew someone and they were like

1267
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:22,860
Oh, hey, I can hook you up get a friend who's got a job doing that and they recommend you

1268
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:27,900
And then you get a job and you just get like pretty good money networking. It's important

1269
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:35,180
Yeah, yeah, the uh, the reputation of specific artists, right is what actually drives the prices skill really doesn't matter

1270
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,140
I an intellectual

1271
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:42,780
Fuck all these people. They're all in a big club and i'm not in it. Uh, it's all about who you know

1272
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,660
It's it's all bunch of those are the same thing

1273
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,940
Those are the same thing

1274
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,500
Uh in ineffectual

1275
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,220
I don't know what that would

1276
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:58,220
I mean like they're saying

1277
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,340
the clips of of various pcp members saying

1278
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:07,900
Uh networking, it's who you know and then the second one is it's who you know and I don't like that

1279
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,700
I'm not who they know. It's the same thing

1280
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:17,020
Yeah, it sucks that that's how it works, but you've got to do it. That's just sort of normal

1281
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,980
The the first is me the well me and others saying this is how it works

1282
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:28,220
The second is me complaining that that's how it works. I don't this this reminds me of um

1283
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:29,660
Um

1284
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,660
This reminds me of okay, Sean

1285
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:36,860
It all comes back to Sean. You're Sean made it made it. I think it was like two weeks ago or something

1286
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,260
I saw this Sean tweeted that like

1287
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,460
He he made sort of a jokey tweet that like his guilty pleasure

1288
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:53,260
Was like seeing seeing like in basically look seeing incels like self-defeating ideology where they let they convince themselves that they are like a

1289
01:31:53,820 --> 01:32:00,060
An undatable monster because like, you know, they're they're like only five foot nine and not five foot ten or whatever, right?

1290
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:03,420
He said like that's a guilty pleasure of his and then

1291
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,900
Like a couple days later. He made

1292
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:14,540
Another tweet that was like critical of incels. He like he said that like, you know, he said that

1293
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:17,420
I don't remember what it was, but it was something to the effect of like

1294
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:24,700
Yeah, this incel ideology is is a problem. You know, it's it's not rational and you know, it's it's bad that people think this

1295
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,380
and I saw people

1296
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,380
being like calling him a hypocrite

1297
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,580
and seeing like the hypocrisy is so obvious

1298
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:33,420
because

1299
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,780
He's because on the one because first he said that he

1300
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:40,140
liked that he got entertainment from something

1301
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,780
and then later he said

1302
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:45,660
that it's not a good thing and like

1303
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:51,500
There's no contradiction there at all. I saw so many people being calling Sean a hypocrite because

1304
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:56,860
He said that on one hand his guilty pleasure is is enjoying seeing this flawed thing

1305
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:02,700
And then the second was him saying that the thing is flawed and those are like kind of the same idea

1306
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:07,180
And this this is I mean, this is honestly, this is just obviously this is the same

1307
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,700
I don't

1308
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:13,260
I'm not sure how seriously to take the criticism that this uh that this voicemail is offering me

1309
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:17,900
But those just seem like the same thing. I couldn't even really tell if it was a criticism

1310
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,660
at first

1311
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:22,140
It might be I mean, I guess I suppose clips are you

1312
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,740
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a joke, but like

1313
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:30,220
I don't I don't know

1314
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,300
um

1315
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,660
The intel the intellectual I guess the point is that

1316
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,340
The second one

1317
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:46,060
I honestly I could I can't tell if it's ironically calling the second one the intellectual point like the intellectual

1318
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:48,060
Like the smart thing is to say like fuck it

1319
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,180
And the and it's it's dumb to be like

1320
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:54,540
Oh, you got a network. You got a network. You got to know people and it's

1321
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:56,940
And it's smart to be like

1322
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,700
Fuck knowing people. It's all a big club

1323
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:03,900
Or if it's ironic and the actual opinion being espoused is the exact opposite of that

1324
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:06,220
I could see it going either way

1325
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,660
um

1326
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:08,780
I don't know

1327
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:09,900
Lamal

1328
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:13,660
I let let's let's just move on. I mean being not in big clubs is annoying

1329
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,540
I think we can yeah, it's terrible

1330
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:18,540
This is the this this is the fucking

1331
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,900
Tragedy of my whole life is that I'm not in a big fucking club

1332
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:27,180
This is the tragedy of like almost everyone's life actually is that they're not in the big club where you get access to

1333
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:30,060
You know, what whatever life?

1334
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,980
Well, I mean I have access to normal life. I don't have access to like

1335
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:35,340
Uh

1336
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:41,980
Big media big media big media collections or something like that. Right. Sure. Yeah, right exact. Yeah, that

1337
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:45,820
That's what it's all about. It's all about getting those poggers connections

1338
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:48,300
Ah

1339
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:51,180
Next voicemail is called elwood edwards

1340
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:53,820
three two one go

1341
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:00,140
So I listened to nate's new podcast and here are my thoughts. It's a bunch of idiots

1342
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:04,060
Talking about especially signs. They do know about getting into topics

1343
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:08,940
They know nothing about where they're contradicting themselves and spreading misinformation

1344
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,980
Just making everyone listening dumber in the process

1345
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,860
With some cringe moments sprinkled. Okay

1346
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:21,340
So it's basically exactly the same as this podcast and I'll be happy to listen to hundreds of episodes faced

1347
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:26,860
Anyway, crack was good last week. You should have him on more. That was like that was like through two weeks

1348
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:31,340
I don't know. Okay. Uh, this must have been. Yeah, okay. Um

1349
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:33,740
Cracks cool

1350
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:37,100
Cracks are really cool guy. Cracks are really smart guy. I like crack a lot. Yeah. Yeah

1351
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,860
Uh, yeah, that sounds that sounds like about

1352
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:45,820
That sounds that sounds about like what I would expect a nate podcast to be

1353
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:51,100
So, you know good good for him. I guess uh lemal

1354
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:53,740
Next one is called alaskan weeb

1355
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,300
three two one go

1356
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:03,500
Hey guys, like fuck Trixie and all that but also I was listening to the

1357
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:07,260
Like two weeks ago podcast and then it's just unrelated and

1358
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,820
It might be the only one who finds it a little bit hilarious that despite Trixie being the one who gets

1359
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:18,140
Blastered with labels like pedophile and all that her ex-wife is the one who tried to sleep with the teenager

1360
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:22,300
Am I the only one who's finding this little cherry on top of this disgusting?

1361
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,020
Sunday to be just

1362
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:27,740
So good and then the fact that she's

1363
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:32,220
Aligning herself with the kind of people who scream save our children save our children

1364
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:36,060
When she's the kind of person that they're trying to save their children from

1365
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:40,060
I mean, I don't know. I'm who's just thinking I mean

1366
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:44,780
You'll you'll you'll get you'll get no defense of may from me

1367
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:51,180
I I do okay. I don't I don't know really that much about the situation. I I thought that the girl

1368
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,300
That may have sent those creepy creepy

1369
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:58,140
like DMs trying to uh trying to like

1370
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:04,700
Trying to like emotionally three some pressure emotionally pressure this like yeah this like

1371
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:12,220
This like fucking battered woman into having a threesome with like her ex-wife her ex-husband and her together

1372
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:16,300
Like I thought those creepy emails were I thought the girl was 18

1373
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:18,380
I think

1374
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:22,620
I think I mean, I think Ethan was probably like fucking her before she was 18

1375
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:28,940
I think might might be legal depending on the state. So that's not a criminal. That's not necessarily a criminal allegation

1376
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:31,580
um, but uh

1377
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:36,780
The the I thought she was 18, but I mean

1378
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,380
I mean, yeah may may is terrible and

1379
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,140
I don't know what else to say

1380
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:47,740
May is an impressively terrible may is terrible person

1381
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:54,540
May is uh save our children save our children stop the steal big nick fuente's fan big fucking white

1382
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,100
Oh, man. I should I mention the

1383
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:01,580
The the tweet the tweet she made when when she announced did I mean I don't think I think this was this week

1384
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:08,940
When she announced her being pregnant. She said like she said that it never never been never been a better time

1385
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:11,180
It's the perfect time to have a baby

1386
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:17,580
It's the best time to have a baby and she linked to the census stats showing that like the amount of white people in america has declined

1387
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,940
She's literally she's literally

1388
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:27,100
She's literally saying like I need to start having babies to protect the white race. There's no subtext there

1389
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:33,740
She's just she's just out to like save the white race. This is just unironically what she's about. I think

1390
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:37,020
I really think

1391
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:41,340
I I know it's it's it might it might seem a little bit

1392
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,060
It might seem a little hypocritical of me

1393
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:50,060
Because I was never this hard on may before but if you like used if you used to like may

1394
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:52,460
I I was I never liked me

1395
01:38:52,780 --> 01:38:58,300
I never I never like publicly criticized her because she never like had a real opinion publicly until a certain point

1396
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:03,660
And then she did but if you if I feel some people say like I used to like may I used to like may on like the

1397
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:08,060
Whatever their fucking side channel was called if you used to like may I think you're an idiot

1398
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,140
I really think you are you are there's

1399
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:15,180
You fucked up and you need to like reflect and like think about like what's wrong with you that made you have that opinion

1400
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:20,940
I really think she's that bad even honestly even aside from just her like nightmarish politics

1401
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:23,340
She also just sucks in general

1402
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:27,420
Um, but then all she's also a nazi on top of it. So, you know, it's a real

1403
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,380
It's a real layer cake

1404
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:32,780
of problems

1405
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:35,020
um

1406
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:37,020
Anything you want to add

1407
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,140
uh

1408
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:39,420
No

1409
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,420

Next fucker next voicemail is called toxic three two one go

I don't watch the pcp anymore. I've seen some of the most recent episodes tommy

01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:58,220
And i'm not gonna watch it's a minute 30 of any more of it

1413
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:03,660
And i'll tell you why this is a dent to like a pcp currently

1414
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,540
reminds me

1415
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,340
Of a fucking high school girls

1416
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:12,300
I kind of want to see where's going with this

1417

Oh, i'm just doing me. You just do you or i have my art you how you are

Yeah

1420
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,260
That's true

1421
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:33,420
No, that's not actually what's going on here. It's it's it's a veneer

1422
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:36,140
that you use to

1423
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:40,380
Make it seem nicer and it actually is this was actually going on

1424
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,420
Is that there's the purse there's the king

1425
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,220
There's the queen b

1426
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,260
Ben

1427
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:50,140
What and then everybody else is just looking for

1428
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:56,620
For opportunities looking for weaknesses looking for slip-ups things that you weren't supposed to say

1429
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:02,700
And then when the moment is right someone strikes and then they get clout

1430
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,340
They're clout facers

1431
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:07,580
Oh, you're a liiib ben

1432
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:11,580
Ben's kind of cringe now. I don't know

1433
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,380
I don't have no idea

1434
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:17,980
But you made this this is all you this

1435
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:22,620
It's that's a that's a

1436
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:26,940
That's a bit. It's it's some kind of a bit, right? I I think so

1437
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:31,420
The silly voice makes me think it's it's got to be some somewhat of a bit

1438
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:36,780
I I don't know what the bit is. I couldn't really get a grasp of what the character

1439
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:43,020
The bit I just feel like it's someone like what if there was a character who had no idea what the hell they were talking about

1440
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,340
What a great bit

1441
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,380
The bit is that the pcp

1442
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,580
Is it is a high school girls club?

1443
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,940
Okay, so so we pretend to be nice to each other

1444
01:41:54,940 --> 01:42:00,940
But actually we're all here to try and like tear ben down for clout. I guess he said it

1445
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:03,260
He said I was the he said I was the queen b

1446
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:08,380
He didn't say who the he said there was a king and that I am the queen b. Who's the king?

1447
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:10,460
um

1448
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:11,660
And then

1449
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:15,100
Who who's who's trying to tear me down you you and tom the guests?

1450
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:17,820
Yeah, who you haven't noticed

1451
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,220
Uh, of course

1452
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:24,620
I'm always on it's because I never let my guard down. It's because I never have any weaknesses to exploit

1453
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:27,340
That's the secret. It's just like when you sign up for a credit card

1454
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:31,100
All you get you just never let give any weaknesses for the banks to exploit

1455
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:35,340
You just never fail the Faustian bargain you keep to all the terms and then you trick them out of their money

1456
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,580
You never let them get you. Um

1457
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,340
I don't know. I I could I guess I could ponder this

1458
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:47,100
I guess I could ponder the intent behind this this voicemail all day, but maybe it's maybe it's not worth it

1459
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:50,380
Uh

1460
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:56,860
Okay, the next one is a is an imager link. It's an it's another beam

1461
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:59,980
It's the same

1462
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:06,060
Same fucking they're doing it on purpose now. They're doing it on purpose. Okay. I like it now

1463
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:10,060
Wait, okay. Um, we've got you surrounded stop drawing

1464
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,420
Yeah, I love draw. Okay. You know what?

1465
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,460
You know what actually this one's pretty funny

1466
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,580
Mesh did she she did be drawing

1467
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:24,620
She did be drawing during the podcast. She did be drawing during the podcast and you know what?

1468
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:30,620
Can't I can't even begrudge her that I can't okay, so this time we got me for sure

1469
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:36,780
Yeah, and we got you and then you there's only fucking fruit flies. Why are there fruit flies in my room?

1470
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:39,180
Where they fucking come from fruit probably

1471
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:41,580
There's no

1472
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:43,340
Are you calling me a fruit?

1473
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:45,340
I'm calling you a person who buys a fruit

1474
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:48,220
Do you not buy fruit?

1475
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:53,420
Is it not pito? Sometimes I buy a tomato. That's a fruit, but I don't keep it in my room

1476
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:56,620
Oh, oh, yeah

1477
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:00,300
Oh, okay. Okay. There's you and me and that's gotta be taboo

1478
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:08,780
Probably and then mate. That's I guess it's the sunglasses and then I'm not really sure who that should be at the bank

1479
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:11,980
Is it Trixie?

1480
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,140
It doesn't seem like it would be Jesse

1481
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:18,060
It doesn't look like Tom or Jesse

1482
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:24,220
I think it's gotta be Trixie. Yeah, it's gotta be Trixie, but it's a very strange face

1483
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:32,620
It is a very strange. I don't know this meme. Is this a meme that this person has drawn or is it an actual meme that other people make?

1484
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,100
Were you were you on last week?

1485
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,100
I've seen another version of this

1486
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:42,620
There yeah, this this is a meme. This is a meme that I I saw around

1487
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
Like on twitter and stuff a while ago

1488
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:49,500
I didn't really get it and the more versions of it. I see

1489
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,540
I feel like the the less I understand it

1490
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:58,220
I think it's like the people coming through the door

1491
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,980
Are coming to get the person behind the table

1492
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:04,700
for

1493
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:07,660
Whatever they're doing and the person behind the table

1494
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,700
Is insane and is still doing it

1495
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:17,020
Well, sometimes it's that but sometimes they're like they're doing the opposite of it or they're saying something like

1496
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,740
else they're saying

1497
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:22,620
I guess the idea is that the person

1498
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:30,060
I think okay. I think the the intent of the meme is to poke fun at the person behind the table

1499
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:33,100
for because they they think

1500
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:35,980
That people are out to get them for something

1501
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:41,980
So like you literally depict these people like cia agents busting through your door coming to get you for whatever it is

1502
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:48,220
Right. I I think the idea is that the person behind the table is crazy because like ha ha. This is what you think

1503
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,460
Like you think this is what's happening

1504
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:52,860
That's that's my interpretation

1505
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,940
and it's

1506
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:56,940
true

1507
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:59,980
Where's the door have like little arms?

1508
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:05,420
The door frame has like a weird arm. It looks it looks like a coat rack. It looks like yeah

1509
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:10,940
It doesn't look like a door or like a clothing rack like a long pole

1510
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:21,500
I like mage's I like mage's face a lot and this one. Yeah, she looks great. She looks great. Um, okay, uh, yeah

1511
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,620
mage do be she do be drawing though

1512
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:28,620
next next voicemail, uh is uh

1513
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:31,020
Wait, where did I?

1514
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:37,100
Oh, I fucking tabbed off the here we go. Um, next voicemail is called jabroni 101

1515
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:39,740
three two one go

1516
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:44,460
Well, we're finally here. Aren't we pcp fans a year and a half later?

1517
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:49,100
And we finally get confirmation of what we all should have known all along

1518
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:55,740
Which is that the brony files have been deleted, you know tweeted as tricksy mentions themselves

1519
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:59,420
And you know, what were we thinking right guys, you know

1520
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:05,660
They gave the middle finger to the fans and they said in the radcon for discord

1521
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,900
I don't have to respect people just because they gave me money

1522
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:15,260
And you know, they're gonna reshoot the lecture supposedly with a different audience and oh boy that video totally won't get this like bombed

1523
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,260
Am I right guys?

1524
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:19,260
I would love I would

1525
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,340
I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's all true. Um

1526
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:23,740
I

1527
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,740
I would I would love

1528
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,460
To see because yeah back back in the day well back in the day

1529
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,820
Because she changed her story a bunch of times

1530
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:38,220
She's like at first she said that she wanted to heavily edit the lecture then she changed the story to

1531
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,460
I want to

1532
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:43,740
Film new footage to combine with the old footage

1533
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:47,660
Then it was just I want to just completely rerecord it

1534
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:55,340
And and I'll let my and Riley will make red con five will produce red con five and you should all come and I'll let my and I'll let

1535
01:47:55,980 --> 01:48:03,340
My crony throw a throw a rap concert which rad con five will be like a side attraction for

1536
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:06,300
And then we'll do it there. I guess

1537
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:08,380
um, and then it was

1538
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:10,540
Radio silence for like months and months

1539
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:17,580
And then it was I've deleted it lemal and but then when she after she announced that she deleted someone asked her about it and she said

1540
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:20,620
she said like um

1541
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:25,660
I've she said something like I've said I've said before that I was interested in rerecording it

1542
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:29,740
But it would have to be with a different audience because I won't work with ben anymore

1543
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:32,460
lemal, um

1544
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:33,820
she

1545
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:35,900
She she didn't she didn't mention the idea

1546
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:37,180
You know

1547
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:41,420
The idea of rerecording it had been floated before she had said she would not release the original

1548
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:44,620
She wanted to record it, but I would really like to see her try to do it now

1549
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:49,740
Because now you know she she doesn't even have like who would she do it in front of?

1550
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,860
Yeg is gone. Yeg is split. You know

1551
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,660
It's literally just her

1552
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:57,980
and her boyfriend

1553
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:59,980
living in her parents house

1554
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:03,340
Just smoking weed with her mom and like getting a fucking allowance

1555
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:07,020
for living just for living for free

1556
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:10,780
and smoking weed 24 seven that's that's

1557
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:17,020
I mean literally the audience would be like her boyfriend and her parents like that would be the audience

1558
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:22,380
I mean I'd like to see it. I would like to see it even like

1559
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:25,100
The idea of redoing it

1560
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:30,700
Does she care to tell the story again? Even no, of course not. It's it's an asinine like deflection

1561
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:34,140
It's it's it's just her trying to put off responsibility. It's like yeah

1562
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:40,300
I trashed the lecture, but only because I want to rerecord it lol like oh, oh, oh, okay. Yeah

1563
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:45,420
I mean just imagining her doing like travel all the way across the country

1564
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:51,420
Imagining her doing that is so funny that I wish I wish it were true

1565
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:54,460
I wish it were a thing that that would ever happen. No, I mean

1566
01:49:55,180 --> 01:49:58,220
Okay, humoring the idea that she would actually do it

1567
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:03,260
She would do it just like the fucking the what were they called the little lectures that she did on the yeg channel

1568
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,260
Which are like look like shit and they're filmed on a phone

1569
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:14,300
That it would it would look like that and she would see no she would see no no problem with that

1570
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,980
Um with that aspect of it anyway

1571
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:22,940
Um, yeah, I don't know. I'm pretty mad about it, but you know what else is new

1572
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:25,180
fruit fly

1573
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,180
okay, um

1574
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:29,820
Next voicemail. Yep

1575
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:32,700
It's called janes three two one go

1576
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:38,700
I think it's fine for teenagers to have internet world models like best guy ever

1577
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:43,340
As they are growing up in the world and they need to have people to take reference from

1578
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:45,580
besides their parents

1579
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,580
But as they grow into young adults

1580
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:53,420
They should recognize what faults their role models have and aspire to be better than them

1581
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:58,140
As well as decide what positive impact they want to have on the world

1582
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:01,260
I think I mean in general

1583
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,940
I guess I agree in general. Sure

1584
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:09,820
I think I think I mean, I think nate is a weird choice of role model, but whatever

1585
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:12,860
Yeah, I don't know

1586
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,820
I get that like

1587
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:23,020
You you're young and you see videos and you don't realize whether they're good or not necessarily you just sort of like the what you like

1588
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:27,340
And then when you grow older you should look

1589
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:30,060
Maybe critically on your past

1590
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:31,900
nostalgia stuff

1591
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,100
Not all of it's gonna work

1592
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:37,100
Not all of it's gonna be something that you're gonna carry forward for the rest of your life or

1593
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:40,060
Is a good thing to base your life off of so I don't know

1594
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:42,860
I guess so I guess that's

1595
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:43,900
Fair

1596
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:47,100
Yeah, fair. Yeah, sure. I don't I don't begrudge. I mean, I don't I don't

1597
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:50,220
begrudge people

1598
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:52,220
I mean

1599
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:55,660
I mean, I'm I'm old and I still I mean, I still really like Sean

1600
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:59,980
I still like I guess I kind of look up to him a little bit like I I think he's a

1601
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:04,700
Smart guy who I would like like to emulate in some way

1602
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:07,100
I mean not like he's not my role model or anything

1603
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:10,540
But I really like his opinions and I appreciate him

1604
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:13,340
So I guess I don't think it's it's not bad to like

1605
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:16,380
Think someone's cool on the internet. I don't know

1606
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:18,620
um

1607
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:20,620
Sure. Yeah, whatever

1608
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:26,060
Next voicemail is another it's another image. I will post it in the

1609
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:29,820
We'll post it in the chat here for elisar

1610
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:34,940
The virgin home buyer versus the chat bitcoin gambler

1611
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:39,500
I think this has got to be a crack versus me. I think yes

1612
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:41,420
Yeah

1613
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:48,700
Virgin's great because it's it's the right way to do this thing where the chat is insane and not good

1614
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,940
The chat is

1615
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:57,260
No, but but actually kind of but actually but actually kind of kind of based kind of based the virgin home buyer

1616
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,500
Has to jump through bureaucratic hoops

1617
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:04,300
Spends a fortune on a house with a leaky roof props up a system that he hates oof

1618
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:08,540
The chat bitcoin gambler knows it's sinful to possess money

1619
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:10,700
So he feeds it to the great blockchain in the sky

1620
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:16,860
His own decisions shapes his future banks and the irs can't touch him because he'll never make a problem

1621
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:25,420
I like my like fucking like acid green like cyborg. I like i'm hacked into the matrix really really hard

1622
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:29,180
And you're like grabbing the whole of the laptop with one palm

1623
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:32,780
Just like all the way around

1624
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:39,660
The real the real bitcoiners. Yeah, they have a phone in one hand laptop in another just holding it up with your thumbs

1625
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:45,020
Something is weird with the chat is like gonna

1626
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:48,380
It's like I got a bulge but the like side

1627
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:54,300
Like the thigh is a sort of like weirdly bulbous on on the sides as well. I don't know what it's supposed to be

1628
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,260
Well, I mean

1629
01:53:57,660 --> 01:53:59,660
Yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe that's a

1630
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,140
artifact from the original

1631
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:03,500
chat

1632
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:09,820
Maybe his his original muscly thighs were like that. Yeah, I'm just kind of have lumpy hips. I guess which is true to life

1633
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:11,100
I suppose

1634
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:13,100
um

1635
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:14,380
man

1636
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:16,380
poor poor crack with his fucking

1637
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:18,940
home ownership

1638
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:23,020
What a nerd uh holding like a receipt of all the people he has to pay

1639
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,700
Just being like oh god

1640
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:29,260
all these

1641
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:32,540
This this is the thing when you own stuff when you own property

1642
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:38,140
Comes responsibility when you are when you own nothing

1643
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,020
When you're like me

1644
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:44,780
And you are bereft of property and all you have is is data

1645
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:46,620
You're free

1646
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:51,660
You set yourself set yourself free of this of these material chains change the buying no no nothing

1647
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:58,380
No money. Nope. No money. No problem. No money. No problems as they say it. What if you could churn bitcoins?

1648
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:00,620
What would that look like?

1649
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,460
I mean

1650
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:09,180
Well, that doesn't mean you you could no you that's not doesn't make any fucking sense. That's not god damn it

1651
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:10,620
um

1652
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:12,060
coin

1653
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:14,060
Next voicemail, okay

1654
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:18,220
This is called hemlo corgo nine the huss

1655
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,980
Uh, this is sent from ben saint pisses on him

1656
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:23,420
him

1657
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:27,580
Himmels in the bathtub at aol.com. I think

1658
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:31,980
That hemlo corgo sent me a dm or saying

1659
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:36,540
Please don't play my voicemail. I was really drunk when I made it

1660
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:40,940
So now I want to know so in three two one go

1661
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:49,340
Hey ben, um, just to start this off real quick. I would like to um clarify that my pronouns are she her

1662
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:53,180
Because you have had any trouble

1663
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:56,700
deciphering that fact

1664
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:02,220
You know because you're super cringe and you're a boomer and you're old. I'm sorry. I do

1665
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:05,980
I do assume mails by default sometimes

1666
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:12,940
The series videos are way better than yours and they're also incredibly enjoyable to listen to

1667
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:16,700
So I don't have a problem with sarah zed

1668
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:20,460
Why do you think there's so much like more fun to listen to?

1669
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:23,980
And why do you think for hussy so hard?

1670
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:26,860
even though they have

1671
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:29,660
like repeatedly committed

1672
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:34,540
Extremely shady business practices in the past

1673
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:42,380
I love hussy too. I love homestuck. I love psychologials, but okay you simp for the hus

1674
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:46,380
Really really hard and it's pretty cringe

1675
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:50,220
And I would just like what your justification for that

1676
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:53,740
It's not it's not true. I deny the charges

1677
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,300
I I don't simp

1678
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:08,220
I I like hussy and I admire hussy as an artist. I have never I have never defended his business practices. I said

1679
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:10,780
that

1680
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:13,020
I do I do like I do appreciate hussy

1681
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,500
More than sarah zed on the whole

1682
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:17,820
I think hussy has done more for the world

1683
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,540
But I mean that's a pretty broad claim

1684
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:25,740
Um, I don't defend any of the like weird business shit that hussy is obviously

1685
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:31,260
Hussy is a terrible business person who runs like a kind of a train wreck of a company

1686
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:35,100
Like I think that's pretty established now and I don't think

1687
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:40,380
I've literally settled. I've literally set I'm repeating myself, but just since you asked

1688
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:47,100
Sarah's ed. I don't I don't begrudge her making any of those videos. I don't think she's wrong to do it even if

1689
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:50,140
even if the attitude

1690
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:55,100
Literally just the attitude in her thumbnail because I didn't even watch the video because I already know what she's gonna say

1691
01:57:55,580 --> 01:58:01,340
Uh, uh, even if the attitude in her thumbnail annoys me. I don't begrudge her that I don't have anything against her

1692
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:04,860
Even if I'm not like super impressed with her

1693
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:11,260
Right like she's fine. Um, I haven't watched her new shipping video. I might

1694
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:16,380
I might watch I was I was annoyed. I was annoyed to see it trending on twitter

1695
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:19,260
because it's like

1696
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:23,980
It's just a youtube just a youtuber released a video and it's like trending news on twitter

1697
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:28,780
I saw the shipping the the thumbnail. I was like the shipping wars. I'm like, okay

1698
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:32,780
This can't be interesting. There's no way it's interesting

1699
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:37,820
I don't it's a people people discussing people sort of video

1700
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:40,860
Yeah, it's it's gonna be

1701
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:43,980
I mean, I can take some guesses as to what happened

1702
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:45,740
I

1703
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:47,580
the okay

1704
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:53,020
The like even like the definitions of the words pro shipper and anti shipper. I'm like not a hundred percent

1705
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:55,340
I feel like sometimes I hear them called like

1706
01:58:56,220 --> 01:59:02,620
Like pro shippers are like pedophiles and like they're pro like pedo and like incest and rape stuff

1707
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:05,100
and I

1708
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:07,340
I think that's what the the distinction is

1709
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:10,300
But I don't I don't know

1710
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:14,380
I could be wrong. I could be totally off base there. So, I mean I can imagine it's

1711
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:17,580
You know, I mean I'm I'm Minerva

1712
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:21,420
What's her fucking handle

1713
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:23,500
double cast

1714
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:30,700
Made that video about uh, you know the fandom the harry potter troll lady who did the whole the fake accounts and the harry potter fan fiction

1715
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:36,060
I mean, it's probably kind of like that, you know, like some factions agree on this thing some don't there's there's drama

1716
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:38,860
There's people make there's probably false allegations

1717
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:45,100
This drama constantly every so often I catch like some either it's like super smash brothers

1718
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:50,220
Or like some artist who was abusive and it's like it's just hashtags and twitter threads

1719
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,940
And it's like here's a thread about this person. I'm like

1720
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:56,300
I never it's whatever it doesn't matter

1721
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:03,660
I don't care. I will never care. I it could be interesting. I don't know. I might watch it eventually. I haven't watched it yet

1722
02:00:03,740 --> 02:00:09,260
Um, I don't know the point is to which these things are like big deals is never really that big

1723
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:14,940
I feel if somebody became like a serial murderer and then I'd be like, holy shit. What the fuck

1724
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:19,980
You play smash and then you go kill a hundred people. That's a bit. That's a bit of an interesting story

1725
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:26,940
Hello, you say that I'm simping for hussey. I think you're simping for sarah zed here here because I never said that I had a problem with her

1726
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,500
There's no reason to be upset and here you are

1727
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:32,060
Here you are. You're upset that I

1728
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:35,580
Am not that I am not like enthusiastically

1729
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:38,780
like praising sarah, so I

1730
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:43,420
Uh, I I like hussey. I admire hussey. I

1731
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:45,340
admit

1732
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:49,740
He is a man of many faults who has fallen short of the mark

1733
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,380
many times, uh

1734
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:54,060
and that's

1735
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:58,940
I just you know, it is it is what it is. Okay. I think that's all I have to say about that

1736
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:04,940
Um next voicemail is called tricksy was wrong three two one go

1737
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:10,620
So a couple weeks ago you were talking about the criteria for a good lecture

1738
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:11,980
um

1739
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:15,900
Which I guess my understanding of it was something you might not check out otherwise

1740
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:19,820
Or maybe it's not as successful or easy to get into but it has merits

1741
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:23,660
And I it got me to think about like some of the other old

1742
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:26,700
Ideas people had had for lectures that didn't come to pass

1743
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:29,260
Uh, the biggest one for me would have been tricksy's

1744
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:34,700
Uh, coheed and camry lecture and she would always bring up the fact that she didn't think it would be a good lecture

1745
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:41,420
But I wholeheartedly disagree. I've really gotten into that fan as as of late and I like

1746
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:46,860
It's great to listen to but it's not easy to get into there's a lot more going on behind the scenes

1747
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:51,820
And it would make a really good lecture if someone really went in and broke that down

1748
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:59,340
Um, I mean as someone who will never ever like

1749
02:02:00,220 --> 02:02:05,740
Listen to coheed and camry and delve into like the lore of like what their songs are about

1750
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:09,660
I would say that that is like, yeah pretty good

1751
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:17,660
Pretty if it if it's telling like a lore based story. Yeah, that's something that I would never check out for myself

1752
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:21,180
But would maybe like explained to me by someone who did

1753
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:26,300
So I guess I agree. It sounds like it could be a good lecture. Yeah

1754
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:30,220
Um, next one is called tricksy was wrong clarification

1755
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:33,340
three two one go

1756
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:42,300
To clarify what I mean by a lot going on is that the quote-unquote story is across a bunch of mediums and and it isn't easy to experience

1757
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:44,380
Yeah, that yeah, that's what I thought

1758
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,580
That's what that was. I what I thought it was like

1759
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:50,460
okay, um

1760
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:52,540
Next one is called

1761
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:57,020
It's a little emoji. It's like a little like one concerned eyebrow over the face

1762
02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:59,740
That's a colon and a backslash like a face

1763
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:02,380
Looks kind of concerned

1764
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:07,660
Looks kind of concerned maybe a little judgmental little sus there. Maybe yeah

1765
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:10,220
Yeah on the on the brink of sus

1766
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:14,860
If you have the other eyebrow raised then it would be sus

1767
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,300
Three two one go

1768
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:23,660
So I've stuck to what I said in the last voicemail I left

1769
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:26,380
And I have avoided

1770
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:30,940
listening to the new episode of the podcast this Friday as I'm recording this

1771
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:38,220
And uh, I don't know you guys. I mean it could be a coincidence. This is only one data point

1772
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:42,940
But it feels like best Friday. I've had in a few months or so. I don't know

1773
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:45,260
um

1774
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:46,940
Okay. Oh, I guess

1775
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:51,260
You know, I mean I get Tommy j told me that he was a heel

1776
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:59,340
All along and that it was all but now he's he's he's he's he's leaning into the heel bit. He's he's he's going full heel turn

1777
02:04:00,460 --> 02:04:02,460
Uh, how long?

1778
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:09,260
How long will the I don't listen to the pcp anymore bit stay fresh? Uh, find out

1779
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:15,100
I mean if it happens one more time this episode, I think it will have soured already

1780
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:17,580
I think

1781
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:19,580
I don't know if it can even last one more

1782
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:22,700
ever

1783
02:04:22,700 --> 02:04:24,700
Uh, next one is called

1784
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:28,140
Tony three two one go

1785
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:34,060
I'm gonna be honest I've submitted like five of these voicemails already

1786
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:39,820
But I never remember to check for future pcp episodes where mine might be on

1787
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:43,740
And besides I close the podcast

1788
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:49,740
Right at that part anyway, so it's not like I why do you send voicemails if you don't listen to the voicemail?

1789
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:52,700
I will never hear your reaction to this

1790
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:55,900
Why

1791
02:04:56,060 --> 02:05:00,060
It's just musing on the idea that that no, what do you know? I'm just throwing it to the wind

1792
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,540
I just how interesting

1793
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:05,900
I

1794
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:07,980
It takes all kinds I guess

1795
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:10,140
I mean, I don't I don't know

1796
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:11,580
Um

1797
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:17,500
Next one is called apologizing for one upping. Sorry. It's bad. Sorry. Apologizing

1798
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:23,900
GUZ for one upping. Sorry. It's bad. She heard three two one go

1799
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:29,260
I'm sorry. I I I swear. I'm not an edgy 14 year old. Okay

1800
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:33,900
I I painted myself in the wrong light by bringing up the insufferable social media argument

1801
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:37,660
You know, I was just trying to bridge the gap between where I I fell in, you know

1802
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:40,220
I was an edgy 11 year old

1803
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:46,540
You know from from what I could parse what I did understand. I was like hell. Yeah, this is funny

1804
02:05:46,780 --> 02:05:52,060
You know, all right. I I learned my lesson. All right as I never listened to the insufferable media podcast

1805
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:56,140
So I have no opinion of monkey jones in real time. I have no opinion about not actually in real time

1806
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:58,940
But as I listened throughout episodes, I watched him

1807
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:03,100
Disappear and that that that that's made me start to realize, you know

1808
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:07,260
As as monkey jones slowly faded as my role model

1809
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:11,580
It it became you guys and you know, I guess just another thing I want to say

1810
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:17,580
Is that effectively having listened to you for so long? Um, you guys are all basically like parental figures to me

1811
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:20,380
And it's really weird. Uh, it sure is

1812
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:25,340
Sure, it's weird. Sure. It's weird. Don't all right here as your

1813
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:28,060
parental figure I must say

1814
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:33,580
Don't listen to us. Don't do that. Don't look up to us. That's really stupid

1815
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:35,340
uh

1816
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:36,540
um

1817
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:38,540
Yeah, I I would say

1818
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:42,940
I don't want I don't want that kind of responsibility. Uh

1819
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:46,140
You learn learn from my mistakes

1820
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:48,620
And nothing else

1821
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:52,300
Next one is called on kiwi farms ideology

1822
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:54,780
three two one go

1823
02:06:55,340 --> 02:07:00,460
I recall correctly one of the things that was like downright said on kiwi farms was that they will misgender like

1824
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:04,540
Trans lulcows and the lgbt members of kiwi farms will be fine with it

1825
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:12,940
And also the guy who runs it is also a great replacement conspiracy not an anti-semitic. So yeah, they clearly have an ideology

1826
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:15,020
whether they want to admit it or not

1827
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,500
yeah, that's

1828
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:23,740
That's the that's the attitude of like, you know, like all all the all the lgbt

1829
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:29,100
and and lgbt q and and in particular trans people that have been

1830
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:32,060
Raging at me because like

1831
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:34,700
You shouldn't don't make

1832
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:42,700
Don't make her one of us. Don't make Chris one of us. No. No, keep it away. Don't let it be one of me. No

1833
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:46,620
um

1834
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:50,620
It's it's yeah, it's that same like self-hating like gatekeeping

1835
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:53,260
Pick me. I'm one of the good ones

1836
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:56,940
shit that like is so typical of that kind of like

1837
02:07:58,060 --> 02:08:00,780
You know, I mean kiwi farms is a website

1838
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:03,900
About bullying people

1839
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:06,300
So of course you go there

1840
02:08:06,380 --> 02:08:10,780
You get bullied. You're you're you're an lgbt freak. You get bullied

1841
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:14,140
They'll let you they'll let you stick around and they won't harass you

1842
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:19,420
But only if you only if you like kowtow and put up with like the fact that like they think less of you

1843
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:21,340
so

1844
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:28,140
You know, of course, of course, that's the type of course. That's the type right like if you're like, I don't know

1845
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:30,860
sort of like

1846
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:33,420
Think of yourself the way that they think of you

1847
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:39,180
And you're like, yeah, that they're right. They're right because I hate myself. They hate me. It just makes sense. You know

1848
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:45,020
Yeah, yeah, stupid. Yeah, they man. They really they really fucking hate this like trans e celeb

1849
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:51,820
They really fucking hate them and be and are and like they're they don't accept. They think they're faking. They think they're agp

1850
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:58,380
Faker. Yeah, I agree too because because I'm not like that because I'm I'm different like I'm I'm one of the real ones

1851
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:01,260
Right. I'm not faking like like whoever, right?

1852
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:05,580
You know

1853
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:07,980
What what more do I need to say it's sad

1854
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:09,180
um

1855
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:10,220
Yeah

1856
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:14,300
Next one is for reference in regards to the natehead

1857
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:16,940
three two one go

1858
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:23,500
Okay, ben recognized my voice cool, uh for reference the whole thing to the angry natehead was actually death alchemist

1859
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:28,860
Old thing that tom used to do back when he was right about to leave the pony days where right when he was talking about the episode

1860
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:31,740
He would like give the good but then right when he would give his criticisms

1861
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:35,020
He would like, you know, say exactly what I said on the podcast and it was just the

1862
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:37,980
Just the funniest thing to me

1863
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:43,100
Uh, I'm guessing you guys don't remember it, but it was something that definitely stuck with me just a dumb small thing

1864
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:45,660
I don't I don't remember that at all

1865
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:51,580
Do you remember what he's talking about? I think he's referring to the time where tom

1866
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:54,140
did his

1867
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:55,020
like

1868
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:57,020
I'm leaving the fandom

1869
02:09:57,020 --> 02:10:03,100
Portion portion of a video like he was doing he was doing a brony analysis, whatever

1870
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:09,100
And at the end he's like, well, you know what I don't like doing this and I'm not gonna do it anymore

1871
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:13,420
And you know what you all suck. I can't remember how like inflammatory he was

1872
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:17,340
I don't think he was actually like like a jesse level like fuck you

1873
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:20,540
But he did sort of piss a lot of people off

1874
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,100
And everyone was really really upset with him

1875
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:26,380
And uh, that was funny. Yeah

1876
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:28,380
is

1877
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:30,380
So it was a reference to tom's

1878
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:32,780
I'm leaving the the brony fandom

1879
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:34,140
thing

1880
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:35,500
I think so

1881
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:37,740
I don't okay. I believe the video is gone because

1882
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,980
cringe

1883
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:41,980
I mean, it's not it's not cringe

1884
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:44,780
No, that's history. Don't erase history

1885
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:46,300
No

1886
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:49,900
Bring it back. You know what I I I learned release release the tommy cut

1887
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:53,660
What I learned realized years ago. Um

1888
02:10:54,940 --> 02:11:01,820
brony curious is like mr. Plinkett style review of some pony episode was gone

1889
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:03,900
Oh, it was of of equestria girls

1890
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:10,860
Yeah, it's gone the the plinkett brony curious. I wanted to rewatch it. It was it was actually good

1891
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:12,940
You know what? Yeah

1892
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:18,060
Me too. I have these I don't remember when it was it might have been like two years ago or something

1893
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:21,980
But yeah, I also like I was going back to rewatch it just because

1894
02:11:23,020 --> 02:11:26,220
And it was and I couldn't I think I could find like the first episode somewhere

1895
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:29,020
um

1896
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:33,740
I'm not sure maybe it's on like a playlist. So it might just be unlisted, but I couldn't yeah, I couldn't find it

1897
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:39,980
I I guess I could ask tongue just to see if if I if it's unlisted if I could have a link

1898
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:46,060
But it's like I don't really care that much to rewatch it. I just don't like that. It's gone. You know, I don't like that

1899
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:48,060
It's gone. I I don't understand

1900
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,020
I I really don't understand the attitude of like

1901
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:57,260
I like I like why like why get rid of it because it's because it's brony related like so what who cares

1902
02:11:57,740 --> 02:11:59,900
I don't know the whole channel is brony related

1903
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:01,820
well

1904
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:03,820
Not anymore, right? It's rebranded

1905
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:06,540
Or wait, did he have did he

1906
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:11,820
He made a different account for brony curious. He had a different different account

1907
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:18,460
Called for rebel pixels, which was the tablet review and technology and like art thing

1908
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:20,380
Yeah

1909
02:12:20,380 --> 02:12:24,540
And I I don't know whether that was the same channel as the brony curious channel

1910
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:29,980
I can't remember. It's been a while. I I I think brony curious got rebranded

1911
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:32,860
Into one of the channels

1912
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:36,220
Yeah, I don't I don't understand why you would take that down. It was

1913
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:39,660
I I

1914
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:42,380
Can't I can't I have no idea. I have no idea why

1915
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:44,300

I'm plus I'm somewhere in the plus probably

1924
02:13:11,980 --> 02:13:16,780
You do not attract a demisexual person as your partner

1925
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:19,100
You will

1926
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:21,660
You will attract a feline

1927
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:26,860
And I know you do not want a feline

1928
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:31,020
This person needs a glass of water

1929
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:35,020
They need to stay hydrated

1930
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:37,020
um

1931
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:39,020
They need to stay hydro-weighted

1932
02:13:39,740 --> 02:13:41,740
I drew hydro-woo-weighted

1933
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,220
Is this my water

1934
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:48,460

So that's correction

1940
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:13,100
You cannot

1941
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:15,740
But you can oh

1942
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:22,060
There is a difference. Oh, it matters to people like me

1943
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:28,380
Who's people like you? What do you mean people like you, huh racist?

1944
02:14:32,140 --> 02:14:34,540
I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep ooo and I'm gonna keep

1945
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:41,900
I'm gonna keep culturally appropriating. Oh, man. Oh, whoa. What's this sexual intercourse?

1946
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:49,820
Notices bulge notices an entirely nude person. This reminds me of

1947
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:55,980
There was a guy I looked at the the the the the Trixie thread on kiwi for speaking of kiwi farms

1948
02:14:55,980 --> 02:15:01,900
I looked at the thread like yesterday the day before and someone there's one guy on there who would make

1949
02:15:03,020 --> 02:15:07,980
He would occasionally post and his thing was that he was mad at her for rapping

1950
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:10,380
while being white

1951
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:14,380
And it was like really funny because his his stance was basically

1952
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:17,100
So racist

1953
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:19,580
That he basically circled around to being woke again

1954
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:22,940
Like he he hates black culture so much

1955
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:30,540
That he protects it that he wants to protect it from white people that want to like co-opt it because he doesn't want it to spread

1956
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:33,820
Like that's his thing

1957
02:15:34,220 --> 02:15:39,660
And he even the even the other kiwi farmers like hate him and made fun of him for it

1958
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:43,340
Is it even woke to like

1959
02:15:44,380 --> 02:15:45,340
to

1960
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:47,580
Like gate keep culture

1961
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,300
Yeah, it's it's I guess what you might

1962
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:56,220
Call like a like a parody of being woke. It's like, oh, no no culturally appropriation

1963
02:15:56,300 --> 02:16:00,540
You can't do anything if you're you can't do these things if you're white

1964
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:03,180
Or whatever

1965
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:04,940
Oh, did you

1966
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:09,260
Was it this week? Was it this week that uh fucking that fucking

1967
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:11,980
Dumpling a noodle book

1968
02:16:11,980 --> 02:16:15,340
Thing happened on twitter. Did you see that? That was a little while ago

1969
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:18,060
Was it um that was so

1970
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,780
That was so annoying. I saw

1971
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:23,340
If you don't know it was oh, yeah

1972
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:27,980
I know I the there was the like the rebuttal that looked into the author

1973
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:33,660
And it turns out the lady who was white who made the book about noodles

1974
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:37,020
Grew up with asian people and culture

1975
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:43,660
Yeah, she was like and so yeah, so it's like fine and not even I mean it I mean it would have been fine anyway

1976
02:16:44,060 --> 02:16:46,060
Yeah, it's like their argument

1977
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:53,580
Yeah, it's just like completely destroyed in every way audience if you don't know the context is this this woman this this I think she was a

1978
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:54,860
filipina

1979
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:55,900
woman

1980
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:57,740
Made a calm she made a tweet that was like

1981
02:16:58,300 --> 02:17:04,220
Why did a white woman write a book about noodles and dumplings and it was it showed like the book

1982
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:10,300
Which is it's called like dumplings and noodles and it was the author and she's like white and she has like curly red hair

1983
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:11,740
She looked like maybe

1984
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:13,580
irish or something. I don't know

1985
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:15,580
um, but uh

1986
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:17,580
yeah, so like

1987
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:19,660
I don't know this kind of shit like like

1988
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:23,340
I saw I saw a a guy

1989
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:30,140
I don't know his name, but I see him on my timeline. I don't think I follow him. He's like a he's like a male only fans

1990
02:17:30,620 --> 02:17:33,180
Model he's like a male like porn guy

1991
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:37,660
But he's like this buff. I think he's middle eastern and he

1992
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:41,420
Is like a handsome

1993
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:42,780

Guy who gay does gay only fans porn, but he also like

1995
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:49,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait

No, it's not gay chat

1997
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:53,340
He's not middle eastern

1998
02:17:53,340 --> 02:17:58,540
Um, I don't think um, but this this he also just makes like good like socialist posts

1999
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:04,220
He just like he just has good politics and posts about them sometimes and he posted and he was like

2000
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:09,100
He said like it's only it's only deaspora kids meaning like

2001
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:15,740
Kids that were born away from their home like like people that are actually from these places don't care

2002
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:20,060
He was like it's only deaspora kids that like give a shit about this kind of

2003
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:27,260
Cultural appropriation like he said my my parents find it funny. They find it amusing when like americans like make

2004
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:30,780
Uh persian food. I think maybe he's persian or something

2005
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:33,580
And I and I think that's true

2006
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:38,220
Uh, it's it sounds true to me. I don't know this is a sentiment that I've seen echoed by other

2007
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:43,660
Like people that are actually from like a foreign country when they see like a white person like

2008
02:18:44,540 --> 02:18:52,460
Doing a tea ceremony or making some food. They're like ha ha lol cute or whatever there. I don't know this this lady

2009
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:57,020
I don't know she she she had this like stupid

2010
02:18:57,420 --> 02:19:03,820
She had this stupid take and then she complained about it for like she had like a huge meltdown on twitter about it for like

2011
02:19:04,220 --> 02:19:10,380
Days because people were calling it stupid. She you know said like oh, I've been spending my I've been all these days

2012
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:12,380
I've been getting harassed by nazis which

2013
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:18,620
Probably some yeah, probably some nazis were in there jumping on this to be racist

2014
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:25,500
And then at the end of it all she's like boy. I've been through so much. Here's my cash app fucking

2015
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:29,100
Tip me and like I'm sure she made like a ton of money

2016
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:32,780
I don't because she was the main character of twitter for like two days there

2017
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:39,020
Uh, so I had another whole thing's obnoxious the whole the whole story is annoying and I don't like it

2018
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:45,580
Uh, and I don't like that kind of like why a white a white person making noodles like

2019
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:50,700
Ah

2020
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:54,140
Okay, I think I've made my point

2021
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:55,660
um

2022
02:19:55,660 --> 02:20:01,100
Next voicemail is called one cool dud three two one go

2023
02:20:01,900 --> 02:20:07,900
Officially induct cyber shell already that bitch is fucking delightful

2024
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:11,420
Cyber shell is delightful. Yes

2025
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:14,700
Uh, but no ceremonies

2026
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:19,900
Yeah, we ran out of confetti. We don't have anymore. We can't do it

2027
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:28,060
Yeah, yeah, and and like the the dubbing the the the the new member dubbing sword is like it's rusty needs repairing

2028
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:34,940
Yeah, it's um, it needs to be reforged in the fires of mount doom

2029
02:20:35,740 --> 02:20:41,260
And it's really far away. It's in like new zealand. It's like there's covids. It's kind of hard to get over to there right now. Yeah

2030
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:44,620
Yeah, yeah, it's actually fro could just take a plane

2031
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:51,180
Why didn't the ball rod just fly the ring to mortar with its wings?

2032
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:59,500
Why didn't Frodo just fucking throw it? Do you know do you know about the ball do ball rocks have wings debate?

2033
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:01,660
um, I

2034
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:06,300
No, I have no idea about that. Well, the the ball rock is described in the book

2035
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:11,100
I I knew about this already, but dan olson just put out a video that is about um

2036
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:18,220
Like an an older adaptation of the lord of the rings not the peter jackson one and he he mentioned this so it's fresh in my mind, but there is a

2037
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:20,220
um

2038
02:21:20,220 --> 02:21:24,300
The the ball rock is it's described first as having

2039
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:28,220
Like darkness spreading out around it like wings

2040
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:30,860
And then later on it says

2041
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:33,500
That it's it says like it's wings spread

2042
02:21:33,740 --> 02:21:37,500
So it kind of like first implies that it doesn't have wings

2043
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:40,940
But just has like shadows that cast a shadow that looks like wings

2044
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:44,140
But then later on it does refer to the wings

2045
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:46,380
and there's

2046
02:21:46,380 --> 02:21:47,900
a great debate

2047
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:51,660
In scholarship and I've seen I've seen really compelling arguments on both sides

2048
02:21:52,220 --> 02:21:56,940
Of like why like the ball rock definitely does have wings or definitely doesn't have wings

2049
02:21:57,580 --> 02:22:01,660
The I watched a video where like a Tolkien expert some professor somewhere

2050
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:05,020
Says that they they definitely don't have wings

2051
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:08,700
Because they are creations of morgoth

2052
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:13,900
And morgoth would not like he made he made the ball rocks to be

2053
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:16,860
What they are like deliberately he crafted them

2054
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:21,260
So why would he give them vestigial wings that don't work that would be like

2055
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:25,260
A waste but then I saw and this was again. This was Sean my guy

2056
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:28,060
He made it he tweeted but he says

2057
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:30,300
That he thinks they do have wings

2058
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:33,900
They can't he that they can't fly but that they do have wings

2059
02:22:34,300 --> 02:22:36,860
Because morgoth was he made

2060
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:41,980
He made all kinds of creatures. He was he was doing all kinds of like experiments and making creatures

2061
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:45,100
So it's it's totally it is reasonable to think that you know

2062
02:22:45,580 --> 02:22:49,740
Not every creature that he made came out exactly like on purpose

2063
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:54,060
Maybe some of them came out a little weird and and that's like why not?

2064
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:55,580
Um

2065
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:57,740
So like or morgoth's not all powerful

2066
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:02,460
So, I don't know. I think maybe he had a red bull. Haha

2067
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:06,860
Although I do think

2068
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:12,300
I do think that the image of a ball rock having not actual wings, but just like

2069
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:18,060
Perpetually casting a wing like shadows around itself. I think that's cooler. Honestly

2070
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:22,380
Um, it isn't the ball rock like in moria

2071
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:25,340
Like trapped down there

2072
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:28,860
Um, like it was released. I don't know

2073
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:31,660
But like it's not supposed to be there normally

2074
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:38,300
They the dwarves unearthed it by digging too deep. I think so. All right. Does he like being in the ground?

2075
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:45,020
Because if why would why would he fly why would he fly and why that's what I want to know

2076
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:48,940
Would he fly up to the surface and go see the birds?

2077
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:54,380
You know, I I think I think that the ball rock was not

2078
02:23:54,940 --> 02:23:57,100
Oh god, I don't fucking know what I'm talking about. I could be wrong

2079
02:23:57,100 --> 02:24:00,380
But I don't I think he was originally trapped down in the earth

2080
02:24:00,380 --> 02:24:02,380
I don't think he was like meant to be down there

2081
02:24:02,380 --> 02:24:06,620
He was trapped down there and then the dwarves unearthed him by digging

2082
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:10,060
I think

2083
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:12,060
And then he got him

2084
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:14,460
And then oh he oh he got

2085
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:17,500
Oh, he got him real good and then unrelated a bunch of

2086
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:20,060
goblins and orcs

2087
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:21,900
took over

2088
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:22,860
because of

2089
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:24,860
Sauron or something

2090
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:26,940
Yes, I think

2091
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:29,420
So

2092
02:24:30,860 --> 02:24:32,220
Yeah

2093
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:35,420
Anyway, uh cyber shell is cool. Cyber shell can be on

2094
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:38,300
whenever

2095
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:40,540
He doesn't he doesn't have to be we don't have to yeah

2096
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:46,940
We don't have to throw a fucking party and do the whole thing we did with like Jeff and monkey about like, oh, you're an official member now

2097
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:49,820
Yeah, there's no there's no need for such

2098
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:55,020
There's no reason for that. They can just I mean like fit mc is on a bunch of episodes. Should we

2099
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:57,420
induct him like I don't know

2100
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:01,340
They can just come on the show. They just be on the show and they'll be it'll be cool

2101
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:03,420
True

2102
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:07,260
Next one is is son of meroac three two one go

2103
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:15,340
At Otacon there is an art show that takes place in the artist alley where artists can submit unique pieces of art

2104
02:25:16,060 --> 02:25:16,940
and

2105
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:21,580
People can sign up to bid for them on an online auction

2106
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:26,780
So I will submit 20 to 40 pieces of unique

2107
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:29,260
hentai

2108
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:31,260
that people can sign up

2109
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:36,860
And wait, this is the same voicemail as last week potentially if there are enough

2110
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:41,420
Online bids it can actually go to a live auction also

2111
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:43,260
So

2112
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:47,660
That's I feel like son of meroac sent this exact same. I wasn't clear so there you go

2113
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:50,540
No

2114
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:52,220
but why

2115
02:25:52,220 --> 02:25:53,420
But why

2116
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:56,540
It's it's an auction and like people buy it, but like

2117
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:02,700
Do you son of meroac draw all the hentai or do you just what have it?

2118
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:07,740
Like why who are you to profit off of hentai you collect? I don't get it

2119
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:13,020
What is the what is the point? I don't you put artists put art into a

2120
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:20,140
Thing and it gets auctioned and then I guess the artist gets paid. I don't know all all I'm all I'm getting is that there is an auction

2121
02:26:20,860 --> 02:26:25,740
I son of meroac am submitting pieces into it to be auction

2122
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:30,540
What what am I supposed to latch on to here?

2123
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:34,460
Uh, good luck. I guess you're supposed to park ben

2124
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:37,100
Pog okay

2125
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:41,260
Next one is called optimal homestuck three two one go

2126
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:51,660
Optimal homestuck experience step one start homestuck step two get sidetracked by problem sleuth step three never look back

2127
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:54,780
problem sleuth is

2128
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:57,100
objectively a better story than homestuck

2129
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:02,140
It's it's more nicely connected together. Yeah

2130
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:04,940
Yeah, it

2131
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:06,700
Yeah

2132
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:13,260
Man, it gave me false hope. It gave me false hope problem sleuth's ending is so good and so robustly

2133
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:17,740
Interconnected that it gave me false hope. I made me think like

2134
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:20,940
Well, obviously hussy knows what he's doing

2135
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:24,780
Just look at the ending of homestuck or the ending of problem sleuth like

2136
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:28,380
Homestuck is just that it's just that but like bigger and more elaborate

2137
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:34,700
So like just like in problem sleuth the ending of homestuck it will all come together and it will all tie together into a into a perfect

2138
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:38,460
It's package and it was just false

2139
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:43,900
It's the metaphor I would use is that the the the it's the same thing

2140
02:27:44,700 --> 02:27:46,700
But due to its size

2141
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:51,420
It can't it can't like like hold its own weight under gravity

2142
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:55,500
It's just too big and so it collapsed. I thought

2143
02:27:56,380 --> 02:27:58,380
I I just I thought like

2144
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:06,300
Hussy knows what he's doing. He wouldn't he wouldn't have built the story like this if he couldn't make it all come work in the ends

2145
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:11,500
Yeah, it's

2146
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:16,780
I mean, I don't I don't want to get into a whole thing about like what was wrong with the ending of homestuck, but

2147
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:21,100
Problem sleuth is but I mean I would still say finish it

2148
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:23,900
At least at least finish act five

2149
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:27,820
At least get to risk it and then understand who I am or

2150
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:31,100
Yeah, true

2151
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:35,820
Next one is called. Why is no one talking about this three two one go

2152
02:28:36,220 --> 02:28:42,060
What's up everybody? It's pretty cool. Today. We're going to be looking at one of the worst shit stands to ever grace the internet

2153
02:28:42,300 --> 02:28:47,260
His name has been saint. He's a comic artist podcaster and ran a tier fake professor

2154
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:51,740
This man is single-handedly responsible for all the horrible news surrounding chris chain

2155
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:58,460
You don't know chris chain was recently arrested for raping his elderly mother an action that was directly influenced by slime

2156
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:06,540
In this in this tweet thread, I will one out of

2157
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:12,060
It's it's it's cleverly disguised, but it's it doesn't sound like a human

2158
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:14,620
It's this the robot

2159
02:29:14,620 --> 02:29:16,620
one of the

2160
02:29:17,020 --> 02:29:19,020
one of the many

2161
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:21,020
arrangements that I observe in the like

2162
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:27,740
In like the the the in the the kiwi farms freaks that are like

2163
02:29:28,540 --> 02:29:30,540
In my in my men. She's lately

2164
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:35,660
Is is this idea that they they they on the one hand they must

2165
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:40,940
They must persecute chris in any way possible whether that's misgendering her

2166
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:45,260
You know calling calling her, you know a rapist, which you know fair enough

2167
02:29:46,060 --> 02:29:48,700
Calling her, you know retarded or whatever

2168
02:29:49,180 --> 02:29:54,140
Whatever they want to do they must persecute chris to the maximum extent in every possible way

2169
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:56,140
But also

2170
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:59,100
But also they must implicate me

2171
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:04,540
In her crimes and like claim that I am they must guilt me by saying like ben

2172
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:07,020
you're wrong

2173
02:30:07,020 --> 02:30:08,940
because

2174
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:10,940
You did this like you

2175
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:12,780
talked to chris

2176
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:20,380
You what they say is you encouraged her delusions. You drove her further and further into her delusions by by acknowledging them

2177
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:25,100
And and therefore the fact that this happened. This is partly your fault

2178
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:29,580
It's like you could have stopped this ben if you had just said wait a minute chris

2179
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:36,220
Actually, I don't think the cartoon world and the real world are going to merge in a big like roger rabbit fucking

2180
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:38,700
Cosmic calamity actually

2181
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:42,700
I don't think that would have if if you had just said that she would have snapped out of her thing

2182
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:46,380
And she would have been like wow, I guess I should I should get a job or something

2183
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:52,060
You could you you helped cause this ben because you didn't do it. I was there. I

2184
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:58,860
Kiwi farms fucking self-hating troll whatever I was there in the menschies every time chris tweeted

2185
02:30:59,020 --> 02:31:03,020
I said chris you are you need a job. You are delusional

2186
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:06,140
You are not a woman. You are a man and you're retarded

2187
02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:08,780
I was there every single time doing my duty

2188
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:13,660
And if only you ben had joined me in that crusade that all it would have been enough

2189
02:31:13,660 --> 02:31:21,740
It would have tipped the scales and everything would have turned out differently, but no you wouldn't you said I want this mom reaped to occur

2190
02:31:22,460 --> 02:31:26,940
You premeditated it 10 years ago. You premeditated it all ben

2191
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:28,860
um

2192
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:31,180
Yeah, they they I mean, where's the lie?

2193
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:33,820
Where is the lie? I don't

2194
02:31:34,460 --> 02:31:36,300
That's that's just

2195
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:41,500
Yeah, it's it's pretty it's pretty fucked. It's pretty fucked up when when they when they pull that card like I

2196
02:31:42,060 --> 02:31:49,100
I just don't know where they get the fucking gall to say such a such a such a moronic thing. I really don't

2197
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:51,180
um

2198
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:53,180
next one is uh

2199
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:56,780
The big chicken's egg of

2200
02:31:57,420 --> 02:31:59,900
Tim rogers is david foster wallace

Three two one go on my way to get my gynecologist mcdonald's but uh make gamers tavern and cybershell permanent members of pcp

2202
02:32:10,220 --> 02:32:12,860

2203
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:16,220
uh make every pcp episode four hours long

2204
02:32:17,180 --> 02:32:18,780

02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,780
Well, we'll just pop

2206
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:23,740
What it doesn't have to do anything with tim rogers

2207
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:26,540
um, no like we have to

2208
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:33,820
We have to introduce artificial scarcity artificial scarcity. We can't give you too many good episodes because then you get spoiled

2209
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:37,420
We want it to only be as a treat

2210
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:39,020
only as a treat

2211
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:45,580
Uh, and then we'd get it would gape keep the rest along on pcb.com slash the patreon dot slash the

2212
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:47,580
patreon.com

2213

One of these days I am bonus episodes one of these days. I am gonna do what I need to do

02:32:52,780 --> 02:32:57,020
It's it's it's not so today is one of these days one of these days could be today

2215
02:32:57,740 --> 02:33:04,780
One of these days someone will do the things we need to do to get those three new bonus episodes live

2216
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:09,020
They will happen. It can't they it can't go on like this

02:33:10,060 --> 02:33:11,900
um

2218
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:15,340
Next one is called big chicken's egg of curl

three two one go

2220
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:23,020
However, of course doing so will cause the finger of the monkey's paw to curl

02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:28,620
Uh, monkey jones will also be returning as a permanent member and uh, man ethan raff's child

Uh, will be the cause of uh vents had been crushed

2223
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:35,020
by a train

2224
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:40,300
So so so so so so so

2225
02:33:44,220 --> 02:33:49,740
Man ethan raff's child is welcome on the pcb train conductor anytime

2226
02:33:53,980 --> 02:34:00,380
Disgusting um next voicemail is called please don't play the last voicemail

2227
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:03,340
three two one go

2228
02:34:04,300 --> 02:34:09,660
Hey, I'm really sorry about that little voicemail. I said a lot of racial slurs

2229
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:16,380
Like probably every single one made up a few new ones for eastern europeans. Really don't like those guys

2230
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:19,260
um made fun of chinese people

2231
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:23,980
Then I bent the knee to chinese people and said uh, hong kong and taiwan are countries

2232
02:34:24,620 --> 02:34:30,620
Um, I said ben's current address live on it and then I said the address he's going to be moving to next

2233
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:35,980
Um, just so much bad shit. I'm really sorry. Please don't play that

2234
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:41,180
And

2235
02:34:41,180 --> 02:34:47,180
If you if there was an email attached never play one from that email again, I'm very sorry

2236
02:34:48,860 --> 02:34:56,380
Hey, what voicemail am I right? Hmm. Don't know what voicemail you could possibly be referring to

2237
02:34:57,100 --> 02:35:02,300
Wink, what is this? Please don't play the last voicemail at cocksack.com

2238
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:08,460
Well, I'll I'll be on the lookout for that one. We will be we will keep our eyes wide open

2239
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:11,580
Next voicemail is called boy zerk

2240
02:35:12,220 --> 02:35:14,220
three two one go

2241
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:19,260
I won't take this slander any longer the golden age arc of berserk is great

2242
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:23,020
But it's the least good part of berserk the least everything after it is way better

2243
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:28,540
The least people saying that only the golden age arc is worth reading or that you can just stop after that

2244
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:31,180
Nah, it's all way better

2245
02:35:31,900 --> 02:35:33,020
Wow

2246
02:35:33,020 --> 02:35:35,740
Least good is quite a claim. I don't know if I would say

2247
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:38,700
I think it's really good

2248
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:41,420
that in in that it's

2249
02:35:42,140 --> 02:35:45,020
Like a contained story that could be stopped

2250
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:50,460
Um, but I definitely think there's so much more good stuff later

2251
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:52,860
Hey

2252
02:35:52,860 --> 02:35:58,620
The kushan the kushan empire arc with the the big crazy guy that turns into a thing

2253
02:35:59,660 --> 02:36:03,420
I feel like that's like the highest point of of the the manga

2254
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:06,540
And even even just even just like

2255
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:08,380
Griffith

2256
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:12,060
In the hand and the the tower of I don't know religious guys

2257
02:36:13,900 --> 02:36:17,420
There's so many good parts. There's no bad part of berserk

2258
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:22,060
But I can I can see the argument for that being like the least good because it's the most

2259
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:24,620
I don't know

2260
02:36:24,620 --> 02:36:26,620
It's it's like a setup to something

2261
02:36:28,220 --> 02:36:30,220
That can be enjoyed by itself

2262
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:32,220
Hmm

2263
02:36:32,220 --> 02:36:36,540
Um, I mean I never I read the I read golden age and then I read like a little bit afterwards

2264
02:36:36,620 --> 02:36:42,620
I read a bunch. There was like some fairies. I read like some stuff about fairies, uh, and that

2265
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:45,820
That's why I didn't get much girl

2266
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:48,460
Probably it was a long time ago

2267
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:56,460
Uh, yeah, it was a girl with like really got to read at least at least up to the point where like the party forms

2268
02:36:57,500 --> 02:36:59,500
Yeah

2269
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:02,060
You got to learn you got to know the characters before you can say

2270
02:37:04,140 --> 02:37:08,540
Yeah, you're right. I don't I don't know if I've if I've ever said like

2271
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:11,340
I

2272
02:37:11,980 --> 02:37:13,980
I recommend okay, I recommended

2273
02:37:14,460 --> 02:37:18,940
People just read the golden age arc and then decide if you want to keep reading

2274
02:37:19,500 --> 02:37:22,220
I didn't say you don't have to keep reading. I said

2275
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:26,060
Because that's the part I've read and I said people should read that

2276
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:30,860
And then if they like it they can continue. I did like it, but for some reason I bounced off it

2277
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:32,860
And then I never got much further past it

2278
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:35,260
Uh, I yeah, I can't

2279
02:37:35,580 --> 02:37:38,860
I never I never got kept going so I can't have any uh

2280
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:42,620
Real opinion about whether it gets better or worse or or what?

2281
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:43,980
um

2282
02:37:43,980 --> 02:37:48,300
Next one is called peri aka at lex paradox

2283
02:37:49,500 --> 02:37:51,660
Okay, three two one go

2284
02:37:52,860 --> 02:37:58,460
So I just got done arguing with stupid transfers about christian's gender on twitter on behalf of one benjamin saint

2285
02:37:58,620 --> 02:38:01,260
And I just wanted to get about how fucking awful they are

2286
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:07,580
Like the entire crux of their argument rolls around christian saying one time that she wanted to be trans to fuck girls or something

2287
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:11,740
10 years ago respond that the reason for someone changing their identity doesn't fucking matter

2288
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:14,140
All that matters is that they identify as that gender

2289
02:38:14,380 --> 02:38:20,620
Then they abandon that first argument and pivot to essentially the argument that christ is too crazy to be trans which is

2290
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:26,140
Concerning in and of itself and then you say well people believe in a lot of crazy shit

2291
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:29,980
Does that discredit everything else that they believe about their identity and everything they think?

2292
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:34,780
Then they know that they've lost and they just call you a bigot and act like they have the high ground or something

2293
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:39,180
And they just run away and it's fucking stupid and it makes me happy dunking on these fucking idiots

2294
02:38:39,660 --> 02:38:44,460
Anyway, uh, then I just wanted to thank you for standing up for trans people. I really appreciate it

2295
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:49,020
I've been listening to the podcast since I was since I was the since I was a freshman in high school

2296
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:51,340
And i'm a junior in college now

2297
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:53,020
U3 assuming tom is on today

2298
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:57,740
I've always been my favorite members of the podcast and it's almost exclusively gotten better since everyone has gone

2299
02:38:57,820 --> 02:38:59,820
Even though everyone seems to think otherwise

2300
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:05,820
Uh, not everyone and have good wonderful days. I love all of you also follow me on twitter

2301
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:10,380
Sometimes I make art when i'm not dunking on idiots. Goodbye at

2302
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:18,540
at lex lexis lex s p e r i d o t i assume that's twitter handle

2303
02:39:18,700 --> 02:39:24,540
Well, i'm glad you appreciate me or me getting in fights on twitter. Uh, I I remember

2304
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:27,260
Yeah, they the what you said is exactly right

2305
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:30,700
They they will they will yeah, they will they will make a claim

2306
02:39:31,260 --> 02:39:33,260
They will make a claim

2307
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:35,100
like, um

2308
02:39:35,100 --> 02:39:37,420
Chris said she's Chris said she's faking

2309
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:43,020
And then when you go that was 10 years ago and also and also it's irrelevant that she said that one time

2310
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:48,780
Then they will pivot to Chris is too crazy and doesn't get to decide her own gender. She can't make that claim

2311
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:52,620
She she says other crazy things. We shouldn't believe her and then you go

2312
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:57,260
That doesn't make any sense because that's what being trans is she identifies as trans

2313
02:39:57,260 --> 02:40:00,540
That's the end and then they and then they will they will just they will just pivot to a new

2314
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:03,180
They'll just keep pivoting to a new argument every single time

2315
02:40:03,820 --> 02:40:06,060
And then they will just circle back around to the beginning

2316
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:12,860
And just make the first argument again and just say that like you didn't and you know that you didn't you didn't respond to it

2317
02:40:12,860 --> 02:40:14,860
even when you did

2318
02:40:15,580 --> 02:40:21,020
And the the most annoying part of all that is that if you do like hound them to make them

2319
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:25,340
Acknowledge that they have no argument to this, you know the the main point or something

2320
02:40:25,660 --> 02:40:30,300
They'll start saying why do you care so much? Why are you going on about this? You know, you kind of fucked up

2321
02:40:30,620 --> 02:40:34,300
They'll that's why that you having the argument is you being insane

2322
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:38,380
Yeah, oh and that somehow that like discredits you it's like

2323
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:45,340
That that one that one that one particularly angry one yesterday was like

2324
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:48,460
convinced that like

2325
02:40:48,620 --> 02:40:50,380
me that like

2326
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:56,300
That she said that true scum is a slur and that like by calling her a true scum. I am like

2327
02:40:57,020 --> 02:41:00,300
outing myself as a bigot because like true scum are the real

2328
02:41:01,340 --> 02:41:03,180
True scum aren't the bigots

2329
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:05,180
The real bigots are the people that

2330
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:08,060
hate true scum that don't agree with them and like

2331
02:41:09,020 --> 02:41:11,340
What do you even what do you even say to a person like that?

2332
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:14,300
What do you even say?

2333
02:41:15,740 --> 02:41:19,660
I don't know. Yeah, the the the pivoting you say the pivoting fucked

2334
02:41:20,460 --> 02:41:26,940
The pivoting this is a thing. I've been complaining about this in my discord lot the the motton bailey argument where you

2335
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:30,460
Make you advance two arguments simultaneously

2336
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:33,020
one of which is

2337
02:41:33,020 --> 02:41:36,140
One of which is uh is controversial or hard to defend

2338
02:41:36,700 --> 02:41:41,420
And the other of which is basic and easy to defend you advance them together

2339
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:46,860
Or as one argument or you advance an argument that could be read as one or the other

2340
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:49,340
And then if someone argues against

2341
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:53,820
the more difficult to defend argument that you made the more um

2342
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:56,860
Yeah, the the more uh

2343
02:41:57,420 --> 02:42:03,740
Controversial argument you pretend you retreat from the bailey to the mott or is it from the mott to the bailey?

2344
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:10,940
Whatever and you you retreat and you pretend that you were only advancing the the the basic uncontroversial one

2345
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:13,900
Um, this is a I hate I hate this shit

2346
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:20,220
It's so fuck I see it all the time and it's really transparent. It's just really it's really dishonest

2347
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:21,580
It's it's you know

2348
02:42:21,580 --> 02:42:28,940
It's really the mark of a person who has a lot of faith that what they're saying is right and that like their ideology makes sense

2349
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:35,980
Where in like they argue it in a way where like they have to pretend they're not arguing what they actually are trying to argue

2350
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:38,300
It really speaks volumes to their character

2351
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:40,060
um

2352
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:45,260
Next voicemail is oh, it's another one from 4 20 69. Oh my god his mission

2362
02:43:41,820 --> 02:43:45,100
The ongoing war between the nate heads and the natefuckers

2363
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:50,140
They're more like they're more alike than they know for no admit

2364
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:52,780
yeah

2365
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:54,780
they

2366
02:43:55,820 --> 02:44:00,300
Well, uh, I'm trying to think of a way to say the joke that I have

2367
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:02,940
because like tally band

2368
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:05,100
natefuckers nate heads

2369
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:07,260
nate 11

2370
02:44:07,980 --> 02:44:13,740
Uh, it doesn't don't really work. That was al-qaeda that did the 9 11 not the tally band

2371
02:44:15,100 --> 02:44:21,980
No, no, I mean like like like tally band like uh had al-qaeda like tucked inside like sneakily

2372
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:25,500
Like that was the whole reason

2373
02:44:26,060 --> 02:44:28,060
tally band like looked the other way

2374
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:30,540
Didn't they? Oh, is that right?

2375
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:35,420
And then they allowed al-qaeda to plan the 9 11 they did the 9 11

2376
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:37,420
that

2377
02:44:37,420 --> 02:44:39,740
I and that's why they tell you that makes sense

2378
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:42,620
That's why tally bad

2379
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:47,020

What about just the tip natefuckers if you do not explicitly support the natefuckers you are

2394
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:40,620
Taking a stance that you want nate to stay unfucked

2395
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:43,420
and that is

2396
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:45,980

Next voicemail is called road to radcon four before I play this one

2408
02:46:36,060 --> 02:46:39,100
I just want to mention again that whole thing about the credit card is because

2409
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:45,900
The proof of printing of road to radcon is made. I was waiting for the credit card so I can pay for it

2410
02:46:46,300 --> 02:46:52,380
Tomorrow monday. I'm going to the printer and I'm going to hopefully approve the proof and be like yep print it

2411
02:46:52,380 --> 02:46:55,100
And then they will be printing 150 copies

2412
02:46:56,540 --> 02:47:01,500
God right in time for me to move. I guess I won't be shipping them until next month. I guess but um

2413
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:07,180
They'll be printing me 150 copies and then I will be shipping them out to kickstarter backers. So

2414
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:09,980
Looking forward to it. I guess

2415
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:12,540
three two one go

2416
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:16,780
Hey, feel free to skip this if you've already talked about it

2417
02:47:17,260 --> 02:47:21,260
But then you apparently finished writing road to radcon four chapter five

2418
02:47:21,820 --> 02:47:27,100
Yep, so when will it be released? There it is. I just told you for the $100 backers

2419
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:33,980
Are you it was a stretch goal of the kickstarter that you release it and the previous chapters were released as youtube videos

2420
02:47:34,540 --> 02:47:40,140
I understand if you don't want to make an audiobook of it, but maybe you could just release it in text form somewhere

2421
02:47:40,860 --> 02:47:46,700
Yeah, yeah, I will I will definitely publish maybe on the maybe on the website and the pcp website or something

2422
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:54,700
Yeah, I'll definitely post the text version online somewhere the the hundred dollar back the hundred dollar backers will get

2423
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:59,340
I think I think on a previous episode around a stream or something. I talked about maybe

2424
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:03,100
I should redo like an audiobook version of the full

2425
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:10,380
Book as a video or something. Yeah, it's probably on the last the one before last heckles or shackles stream

2426
02:48:10,860 --> 02:48:12,860
We talked about that. Yeah

2427
