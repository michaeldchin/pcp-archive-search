00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber where I train

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,280
my ability to complain. I am Tom Oliver and today I am recording much earlier than I usually

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,520
do these episodes. Usually I record these around 11.30 at night but today we are recording

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,560
at 11.30 in the morning. So I thought it was a perfect time to try out a new wine that

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:35,520
I picked up. Fourth star brewing company, Maple Breakfast Stout, brewed with real maple

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:46,960
syrup. One pint in a can. Maple C Series, 6.5% alcohol per volume. Another Vermont small

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
brewery. We seem to get a lot of those here in Massachusetts because we are pretty close

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:01:00,280
by and there's a big brewing scene over there in Vermont. So this seems like an early morning

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:09,040
beer for an early morning kind of podcast. So let's see what we got going on here. Yeah,

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,760
it tastes like beer. There's a little bit of a hint of maple syrup but I fucking hate

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,960
beer man. I don't know why I buy beer. Every time I'm just like maybe I'll enjoy this one,

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,160
maybe I'll enjoy this one. I don't, I don't like the taste of beer. People give Coors

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,440
Light and Budweiser a bunch of shit because it tastes like water but like at least water

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:39,480
tastes good. You know what I mean? It's probably blasphemy to like lots of beer enthusiasts.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,120
The maple syrup, it's very very subtle. It's very subtle but it does a little bit to kind

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:57,880
of like take the edge off that like piss and barf taste that is beer. So yeah, I'll give

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,400
it, I'll give it that. I will give it that. It is a beer but it's one of the less offensive

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:14,160
stronger beers that I've had. What can I say? I'm a Roman vodka guy. Wait, shit. I forgot.

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,640
I'm gonna like insert this into the beginning. Reminder to self. Insert this before I start

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:27,280
talking. If you want to help support the Wine Fund you can go to the PayPal link in the description

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,080
and donate wine, money for wine. You can tell me what to talk about and what wine you would

22
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,000
like me to drink. I will do my best to find it. I have a local liquor store up the road

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,760
for me. They have a pretty decent selection but I am in the middle of nowhere so if not

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,080
I'll do, I'll get the closest to what I can because the guy there is pretty good and he

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
knows I don't know shit about wine so if I have questions he usually just takes pity

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,680
on me. So that's, then do that. Suggestions are cool otherwise you just get noodley videos

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,080
like the one I just made that you're about to listen to. Okay. So today we're gonna be

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,680
talking about, I don't know, I guess we're gonna be talking about making shit. Making

29
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:21,040
shit online and why I'm frustrated with it and just venting some of my personal frustrations

30
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,560
and thought processes behind making stuff in terms of just my personal development trying

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,040
to build a personal brand and also intermixing my personal brand with the PCP and the effects

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,960
that it has had and how I feel it's working and it's not working. So that's what we're

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:50,720
gonna dive into today. So I don't think a lot of people who are listening to this, who

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:59,160
listen to the PCP either know that I make things or give a shit and that's not an accusation,

35
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,880
it's just an observation. It's something I've always been very curious about and not just

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,840
me. One of the interesting things that I've always tried to observe from behind the scenes

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,080
about doing the PCP is like where do these people come from? What are they interested

38
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:25,520
in? Why are they here? And what happens when like a DigiBro fan finds the PCP? What do

39
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,720
they do from that point? Do they look into everybody else? Do they just kind of listen

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,240
to the podcast and that's it? Do they even stay on the podcast in general or do they

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,760
just listen to ones with Digi in it? And the same thing with anybody else, like if I bring

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,280
someone to the PCP, are they just gonna listen to episodes that I'm in? Are they gonna ignore

43
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,120
it all together or are they gonna explore the other members? You know, because there's

44
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,320
this core group of people in the PCP who listen to it that have been following all of us since

45
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,040
the horseshoe days. And I think that makes up the core audience, but we've been growing

46
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,560
substantially since the beginning. For the most part, there's been a general upward trend

47
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,360
since the start. So there has to be at some point since no one's doing horse shit anymore,

48
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,200
that there's an audience trickling in that has no idea about any of our backgrounds.

49
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,880
I would assume the bulk of them are probably coming from firstly Digi. There was a phase

50
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,040
where there was monkey and Nate's getting pretty big now too. So there's definitely

51
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,760
and since Nate's the showrunner, the frontrunner of the PCP, I'm assuming a lot of the PCB

52
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,960
audience has to be coming from him. But where do they come from? Where do they go? Where

53
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,360
do the fans go, bro? That's always something that's intrigued me. And there's really no

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,720
way to track it. There's no hard data on it. There's no way to really know. Because none

55
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,480
of us really make posts that say, hey, here's a new PCP episode, go check it out. So we can

56
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,560
go into the YouTube analytics and track where viewership is coming from. It just kind of

57
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,200
happens. And that's something that's always intrigued me. So I've always wondered, like,

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:08,640
what do people see? Like, how am I perceived externally? Right? That's kind of interesting.

59
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,360
Because I have, obviously, we all have limited perspective on ourselves. We're not going

60
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:21,120
to have some more maple stout. Hold on a second. I want to say it's grown on me, but it really

61
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,560
is. How am I perceived externally? What is my persona being projected outward? Because

62
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,280
I can observe the persona and the image of everybody else in the group, but I can't

63
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,000
observe my own, because I'm too connected to it, you know? And the reason I'm interested

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,640
in that other than just general curiosity, because like, the internet in general fascinates

65
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,480
me and how it grows and things of all that stuff like that. But also, I want obviously

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
like one of the benefits of doing the PCP, there's like three benefits, right? The first

67
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,880
is like I get to hang out with people that like that's that's the first one. The second

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,040
one is I make some money, which is also very important. And the third one is that it can

69
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,400
help bolster my personal projects, right? So that's like the three benefits to everybody,

70
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,240
like we all get to hang out because we don't get to do that much otherwise. We all make

71
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
a bit of coin, which is handy and brings us to our long term goal of not having to be

72
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,360
slaves to the man. And then also like we can use each other's audiences that we bring in

73
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,840
to build our own brands. My personal brand kind of sucks. And I feel like because it's

74
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,360
constantly been in this amorphous shifting thing, whereas everybody else is very much

75
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
kind of concretely decided what their personal brand is going to be, that my personal brand

76
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,760
and my brand recognition and even people understanding what I do and if I do anything

77
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,040
has been lost. And I don't blame anybody but myself for that because I've been in a long

78
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:54,960
transitional period because everybody in the PCP, the exception maybe of of of of Gibb,

79
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,240
and then obviously Mage, because Mage doesn't do much with YouTube other than posting her

80
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,040
animations and like Gibb kind of like, does you want to be the art boy who wants to be

81
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,320
the YouTube? Everybody else is very firmly in the YouTuber camp. And you know what, I even,

82
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,360
I take that back. It goes there very much in the YouTuber camp, like at this point.

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,840
So everybody kind of like settled on, I'm going to be the YouTuber. I'm going to do this gimmick.

84
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,840
You know, Nate had the best guy ever. Digi is Digi and pivoted to anime. You know,

85
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,680
so everybody kind of did their shit. They've been locked in their shit. And even Ben,

86
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
who's not really on YouTube, was locked into shit. He's doing the Vapors and Champion.

87
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I have been floating around in space for ever since 2015 when I stopped doing MLP. I was like,

88
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,720
what am I going to do? I'm going to try writing. Guess not. I'm going to try drawing and comicking.

89
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,560
Guess not. I'm going to try doing this Rebel Pixels thing and try and like review art things and

90
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
talk about art just because I like being an artist and that whole field interests me and like

91
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,200
entrepreneurship. Maybe I'll try starting an email marketing business. I don't really think this is

92
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,480
as hype as all the people making money off of selling courses or online email marketing is

93
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,880
really selling out to me. So now I'm in 3D and I don't think anybody even really knows on the PCP

94
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
that I do 3D because I just looked at like some of the past PCP episodes and they're all linking to

95
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,880
my old channel that's dead and I don't even use anymore. And there are people in the comments

96
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
saying like, well, the only reason Tom's on the PCP is because like he knows these people.

97
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,840
And if he didn't already know them, like they wouldn't give him the time of day and they're

98
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:24,080
right. I don't care what anybody says. They're right. But what I want to do is I want to understand

99
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:34,160
what how my personal brand is being perceived and then fix it so I can more accurately explain

100
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
who I am, what I do and why anyone should care. And I guess maybe that's partially the point of

101
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,080
doing this episode on this topic is to be like, Hey guys, for all like 300 people who listen to this

102
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,880
that care about my personality enough, ironically, probably the 300 people who already know exactly

103
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,120
where I'm at what I'm doing. But just in case there's a little bit of a little bit of dipping in a

104
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,880
little bit of crossing over a little bit of influx, you know, whatever. I'm a 3d boy now.

105
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,000
I've been that since last year. And the beginning of the last year around February is when I started

106
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,880
really focusing solely on doing 3d. I run a blog, polystation2.com, like PlayStation 2,

107
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,240
but Polly's because Polly gods, that's the idea. And the just behind the blog and the website

108
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,840
go to polystation2.com I bought the domain is that it's trying to like capture the aesthetic

109
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,760
of like PlayStation two games, and like, mostly doing fan art stuff right now to kind of build

110
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,000
the brand and like get people interested in it. But that's what I do. Like a lot of people, I guess,

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,040
I don't want to say a lot of people, but like, I look through all the comments on the PCP,

112
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
I try and respond because I think this will probably be a topic in a future wide chamber. I

113
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,800
think we're pretty bad at interacting with audience a lot of the times. I think that's a huge

114
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,680
problem with the PCP in general, is that this kind of meme of like cometer rules is like somehow

115
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,840
amorphed and evolved into like actual disdain for the audience. So I think it's a huge mistake.

116
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,200
That'll be next week's wide chamber. I'll probably get more into that. But because of that,

117
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,120
I try and like, be someone who tries to interact with audience and stuff just because I enjoy

118
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,960
doing that. Probably more than anybody else. Maybe don't quote me on that. I never talked

119
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,960
to anybody about it. But I feel like I try and be a little bit more active and try and talk to

120
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,640
people and definitely respond to questions and stuff when people have them. Because why the

121
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:33,280
fuck not? I don't mind. So I forgot what my main point was. I want my personal brand to be understood.

122
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,520
And that's why I was trying to do this podcast. So maybe people who don't understand who I am

123
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,320
and why I'm still here can understand what I'm trying to do and they can decide for themselves

124
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,880
whether it's interesting or not. So that's what I'm doing. I'm doing low poly, PlayStation 2 style,

125
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
3D models. Right now, I'm definitely still learning this. I've only been doing it for a

126
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,120
little over a year, probably like 13 months now. No, it's, no, it's, it's beginning March,

127
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,960
just 13 months, 13 months. And that's, that's really my big thing, you know, like Ben has his

128
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:11,360
comics, Mage has her animation memes, and I'm doing the 3D. But the interesting thing is that,

129
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,800
like, in addition to the 3D models, I've been trying to, like, talk about 3D in an analytical

130
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,160
fashion on my YouTube channel on Tommy Oliver. So if you go to youtube.com slash C slash Tommy

131
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,200
Oliver, link to all is in the description, if I remember. I have, like, analytical videos breaking

132
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,800
down 3D as a medium, because there's a lot of people who talk shit about, like, 3D anime and

133
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,600
stuff, but they don't understand how 3D works. And they're like, Oh, 3D anime looks like garbage,

134
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,240
but they don't know why. They just say it looks wrong. But now that I like know about 3D, I can

135
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,120
explain why it looks wrong, like the technical reasons that things look different. In addition,

136
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,960
I just like exploring the medium of 3D because I'm in learning mode right now, trying to absorb a

137
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,200
bunch of information and figure out how all these things work. So I want to like, explain that to

138
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:07,520
people. So that's another thing that I do. But the growth has been bad, trying to do that. It

139
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,760
seems that every time I put out one of those videos, I lose subs, I lose, like, 100 to 300

140
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,240
subscribers every time I upload a video. And then if I don't upload for a week, I'll slowly gain

141
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,480
back, like, 50 or so people that upload another video, and then it plummets again. So, like,

142
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,200
it's almost like YouTube is a bad idea. I really like Instagram. I just started using Instagram.

143
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,640
And I know it's like kind of like not cool, like, because we're all like, PCP, art, faggy, kind of

144
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,280
like counter-cultury things. And like Instagram and Facebook are really gay. I don't know anything

145
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,920
about Facebook, but I really like Instagram as a concept, because it lets you separate

146
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,600
your content. Like the interesting thing is like, you know, how Digi has Digibrow. And then you

147
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
have Digibrow After Dark, which is like the more casual vlogging kind of content. And then Digibrow,

148
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,320
the main channel is like, this is where all like the serious analytical shit is. Instagram is set up,

149
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,600
even though it's much shorter form content, it's not a replacement for YouTube. But in terms of

150
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,640
like organization, you don't have to make another thing to like vlog about your niche in addition

151
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,440
to doing like main content, because you have Instagram, like the main Instagram, where you post

152
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,200
your photos and your videos and whatnot. And then you have Instagram Stories, which is kind of like

153
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,360
Snapchat. They expire in like a day. And you can like pin like some of the best moments to your

154
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,920
profile, but these don't show up on your main feed. They're separated. So you can do all your

155
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,080
vlog and casual stuff at Instagram Stories. So you can have one account and you can like

156
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,720
document making stuff without cluttering your main feed of content, which I just think is fucking

157
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,840
dope as shit. And I wish everyone did that. Like Patreon just rolled out like I think called Lens,

158
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,760
which is basically Snapchat built into Patreon, which I think is true. But I think Patreon should

159
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,520
be a social networking platform at all. It should be a payment service. And that's it. The whole

160
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,400
social thing makes no sense to me. I've never had anyone really network with me on Patreon. It just

161
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,000
seems like such a dumb idea. They should just focus on their strengths, which is like taking

162
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,600
people's money and giving it to me, or whatever. YouTube has a community tab thing now, which

163
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,200
kind of works in the same way. You can't upload vlogs and stuff. What you could do is you could

164
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,840
upload vlogs on listed and then post them on the community tab. So they show up in your community

165
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,600
tab for people who want to look at it, but they're not going to be in your main feed with all your

166
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,520
like actual content. So I like this idea, especially on Instagram, because like YouTube

167
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,280
community tab is great, but like it's not integrated very well, like nobody really gets

168
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,120
notifications for it. They kind of show up sporadically, whereas Instagram Stories is like

169
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,240
very much a strong understood part of Instagram now. So you could use stories like people get it,

170
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,960
whereas on YouTube, it's not so much with the community tab. It's still a new feature.

171
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,360
My whole thing is like, I want to communicate my brand effectively. And now that I like have a

172
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,640
direction and like 3d is like, this is what we're doing. This is this is the hill we're dying on.

173
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm growing slowly, but growing on Instagram. I'm growing on Twitter. I'm growing on Tumblr,

174
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,160
not growing on YouTube. And the YouTube videos, the analytical videos are a technically still kind

175
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,400
of off brand, because I do like tutorials, which is fine. And then I do these anal analysis videos,

176
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,800
which aren't really the same thing. They're tangentially related to the topic of making 3d,

177
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,880
but they're not really the same thing. Like one's a creative thing and one's a commentary thing.

178
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,480
So they feel off brand. And every time I post them, they hurt my channel, not help it. And even

179
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,040
more damningly is that I hate doing the work because I hate video editing. So I'm like,

180
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,200
maybe I should just stop making YouTube videos for the time being and just focus on Instagram,

181
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Tumblr and Twitter where I'm actually growing. I'm actually making progress and I'm actually

182
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,400
able to do work on those platforms that I actually enjoy doing because like I try and take Saturdays

183
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,360
to do video stuff because that's whenever we record PCP. So I'm like, well, I'm already going to not

184
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,200
have I'm going to have a block of time or I'm going to have to record PCP. So I might as well take

185
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,000
this entire day and just shotgun as many videos and stuff that I can, but I never get a lot of

186
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,520
stuff done because making videos sucks. It sucks so bad. Like whether it's technical problems,

187
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,720
whether it's things not working or it's just me being miserable, usually all three things just go

188
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,760
really slowly. And so it never just takes that one day, it takes two days or three days. And then

189
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,280
like half my week is dedicated to doing things that aren't helping my brand grow and make me upset.

190
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,240
Seems kind of stupid. I definitely feel like a pressure to be a YouTuber because everybody

191
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,040
I'm friends with is a YouTuber and YouTube is like the big platform and it's helping everybody

192
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,120
else like become rich, become famous, become successful and like building a really strong

193
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
brand and like you listen to anybody who talks about marketing and they're all like,

194
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,800
you've got to be on YouTube. There's no reason not to be on YouTube.

195
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,160
But if YouTube's not working for me, like should I still do it? I don't know. I like Instagram a

196
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,320
lot. I like Twitter a lot, a lot. Twitter is like my favorite social media platform.

197
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,200
Super fucking fun. I don't really know why I like it so much. I just do.

198
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,680
I was thinking maybe taking all these vlog ideas and video essay ideas and just making them regular

199
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,280
essays on medium like maybe I don't know. My whole thing is like personal brand dude. That's

200
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,400
what this episode is going to be. I was actually going to talk about just art, but it's turning

201
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,920
into a branding thing. Personal brand. My personal brand. I want to grow. I want to be a personality.

202
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,320
But that's the interesting thing. And I talked with Mage about this at one point

203
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,240
when we were talking about just PCP stuff in general, because we're both the artists. Ben is

204
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,680
too, but Ben's a bit better at this than me and Mage are. I feel like me and Mage definitely

205
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:51,920
related to this is that we don't have bombastic personas. We want our artwork to do the speaking

206
00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:00,240
for us. Like I'd rather be behind the scenes making cool shit and the cool shit sells me

207
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
instead of me, you know? And like Ben has an interesting personality. So even though he's

208
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,520
doing like the champion and the vapors and they're fucking amazing, like he can he has an

209
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,840
interesting personality just naturally. So like when he talks, like you can get vibes with him

210
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,400
and like he gels off other people really well. Me and Mage less so. Like like I think Mage has

211
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,280
a good personality, but I think she has to like try to like do it. It doesn't come naturally.

212
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,440
Same with me. I have to like sit down like on a pcb episode and like try and project myself and

213
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,080
like try and be a presence and not just fade into the background because that's just my natural state

214
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,160
is like I'd rather just sit down do the work and let what I do define me and not like who I'm acting

215
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:51,600
like. So I try and do these podcasts to help build a personality because now I don't have any

216
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm not competing with anybody else on wide chamber. It's just me. So I don't have like a Nate

217
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,480
Bestman salesman voice that can like hype up anything. I'm just like mumbling and rambling

218
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,520
and getting progressively more buzzed. But I just try and be as real as possible like straight up.

219
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,680
If I have something I want to talk about, even if it's weird or uncomfortable or makes me sound

220
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,520
stupid, I'm just going to let it out anyway because that's the best I know how to communicate

221
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:30,480
who I am and how I be. So yeah, I just want I want anybody who comes to the PCP from outside

222
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,960
even if they don't like what I do. I want to at least make it clear what it is I do so they can

223
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,600
make that decision for themselves. You know, it's becoming very obvious as I dig through comments

224
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,600
and stuff that nobody knows what I do. I'm not communicating it clearly enough. And obviously

225
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,560
just because I've been jumping back and forth but like I think we're set. We're going we're going

226
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,320
into this year on a year. This is like the longest I've actually sat down actually worked on something

227
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,880
consistently. Medium wise in the last couple years 3D seems to be the thing that's clicking for me.

228
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,000
I enjoy it. I like it. I want to keep doing it. So I want that personal brand to to to become

229
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,560
something that is clearly understood. But it's difficult because I'm not a guy commentating

230
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,480
right. So like if you listen to Nate bitch about stuff on on the PCP like you're basically getting

231
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,480
a little preview of what he does because all he does on best guy ever is bitch about shit or hype

232
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,560
shit up. So when you listen to like Digi or you listen to Gibb or you listen to Nate like you're

233
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,080
just getting a preview of what they do on their channel full time. You listen to me bitch. It has

234
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,760
nothing to do with the content that I actually give a fuck about it. It's like I'm not a part of it.

235
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm just a guy behind the scenes pushing vertices and making textures and like saying here don't

236
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,800
look at me. Look at this. Whereas you know Digi Bro is like look at me. I am the product. Whereas

237
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,240
I'm like don't I'm not important. This is look at that. Tell me you like that. Don't tell me you

238
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,800
like me. So and I feel like a lot of the the interest in the PCP is like it's this cult of personality

239
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,680
and people are more interested in in it for the personalities and they don't care as much

240
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,000
for consuming art. They want to consume the personalities like

241
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,280
I think a lot of people are into anime because they like watching the discussion around anime almost

242
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,160
more than they like watching the anime themselves. I think it's I think that is it's not a lot of

243
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,960
people. I think there is like a very dedicated group of people who consider themselves like critics

244
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,920
or pseudo-intellectuals or whatever not to not to disparage anybody because you can like whatever

245
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,680
you want. But I'm saying there is like a group of people I think who watch anime as a prerequisite

246
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,920
to be a part of the discussion of the criticism of anime. And I don't know if that's the PCP

247
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,760
audience because I don't know what anybody does. I don't have enough time to like invest in everyone's

248
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,840
personal profiles or whatever to figure it out. It's kind of creepy if I did.

249
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:15,040
I uh I don't know. I make 3D models. Please pay attention to me. That's that's like the underpinning

250
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,360
cry for attention at this podcast really is. It's that I feel like I get lost in the shuffle

251
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,880
because I've been so disparate and lacking focus and now that I have it it's like too late

252
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,320
for people to understand. It's like I gotta go back to like all 90 something episodes of PCP

253
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,240
and change all the links probably like to my Instagram or my Twitter so people can see the

254
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,960
artwork I'm doing as opposed to like a YouTube channel that doesn't communicate it very effectively

255
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,160
and I don't think is my best work anyway. Oh oh god oh building things online is hard when you're

256
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,240
not an extroverted confident person. It's very hard guys let me let me tell you. Keeping up

257
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,600
keeping up with these guys who who who feel like their shit is the shit when you feel like your

258
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:11,280
shit is shit. Oh boy it's it's tough it's it's a tricky. There's definitely jostling in every

259
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,840
PCP episode like man I gotta be able to say my fucking piece. I gotta be able to say something

260
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,120
witty but I'm not a funny guy. I don't my jokes are very reactionary. You can tell me sit down

261
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,080
and be like Tom tell a joke. I'd be like fuck not funny. I'm not entertaining. 99% of my life

262
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,720
is like sitting behind a laptop screen clicking and that's what I do and I hope the fruits of those

263
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:42,320
clickings take me somewhere and give me something. Oh what was the point? I don't remember what the

264
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:50,960
point was. Let me drink more beer. I had so much fucking rum last night and I didn't even get bugs.

265
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,520
I was so upset. I just wanted the pain of editing to go away and it did.

266
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Um this is like the worst wine chamber yet I feel. Usually when I do a wine chamber I have

267
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,600
like a one specific point I want to hammer away at and then I'm good. This one felt way more all over

268
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,880
the place because I'm talking about myself and again this kind of goes back into what I was just

269
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,360
saying. I don't have that extroverted personality so when I have to talk about myself I fall apart

270
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,800
because like I'm boring. I don't care. I don't care about me. Just just go to instagram.com

271
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,840
slash polystation 2. You'll understand more about me just by looking through those videos than

272
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,880
then you will listen to all these episodes combined. Like that's what I care about.

273
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,800
That's what I want to be known for. I changed patreon.com slash save me. It's patreon.com

274
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,760
slash polystation 2 because I'm sick of my only person. My personality on the pcp has devolved

275
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:53,520
into this guy has a miserable shitty life and he's a joke. I don't want to be a miserable shitty joke.

276
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:02,720
I I freely admit that my situation is not the best but I don't feel sorry for myself. I joke

277
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,320
about being sorry for myself but I think the joke has become my primary defining characteristic.

278
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:17,680
Let me fucking tell you I don't feel sorry for myself. I made mistakes. I have suffered and

279
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,360
fucked myself over because I don't have confidence in myself and I've let other people make decisions

280
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:31,600
for me and I fucking put myself in this position but it's my responsibility and my interest in

281
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,760
digging myself out of the shithole and becoming the best person on this podcast becoming the most

282
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,200
successful person making more money than everybody on here because despite the fact that I self

283
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,520
depreciate all the time I think the work that I do is way more interesting than when everybody else

284
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,880
on this fucking podcast does because criticism is gay and making things is by default more valuable

285
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,720
and commentating on things so despite the fact that I kind of mope around and have become this

286
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,760
caricature of myself saying oh woe is me patreon.com so I save me I'm poor and fucked up I still think

287
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,600
that my shit's more interesting and more valuable than anything anybody else does in this goddamn

288
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,200
fucking channel except for mage and ben because they're both doing art too so they're excluded from

289
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,160
that rant but that's the whole thing and munchy investigator come on munchy you promised me you

290
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,920
let me see whips like fucking a month ago and I still haven't seen him I still haven't seen him

291
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,800
okay fuck I don't know why I'm getting more like buzz off of this stout than I did on like

292
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,840
shotgunning rom yesterday maybe I'm just still really tired I don't fucking know dude

293
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,600
I don't want to be I want to have a personal brand I want to like have a good personality and I want

294
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,000
to be known for like my artwork and I'm sick of being a fucking uh sad sorry I don't want anyone

295
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,080
to be sorry for me fuck you if you're sorry for me I don't I don't want to be sorry for me I don't

296
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,880
want anyone else to be sorry for me if you donate to my patreon I want you to be like man patreon.com

297
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,240
slash save me like this guy's got a shitty life I'm gonna give him a dollar because he needs it

298
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,280
more than me no I want you to be like patreon.com slash polystation too this guy is totally zeroing

299
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,680
in on my nostalgia the fucking fos from Hoseki no Kuni designed to look like a PlayStation 2

300
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,800
character straight out of like Xeno Saga that's fucking dope like I'll give you five dollars

301
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,120
you're the coolest that's what I want that's what I want my personal brand to be I don't want to be

302
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,560
the sorry parody of myself fuck that

303
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,000
sometimes I feel shitty because Nate and Digi have more money and more patrons and more all

304
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,960
that shit and more subscribers but I would hate to have subscribers and money for the work that

305
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,000
they do why because I did when I did my little pony and I was miserable and it felt disgusting so

306
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,840
fuck that I don't I don't want to do reviews and there's also why maybe I shouldn't do these analysis

307
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,000
videos on youtube even though I feel like they're more valuable because at least I'm interested

308
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,160
in the subject matter but even if they took off like let's say why 3d anime sucks got like 10

309
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,760
million views today like while I'm recording this and I got a million subscribers all those people

310
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,600
they wouldn't care about polystation 2 they wouldn't care about the animation and the 3d graphics

311
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,840
I'm doing they just want more analysis they probably just want more analysis on anime in general

312
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,040
and I I know so no

313
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,400
I think I think this podcast is over I feel like I'm just rambling now but that

314
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,640
go check out my work that matters understand if you've been confused about my personal brand I

315
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:47,840
am a 3d artist I'm gonna do lots of cool 3d shit and my personal belief is that the worst piece of

316
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:56,080
art is more inherently valuable than the best analytical video ever made by by context of the

317
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,560
medium it's in fight me if you want if you want more description on that let me know maybe I'll

318
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,920
do a wine chamber on that opinion but no I don't feel sorry for myself don't feel sorry for me

319
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:23,680
okay good good bye
