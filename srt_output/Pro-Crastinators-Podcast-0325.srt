1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, that's the start of the episode. Go!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello everybody and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, the only show where topics go to die.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Excellent start, excellent start.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Guests, keep it going, keep it going.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hi, I'm a guest, holy shit, I never paint. I paint.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's true.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Also, I have with me, right next to me, Asha A.M. Hello.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She also paints.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Never paint and Asha A.M.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, yes, I have seen both of your art on Twitter and elsewhere.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You two are, I've seen your usernames around for years and years at this point.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We met at Dating Sim back in the day, many eons ago.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Right.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Back before things got weird.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You both, I'm sorry, did you say the Dating Sim was before it got weird?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, shit got weird.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I met the world, I met like the pandemic started, I think, wait, did it?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, the pandemic started, S.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, it was pre, that was pre-pandemic.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, it was.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It released in the first week.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because it was pre-radcon.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, it was pre-radcon four.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Actually, yeah.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because radcon four caused the pandemic.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, yes, we all know.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
As, you know, if you've read, you know, anyone who's, wait, did I, did I publish, anyone

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
who's purchased Road to Radcon has read the backstory and knows that coronavirus came from,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that cold corona was transformed in a horrific accident involving super aids, ISIS, and other

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
things that I can't remember at the moment.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think there was a Lovecraft squid involved.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We guess that all along, we didn't even have to read it.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That was clear.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We knew it deep in our hearts.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Some twists, yeah.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But yeah, you, right, I forgot, you both wrote for the, well, you did art.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I did art hero.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You both did art.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I did art and writing.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You did art as well.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And more or less directed.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You became the director.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, co-director, I guess, together with Chip Weisman.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, to keep everything together for these grueling 18 months of production.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, it's funny that I've enjoyed the game and it's like, wow, this cool thing just suddenly

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
appeared.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I never really asked anyone involved what the process was like.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've heard that it was a bit of a nightmare because, of course, it would be such a large

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
project and so many things going on.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But what's the story, huh?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I mean, this is an interview now.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, cool.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I guess.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We did have an interview thing on the PCP channel like two years ago with Nathan.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh my God, I forgot.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm so embarrassed.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, it's all right.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I remember, I'm sure I've forgotten some bits of it, but I remember listening to it.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, if you want to say anything about that.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, I mean, I think it just started in the game launch.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I guess we'll link in the description.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Link in the description to the dating sim for anyone that hasn't played it.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And also, we can link to that interview.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you want to recapture the aesthetic and the feeling of the PCP from like three to

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
like six years ago, play that game.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a time capsule.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It will never be relevant again.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was only relevant at like one specific time in history.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You know, okay, have I mentioned on the podcast before that I conscripted several of you,

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the PCP dating sim guys to write the dojin.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Have I mentioned that?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm pretty sure you have mentioned it.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Have I made that?

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You might have.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, that's true.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's true.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, it's you.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I asked you guys, since you guys did such a great job making the dating sim and it was

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
very funny, I thought there would be no one else.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I thought it would be a good pool to draw from for people who wanted to write some funny

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
gag strips for the dojin and it was you and Chip Wiseman and Ouroborista.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Right?

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's the name.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That was already a year ago, I think.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Almost a year ago.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It was already a year ago.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, I know.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But you've seen that I've been posting.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, they've been looking great.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A drinking moth has picked up the slack and has been making more pages and they look really good.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know, one thing that I appreciate, especially, I'm remembering, I read the script when you

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
gave it to me, but seeing the pages that they're coming out, one thing that I really appreciate

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is that there are jokes in the dojin that specifically reference the fact that by the

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
time the dojin was written, the PCP as it existed at the time of Radcon 4 was dead and

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
had completely changed.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Like reading the dojin, it's written for a post PCP.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a post PCP world, basically.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, it's like a combination of making fun of what's going on right now and how everything

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
has changed, but also capturing some nostalgia for the good old times.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, come back.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't know.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I wrote that little snippet of you getting tentacle molested by your tentacle crew.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Collapse.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There was just...

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Rearadno.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There was just remembering the good old snotlock times.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, those were good old times.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,500
I meant to do another one and I've had other things occupying me and so I have not gotten

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:21,000
around to my next snotlock, which I had plans for and they have been pushed back and pushed

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
back.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What would it be?

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Would it be another Pokemon?

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Yeah, I wanted to do Platinum and I had some story elements, I had some ideas for it.

121
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
I never played Platinum.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,860
And you know, without spoiling anything, I will say that if those were to be relevant,

123
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,420
I would probably have to do it before 2024.

124
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
There's a time limit.

125
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
There's a deadline.

126
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,500
Are they making a remake?

127
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,220
No, that's not why.

128
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,660
Why 2024?

129
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,220
I'm not telling why.

130
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,940
You'll just have to guess.

131
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,580
There are externalities.

132
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,360
There are externalities in the real world that would make the ideas that I had for the

133
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:22,040
plot of my theoretical next snotlock obsolete if I did it post 2024.

134
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,280
I wonder what the fuck could be happening on such a year.

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I don't know.

136
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Could it be the Olympics?

137
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
No.

138
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Could it be the FIFA football?

139
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
No.

140
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,560
Well, I just don't know then.

141
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,780
Could it be the terrorist attack that I have planned out?

142
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,780
In Minecraft.

143
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,780
In Minecraft, guys.

144
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,780
Of course not.

145
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Of course not.

146
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Of course not.

147
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:53,540
Anyway, I just wanted to give you kudos on the script and I am really looking forward

148
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
to it being done.

149
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Do the same.

150
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,540
It is coming along again.

151
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,380
It was in production hell for a long time, but it will, it is getting there.

152
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
At long last.

153
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
It's very exciting.

154
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,380
Did he plan?

155
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:12,240
He got us to Drinking Month for being a, yes, yes queen, yes queen, slay, slay.

156
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm happy that still people out there, like new people coming in, making fan art and sending

157
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,720
it through voicemails, like, I don't know, that's, this is great.

158
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm glad that the short period where the PCP had a voice, no, it had a fan art section

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,680
just got returned by the voicemailers.

160
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,220
There was this in 2018, there were like a few episodes where you did like a little fan

161
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:44,060
art thing, where you showed fan art that people drew and then you stopped.

162
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,660
Because I don't, I don't remember that.

163
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
Yeah.

164
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
No, we did do that.

165
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,380
I think it was, I can't remember the reasoning, but it was something to do with it being like,

166
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,060
there's not that much fan art.

167
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,540
So making a whole like thing about it would be like, I don't know, some days we just wouldn't

168
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
have any.

169
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,520
Maybe like the fan art was exploding around the time just because you did that.

170
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,160
Were those, those must have been in the Nate days, right?

171
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I mean, of course.

172
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Yeah.

173
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Oh, of course.

174
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Yeah.

175
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,760
Nate was always so like, so rigid about like the, it like, it's structured, like if there's

176
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,200
a segment like the segment, the segment format must be adhered to, the topics must be, the

177
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
topics must be obeyed.

178
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,000
I think the actual problem was that you also did the theme song contest at the same time

179
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,340
and also still had to ask PCP.

180
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,920
So yet three little segments and you just got annoyed by that or something.

181
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,420
Too many segments.

182
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
Very annoying.

183
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Very annoying.

184
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Yeah.

185
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
And they were, yeah.

186
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:51,340
It's, it's just, I think it should have been definitely allocated just like the fan moment.

187
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,340
Let's look at fan stuff.

188
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
We got some questions.

189
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,500
We got some video, some audio.

190
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Yeah.

191
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Got a picture or two.

192
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,760
They validate us for our existence, for our stupid podcast that has been going for years

193
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
and years, which is very odd.

194
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
What can I say?

195
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Odd, but I appreciate it.

196
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
What else would I draw to?

197
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Like I need something.

198
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:25,800
I, you know, not, not to be a, well, I don't know if it would be a downer, but I guess

199
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,840
in podcast news, in terms of like blasts from the past, from the PCP history, did you, did

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,860
anyone see a DeVoo, DeVoo's tweet the other day?

201
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I don't think so.

202
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,380
I saw you respond to it.

203
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Made me mad.

204
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
Made me mad.

205
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,780
Something about like the being in the Christian lecture and disavowing it or their involvement

206
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
of DeVoo.

207
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,780
DeVoo, DeVoo.

208
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
Yeah.

209
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:56,020
Basically DeVoo disavowed her involvement in the lecture because of, because it's mean

210
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,840
or something like that, I don't know.

211
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,720
Something stupid, some dumb shit made me, it was annoying.

212
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
It was annoying.

213
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,200
It's, it's, it's meaningless, but it's annoying and I don't like it.

214
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:18,560
I never felt that bad about those lectures because like in terms of, of Christian stuff,

215
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,800
it was more lighthearted and less like spiteful and like toxic than other things I've seen

216
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:35,180
I really think that I was not, that I was, that I tried not to be like particularly venomous.

217
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,060
Like I pretty much used kid gloves through the whole thing as far as I'm concerned.

218
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:48,060
I'll also say someone posted for me a screenshot of someone in, in someone asked DeVoo on Discord

219
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,740
like, Hey, what's up with that?

220
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,800
DeVoo explained her feelings about it and she said that she had not only not recently

221
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,480
watched the video, she had never watched the video back.

222
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,240
She just remembered sitting in it and she explained what she thought the problem with

223
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
the lecture was and I'm not kidding.

224
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Yeah.

225
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,120
She never watched it.

226
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,960
She never watched it back, but she explained what she thought the problem was and her problem

227
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,680
with it basically is that the story of Chris Chen is a story about Chris getting harassed.

228
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,940
So it's basically like, you know, you know that, that, that list that's been going around

229
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,220
Twitter, I've seen people talking about that list of problematic authors.

230
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,620
I have heard it, but I haven't seen it.

231
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,220
I haven't seen it, but I get the impression from what people say about it, that it's stuff

232
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:45,340
like, that it's, it's stuff like fucking catcher in the rye is on there because like Holden

233
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,320
Caulfield is like a jerk and misogynist and stuff.

234
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:57,040
And he like stuff like that, you know, it's like, it's like, it's like problematic because

235
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,520
they wrote about a character who is flawed and like that flaw is a problem, right?

236
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,040
That's basically DeVoo's problem is that the story of Chris Chan is sad because people

237
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,320
were mean to Chris.

238
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,160
So it's bad to be in a lecture where I talk about how that happened, do a, I mean, I,

239
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:23,660
I will say that a lot of the part of Chris Chan is that the harassment is, it's like a

240
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:31,900
disabled person who can't deal well with bullying is like very funny when the bullies bully her.

241
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,020
So it creates a cycle.

242
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,580
And like, you could argue that playing into that cycle at all is not moral, I guess.

243
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,520
Hmm.

244
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Well, like, you could.

245
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,560
Yeah, I don't think if you were a pussy.

246
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,480
Yeah.

247
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,600
I mean, there's, there's an argument there.

248
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,680
I don't particularly think it's worth me disavowing my sitting in watching somebody talk

249
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,080
about it.

250
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,560
I don't feel bad.

251
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,320
I don't feel bad in the slightest.

252
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,920
That's it.

253
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,960
I think the thing I get that like people who make content about Christian can be like real

254
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,540
assholes about it and don't have the nuance of realizing this is like a kind of fucked up

255
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,060
thing the internet did.

256
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:27,540
But I think in comparison to yours was a bit more not, I don't, you were more focused on

257
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,460
the comics and also it's not like you weren't like the other people who just say, oh, Chris

258
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,140
is a bad person who deserves to get misgendered.

259
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,120
I think, I mean, I, you know, I did misgender Chris in that first video, and it was, and

260
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,080
it was out of, it was out of talking cast sense on my own part.

261
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,520
Yeah.

262
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, it's because I didn't, I didn't really understand because I hadn't really like read

263
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,000
up on like recent Chris.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,200
I mostly knew Chris from when I had read about her like in the old days.

265
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,500
And I was, I was mostly just going on what I remembered.

266
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,140
And when I read the quickie to, you know, find out, you know, new developments, you

267
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,580
know, the quickie always says he, and so I just, I just kind of did that because I sort

268
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:23,220
of didn't didn't really look into it and then the content is from people who don't have

269
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,220
enough empathy to some degree.

270
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,060
No, the quickie, the quickie is written by bad, the quickie is written by bad people.

271
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,340
Who like went out their way to get all this information are really bad people, but it's

272
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,620
really interesting to learn about Christian.

273
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,260
Like I fell down a hole, I think like last year.

274
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,100
It's, it's, it was my bad.

275
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,300
It was my bad to take their word about that was my, that was my error.

276
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,420
But so, you know, but that was a mistake.

277
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,140
But shit, where was I going with that?

278
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:09,440
Um, yeah, I, uh, I, I think I like, I feel, I think that I feel, I felt a lot of empathy

279
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,920
with Chris.

280
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,760
I mostly saw Chris as a sort of harmless kook who is not really hurting anyone.

281
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,760
And I think I made that point clear many times in that lecture that like, Chris doesn't

282
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,240
really deserve to be harassed.

283
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,000
Bad things happen to her.

284
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,240
She was harassed.

285
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,040
It's not good that those things happened.

286
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
But here are some funny things that she said.

287
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,220
Uh, here are some, uh, here are some, here are some, here's some facts about her life as

288
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,180
related to the comic was hurt in the making of this story about Christian, but would you

289
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,340
like to hear the story?

290
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,100
Right.

291
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,900
It's really good.

292
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
It's a funny story.

293
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:54,100
I will not, I will not, I will restrain myself from, uh, exploding.

294
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,400
I will restrain myself from giving a full explanation of what I think about DeVoo as

295
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,240
a human being.

296
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,840
Uh, I will, I will, I will simply not simply see those teeth.

297
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,920
Yes.

298
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,720
Oh yeah.

299
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,880
Oh, they're grinding.

300
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,440
All right.

301
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,440
You don't have to burn everything down all the time.

302
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,400
Just reserve it on Sunday.

303
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,080
Oh, wait, it's Sunday.

304
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,200
No, wait, no, it is Sunday.

305
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,040
Sorry, sorry, sorry, loser.

306
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,640
I mean, there's like, you know, there's like, you could wish that you changed, like, didn't

307
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,440
say things in a certain way, but you don't have to like, throw out the whole, uh, pot.

308
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,320
Right.

309
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,840
I, I don't understand.

310
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,440
You know, DeVoo messaged me a while ago and basically said the same thing.

311
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,520
Like, Hey, Ben, uh, I'm thinking of posting on the internet again.

312
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,440
And I just want you to know that I kind of don't like that I was in that lecture and

313
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,060
I got mad and I said, why are you telling me this?

314
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,660
Like, I don't care.

315
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,020
She, she, she worries so much about it and nobody would care.

316
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Like, she's so worried about it.

317
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,660
And you know, it's really, I got to say, it's really self absorbed of her to even

318
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,820
think anyone gives a shit that she was in the audience.

319
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,700
I get, I get why nobody cares.

320
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,220
Man, she wanted to disassociate from his lectures completely.

321
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,180
Like that's, yeah, that's completely reasonable.

322
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,420
But that one's fair enough because he was the one doing it.

323
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,500
But DeVoo was just sitting there.

324
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,420
She was just, I mean, fucking.

325
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Uh, mother's basement was in the audience and like mother's basement is not

326
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,680
having a fucking, we also have us having a fucking nobody.

327
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Nobody gives a shit.

328
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,040
Nobody just wait until Jeff, just wait until Jeff's runs for senator and

329
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,160
then they'll pick up the PCP episodes and then he'll be fucking ruined.

330
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,400
Have me executed.

331
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,840
Yeah.

332
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Uh, oh, well, you know, that's, that's, that's life.

333
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,140
So, so Ash and me have been listening to, uh, Chris story that podcast, uh, by

334
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,300
Asteris and Sri Lanka about the entire story of Chris Chan.

335
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,180
And I want to ask you, Ben, they said, they, they said they were going to have

336
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,900
been on an episode, I think you're both like, you're both just being like, Hey,

337
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,980
I'm wondering when that person's going to come on it.

338
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,060
And you're just kind of a standstill.

339
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,580
Someone needs to go.

340
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,140
Hey, they keep saying it every few episodes that that's going to happen at some point.

341
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,280
They want to, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't really talked to either of them

342
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
in, in quite a while.

343
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,360
You know, I think the plan might have been that I would be on like a live episode.

344
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,800
Like I think at some point they were planning on like traveling to the area.

345
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,120
And then it was like, okay, I'll be on an episode in person and then COVID

346
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,720
happened and then travel plans all stopped.

347
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,320
And so I think that might have, uh, down to go to Boston.

348
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:48,700
Well, I mean, I would be on an episode, I'd be on that any, any time I was invited.

349
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Okay, I'll tell Sirius myself.

350
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
I think he follows me.

351
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Yeah. I mean, does he?

352
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Yeah, he follows me on Twitter.

353
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh, that's cool.

354
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
He follows me too.

355
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Uh, he's, uh, okay.

356
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,300
Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't, I mean, okay, I would like to be on, I'd like to do this.

357
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
That sounds like fun.

358
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,280
It is just fun hearing Sirius be very disgusted and distressed by everything Sirius tells him.

359
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Um,

360
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Right. Sirius, Sirius, like is the one that knows stuff and is like explaining.

361
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Yeah.

362
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Basically, yeah.

363
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Okay.

364
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
I, I, I haven't actually listened to it myself.

365
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Uh, I, I know what it's about.

366
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Cause I mean, I'm already, I know everything.

367
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Yeah, of course.

368
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I don't need, I don't need to be educated.

369
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,260
It's fun watching a older man be horrified.

370
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
By the horrors of the internet.

371
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Just, just horrified.

372
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
Just in general.

373
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Yeah.

374
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,260
How old is, how old are you?

375
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
He just turned 40.

376
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,260
What's he like, 40?

377
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
He just turned 40.

378
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
It's basically dead.

379
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Okay.

380
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
I would, I would have thought he was maybe like,

381
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,260
He's younger than Dan ever, Dan, I think.

382
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Yeah.

383
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,260
I don't, I don't think I like Dan.

384
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,260
I don't think I like that he exists.

385
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
That he exists?

386
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Are you gonna do something about it?

387
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Maybe, maybe I will.

388
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
You know, maybe I will.

389
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,260
You could complain about him on your podcast.

390
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,260
I, yeah, I don't have any specific grievances.

391
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I just kind of think I don't like his vibe.

392
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
And that's all I got.

393
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Well, that's where the world stayed.

394
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
Okay.

395
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Uh, true.

396
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Um, shit.

397
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Well, what else is going on?

398
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,260
I have just got back, this is the reason I've been on the last episode is I just got back

399
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,260
from a family holiday with the dog at, at Bog Neregis.

400
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Just the dog?

401
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
You?

402
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
No, the family.

403
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,260
Why do you go, why do you go to all these places with silly names?

404
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
The Agunary and the, and the Bog Neregis.

405
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Bog Neregis is a very silly name.

406
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Agunary is also a very silly thing name.

407
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,260
But, uh, I don't know.

408
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
It's the UK.

409
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
What do you want?

410
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Everything silly over here.

411
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Going to the old, the old, the old cobbler down to the cobbler down on the, the Haberdasher

412
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Street and an old, an old London town.

413
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Okay.

414
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
That's the silliest thing I could think of.

415
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
Beans, beans on toast.

416
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Beans on cobblestone.

417
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Yes.

418
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
Delicious.

419
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Uh, yeah, but that was nice.

420
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,260
It's the seaside town.

421
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Um, when I say with the dog, it's like every so often my family wants to take the dog with them on holiday instead of just going on holiday without him.

422
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Um, but obviously he's a dog and he's very wriggly and he very hard to control so we can't just go anywhere.

423
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,260
So it's usually a local place and this time it's, you know, a beach.

424
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:56,260
So he's running around on the beach, doesn't understand seawater, would splash in the seawater and lie down to keep cool.

425
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,260
Get a mouthful of seawater and then pick it up later because he didn't know it was bad.

426
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,260
So classic stupid dog stuff and it was great.

427
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
That's, that's sweet.

428
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Uh, how old's the dog?

429
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
He's pretty young, right?

430
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,260
You just got him like a couple years ago.

431
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:21,260
He's like, yeah, he's all, I think he's four or five and we've had him since he was a tiny baby puppy the size of a tennis ball.

432
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,260
Aw.

433
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
Geez.

434
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,260
He's so cute and he's, he's a good boy.

435
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
It's funny that I say tennis ball because he loves tennis ball.

436
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
He's always got a tennis ball in his mouth.

437
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,260
It reminds him of himself as a young good dog.

438
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Uh, um.

439
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Yeah, I basically just wanted to mention Bognoregis because Bognoregis is such a silly name and I like saying it.

440
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
The name is wonderful.

441
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
The name of a town?

442
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah, Bognoregis.

443
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,260
You would think it's a swamp, but no.

444
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Yeah, no, definitely.

445
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
The ocean's just the biggest swamp.

446
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Well, I've been, I've been frantically working, trying to get my secret video project recorded before I move.

447
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm moving at the end of the month.

448
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:20,260
Actually, I'm moving on the, I have to move out on the 30th instead of the 31st because my lease is fucked up.

449
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,260
I think my landlord was trying to trick me, trying to trap me into staying too late so she didn't, wouldn't have to give me my security.

450
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I really, I genuinely think it was a trap, but I'm not going to fall for it.

451
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,260
But I'm, I'm scrambling.

452
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,260
So I have, oh God, I have only nine days left.

453
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:47,260
It sounds like nine days to record.

454
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,260
But to get ready to record and then to record.

455
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
Yeah.

456
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
I don't know.

457
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
It sounds like a lot of time.

458
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
You also have to pack and stuff.

459
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
Get your stuff ready.

460
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Yeah, I do.

461
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,260
I have to hire a van to get everything.

462
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,260
I do have to arrange for a truck.

463
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,260
I have to arrange for a truck.

464
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:14,260
And then I have to figure out what I'm going to do because I have to be out on the 30th and I can't move in until the first.

465
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:23,260
So I'm going to have to find accommodations for two nights and I'll probably have to park the truck somewhere.

466
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,260
So I'll have to rent it for three days.

467
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
Yeah.

468
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
It's, it's, and I have to.

469
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,260
So I have to sort all that out in the next nine days or so.

470
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,260
Okay, but what if you just put your bed in the truck and sleep in the truck?

471
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Your bed's already in there, right?

472
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,260
It would be dark in there.

473
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
It'd be like camping.

474
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,260
It'd be like, it's like a big metal tent.

475
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
Bring a flashlight.

476
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
Oh God.

477
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,260
Bring some slime that I feel like glows green.

478
00:25:53,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Yeah, bring my jug of fluorescent slime and my black light to illuminate.

479
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,260
To read by slime light.

480
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,260
All the blood stains all over the truck.

481
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,260
Illuminated, yeah.

482
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Okay, well that's, well that's a, anyway, so all that, yeah.

483
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:25,260
Nine day, nine days to record a video sounds like a lot of time, but I have things I want to get ready and I don't know if they're ready and I don't,

484
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,260
I don't know if it's going to take me one or two or three or four days to get them ready.

485
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:38,260
And then I don't know how many days it's going to take me on top of that to be doing all these preparations and stuff and sorting shit out.

486
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
And I don't even know, it's really late.

487
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,260
I'm really late to getting a truck.

488
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,260
Like I've left it way too long and it's a big problem and I might be fucked.

489
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:52,260
I'm sure I can figure something out, but I should not have waited this long to get a truck.

490
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
Do it right after the recording.

491
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Yeah, that would be the smartest thing to do.

492
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
But would it be what Ben St. would do?

493
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Yeah, but you know, historically, I have not done that.

494
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
So what are the odds I'm going to do at this time?

495
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Wait, if you know the exact time you need to go, just call a thing now.

496
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,260
Well, not now, but like after the podcast.

497
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:25,260
Look, all I'm saying is that I might, I don't know, there's a chance that I might call up every U-Haul in town and they might all be like,

498
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,260
nah, we don't have any trucks.

499
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Nah, it's too late.

500
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
It is summer.

501
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
People are moving.

502
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,260
It's summer and yeah, start of September is when everybody moves.

503
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,260
That's the busiest time.

504
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,260
So like, no, I really fucked up.

505
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
I've really fucked myself.

506
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
I don't know.

507
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Time to build a truck.

508
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
I don't know exactly how fucked I am.

509
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
Do you have a large wheelbarrow?

510
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,260
100%.

511
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,260
Do you have like a really huge piece of like polka dot red?

512
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Red with white polka dot like fabric and a long stick.

513
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,260
You could like have everything like sling it over your shoulder.

514
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Oh, you know, just call an Uber and let them drive back and forth a few times.

515
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
That'd be so expensive.

516
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Yes.

517
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:15,260
No, it wouldn't work because I can't move in until two days later.

518
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Oh yeah, right.

519
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
You dingus.

520
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Yeah.

521
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Can't move in until first.

522
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,260
Take it straight to wherever the heck you're staying.

523
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
I just need, I need to get it.

524
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,260
I need to get a big truck by some somehow.

525
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,260
Somehow I need to get one and I need to have it for two days, maybe three days.

526
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,260
And then everything's all that's all I need.

527
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
That's all I need.

528
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Is it going to be easy?

529
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
Well, good luck with that.

530
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
So easy.

531
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,260
Yeah, I would prioritize figuring that out before recording whatever the thing.

532
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Yeah.

533
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
You're right.

534
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Because even if I don't get it recorded before I move, like it's kind of fine and doesn't matter.

535
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:57,260
I just wanted to, you know, like I sort of set myself a deadline and I'm like, I don't

536
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,260
want to miss my deadline because like keeping deadlines is how you get things done.

537
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Yeah.

538
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:10,260
But I mean, yeah, like whatever, that's just a psychological trick and things that are

539
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
in your mind aren't real.

540
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
You don't easily get tricked by yourself.

541
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
No.

542
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,260
You don't have to fall for it.

543
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
I don't.

544
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
I don't get tricked by myself.

545
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
I can't trick myself into doing things.

546
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,260
And that's why I don't do as many things as I should do.

547
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,260
You trick yourself into not doing anything.

548
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Because I'm so smart.

549
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,260
And I think that's just me trying to trick myself into being productive.

550
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,260
But I know better.

551
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
I won't fall for it.

552
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,260
And I'm too clever.

553
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Yeah.

554
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,260
So I've been scrambling.

555
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,260
I've been scrambling with that and it sucks.

556
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
Shitty week.

557
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
Shitty week, all things considered.

558
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,260
No.

559
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,260
We had a really great week.

561
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,260
We've got another shitty week coming up.

562
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
Oh, well, good for you.

563
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,260
I'm so happy for you.

564
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,260
We had all our friends over from the sketchy peoples.

565
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,260
Not all of them, but everyone who could make it.

566
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,260
And we had a big old meetup at my place for like a whole week.

567
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,260
Do you guys all live in like a similar area?

568
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
Absolutely not.

569
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Yeah.

570
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
Who could make it?

571
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Well, James came from Madrid.

572
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
James Tolbert.

573
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
Exactly.

574
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,260
The very one and only.

575
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,260
I know him.

576
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,260
Stefan Tantana from Austria.

577
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
The artist, right?

578
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,260
The artist almost became PCP editor back in the day.

579
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,260
Oh, that's right.

580
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,260
Back when he was green flowers.

581
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,260
Green fleshy flowers.

582
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Oh.

583
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Did he make, he made the one that was all the TV screens?

584
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,260
Exactly.

585
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
Yeah.

586
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,260
And we used this kind of a similar thing for the sketchy people later.

587
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,260
I think I pushed for him.

588
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
I did like that.

589
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,260
I really liked that sketchy like CRT monitor setup.

590
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,260
Yeah.

591
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Yeah.

592
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:14,260
He's a professional animator, boy now working for ads and stuff.

593
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,260
Rules.

594
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
Wait, who else made it?

595
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Oh yeah, Alex.

596
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,260
Alex C. Bell.

597
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,260
The music boy.

598
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
Is that Alex SSSS?

599
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
Yes.

600
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
Yes.

601
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Exactly.

602
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Where is he from?

603
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Germany as well.

604
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
Yeah.

605
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,260
The very other side of Germany from where I live.

606
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
And me.

607
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
And you.

608
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,260
Are you two like roommates?

609
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
No.

610
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
No.

611
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,260
We're just dating.

612
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Oh, okay.

613
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,260
I see.

614
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
So are you just visiting?

615
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Yeah.

616
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,260
Or do you work together?

617
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,260
No.

618
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
Okay.

619
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,260
No, we have some very city long distance thing going on.

620
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
Oh, damn.

621
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
Yeah.

622
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
That's pretty far.

623
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
Yeah.

624
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Yes.

625
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
Very.

626
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Like we've been together for like two and a half years now and we first met each

627
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,260
other last Christmas.

628
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
In person.

629
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
Yeah.

630
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Yeah.

631
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,260
In person.

632
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Because the pandemic kind of just prevented everything.

633
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Like restrictions were pretty bad for a long time.

634
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
At least on the Canadian side.

635
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,260
And also I had to run away from home first.

636
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Yeah.

637
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,260
Is that true?

638
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Yes.

639
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,260
Well, what?

640
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Is that a thing you can talk about?

641
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
Yes.

642
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:44,260
I don't know the sum it up really other than my family's like weirdly controlling.

643
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Okay.

644
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,260
My mom's a weirdo.

645
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
Yeah.

646
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:56,260
And she took advantage of a lot of me being sick to like make me dependent.

647
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Hmm.

648
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
And then.

649
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Sounds not good.

650
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Yeah.

651
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
And.

652
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Sounds not the best.

653
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Plus I like going against kind of my religious background.

654
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:16,260
So, you know, like there's no way I would have been able to just go to Germany and see

655
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
never paint.

656
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Hmm.

657
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,260
So I am and also just living them stressed me out.

658
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,260
And so I secretly moved out.

659
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
Okay.

660
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,260
Ran away.

661
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
You left.

662
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
You left a dump.

663
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
You left a ninja log decoy.

664
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
I did.

665
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,260
And one day your mom is going to throw a kunai at it and it's going to poo.

666
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
Shit.

667
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
Tricked.

668
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Very nice.

669
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Impressive.

670
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,260
Impressive Jutsu.

671
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:53,260
No, I literally just like went through all my stuff took the bare minimum necessities

672
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
I needed.

673
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
Hmm.

674
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,260
And like gone Uber and just hauled.

675
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
Oh my God.

676
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
Wait, so where did you go?

677
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,260
I just know I just moved to like an apartment.

678
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,260
Hmm.

679
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,260
Like I've just prepared all this in secret.

680
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Yeah.

681
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Yeah, I see.

682
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
I see.

683
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,260
And then they didn't and they like don't know where you're at.

684
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,260
Well, I let my sister know at this point because I trust her.

685
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,260
But like, I'm used to tell really anybody.

686
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,260
Yeah.

687
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Where I am.

688
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
Yeah.

689
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,260
I'm just like, I'm just going to stay away.

690
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
Yeah.

691
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,260
Got to do what you got to do.

692
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:40,260
And then I had to like demand my IDs back because my mom kept them all in safe.

693
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,260
Oh, got to have your IDs.

694
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,260
Yeah, I mean, that's a serious situation.

695
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
That's a bummer.

696
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
Yeah.

697
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Good for you to get out of there.

698
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Yeah.

699
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,260
I could probably I probably could write a comic about it someday.

700
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
But it's a story.

701
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
It is a tale.

702
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
That's what all artists thought about.

703
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,260
And then I got as soon as a guy, I'm like, let's get ready for Christmas.

704
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
Let's go.

705
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,260
I mean, that was like, all right.

706
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,260
That was, yeah, that that had to happen before you two could meet.

707
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
I understand.

708
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Yeah.

709
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,260
Yeah.

710
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
Yeah.

711
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,260
Gotcha.

712
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Gotcha.

713
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Yeah.

714
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,260
But very, very lucky that that all worked out now.

715
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:31,260
And also that Asha could also meet some of her other friends besides me in real life finally.

716
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:38,260
It's annoying how you like make friends through internet podcasts.

717
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,260
And then they are like all over the world.

718
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:47,260
You meet the best people in the world and then they're all really far away.

719
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Yep.

720
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Yeah.

721
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
True.

722
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
True.

723
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Still a problem for me.

724
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
Yeah.

725
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Yeah.

726
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,260
I guess there are a few people around that I could visit in the UK.

727
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,260
And you know, Europe is not very far away.

728
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,260
But Boston is like the hub.

729
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,260
That's where I need to go for like maximum like, oh my God.

730
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:15,260
But also you really wouldn't want to move to the US though because that sounds like a hellhole.

731
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,260
It's not that bad.

732
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,260
It's not that bad.

733
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:28,260
It's scary with all the news of like, I don't know, rising like completely bloodthirsty

734
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,260
transphobia in war.

735
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,260
Sure.

736
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Like that's a little scary.

737
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Yeah.

738
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
But what are you going to do?

739
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
What are you going to do?

740
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,260
You know, you got to take the good with the bad sometimes.

741
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,260
I'll just come over and I'll like I'll buy a gun because that's easy to do and I'll just

742
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
defend myself.

743
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,260
Exactly.

744
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,260
Easy peasy.

745
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,260
You're sounding like an American already.

746
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,260
I mean, Massachusetts is not really America.

747
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,260
It's basically like Europe, but on the other side of the ponds.

748
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,260
I guess it's the only part that is not completely spoiled yet, maybe one of the few parts.

749
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
No, we're good.

750
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
I swear, I promise.

751
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:12,260
You know, I guess it's pretty fortunate that, you know, I just happened to work out that

752
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:17,260
I live in the same town now as Munchie and Kazi.

753
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
That's pretty cool.

754
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:25,260
Although, although I haven't seen them in a while, it's been like more than a month,

755
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
actually.

756
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
They've been traveling.

757
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Yeah, they've been.

758
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,260
I've heard about it.

759
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Yeah, they've been, they've been.

760
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Summer holiday, various things.

761
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Yes.

762
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Yeah, I should.

763
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
I should reach out.

764
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,260
I think Munchie is getting back soon-ish.

765
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260
I think he's back now.

766
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
Oh, shit.

767
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
Well, neat.

768
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Cool.

769
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:57,260
But, yeah, just sort of worked out that we ended up in the same town, so that's kind of nice.

770
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:06,260
But, what were we talking about?

771
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,260
And next Thursday, we're going, we're both going to Canada.

772
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,260
So, I'm going to visit Archer first.

773
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
She visits me.

774
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
I visit her.

775
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:21,260
I actually have to, I have to go to Canada because of my university, because I have to

776
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:29,260
spend a certain amount of time in an English-speaking country, as that's part of my requirements.

777
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,260
I see.

778
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,260
So, I can do that two in one, because I'm going to be an English teacher one day.

779
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Like, English as a second language.

780
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
Epic.

781
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
And art.

782
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,260
Yeah, that's going to be a lot of fun.

783
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:51,260
You know, teaching English as a second language is a job that you can do anywhere.

784
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
I mean, anywhere-

785
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
Not really.

786
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
No?

787
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Well, the thing is, you kind of also need to know the language of the country that you're

788
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
in.

789
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Yeah, you kind of need to know.

790
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
You know-

791
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Get by with just some eyebrow-raising and body-movements.

792
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
At least on lower levels.

793
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:15,260
I guess on higher levels, it works better, but I couldn't teach fifth graders in Poland,

794
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
because I don't know Polish.

795
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,260
And if they have a question and can't speak English yet, I don't have a chance.

796
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,260
So, I'm kind of limited to German-speaking countries.

797
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:31,260
What would you say is the closest other language that seems like it could-

798
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:37,260
German would be similar enough that you could switch to-

799
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
Dutch?

800
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Yeah.

801
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
Yeah, Dutch is kind of like-

802
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,260
It sounds very German with some English and French mixed in.

803
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Yeah, that would work, I guess.

804
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Perhaps.

805
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:55,260
I mean, there's also German schools in a lot of countries.

806
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,260
Right here.

807
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,260
That could all work.

808
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:07,260
I mean, I remember when I went to Poland, a lot of people that I met there were English.

809
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,260
They worked teaching English, and I guess maybe they did know Polish.

810
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,260
I didn't speak Polish, really, but I wasn't teaching English.

811
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,260
I was teaching physics, so I didn't really-

812
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,260
And I was teaching in English, so I didn't really have to-

813
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,260
What age were the students you were teaching?

814
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,260
They were just out of high school.

815
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
It was like a college prep.

816
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,260
It was a college prep class.

817
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Basically, I must have been 24, 24, 25.

818
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,260
So, I guess that'd be like 10 years ago, wow.

819
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,260
It's older than I am.

820
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:04,260
No, 20, I think that was in like 2010, so I would have been like 22.

821
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,260
And they would have been like 18 younger than I am.

822
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
No, it was later than that.

823
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,260
It must have been 2012 or 2014 or something.

824
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,260
2016, 2018, you know.

825
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,260
I want to say it was about 2012.

826
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,260
But anyway, the kids were like 17, 18, 19, something like that.

827
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Yeah, that makes sense.

828
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
They should know enough English by then.

829
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,260
Yeah, because they were basically just relearning subjects

830
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,260
that they had already learned in school in Saudi Arabia.

831
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,260
It was like a university prep class or something.

832
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,260
They were basically just relearning them in English.

833
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,260
Yeah, we have those to get ready for university

834
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,260
because schools don't actually teach you

835
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,260
already enough for university requirements and STEM stuff.

836
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,260
So, that's often required.

837
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,260
Yeah, but like I said, I didn't have to know Polish.

838
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,260
Because the kids didn't speak Polish.

839
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
They spoke...

840
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:12,260
Shit, what language do they speak in Saudi Arabia?

841
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
Arabic?

842
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,260
Arabic, yes, there you go.

843
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Probably?

844
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,260
I don't remember the Saudi part of it.

845
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,260
I just remember you were a physics teacher in Poland.

846
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,260
Yeah, they were from Saudi Arabia.

847
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,260
They were...

848
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,260
They sometimes talked about the king.

849
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,260
As you do.

850
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,260
As you do.

851
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
The...

852
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,260
Elvis?

853
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,260
They didn't have anime in Saudi Arabia,

854
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,260
but they could watch anime in Poland,

855
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,260
so I thought that was pretty cool.

856
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,260
Did they hear about it in Saudi Arabia?

857
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,260
Is it like a secret?

858
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,260
I believe so.

859
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,260
Yeah, I think they just didn't really have much access to it.

860
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,260
It's a lot of it was banned or something for whatever reason.

861
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,260
Yeah, but surely they could have watched it online,

862
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
like we all did.

863
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,260
I don't know.

864
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,260
I mean, this was a long time ago.

865
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
VPNs didn't really exist.

866
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,260
Oh, yeah, fair.

867
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,260
Maybe.

868
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,260
You probably would have had to get it on some kind of black market,

869
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,260
the USB drive or something.

870
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,260
Get it on three parts on YouTube.

871
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
Yeah.

872
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,260
Maybe.

873
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,260
Yeah, in 240p quality.

874
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Yes.

875
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,260
3x4 resolution, of course.

876
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,260
That's how we watched the Dungeons & Dragons episode of Community today,

877
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,260
because it got pulled off Netflix.

878
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
Right, they've been pulling shows.

879
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,260
No, there was services be pulling shows.

880
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,260
No, this was years ago.

881
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,260
Yeah, that was a while ago.

882
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,260
This is a specific episode because it had a joke

883
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,260
where a character did blackface.

884
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,260
You know, have I complained about the episode of Golden Girls

885
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,260
that got pulled for blackface?

886
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Because they straight up just aren't doing blackface

887
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,260
in the episode of Golden Girls that got pulled for blackface.

888
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,260
Wait, episode of Golden Girls got banned?

889
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,260
Yeah, well, it got taken off Netflix.

890
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,260
The joke is that Dorothy has a black friend

891
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,260
and the black friend comes over and B,

892
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:29,260
no, Blanche and Rose,

893
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,260
they're doing spa treatments, so they're wearing mud masks.

894
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,260
So they come out wearing their mud mask and they're like,

895
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,260
oh, no, no, this isn't, we're not, this isn't,

896
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,260
they're trying to explain.

897
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,260
So like, the whole joke is that they're not doing blackface

898
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,260
and yet that episode got pulled from Netflix.

899
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
It's a misunderstanding.

900
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,260
For blackface.

901
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,260
I mean, that's a sad thing there.

902
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,260
Who woke SJWs have gone too far this time?

903
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,260
Or it's just the producers weren't understanding.

904
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,260
Where's my Golden Girls?

905
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,260
It's a funny joke.

906
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,260
Okay.

907
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,260
It's a shame because in advance,

908
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,260
Dungeons & Dragons is one of the best episodes of community.

909
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,260
It's great.

910
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,260
I always love when a show does a D&D episode.

911
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,260
I'm a sucker for that.

912
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,260
You should watch Stranger Things.

913
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,260
I have not seen the new, I did watch the first season

914
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,260
of Stranger Things.

915
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,260
Did they do a D&D episode of My Little Pony?

916
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:35,260
Yeah, it was Boys Gamer Night with Discord, Big Mac, Spike,

917
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,260
and Discord like made like,

918
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,260
I think there's some other character there, I forgot who,

919
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,260
and Discord like made things real because he's Discord.

920
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,260
And they were like, oh God, Discord,

921
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,260
you're actually going to kill us with these monsters.

922
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,260
He said, I'm just playing.

923
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,260
I don't think that's what they were trying to, but okay.

924
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,260
Never mind.

925
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,260
That sounds terrible.

926
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,260
I think I would have hated it.

927
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,260
It was later season MLP.

928
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,260
Yeah, I've definitely have not seen that one.

929
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,260
Do you watch that, Asha?

930
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
Yes, I've seen all of MLP.

931
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,260
Oh God.

932
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,260
Oh my God.

933
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,260
100% completion rate.

934
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,260
Yes.

935
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,260
I stopped at like season five, I think.

936
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,260
No, no, Asha, Asha, it's like an old movie.

937
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,260
The last few episodes of the last few seasons are such a weird like...

938
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,260
They are so strange.

939
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,260
There's the final battle between all of the biggest villains

940
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,260
coming back together to team up.

941
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,260
Plus all of the kids from all of the different races

942
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,260
that come to the school and the main six

943
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,260
and a bunch of other people.

944
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,260
And they all come...

945
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,260
And Starshall, the birdie and all of his ancient friends

946
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,260
who came back from the thing when they did that.

947
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,260
And they all come together and they go...

948
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,260
Yeah, that's what they do.

949
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,260
It's just, I can't remember what happened.

950
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,260
But at the end, Twilight has a really long neck

951
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,260
and that's the main thing that matters.

952
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,260
I can't remember what happened,

953
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,260
but I remember that I didn't like it.

954
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,260
She became a long-born.

955
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,260
And her friends became old boys.

956
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
She's right.

957
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,260
The age is the very first, very last thing

958
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,260
is that we confirmed that Twilight will live forever

959
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,260
and her friends will all age and die

960
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,260
and she will just have to watch.

961
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,260
She's again making new friends.

962
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,260
No, she can't.

963
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,260
Celestia never made friends.

964
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,260
Yes, she does.

965
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,260
Pony's made for life, I'm sorry.

966
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,260
Once your friends die there, you can't make anymore.

967
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,260
What happened to Twilight in the new metal pony, Jen?

968
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,260
We don't know that, huh?

969
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,260
It's very...

970
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,260
I saw the movie, I don't think...

971
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,260
Well, she's been relegated to myth.

972
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,260
Yeah.

973
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,260
So...

974
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,260
I don't know what the new lore is with the new TV series.

975
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,260
Is that out now?

976
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,260
No, but there's a special, at least one.

977
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,260
And it's terrible.

978
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,260
At least it looks and sounds terrible.

979
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,260
The movie came out like two years ago.

980
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,260
What are they waiting for?

981
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,260
I don't know.

982
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,260
But at least I think the show is not on.

983
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,260
But I really like the movie.

984
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,260
I like the performances and the songs a lot.

985
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,260
I thought the movie was alright.

986
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,260
The movie had its moments.

987
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,260
It was neat.

988
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,260
I didn't hate it.

989
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,260
The thing is...

990
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,260
Which is a lot for me.

991
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:23,260
The TV special or the Netflix special that did a bit ago,

992
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:29,260
it looks horrible because it's kind of the same CG style of the movie,

993
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,260
but much worse than it was the animated.

994
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,260
And it looks very stiff and weirdly shaded.

995
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:41,260
And also they replaced all the voice actors, which were pretty good.

996
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,260
And yeah.

997
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,260
All the swabs doing it for the actors.

998
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,260
They didn't get Ken Jeong back to play a red guy?

999
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,260
It's terrible.

1000
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,260
I guess they can't afford him.

1001
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,260
Why would you do that?

1002
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:59,260
Why would you make such a big event movie and not followed up?

1003
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:06,260
Just like how they couldn't get Robin Williams to play Genie in the Aladdin sequels and the animated show.

1004
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,260
So they got...

1005
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,260
They got...

1006
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,260
Ugh!

1007
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,260
Guess we got to settle for Dan Castle and Edda.

1008
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,260
Ugh!

1009
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,260
God!

1010
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,260
Do any of these Disney TV sequels have the original actors?

1011
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,260
Some of them must.

1012
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
Some of them must.

1013
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,260
I think they did get Gilbert Godfrey to continue to be Iago,

1014
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,260
because I mean, what else was he going to do?

1015
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,260
Well, who else could be that voice as well?

1016
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,260
Yeah, I mean true.

1017
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:40,260
But I mean, if he were as big a star as Robin Williams,

1018
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:45,260
they would have just had to say fuck it and suck it up and get someone.

1019
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,260
Fortunately, he's just...

1020
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,260
Fortunately, Gilbert Godfrey likes doing things.

1021
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,260
Fortunately, he's just Gilbert Godfrey and he...

1022
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,260
Yeah, did he die?

1023
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,260
Yeah, he died recently.

1024
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,260
That's too bad.

1025
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,260
Yeah, I thought so.

1026
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:07,260
Did you see that episode of the Angry Video Game Nerd starring Gilbert Godfrey?

1027
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,260
I think I saw parts of it.

1028
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,260
As Fred Fuchs, the explorer.

1029
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,260
Yeah, I think I saw parts of it.

1030
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,260
I don't think I watched the whole thing.

1031
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,260
I think it was awkward.

1032
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,260
It was awkward.

1033
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,260
I think I remember it was really awkward.

1034
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,260
James is such an awkward person on camera with other actors.

1035
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,260
He's not good at that, but it was funny just the fact that it happened.

1036
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:37,260
It wasn't good, but the fact that it happened is worth celebrating.

1037
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,260
No worth celebrating.

1038
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,260
I'm just like, wow, wow, what?

1039
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,260
Noteworthy.

1040
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:49,260
It felt like Gilbert didn't really know what he was doing either.

1041
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,260
Yeah.

1042
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,260
Can you imagine getting there and having the nerd direct you?

1043
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:04,260
You're like, okay, your motivation in this scene is that you hate this video game and you're really angry and you're going to yell at it while you play.

1044
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,260
You're going to yell at it.

1045
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,260
You're going to talk about how you'd rather put your balls in a blender.

1046
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:20,260
I want you to compare the game to poop, but I want you to come up with some different kinds of poop that you could compare it to.

1047
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,260
Different consistencies, different animals.

1048
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
Okay, go.

1049
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,260
Spitball.

1050
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,260
Right.

1051
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,260
James Rolfe is a character.

1052
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,260
What do you call it?

1053
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,260
Character director?

1054
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,260
Yeah.

1055
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,260
I forget the term.

1056
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,260
I'm not sure, but I think I know what you mean.

1057
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,260
Name Gilbert Gottfried sounds like an Elden Ring character.

1058
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,260
I think it might just be an Elden Ring character, actually.

1059
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,260
Yeah, my player character.

1060
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,260
I hope not.

1061
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,260
I hope not.

1062
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,260
Hey, Gimm.

1063
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,260
Elden Ring streams.

1064
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,260
When?

1065
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,260
Oh.

1066
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,260
Well, the reason I stopped that was because no one watched it.

1067
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,260
I watched it.

1068
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,260
I killed Mog.

1069
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,260
I killed Mog and there was no one watching.

1070
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,260
I was like, what am I doing?

1071
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,260
Damn, I'm sorry.

1072
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,260
I was probably sleeping.

1073
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,260
No, no, no.

1074
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,260
I'm not trying to kill people.

1075
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,260
That is the reason I was like, okay.

1076
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,260
I was taking it very seriously for some reason.

1077
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:22,260
I really wanted to get my whole Elden Ring experience streamed,

1078
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:27,260
and I was sort of doing it even though I didn't want to.

1079
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,260
And now I will continue it.

1080
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,260
I do want to, but I'm still playing Elden Ring for a while.

1081
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,260
Yeah.

1082
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:40,260
I don't know when, could be soon, could be a million years.

1083
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,260
I've only been playing Elden Ring for the past half year.

1084
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,260
There's no other video game that's important.

1085
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,260
That's the only one.

1086
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,260
I'm also really bad at it, so it takes me a long time.

1087
00:52:51,260 --> 00:53:00,260
I saw the new Never Knows Best video about how Elden Ring is bad.

1088
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:05,260
I've heard a few people say Elden Ring is sort of, it's huge

1089
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,260
and it's impressive, but replay value isn't that high for some reason.

1090
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,260
What was Never Knows?

1091
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,260
I mean, he didn't say bad.

1092
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,260
He said it was disappointing because it could have been a lot better.

1093
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,260
What did he say?

1094
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,260
Boss variety, bad.

1095
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:29,260
The game is easy if you look up the meta and build according to the meta

1096
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,260
and hard if you don't do that.

1097
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,260
The game assumes you will use guides to play it.

1098
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,260
If you do that, it's easy and otherwise it's a nightmare.

1099
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,260
That's what he said.

1100
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,260
He said that's bad.

1101
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,260
That's bad design and it's bad game philosophy.

1102
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:51,260
I've always felt similar just because I never like looking at guides,

1103
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:59,260
but as guides and as games have come out, as the internet has grown

1104
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,260
in relevance to gamers in the world,

1105
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,260
the idea of looking up something when you're stuck

1106
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:10,260
is something that game developers have had to work around.

1107
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,260
They can't really make something that's secret.

1108
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,260
If you can look it up and solve the secret,

1109
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,260
they've got to try and make it, I don't know, design it differently.

1110
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:27,260
Now, I think there is a blanket sort of acceptance that,

1111
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,260
yeah, people use guides, they'll go on the wiki,

1112
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,260
the wiki will be made within a month,

1113
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:36,260
fully formed with everything you could ever possibly want to know about the game.

1114
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,260
In the game, you don't really need to explain that much

1115
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,260
and for people who don't like looking up guides,

1116
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,260
it sucks sometimes.

1117
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:51,260
I understand that there's sort of like Dark Souls

1118
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,260
and the whole Souls series and all the FromSoft games that have come out

1119
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,260
since then, they're sort of built around this idea of the community.

1120
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,260
They're all kind of built around the idea that people will come together

1121
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,260
and help each other and sort of tell each other

1122
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,260
what they're doing and advise each other

1123
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:13,260
and warn each other about danger with signs and stuff.

1124
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,260
I like the in-game versions of that,

1125
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,260
with the people writing stuff on the floor.

1126
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,260
I think that's all right.

1127
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,260
I don't like the expectation that you should go elsewhere

1128
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,260
to complete the game experience, as intended.

1129
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:31,260
Yeah, that's kind of...

1130
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:36,260
I sort of had to do that my first playthrough of Dark Souls.

1131
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:42,260
The interface was so opaque and the character building

1132
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,260
was so like, what is any of this doing?

1133
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,260
I think I did go and look up some guides for stuff

1134
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,260
and I was like, oh, okay.

1135
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,260
And I think the game would have been stronger.

1136
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,260
It would have had a better overall experience

1137
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,260
if I had not had to do that,

1138
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,260
if the game explained itself a little better.

1139
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,260
Yeah.

1140
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,260
Yeah, I mean, I played Dark Souls for the first time

1141
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:12,260
after having watched the Digi Bros. Let's Play,

1142
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,260
which is what made me realize that it was cool.

1143
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,260
I was like, oh, look at all that.

1144
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,260
That seems neat, and I bought it.

1145
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,260
But I already knew a lot of the secrets.

1146
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,260
I knew about Ash Lake.

1147
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,260
I knew about what you should put your stats in.

1148
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,260
Yeah.

1149
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,260
And I had a very smooth time,

1150
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,260
but I could imagine myself getting extremely frustrated.

1151
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:38,260
If my first try at a character was a complete failure,

1152
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,260
I put the stats in the wrong things

1153
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,260
and it was extremely difficult going forward

1154
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,260
and it would have been better for me

1155
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,260
and much quicker and more efficient

1156
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,260
if I deleted my character and started again.

1157
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,260
But I wouldn't have known to do that

1158
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,260
if I just played the game

1159
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,260
and I would just assume that it was too hard.

1160
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,260
Yeah, I picked it up blind

1161
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,260
and I just fucked around in it

1162
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,260
and I was like, what am I doing?

1163
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,260
What am I doing wrong here?

1164
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,260
I had to resort to a guide

1165
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,260
and it was not fun to have to do that.

1166
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,260
TBH.

1167
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,260
I think guides as part of a gameplay experience

1168
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,260
are at best neutral.

1169
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,260
At best they don't negatively affect things,

1170
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,260
but they don't improve as an experience.

1171
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,260
I feel like it's always cooler

1172
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,260
if you play the game

1173
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,260
and then you come up with these things yourself

1174
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,260
and then if you check the meta,

1175
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,260
it turns out that the thing you naturally came to the conclusion of

1176
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,260
was the way you should do it.

1177
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,260
I admit, I think I use guides a lot,

1178
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,260
but I'm also very new to playing video games in general

1179
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,260
because I grew up with parents who didn't like video games

1180
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,260
and I never had any consoles or computers that were good enough

1181
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,260
to play most games.

1182
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:02,260
So it already takes me probably five times as long

1183
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,260
as most people to beat most games,

1184
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,260
so I'm fine with having a guide

1185
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,260
just to save my precious lifetime.

1186
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,260
Some games just really waste your time

1187
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,260
if you don't have that.

1188
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,260
I looked up a giant map of the Hollow Knight thing

1189
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,260
just to kind of know where I have to go

1190
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,260
because it gets confusing at some point.

1191
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,260
Hollow Knight is very...

1192
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,260
Actually, I don't know.

1193
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,260
I can't remember my first playthrough of Hollow Knight.

1194
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,260
I don't know if I had seen content of guides before.

1195
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,260
You streamed it too.

1196
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,260
I streamed it and I had stream chat helping me sometimes,

1197
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:41,260
so that would, I guess, count as extra help.

1198
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:48,260
I was playing Mega Man ZX Advent

1199
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,260
and ZX and ZX Advent have like...

1200
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,260
They're sort of Metroidvania.

1201
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,260
They kind of have big open worlds

1202
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:59,260
and that's cool and I appreciate that,

1203
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,260
but I also kind of just wanted to beat the game

1204
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,260
and I didn't want to spend a lot of time

1205
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,260
like kind of wandering around looking for stuff.

1206
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:09,260
I know that's kind of the point of a world like that

1207
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:12,260
is you kind of wander around and find stuff,

1208
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,260
but I kind of just didn't want to spend the time,

1209
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,260
so I did use a guide for a lot of stuff

1210
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,260
that just told me like, where do I go next?

1211
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,260
What's my next objective?

1212
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:26,260
And I probably did hurt my experience of the game a little bit,

1213
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:29,260
but also I got through it a lot faster and that's valuable.

1214
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:33,260
It's just like watching a movie and putting subtitles on

1215
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,260
because all the characters have weird accents

1216
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,260
and you don't speak the language

1217
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,260
and it's not your first language

1218
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,260
and just helps you experience the movie better and quicker

1219
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,260
and easier.

1220
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,260
I don't know if it's like that,

1221
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,260
because if you don't speak the language, you literally can't.

1222
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,260
No, I mean like...

1223
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,260
Experience the movie.

1224
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,260
I guess, yeah.

1225
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,260
But it's just making your experience easier

1226
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,260
or like a little more accessible.

1227
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,260
It doesn't ruin it necessarily.

1228
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,260
I think...

1229
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,260
I think I'm coming from a perspective where like,

1230
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,260
I played PlayStation games,

1231
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,260
I played Rayman or whatever,

1232
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,260
I played Spyro.

1233
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,260
When you play Spyro, the level is very small

1234
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,260
compared to Elden Ring,

1235
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:18,260
so you go around, you collect as many gems as you can

1236
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,260
and then it's like, oh, there's five gems left

1237
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,260
and I feel like I've been everywhere.

1238
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,260
Where is it?

1239
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,260
You run around the level,

1240
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,260
you check everything twice, three times,

1241
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,260
and it doesn't actually take that long to do it.

1242
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,260
And there's a chance that you could actually figure out

1243
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,260
a place that you maybe could glide to

1244
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,260
that you haven't seen before and is that possible?

1245
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,260
Oh my God, it is.

1246
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,260
There's the gems.

1247
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,260
You 100% completed the level without using a guide.

1248
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,260
But if I was stuck on like something that would take me,

1249
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,260
I don't know, 40 minutes, an hour, two hours,

1250
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,260
three hours to figure it out for myself,

1251
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,260
I am going to get tired

1252
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,260
and I'm just going to YouTube like,

1253
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,260
where do I fucking go?

1254
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,260
So for small little games,

1255
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,260
guides are not necessary at all.

1256
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,260
And I prefer a few failures,

1257
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,260
a few like little trials and errors to get to the end

1258
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,260
and 100% complete.

1259
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,260
But for something huge,

1260
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,260
for something that's even like middleingly large,

1261
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:19,260
or for a game that sucks, guides are great.

1262
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,260
Guides are a good time saver.

1263
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,260
Using a guide on Mega Man ZX

1264
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,260
was the difference between me completing the game,

1265
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260
you know, like knowing where to go

1266
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,260
instead of having to sort of wander around

1267
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,260
and like check every door I've been through

1268
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,260
and like talk to every NPC I've talked to before

1269
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,260
and see if their dialogues changed

1270
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,260
and see if any of the old doors have opened now

1271
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,260
and like try and remember,

1272
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,260
oh, was there a yellow door over there?

1273
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,260
Oh, I should try that again, see if that leads anywhere.

1274
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,260
It was the difference between me beating the game

1275
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:52,260
in like seven hours versus like 12 hours.

1276
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,260
And I just wanted those five hours.

1277
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,260
I wanted to save those five hours.

1278
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,260
I don't want to spend them fucking around.

1279
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,260
Yeah.

1280
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,260
You can only play so many video games.

1281
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,260
I did, but I, you know,

1282
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,260
I understand that by doing so,

1283
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,260
I robbed myself of the joy of discovery going,

1284
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,260
aha, I found it.

1285
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,260
When Silk Song comes out,

1286
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,260
I want to try to play it completely blind.

1287
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,260
Oh, Silk Song.

1288
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,260
Because it's going to be new

1289
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,260
and nobody's going to have played it yet.

1290
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,260
I'm going to play it first day and like know nothing

1291
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,260
and have the pure experience.

1292
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,260
That's a good one.

1293
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,260
Is there any news on that?

1294
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,260
Do we know when that's coming?

1295
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,260
It's supposed, I think like a month ago or something,

1296
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,260
there was an announcement and like a new short trailer

1297
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,260
and they said it's supposedly coming out

1298
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,260
within the next 20, no,

1299
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,260
within the next 12 months.

1300
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,260
Within the next 25 years it will come out.

1301
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,260
No, within the next year, apparently.

1302
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,260
Maybe.

1303
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,260
We don't have a date though.

1304
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,260
I feel like that's always the Silk Song news,

1305
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,260
is like they've released

1306
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,260
another three seconds of video footage.

1307
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,260
That was the first news.

1308
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,260
We don't know anything else.

1309
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,260
There's this one channel on YouTube

1310
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,260
called Daily Silk Song news

1311
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:07,260
and they upload a video every single day.

1312
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,260
Just like a tiny like

1313
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,260
30 second thing.

1314
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,260
Welcome to Daily Silk Song news.

1315
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,260
Today there has been no Silk Song news.

1316
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,260
And they talk about

1317
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,260
every single snippet that releases.

1318
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,260
It's a good channel.

1319
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,260
And yeah.

1320
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,260
I hope on like a day

1321
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,260
when there's actually big Silk Song news

1322
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,260
they forget to upload or like they give up

1323
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,260
on that day and will be very sad.

1324
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:35,260
Oh, I guess you know what?

1325
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,260
You know what I've realized?

1326
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,260
I think it's when it comes to

1327
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,260
like a video game,

1328
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,260
like what the appeal of the gameplay is.

1329
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,260
If the point

1330
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,260
of the game is about

1331
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,260
figuring stuff out,

1332
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,260
like a point and click or a mystery game

1333
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,260
sort of thing.

1334
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,260
Guides are

1335
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,260
absolutely damaging to the experience.

1336
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,260
If you get like

1337
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,260
a little impatient or frustrated in a point and click game.

1338
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,260
I mean some point and click games are just

1339
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,260
obtuse to the point of

1340
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,260
absurdity and it doesn't make sense how you

1341
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,260
could figure stuff out. But some of them

1342
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,260
you can. You just have to think

1343
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,260
and

1344
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,260
like it's so much

1345
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,260
more satisfying coming to

1346
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,260
the correct conclusion in a game like that

1347
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,260
instead of using a guide.

1348
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,260
But if you're playing a game

1349
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,260
where the appeal is

1350
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,260
like Minecraft, right?

1351
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,260
The fun of Minecraft is building stuff

1352
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,260
and

1353
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,260
mining and

1354
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,260
crafting and stuff.

1355
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,260
Figuring out the lore or

1356
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,260
rather just how you do

1357
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,260
things is

1358
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,260
completely impossible.

1359
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,260
Like you can, there are some

1360
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,260
fits of clues.

1361
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,260
I guess they changed a bit.

1362
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,260
They have like a recipe book now.

1363
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,260
They changed a bit, but like if you wanted to know how to get into the Nether

1364
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,260
you would just, and you had no

1365
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,260
Minecraft experience, you would come across

1366
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,260
you would have to be lucky enough

1367
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,260
to come across like an unfinished Nether portal

1368
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,260
and then

1369
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,260
put the pieces together that you need to finish it

1370
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,260
and then set it on fire so that you can go through

1371
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,260
so you can get like access to a whole other section

1372
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,260
of the game with all these important items that you need

1373
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,260
to do all these other things.

1374
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,260
They've only put these unfinished Nether portals in so that you have

1375
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:17,260
a kind of a guide

1376
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,260
that you play as one or something.

1377
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,260
It was just expected to go to the Minecraft wiki

1378
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,260
that was

1379
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,260
part of the game kind of.

1380
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,260
But that's the reason it's fine in Minecraft

1381
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,260
because like

1382
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,260
that experience of

1383
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,260
understanding how the game works

1384
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:35,260
is not as satisfying as finding a cool cave.

1385
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,260
You don't need to do like

1386
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,260
any wiki searching to know

1387
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,260
what a cool cave is when you find it.

1388
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,260
You know all the, you can look up

1389
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,260
a guide on all of the things. It's just

1390
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,260
whether you find them or not. That's the fun part.

1391
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,260
Yeah.

1392
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,260
Nobody agreed. Like

1393
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:53,260
to the same extent if I want to look up

1394
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,260
hey how do I get to this specific

1395
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,260
boss in like

1396
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,260
Elden Ring or Hollow Knight or whatever

1397
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,260
like I can look that up and I still

1398
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,260
have fun fighting that boss

1399
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,260
that doesn't really take away from it that much.

1400
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,260
It always depends on what you want

1401
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,260
out of it and

1402
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,260
what's like, what your time is worth

1403
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,260
spending on certain tasks

1404
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,260
in the game.

1405
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,260
I really care for my time

1406
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,260
which is why I play RuneScape

1407
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,260
and I mine

1408
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,260
iron for hours upon

1409
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,260
hours every day.

1410
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,260
I have no idea what RuneScape is. I heard the name for years.

1411
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,260
I have no idea

1412
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,260
what it even looks like.

1413
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,260
I've seen it and I have a vague idea.

1414
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,260
I have a general idea of what sort of things you do

1415
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,260
in it. I can pitch RuneScape.

1416
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,260
RuneScape is

1417
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,260
an MMO

1418
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,260
like a massively multiplayer online

1419
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,260
role-playing video game, but instead

1420
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,260
of being based off of World of Warcraft

1421
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,260
like everything else, it came out

1422
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,260
like before that or around the same time

1423
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,260
and it's more based on

1424
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,260
point and click

1425
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,260
adventures and dungeons and dragons

1426
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,260
where the world

1427
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,260
is

1428
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,260
it's more lived in.

1429
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,260
There are NPCs that just talk about stuff

1430
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,260
and the game is not about combat necessarily.

1431
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,260
So there's fantasy things

1432
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,260
but

1433
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,260
the core of RuneScape is that you're in

1434
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,260
just a fantasy realm

1435
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:17,260
and there's lots of different skills you

1436
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,260
can get higher.

1437
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,260
There are many quests you can complete.

1438
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,260
So you're running around as a little

1439
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,260
video game guy and fight things too?

1440
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:27,260
You run around

1441
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,260
and you can do anything.

1442
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,260
Combat level is like

1443
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,260
a thing that you need if you want to live

1444
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,260
in certain areas obviously. Enemies will throw rocks

1445
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,260
at you, they'll punch you.

1446
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,260
Certain quests require you to

1447
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,260
defeat demons and vampires and stuff.

1448
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,260
For some reason I always mentioned it

1449
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,260
as like a puzzle game, like Candy Crush.

1450
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,260
I don't know.

1451
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,260
Something about the name. I told you about it?

1452
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,260
Maybe? I don't know. I imagine

1453
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,260
like a Candy Crush but with stone plates

1454
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,260
that have runes on it. I thought that's what

1455
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,260
RuneScape is. No.

1456
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,260
No, you're a little polygon dude running around

1457
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,260
doing medieval literature. You're a little

1458
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,260
low poly. It's like a Java based

1459
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,260
demo. Let me find

1460
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,260
it's like the lowest poly models

1461
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,260
you've ever seen. The lowest poly

1462
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,260
this

1463
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,260
is an okay image.

1464
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,260
Here's an image of a RuneScape

1465
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,260
character

1466
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,260
who has a lot of levels actually. Fishing.

1467
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,260
Fishing in a little pond.

1468
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,260
That's adorable.

1469
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,260
They're gonna get some fish and then they can

1470
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,260
if you see the mini map in the top right

1471
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,260
there's like the fishing spots there.

1472
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,260
It looks like there's a fletching

1473
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,260
or an arrow shop you can buy arrows from.

1474
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,260
Thank you.

1475
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:37,260
It's a quaint adorable

1476
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,260
and

1477
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,260
very, very, very, very, very

1478
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,260
time consuming, old style

1479
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,260
video game that I love playing. Does it still exist?

1480
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:47,260
At the moment. I don't know.

1481
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,260
Old school RuneScape does exist

1482
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,260
as like a

1483
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,260
like the fans wanted the old version

1484
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,260
of the game because they updated it as time

1485
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,260
of course.

1486
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,260
And the old version of RuneScape

1487
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,260
exists and is like

1488
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,260
in like

1489
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,260
what do you call it, active

1490
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,260
support. There's like a team

1491
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,260
that supports it.

1492
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,260
And yeah, I've

1493
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,260
I remember talking about RuneScape like a couple weeks

1494
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,260
ago. I don't know whether I mentioned that I'm

1495
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,260
on like a stupid

1496
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,260
challenge run

1497
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,260
that involves being extremely inefficient.

1498
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,260
I think you did, but I mean

1499
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,260
I don't remember the details.

1500
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,260
Yes.

1501
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,260
Because it's all gobbledygook to me.

1502
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,260
It's all nonsense.

1503
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,260
Yeah. No, I did

1504
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,260
I do remember saying it, but basically

1505
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,260
what I'm doing right now is I'm

1506
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,260
mining iron in the mining guild.

1507
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,260
I go up to a little ore rock

1508
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,260
and I click on it and my guy does

1509
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,260
a little animation. He gets an iron ore

1510
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,260
or she does because it's she.

1511
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,260
I change the gender. You can change your gender

1512
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:51,260
in this game. You just walk to a little

1513
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,260
witch and she says, what do you want?

1514
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,260
I will change your face and you're like, okay.

1515
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,260
I mean, that's just how it works in real life, right?

1516
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,260
Yeah, basically.

1517
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,260
And

1518
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,260
actually this is funny. There's a quest

1519
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:07,260
in RuneScape

1520
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,260
that requires you be a female

1521
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,260
to access a certain area

1522
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,260
so that you can

1523
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,260
do something. I can't remember what the quest was.

1524
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,260
But

1525
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,260
all of the characters who choose female

1526
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,260
the beginning of the game

1527
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,260
don't need to change their gender to do that.

1528
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,260
But every male character is

1529
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,260
force found by that quest.

1530
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,260
So that's funny.

1531
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,260
They have to be a female for like

1532
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,260
a few minutes.

1533
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,260
Got them.

1534
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,260
Damn.

1535
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,260
Yeah, but the moment I just

1536
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:43,260
passed the point where I've got

1537
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,260
50,000 iron ore in my bank.

1538
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:47,260
I've collected

1539
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,260
over 50,000 and I'm going for

1540
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,260
100,000 because

1541
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,260
that's the amount of iron ore I need

1542
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,260
to make enough steel bars

1543
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,260
to get my smithing level high enough

1544
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,260
so that I can smith rune itor

1545
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,260
into bars.

1546
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,260
And that means something to somebody

1547
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,260
and it certainly means something to me.

1548
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,260
You're welcome, RuneScape

1549
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,260
knowing audience.

1550
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,260
Well, that sounds great.

1551
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,260
You gotta do it.

1552
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,260
You gotta rune it. Yeah.

1553
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,260
I wanna do it.

1554
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,260
Like runar or morse.

1555
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,260
I always wanted to do it whenever

1556
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,260
since I was a tiny little speck in the ground.

1557
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,260
Since I was one atom tall.

1558
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:29,260
Here's what I can say.

1559
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,260
If I were you,

1560
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,260
I'm sure I would feel the same way.

1561
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,260
That's the most

1562
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,260
condescending generic way I can agree

1563
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,260
with someone.

1564
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,260
So you're welcome for that.

1565
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,260
Here's another image.

1566
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,260
This is showing

1567
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,260
in the chicken farm.

1568
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,260
Somebody has been killing chickens

1569
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,260
and getting the raw chicken so they could

1570
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,260
make roast chicken. Lucky.

1571
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,260
Ooh, that looks tasty.

1572
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,260
Look at all the bones.

1573
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,260
You can make some good

1574
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,260
stock out of them bones.

1575
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,260
There's some giant bones in those chicken.

1576
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:05,260
Yes.

1577
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,260
Full of femurs.

1578
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:09,260
That bone goes from

1579
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:11,260
it just replaces

1580
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,260
its entire spine.

1581
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,260
Everything drops bones

1582
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,260
if you bury the bones

1583
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,260
you get prayer experience

1584
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,260
because you're giving it a proper

1585
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,260
send off.

1586
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,260
Prayer experience allows you to gain buffs

1587
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,260
in combat or other things.

1588
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,260
To protect you from magic

1589
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,260
damage or melee damage

1590
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,260
and things like that.

1591
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,260
So if you kill

1592
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,260
a million chickens, you may as well pick up

1593
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,260
their bones and give each one a burial

1594
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,260
and get prayer experience for it.

1595
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,260
Cool.

1596
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,260
That's what I do.

1597
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,260
That's what I do with my time.

1598
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,260
Chicken mass grave.

1599
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,260
We can only do it one at a time.

1600
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,260
They're all tiny little graves.

1601
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,260
Do you get more prayer points

1602
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,260
for a bigger creature

1603
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,260
being buried? Literally yes.

1604
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,260
If you get giant bones, if you kill giants

1605
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,260
and you bury their bones, the mass

1606
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,260
equates to more burial experience.

1607
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,260
It's a bigger funeral. That means it's more

1608
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,260
sacred.

1609
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,260
If you get dragon bones, you bury those

1610
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,260
as well as even more prayer experience.

1611
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,260
Of course.

1612
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,260
That's just how

1613
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,260
religion works in real life as well.

1614
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,260
God just likes

1615
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,260
the amount of bones.

1616
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,260
Bigger souls, please.

1617
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,260
Yeah.

1618
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,260
Good.

1619
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,260
I agree.

1620
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,260
I agree.

1621
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,260
Runescape.

1622
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,260
What's it called?

1623
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,260
World of Warcraft Fantasy.

1624
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,260
It's based on

1625
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,260
Tolkien or something.

1626
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,260
That's what I wanted to come on this episode.

1627
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,260
That is why

1628
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,260
you pitched yourself as coming on

1629
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,260
because I talked to a Tolkien.

1630
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:55,260
Yeah.

1631
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,260
You said you're a Tolkien guy.

1632
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,260
No. I saw that episode

1633
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,260
titled two weeks ago. It was mid-journey

1634
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,260
and Tolkien. I already expected it

1635
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,260
to be like, you always do that thing

1636
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,260
or I guess Elgazar does the thing where

1637
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,260
you do something for like five minutes

1638
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,260
out of three hours and that's in the title.

1639
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,260
Look, blame Elgazar

1640
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,260
for picking the titles.

1641
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,260
That happened with Hollow Knight 2 once.

1642
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,260
I was really excited. He had like a whole

1643
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,260
Hollow Knight thumbnail and Hollow Knight in the title

1644
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,260
and Gip mentioned her stream once.

1645
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:25,260
I don't know what to tell Elgazar.

1646
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,260
We don't tell Elgazar what to put

1647
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,260
the title on. No, no, no. It's fine.

1648
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,260
I mean, it's working. I guess it's working.

1649
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,260
It's clickbait and it's just

1650
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,260
bait and there's no content.

1651
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,260
No, it's great. You've been duped.

1652
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,260
It's perfect never paint bait.

1653
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:41,260
Yeah, I guess. You're a sucker.

1654
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,260
What the procrastinator is talking

1655
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,260
about Tolkien? Like the one thing

1656
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,260
I know about? Talking about them?

1657
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,260
Incredible.

1658
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,260
Wow. I don't really know.

1659
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,260
No, I really don't know that much about it

1660
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,260
other than I read the books

1661
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,260
when I was in like

1662
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,260
high school, middle school.

1663
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,260
Yeah, I'm insane.

1664
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,260
That was a long, long time ago

1665
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,260
and I saw the movie.

1666
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:07,260
I don't even think I saw all the movies.

1667
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,260
I think I saw the first two movies.

1668
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,260
And you know, everybody likes the movies

1669
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,260
and I hated them.

1670
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,260
I remember viewing

1671
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,260
well, I remember viewing them with disdain.

1672
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,260
I remember thinking that adaptations

1673
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,260
were like cheap and not art

1674
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,260
and that these movies are just a...

1675
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,260
Yeah, I remember turning my nose up

1676
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,260
and being like, ugh, they just remade the

1677
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,260
book. Like, why?

1678
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,260
The book is already good.

1679
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,260
I know. And like, clearly

1680
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,260
culture has...

1681
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,260
I was not vindicated by time

1682
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,260
on that one. But that was my take.

1683
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,260
But that was my take back in the day.

1684
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,260
So your problem wasn't that they

1685
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,260
were too different from the books.

1686
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,260
Your problem was that they were just the same thing

1687
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,260
and it wasn't

1688
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,260
creative enough.

1689
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,260
That's interesting.

1690
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,260
I was about to say that's a really hot take

1691
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,260
but then I'm like, maybe not.

1692
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,260
It's still...

1693
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,260
It still is.

1694
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,260
Because these movies are kind of like universally

1695
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:05,260
praised

1696
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,260
mostly for being like, oh, this is like the

1697
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,260
ultimate adaptation. This is the best thing

1698
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,260
you can do. This is

1699
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,260
perfectly true to Talking Spirit

1700
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,260
which is like not completely true.

1701
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,260
But...

1702
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,260
Yeah.

1703
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:21,260
Look, when Aragorn punched

1704
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,260
that guy and went slash

1705
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,260
kill that orc

1706
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,260
I enjoyed it.

1707
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,260
Did you know that when Aragorn punched

1708
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,260
that guy, he broke his toe?

1709
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,260
No. It's when he kicks

1710
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,260
the helmet. Yeah, I know.

1711
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:37,260
Did you know that when he kicked the helmet

1712
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,260
he deflected the blade?

1713
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,260
Oh, wait.

1714
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:43,260
The actual fact is that when Aragorn

1715
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,260
kicks a helmet or an orc head

1716
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,260
in the movie, he actually broke his toe

1717
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,260
and they kept that take in and he screamed

1718
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,260
and...

1719
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,260
You screamed in character.

1720
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,260
He screamed and just fell on his knees

1721
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,260
and it was like, ah, so sad.

1722
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,260
Doesn't Aragorn

1723
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,260
kill the mouth of Sauron

1724
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,260
in the movie that he doesn't in the book?

1725
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,260
Yes, it's horrible in the movie.

1726
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,260
It's only an extended edition, but...

1727
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,260
And it's literally just him like killing a

1728
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,260
peaceful ambassador. Yes, it's great, right?

1729
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,260
Like, sure, he's from the evil empire

1730
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,260
but like, they sent you this guy to negotiate.

1731
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,260
Like, that's what the

1732
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,260
fucking Trade Federation does

1733
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,260
to the Jedi.

1734
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,260
He's one of those fucking

1735
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,260
Asian stereotype

1736
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,260
lizard people.

1737
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:29,260
He's as bad as fucking...

1738
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,260
What's his name? Anakin.

1739
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,260
Remlazar.

1740
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,260
No.

1741
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,260
Trade

1742
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:39,260
Federation. We're talking about Tolkien.

1743
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,260
I gotta look up what the aliens in Star Wars are.

1744
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,260
Trade Federation.

1745
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,260
Aliens.

1746
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,260
Lexivarack?

1747
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,260
I think. Is the...

1748
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,260
The dudes?

1749
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,260
That's not even a really constructed language.

1750
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,260
Newt Gunwreck. That's the one.

1751
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:57,260
Aragorn is just as bad as Newt Gunwreck.

1752
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,260
Okay.

1753
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,260
I don't remember this

1754
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,260
from the film.

1755
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:05,260
What are you talking about?

1756
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,260
What is the mouth of Sauron?

1757
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,260
At the black gate in the end of the third movie.

1758
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,260
Only an extended edition.

1759
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,260
There's a guy coming out with an ugly face.

1760
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,260
I haven't seen the extended editions, so that makes sense.

1761
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,260
They're pretty good, except that scene.

1762
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,260
I don't know the scene where they jump over.

1763
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,260
I remember seeing the mouth of Sauron

1764
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,260
and thinking that he looked very striking.

1765
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,260
I mean, I thought he looked cool.

1766
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,260
I mean, the artisan of these movies.

1767
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,260
These movies are incredible in general.

1768
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,260
That's the best thing about them.

1769
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,260
And the music.

1770
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,260
I learned from Tolkien Untangled

1771
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,260
that the mouth of Sauron is...

1772
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,260
What is he?

1773
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:41,260
He is a black Numenorean.

1774
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,260
Exactly.

1775
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,260
And now I didn't know that.

1776
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:47,260
He's a dude who works for Sauron

1777
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,260
for some reason.

1778
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,260
We don't know a lot about him.

1779
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,260
But there must be more of them.

1780
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:55,260
But there are others, too.

1781
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,260
He's not the only one.

1782
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,260
We don't even know if the mouth of Sauron

1783
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:01,260
is one character or just a title.

1784
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,260
Like...

1785
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,260
That guy. I thought that was the Witch King.

1786
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,260
No, Witch King.

1787
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,260
It's like a hollow Nazgul dude.

1788
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,260
Witch King is a race.

1789
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,260
There's a Tolkien Untangled

1790
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,260
Black Numenorean who's like a woman

1791
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,260
who is like this witch

1792
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,260
that has these black cats

1793
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,260
and her cats are like her spies.

1794
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,260
And she...

1795
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,260
That's Queen Baruthiel.

1796
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,260
But we don't...

1797
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,260
I don't actually know...

1798
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,260
I don't actually know that she's a Black Numenorean.

1799
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,260
I don't think we know a lot about her.

1800
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,260
I think that...

1801
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,260
He said she was a Black Numenorean.

1802
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,260
That might be it.

1803
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,260
You don't have to take it up with him.

1804
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:43,260
I'm not even familiar with Queen Baruthiel.

1805
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,260
Queen Baruthiel is one of these things.

1806
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,260
It's just a name drop in the Lord of Rings book.

1807
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,260
Like Aragorn says something.

1808
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,260
To walk from Moria, we need eyes

1809
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,260
as good as the cats of Queen Baruthiel.

1810
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,260
And...

1811
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,260
Talking himself didn't know who Queen Baruthiel was

1812
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,260
when he wrote that probably.

1813
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:01,260
That's why he was...

1814
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,260
That's why he was writing mostly.

1815
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,260
And then maybe he came up with

1816
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,260
Queen Baruthiel.

1817
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,260
He would brighten it in the

1818
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:11,260
unfinished tales.

1819
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:13,260
He's like, oh yeah, she's like a witch

1820
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,260
with these cats that she communes with.

1821
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,260
And she sailed on a boat somewhere.

1822
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:19,260
Or something.

1823
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,260
I don't know.

1824
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,260
God, I love talking.

1825
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,260
It's been my mainstay.

1826
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,260
Just like George Lucas.

1827
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,260
The music they listen to

1828
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:31,260
in the cantina is called

1829
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,260
Jizz.

1830
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,260
What else?

1831
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,260
You seen that

1832
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,260
Tuesday

1833
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,260
JK Rowling versus

1834
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,260
George Lucas?

1835
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,260
I haven't actually.

1836
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,260
Hold on, I'll post it.

1837
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,260
It's about retconning things.

1838
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,260
It's the two of them.

1839
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,260
The stupid dumb shit they come up with

1840
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,260
about their stories after the fact.

1841
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,260
Hang on.

1842
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,260
We need Tuesday

1843
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,260
JK Rowling

1844
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,260
George

1845
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,260
How do you spell George?

1846
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,260
Geodude

1847
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,260
Like any other George.

1848
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:11,260
Here we go.

1849
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,260
Here we go.

1850
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,260
It's in two images.

1851
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:17,260
You're going to have to look at both of them.

1852
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:19,260
Sorry, I brought this topic up.

1853
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,260
We have to discuss it thoroughly.

1854
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:23,260
We have to

1855
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,260
dissect every morsel

1856
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,260
of content

1857
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:29,260
out of this.

1858
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,260
The thing is, is that all

1859
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,260
actually George Lucas

1860
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,260
because the extended Star Wars

1861
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,260
was like all different authors doing stuff

1862
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,260
and George Lucas just waving it

1863
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,260
and be like, yeah, it's okay.

1864
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,260
I don't think these are real.

1865
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,260
I don't think there is an actually

1866
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:47,260
I don't think Qui-Gon Jinn's hairdresser

1867
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:49,260
is actually a blue rat named Fungo

1868
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,260
hairstyle.

1869
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,260
I can believe that.

1870
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,260
But all the

1871
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,260
Star Wars shit, all the novels

1872
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,260
are written by different people

1873
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,260
and

1874
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,260
back in the day before Disney took over

1875
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,260
George Lucas was just like, yeah, sure, it's all canon.

1876
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,260
I don't care.

1877
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,260
Let's just probably make it canon.

1878
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,260
You might be right.

1879
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,260
I mean, I think George does say

1880
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:15,260
goofy shit like this, but yeah.

1881
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:17,260
Some of the goofy shit is probably

1882
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,260
from like the extended books

1883
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,260
that other people wrote. That's fair.

1884
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,260
All of the things J.K. Rowling

1885
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,260
is depicted saying here are exactly

1886
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,260
one-to-one. She said them

1887
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:29,260
for sure, definitely.

1888
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,260
I hope so.

1889
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,260
There are no Jews at Hogwarts, but don't worry.

1890
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:35,260
All the main characters are about

1891
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,260
Zion.

1892
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:41,260
But they talk about it off-screen

1893
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,260
all the time. They're always

1894
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,260
really mad at Palestinian terrorists.

1895
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,260
They're getting fucking fuming.

1896
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,260
They can't even

1897
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,260
they can't even fight against

1898
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:53,260
the master red corner J.R.

1899
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,260
Tolkien who's literally the best

1900
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,260
red corner in the world

1901
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,260
and also it's like

1902
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:01,260
kind of one of the coolest

1903
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,260
things about his work.

1904
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,260
Well, okay. Do you know how

1905
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,260
in the Hobbit Bilbo gets the ring at first?

1906
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:15,260
Basically, he walks into a cave

1907
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:17,260
he finds the ring just on the ground

1908
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,260
doesn't think much of it. Then he meets

1909
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,260
then he meets Gollum

1910
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,260
and has like that riddle

1911
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,260
game with him.

1912
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,260
You know, yeah, I forget the details

1913
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:29,260
but I think I've heard

1914
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,260
he stumbles upon.

1915
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:33,260
He stumbles upon the ring

1916
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:35,260
and finds Gollum

1917
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,260
Gollum wants to eat him and they make

1918
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,260
like a bet. Hey, let's do a riddle game

1919
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,260
and if I win

1920
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:43,260
you have to, Bilbo says if I win

1921
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,260
you have to show me the way out. If Gollum wins

1922
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,260
Gollum eats him and

1923
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,260
Gollum had this ring but lost

1924
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,260
it earlier and Bilbo found it

1925
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,260
didn't tell Gollum.

1926
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,260
Towards the end, Bilbo runs out of riddles

1927
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,260
says like a fake riddle

1928
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,260
what do you have in my pocket

1929
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:01,260
and Gollum has to guess exactly

1930
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,260
the ring and

1931
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:05,260
then Bilbo in the end just runs away

1932
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,260
from Gollum and

1933
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:09,260
yeah, basically

1934
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,260
he got this ring

1935
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,260
kind of dishonestly and like in not a

1936
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:15,260
very cool or honorable way

1937
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,260
but that's not actually the original

1938
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,260
version of the story because

1939
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,260
in like the 1937

1940
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,260
version of the Hobbit that got first published

1941
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,260
that story was completely

1942
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,260
different and that story

1943
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,260
he met Gollum and Gollum was

1944
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,260
much more friendly and goofier character

1945
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,260
and he actually

1946
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:35,260
bet the ring in the riddle game

1947
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,260
like Gollum was like hey if you

1948
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,260
win this riddle game you can get the ring

1949
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,260
and Bilbo won the game

1950
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,260
won the ring

1951
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,260
honorably and they said goodbye

1952
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,260
and Gollum showed them the way out I think

1953
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,260
even. I'm not entirely sure

1954
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:51,260
but then

1955
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,260
that wouldn't make sense with what the ring

1956
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,260
ended up becoming. Yes, exactly

1957
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,260
then the publishers came and were like

1958
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,260
okay, JR

1959
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,260
talking we want more

1960
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,260
Hobbit stories and he was like

1961
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:05,260
can you publish my silver ring?

1962
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:07,260
They were like no

1963
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,260
it doesn't have Hobbits in it

1964
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:11,260
that's weird stuff

1965
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,260
give us Hobbits and he was like okay

1966
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:15,260
I guess I can write the Hobbit too

1967
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:17,260
and then he took like 15 years to write

1968
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:19,260
and while he was writing that

1969
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:21,260
and turned out that the ring might be

1970
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:23,260
actually way more important than he thought

1971
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:25,260
because Tolkien didn't plan out it

1972
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,260
he just wrote and explored

1973
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,260
the world as he was writing

1974
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:31,260
and

1975
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,260
so while that was happening

1976
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:35,260
he was like okay this is too important

1977
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,260
the ring is too important. Let's

1978
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,260
republish the Hobbit

1979
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,260
change that story but

1980
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,260
the original story in the original

1981
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,260
published version is still in the book

1982
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,260
the story that Bilbo tells to the other dwarves

1983
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:49,260
when he meets up with him again

1984
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,260
so he justifies

1985
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,260
to the dwarves

1986
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,260
that yeah that's how I got the ring

1987
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:57,260
it was all

1988
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,260
he also says it to Gandalf I believe

1989
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:01,260
and it was all honorable

1990
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,260
so now it's not just that he got the ring

1991
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,260
dishonorably but he lied about it

1992
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,260
he lied about it and that's the original

1993
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:09,260
story that went into Bilbo's diary

1994
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:11,260
which became the published Hobbit

1995
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:13,260
and so most of the Hobbits

1996
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,260
are back again because it's framed as

1997
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:17,260
this is the record that Bilbo wrote down

1998
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,260
of what happened

1999
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,260
so most of the Hobbits

2000
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,260
in the Shire at the beginning for Lord of the Rings

2001
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,260
have heard Bilbo's stories

2002
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,260
from that book

2003
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,260
but they've heard the fake story

2004
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,260
from the 1937 Hobbit

2005
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:33,260
so it's that

2006
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,260
both versions are canon in the story

2007
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,260
that rules so much

2008
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,260
and basically only I think Frodo

2009
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,260
and Sam and Gandalf

2010
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,260
know the real version of the story

2011
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,260
and it's so thematically fitting

2012
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,260
because Bilbo

2013
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,260
only hours after finding that ring

2014
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,260
felt the need to lie about how he got it

2015
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:53,260
like he felt the need to justify

2016
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,260
his ownership of the ring

2017
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:57,260
it's already influencing him

2018
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:59,260
there was no real reason

2019
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,260
that's a clever retcon

2020
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,260
that actually works with how

2021
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:07,260
he intended to use the ring going forward

2022
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,260
that's really cool

2023
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,260
and there's so much like that

2024
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,260
he kind of

2025
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,260
I mean all of the Legendarium

2026
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:17,260
all of the Lord of the Rings

2027
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,260
Hobbits and everything and stuff

2028
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,260
all is kind of

2029
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,260
there's multiple versions of it

2030
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,260
and it's all kind of canon

2031
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:27,260
or canon is not even important

2032
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,260
because it's all told stories

2033
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,260
and written down manuscripts

2034
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,260
from people in the story

2035
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,260
that got translated many times

2036
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,260
and given to different people

2037
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:39,260
it's kind of beautiful

2038
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:41,260
I love it for that

2039
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:43,260
so like the story

2040
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,260
canonically is written

2041
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,260
or finished by Frodo

2042
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,260
the Lord of the Rings

2043
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,260
but Frodo wasn't

2044
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,260
at every event

2045
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:55,260
so he had to hear it from

2046
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,260
from everyone else

2047
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:59,260
I'm pretty sure the final version

2048
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:01,260
that Tolkien came up with

2049
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:03,260
is that the Lord of the Rings

2050
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,260
and the Hobbit are Bilbo's diary

2051
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,260
Frodo's

2052
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,260
reports of the events

2053
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:11,260
of Lord of the Rings

2054
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,260
combined with

2055
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,260
I think after

2056
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,260
Frodo gave the book to Sam

2057
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,260
when he left to the Grey Havens

2058
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,260
and Sam completed it and I think Sam's family too

2059
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,260
and then the book was given to Minas Tirith

2060
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,260
to Gondor

2061
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,260
where like historians

2062
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,260
kind of added annotations

2063
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,260
and changed a few things

2064
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,260
and like added some

2065
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,260
information where it was needed

2066
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,260
and so on

2067
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:39,260
and it got like stored there

2068
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:41,260
and retranslated in other parts

2069
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:43,260
until I believe

2070
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:45,260
in one version of the Legendarium

2071
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,260
there's actually like an Anglo-Saxon

2072
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,260
human person from the real world

2073
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:51,260
finding that manuscript

2074
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:53,260
and transcribing it into

2075
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,260
old English

2076
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:57,260
and Tolkien pretended to be

2077
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,260
the final translator to translate it

2078
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,260
into modern English

2079
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,260
that's commitment

2080
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,260
it's all really fucking neat

2081
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,260
that commitment to the bit

2082
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,260
that is great because it's like

2083
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,260
from fantasy

2084
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:13,260
fantasy

2085
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,260
is like stories from history

2086
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,260
that were passed down by word of mouth

2087
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,260
and then written down and translated over

2088
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,260
years and they become myths

2089
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:23,260
and he made his own myths

2090
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:25,260
and then came up with a canonical reason

2091
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,260
why magic exists then

2092
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,260
but doesn't in the real world

2093
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:31,260
because it's like

2094
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,260
it's a story

2095
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,260
it's like was there

2096
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,260
Sauron, huh? What?

2097
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,260
Could it have been just a guy with a big axe?

2098
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:41,260
I mean

2099
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,260
sorry if this is a

2100
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,260
shit everybody knows already

2101
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,260
but are you all familiar

2102
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:49,260
with

2103
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,260
oh god

2104
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,260
The Princess Bride

2105
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:55,260
No

2106
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,260
I also don't

2107
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:59,260
Okay, well

2108
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,260
Aasha have you read the book or have you seen the movie?

2109
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,260
I've seen the movie only

2110
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,260
I haven't read the book, I've read parts of it

2111
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:07,260
The movie

2112
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,260
is framed

2113
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:11,260
as

2114
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:13,260
the

2115
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:15,260
grandpa is

2116
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:17,260
reading the story

2117
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,260
to his grandkid

2118
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:21,260
and it's sort of every now and then

2119
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,260
it jumps out of the story to have a conversation

2120
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:25,260
between the grandpa and the kid

2121
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,260
and the grandpa is like

2122
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:29,260
nah, let's skip past this part

2123
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,260
nah, this part's boring

2124
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,260
nah, you don't want to hear the romance stuff

2125
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,260
or whatever

2126
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,260
Well, the book

2127
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,260
which is much less famous than the movie

2128
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,260
is sort of like that

2129
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:43,260
the book is written

2130
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,260
as like an edited manuscript

2131
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,260
of another fantasy

2132
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:49,260
sorry, it's written where there's

2133
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:51,260
notes in red ink

2134
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,260
written by the quote unquote editor

2135
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:55,260
this part went on

2136
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,260
for pages and pages describing

2137
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,260
the lineage of this

2138
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,260
and nobody cares, so I cut it out

2139
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,260
like a fake

2140
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,260
meta

2141
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,260
the author wrote it

2142
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,260
with these fake editors

2143
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,260
notes about how I cut this part out because it sucks

2144
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,260
I

2145
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,260
haven't read the whole book, but I've seen it

2146
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:17,260
and it's got a similar

2147
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:19,260
meta

2148
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:21,260
framing device to it

2149
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:23,260
I mean, Tolkien's

2150
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,260
not many people have read the

2151
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:27,260
not many people have read the book

2152
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:29,260
I think a lot of people don't even know that it is based on a book

2153
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,260
sounds good though

2154
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:33,260
yeah

2155
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,260
I mean, Tolkien's original intention

2156
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:37,260
was to some extent to

2157
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,260
create a mythology for England

2158
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:41,260
because he felt like England doesn't have

2159
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,260
its own fairy tales or myths

2160
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,260
that just belong

2161
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,260
to England because of its history

2162
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,260
of the nomadic invasion

2163
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,260
and

2164
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,260
a bunch of stuff going on

2165
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,260
I don't know the history facts well enough

2166
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,260
yeah, I mean we were just like a bunch of peasants

2167
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:59,260
sitting in mud

2168
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:01,260
and flooring mud around

2169
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,260
and then we got invaded like 18 times

2170
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,260
I guess we have culture now

2171
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,260
I mean, English got kind of banned

2172
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,260
for a while and then mixed with French

2173
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,260
and

2174
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,260
a lot going on

2175
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:15,260
but over time

2176
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:17,260
I guess we're Anglicans

2177
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:19,260
now over time he kind of went into the direction

2178
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,260
yeah, I'm just going to

2179
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,260
have my own

2180
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,260
sub-creation

2181
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,260
he wants his own

2182
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:29,260
what we do now all the time

2183
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,260
it's so fun but he was like

2184
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,260
this is my own thing

2185
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:35,260
and it's not directly based on our history

2186
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:37,260
or whatever

2187
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,260
it's not super supposed to be our world

2188
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,260
but our world on a different

2189
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,260
imaginary

2190
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,260
stage or layer

2191
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,260
and

2192
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:49,260
it's

2193
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,260
really cool

2194
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:53,260
of course

2195
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:55,260
he commented once

2196
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:57,260
that whole thing that he wanted to be

2197
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:59,260
a mythology for England

2198
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:01,260
and that means that when you make an adaptation now

2199
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:03,260
you can't possibly cast

2200
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,260
BPUC actors in it

2201
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:07,260
because all the fans would come and say

2202
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,260
no this is a mythology for England

2203
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,260
you can't do that

2204
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,260
you can't do

2205
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:15,260
black fish and chips

2206
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,260
black people in England

2207
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,260
can't be happening

2208
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,260
it's not true

2209
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:25,260
no

2210
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:27,260
thank you

2211
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:29,260
so brave of you to say it

2212
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:31,260
so brave of you to say it and risk cancelling

2213
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,260
no I'm parroting

2214
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,260
a lot of stupid people I've heard

2215
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,260
over the past few months

2216
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,260
there's a tv series

2217
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,260
being made right?

2218
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,260
or is that also a Game of Thrones one

2219
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,260
being made?

2220
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:47,260
there's apparently

2221
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:49,260
several sort of perspective

2222
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,260
Game of Thrones side stories

2223
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,260
series that are like in production right now

2224
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,260
that dude should just finish his book

2225
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,260
what damn it

2226
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:59,260
but he's like

2227
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:01,260
involved in all of them a little bit I think

2228
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,260
he's involved in all of them

2229
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,260
and

2230
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:07,260
also he seems to be

2231
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,260
like he's

2232
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:11,260
according to his updates it seems like he's

2233
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:13,260
yeah

2234
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,260
his updates seem to suggest that he's more

2235
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,260
focused on the tv shows

2236
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:19,260
finishing

2237
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,260
it's a classic like I'm gonna start a bunch of new

2238
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:23,260
projects because I want to procrastinate

2239
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:25,260
really hard on this one that I have to do

2240
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,260
and I know I have to do it

2241
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:29,260
I mean

2242
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:31,260
what if I did anything else

2243
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,260
what if I did a writing game

2244
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:35,260
I mean song of ice and fire

2245
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,260
we should get George R. R. Martin

2246
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:39,260
from the podcast

2247
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:41,260
yes Ben have you seen that

2248
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,260
so that he doesn't have to write his book

2249
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,260
have you seen a Preston Jacobs video where he like

2250
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,260
figures out how much he has written

2251
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,260
since

2252
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,260
that was really depressing

2253
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:53,260
I'm glad you're a Preston head

2254
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,260
I am

2255
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,260
I don't

2256
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:59,260
he

2257
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,260
he's a Game of Thrones guy

2258
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,260
he is kind of known in community

2259
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,260
as a little bit of like tinfoil

2260
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:07,260
because he has really advanced

2261
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:09,260
crazy theories

2262
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,260
all kind of make sense though

2263
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:13,260
the man is a misunderstood

2264
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,260
genius

2265
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:17,260
the man knows George better than George

2266
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,260
knows himself

2267
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,260
maybe we'll see

2268
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,260
history will vindicate you Preston

2269
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,260
no history won't because

2270
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,260
the books are never gonna get done

2271
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,260
we'll never know

2272
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,260
we'll never know if Quentin survived

2273
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,260
oh god

2274
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,260
true

2275
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:37,260
but he made a video

2276
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,260
he made a video where he basically went back

2277
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:41,260
through like everything George

2278
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,260
has ever said on the subject

2279
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,260
and like pretty much constructed

2280
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:47,260
a theory of like okay based on

2281
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:49,260
everything George has said how much do we think

2282
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,260
he's actually written and the answer

2283
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,260
is like some

2284
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,260
but like maybe like a quarter

2285
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,260
of a book now the worst thing is that

2286
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,260
he kind of figured out that George has

2287
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,260
probably written anything for like the first

2288
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,260
like eight years

2289
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,260
after the last book

2290
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,260
because he wrote too much for the

2291
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,260
last book he had like a few chapters

2292
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:11,260
left over and so

2293
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,260
like he could kind of just

2294
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,260
said yeah I have so this much done of the new

2295
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,260
book but he could have just referred to the old chapters

2296
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:19,260
that he already had done

2297
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,260
from the beginning and

2298
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:23,260
he probably hasn't really started writing

2299
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:25,260
anything new until like two years ago

2300
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:29,260
oh boy yeah

2301
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:31,260
and he's well

2302
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,260
busy

2303
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,260
yeah and he also said that he doesn't

2304
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:37,260
want anyone else to finish it

2305
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,260
when he's dead so

2306
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,260
I wonder how's that gonna work out

2307
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,260
come on just let

2308
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,260
someone else finish it

2309
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,260
come on you're gonna be dead

2310
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,260
someday

2311
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,260
who cares

2312
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,260
who cares at that point

2313
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:57,260
Preston tries to finish it right now

2314
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:59,260
I want to on the subject

2315
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:01,260
of black characters

2316
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:03,260
in Tolkien I did see

2317
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,260
that one dwarf

2318
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,260
and I was enraged

2319
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,260
she's barely got a beard

2320
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,260
it's bullshit

2321
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:13,260
it's bullshit the story

2322
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,260
clearly says that female

2323
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,260
dwarves have beards just like the men

2324
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,260
and non dwarves can't tell them apart

2325
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,260
and then they get the oh they get

2326
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:23,260
oh here's a girl dwarf

2327
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:25,260
and she's got oh she's got these delicate

2328
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:27,260
little sideburns oh these cute little sideburns

2329
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,260
she's got a beard guys no

2330
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,260
no that's not what it's

2331
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:33,260
that's not textual

2332
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:35,260
you cowards

2333
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,260
okay the thing is

2334
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,260
the thing is

2335
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,260
it's kind of debatable

2336
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,260
if that's actually in the books because

2337
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,260
of the nature of how Tolkien's

2338
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,260
writing works

2339
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:49,260
there is a book where he says that

2340
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,260
all dwarves, male and female

2341
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,260
get born with beards

2342
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,260
and that's fine there's also stuff like

2343
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,260
oh dwarves never get their beards cut off

2344
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,260
because that's like really

2345
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:01,260
shameful for them so they don't shave or whatever

2346
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:03,260
the thing is

2347
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:05,260
yeah that's in one of the thing that's like

2348
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,260
somewhere published in History of Middle Earth

2349
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,260
so not even in any of the main

2350
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,260
big publications

2351
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,260
in the Lord of the Rings

2352
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:15,260
it just says that

2353
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:17,260
dwarf men and women are like

2354
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:19,260
close in appearance

2355
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,260
not specifying more

2356
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:23,260
and there's also different

2357
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:25,260
older writings where

2358
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:27,260
he says that's another retcon by the way

2359
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:29,260
do you know how Gimli in the movie says

2360
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:31,260
oh there's like a legend that

2361
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:33,260
a dwarf and women get born

2362
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,260
oh no like dwarves just get born

2363
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:37,260
out of stone we don't even have women

2364
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,260
that's actually something that Tolkien

2365
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:41,260
wrote in an earlier version of the same

2366
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:43,260
universe

2367
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,260
back in the day dwarves were just like

2368
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,260
constructed stone beings that were also

2369
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,260
I mean that's how they were originally

2370
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:51,260
made by

2371
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,260
what the fuck is that

2372
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,260
yes Aula made

2373
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:57,260
them out of stone

2374
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:59,260
the first dwarves

2375
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,260
yeah the seven dwarf fathers

2376
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,260
we don't even know if there were any women

2377
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:05,260
where did the first ones come from

2378
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:07,260
it's all a little unclear

2379
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,260
yeah exactly

2380
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,260
I think Tolkien hated

2381
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,260
Snow White the Disney movie

2382
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:15,260
a lot and his daughter really loved it

2383
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:17,260
and

2384
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:19,260
he had a big problem with that

2385
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:21,260
but yeah and that's a thing

2386
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:23,260
there's like multiple versions of that

2387
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:25,260
I think in a Tolkien book that

2388
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,260
just came out this year or last year

2389
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:29,260
by the way

2390
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:31,260
there's new Tolkien books coming out every year

2391
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,260
because there's so much writing to it that still gets

2392
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:35,260
published there's still not done

2393
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,260
from his like from his

2394
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,260
like old like journals and stuff

2395
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:41,260
yeah yeah there's still

2396
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:43,260
material there's a new Tolkien book coming out

2397
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,260
this year called the fall of Númenor

2398
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:47,260
which will have

2399
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,260
more original text probably

2400
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,260
that haven't been published

2401
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:53,260
there's so much

2402
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:55,260
but yeah and in that

2403
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,260
new book it specifically states

2404
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,260
all male

2405
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,260
capitalized dwarves have beers

2406
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:03,260
and that's one of his latest writings so

2407
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:05,260
it seems like he changed his mind a few times

2408
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,260
but in general I agree

2409
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:11,260
with you I think it's cool

2410
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:13,260
I just want to be mad

2411
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,260
that's what the internet is for

2412
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,260
listen

2413
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,260
obviously I'm actually just mad

2414
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,260
that she's black but I can't say that

2415
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,260
so I have to pretend that it's about the beers

2416
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,260
okay?

2417
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,260
let me have it

2418
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:29,260
yeah that's the point actually

2419
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:31,260
I actually also would like to see

2420
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,260
dwarven women of beards

2421
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:35,260
that would be great and

2422
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:37,260
yeah I agree

2423
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:39,260
even if there's a textual

2424
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:41,260
reasoning for it I still think it would have been cooler

2425
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:43,260
if she just had a beer

2426
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,260
they could still make

2427
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:47,260
they could still give her feminine features

2428
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,260
they could give eyelashes or whatever

2429
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:51,260
they did add a bit in the Hobbit movies

2430
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,260
there's a few background dwarven women

2431
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:55,260
that have bigger sideburns

2432
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:57,260
at least and a little bit of chin and beard

2433
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,260
but

2434
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,260
it really doesn't make sense why beards

2435
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:03,260
are a thing anyway

2436
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:05,260
why doesn't hair come out of the

2437
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,260
chin on some people and not on others

2438
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,260
why the hormones is that

2439
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:11,260
is that why?

2440
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:13,260
what's the purpose of this?

2441
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,260
I don't get humans they don't make sense

2442
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:17,260
keep your chin warm

2443
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:19,260
women need their chin warm

2444
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,260
everyone not likes a warm chin

2445
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:23,260
no they don't

2446
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:25,260
women should be cold all the time

2447
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:27,260
and God said

2448
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:29,260
you know

2449
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,260
when Eve ate the apple

2450
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,260
God said women will always be cold

2451
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:35,260
in the office the AC will always be

2452
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,260
turned up a little too high and they'll complain

2453
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:39,260
about it forever

2454
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:41,260
and so it was

2455
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:43,260
on earth as it was in heaven

2456
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:45,260
I read the bible

2457
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:47,260
makes sense

2458
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:49,260
it's the only mythology for england that I need

2459
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,260
there's a weird thing going on with the new tv show

2460
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:53,260
that

2461
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:55,260
they casted a few B.P.C. actors

2462
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:57,260
for it

2463
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,260
and that's

2464
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:01,260
one of them was an elf

2465
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,260
that's probably the most debated one

2466
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:05,260
but

2467
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:07,260
I just read it don't care

2468
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,260
I think middle earth is big enough that it's possible

2469
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:11,260
and

2470
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,260
I mean there's like

2471
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,260
I've been watching this guy's videos

2472
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:17,260
and I know there's a bunch of different elf

2473
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:19,260
tribes

2474
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,260
there's a lot of different elf groups

2475
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:23,260
I don't think I can list them all off

2476
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,260
they have many different names as well

2477
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:27,260
there's like way more regions

2478
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:29,260
in middle earth than

2479
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:31,260
just the ones that you hear about

2480
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:33,260
in lord of the rings

2481
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:35,260
it's all underwater

2482
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,260
there's a ballerian

2483
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:39,260
and numinor

2484
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:41,260
ballerian is bigger than middle earth

2485
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:43,260
that we see in lord of the rings

2486
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,260
and it's all underwater and gone

2487
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:47,260
numinor as well

2488
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,260
wow middle earth is a planet

2489
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:51,260
well

2490
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:53,260
wait no middle earth is

2491
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:55,260
the plate

2492
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,260
middle earth is like the land

2493
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,260
the planet is called

2494
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,260
I forget what the world is called

2495
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:03,260
I got it

2496
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,260
I think outer actually

2497
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,260
includes all creation

2498
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:09,260
including space

2499
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:11,260
and everything around it

2500
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,260
I see

2501
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:15,260
but middle earth is like

2502
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,260
the land in the middle

2503
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,260
and it used to be actually a flat earth

2504
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,260
and then turned round at some point

2505
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:23,260
wait what did I want to get to

2506
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:25,260
oh yeah

2507
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,260
the elf of color

2508
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,260
oh yeah

2509
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:31,260
the EOC

2510
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,260
yeah exactly

2511
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:35,260
the thing is melanin

2512
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:37,260
like doesn't even

2513
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:39,260
it's not even a thing

2514
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:41,260
I mean the thing is

2515
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:43,260
what do you mean

2516
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,260
middle earth is not based on science in most ways

2517
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,260
the most scientific thing about middle earth

2518
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:49,260
is like the language development

2519
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:51,260
that's like because Tolkien knew

2520
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,260
a lot about that and he made sure

2521
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,260
that that's all correct and actually

2522
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,260
really detailed

2523
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:59,260
the sun of middle earth is not our sun

2524
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:01,260
it's like a magical glowing

2525
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,260
fruit from

2526
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:05,260
one of the two trees that lit the world

2527
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,260
before sun and moon existed

2528
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,260
and it's like a magical glowing

2529
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:11,260
fruit that gets carried by an angelic being

2530
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,260
over the planet

2531
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,260
and then like under the

2532
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:17,260
I guess under the flat earth plate

2533
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:19,260
and then on the other side up again

2534
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,260
and the sun has kind of like

2535
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:23,260
a relationship with the moon

2536
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:25,260
and that's why the moon always wants to get closer to the sun

2537
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:27,260
is also being that's carrying a magic

2538
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:29,260
flower or something

2539
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:31,260
and like that's why he has like

2540
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,260
stains because he gets too close to the sun or something

2541
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:35,260
like

2542
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:37,260
and elves got kind of

2543
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:39,260
made before sun even existed

2544
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:41,260
like they should be all albinos

2545
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:43,260
I guess

2546
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:45,260
but like middle of biology doesn't

2547
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,260
make any sense there's no real reason

2548
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:49,260
why specific people should have

2549
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:51,260
specific skin colors

2550
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:53,260
it's all fair game really

2551
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,260
I mean in earth

2552
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,260
different peoples

2553
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:59,260
living in different places

2554
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,260
developed different physical

2555
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,260
attributes so why not

2556
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,260
elves why not

2557
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:07,260
dwarves etc

2558
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:09,260
oh god there was a

2559
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,260
I was watching a Trey the explainer

2560
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:13,260
video you ever see that guy

2561
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,260
I was watching one

2562
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,260
it was about the um I think

2563
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:19,260
I hope I'm remembering they're called the Ainu

2564
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:21,260
the indigenous people of Japan

2565
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:23,260
right for saying that I thought you meant

2566
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:25,260
the Ainu or as in like all the

2567
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:27,260
Valar and the Maya but yeah

2568
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:29,260
no no no the Ainu

2569
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:31,260
are this um this indigenous

2570
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:33,260
tribe

2571
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,260
or something that was there in Japan

2572
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,260
before you know what we think

2573
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:39,260
of as the ethnically Japanese

2574
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,260
colonized it more or less

2575
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,260
and the

2576
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,260
he was going into like um

2577
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:47,260
oh god I forget the terms but like

2578
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:49,260
the gene

2579
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,260
like groups right like you can

2580
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:53,260
you can track um

2581
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:55,260
like gene groupings right like

2582
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:57,260
different ethnic groups sometimes

2583
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,260
share these like

2584
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:01,260
gene packets

2585
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:03,260
and by like oh this

2586
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:05,260
these people have these gene these people

2587
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,260
they look different but they have

2588
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,260
they share this gene packet so we can see like

2589
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:11,260
okay well they must share a common ancestor

2590
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:13,260
they they these two groups must

2591
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:15,260
have somehow been like a split in

2592
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:17,260
this other third group that came from a third place

2593
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:19,260
and it's like you might not think they were the same

2594
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:21,260
but they actually share a relation and you can

2595
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:23,260
tell by looking at you know these

2596
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:25,260
these gene clusters and uh

2597
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:27,260
the frickin these

2598
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:29,260
these Ainu like they're not

2599
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,260
uh they they have

2600
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,260
curly they're they're

2601
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:35,260
light skinned like

2602
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,260
lighter than than Japanese like they have

2603
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:39,260
like Caucasian like white skin

2604
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,260
they have curly dark hair

2605
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:43,260
and blue eyes

2606
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,260
uh and yet they share

2607
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,260
genes

2608
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,260
like they're most closely related

2609
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,260
to um this like

2610
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:53,260
dark skinned

2611
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:55,260
uh people that live like exclusively

2612
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,260
on like the coast of like

2613
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:59,260
the Indian Ocean or so they're like one little

2614
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:01,260
place they don't look anything

2615
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,260
alike but they have like a remark they

2616
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:05,260
share these these gene packets

2617
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,260
and like the only two groups that do so

2618
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,260
so even in the real world

2619
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:11,260
it doesn't always make sense obviously

2620
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:13,260
the video the video showed

2621
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,260
like oh god I wish I had

2622
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,260
the diagram but it was like

2623
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:19,260
it was like basically a sort

2624
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,260
of like a flow chart of like

2625
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:23,260
you know human genetic

2626
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:25,260
uh like ethnic groups that had like

2627
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:27,260
split and split and split and split and

2628
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:29,260
split and like it's

2629
01:47:29,260 --> 01:47:31,260
it's totally like it's way

2630
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,260
more complicated there's so many

2631
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:35,260
more branches than I could even

2632
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:37,260
think of and some of them yeah and

2633
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,260
some of them split in ways like that like like these

2634
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:41,260
two different groups that ended up looking

2635
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,260
totally different but they are kind

2636
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,260
of related to each other

2637
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,260
like more closely than than

2638
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,260
some others uh that even ones

2639
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,260
that like look similar so

2640
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:53,260
yeah this kind of thing

2641
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:55,260
is just a thing that like

2642
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,260
humans and human

2643
01:47:57,260 --> 01:47:59,260
adjacent creatures can be

2644
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:01,260
like expected to do over

2645
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:03,260
you know but uh

2646
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,260
over you know geological

2647
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:07,260
periods of time

2648
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:09,260
differentiate themselves

2649
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:11,260
physically right

2650
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:13,260
yeah but don't you know that there's

2651
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,260
only white people in Europe

2652
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:17,260
like of course

2653
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:19,260
everything I just everything I just

2654
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,260
everything I just said was a test and you pass

2655
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:23,260
I'm just

2656
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:25,260
I'm just gonna disappear now

2657
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,260
whew

2658
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:29,260
whew

2659
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:31,260
like that's the wind

2660
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,260
the second I hit Europe

2661
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:35,260
ground dude it's

2662
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,260
it's crazy how much the outrage

2663
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,260
against this casting and the Sean

2664
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:41,260
general has been

2665
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:43,260
very weird for me to

2666
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,260
witness because

2667
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:47,260
like Tolkien hasn't really

2668
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:49,260
been that relevant for

2669
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:51,260
a while like ever since the Hobbit movies

2670
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:53,260
came out like for some reason

2671
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,260
companies didn't touch it that much

2672
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,260
like there were no

2673
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:59,260
like there was no big sequel

2674
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:01,260
series that will accept the Hobbit movies

2675
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,260
really well I feel like video games and stuff

2676
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:05,260
but it was very quiet yeah

2677
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:07,260
I feel like the rights must have been

2678
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:09,260
really expensive at that point

2679
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:11,260
oh it's the most expensive TV show of all time

2680
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:13,260
because of that

2681
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:15,260
really yeah apparently they

2682
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:17,260
I don't know how well the Hobbit movies did

2683
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,260
the Hobbit movies did

2684
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:21,260
obviously had the brand recognition

2685
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:23,260
to get a lot of money but like

2686
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:25,260
I don't think people liked them

2687
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:27,260
critically I think they're kind of disliked

2688
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:29,260
yeah in general

2689
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:31,260
they're kind of forgettable

2690
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,260
the last two especially the first one's

2691
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:35,260
really good

2692
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:37,260
but

2693
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,260
yeah and so I haven't really

2694
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:41,260
seen like the internet

2695
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:43,260
the very bad

2696
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,260
racist gamer internet

2697
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:47,260
fandom descend onto my

2698
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:49,260
fandom

2699
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:51,260
as like happened to Star Wars

2700
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:53,260
or whatever when they cast like

2701
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,260
a black stormtrooper

2702
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,260
a few years ago like I saw that

2703
01:49:57,260 --> 01:49:59,260
in Star Wars and I was like oh yeah my talking fandom

2704
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,260
that's like everyone's nice

2705
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,260
everyone's good but then they all came

2706
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,260
we're not like those

2707
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,260
we're not like those toxic Star Wars

2708
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,260
yeah it turns out we actually are

2709
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,260
I mean they are

2710
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:13,260
it's there's

2711
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:15,260
there's a lot of really horrible

2712
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:17,260
YouTubers who

2713
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:19,260
like promote that stuff

2714
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:21,260
it's I mean

2715
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:23,260
some YouTubers will

2716
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:25,260
don't even really give a fuck

2717
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,260
they'll swoop in

2718
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,260
to any

2719
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:31,260
subject if there's a

2720
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,260
if there's an SJW

2721
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,260
if there's an SJW to be owned

2722
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:37,260
yeah I mean

2723
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,260
the Lord of the Rings

2724
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:41,260
is not like

2725
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,260
there's a niche of like

2726
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,260
super nerds who read the entire

2727
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,260
Silmarillion but then there's like

2728
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:49,260
the vast majority of people

2729
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:51,260
who know what the Lord of the Rings is are just people

2730
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:53,260
who grew up and

2731
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:55,260
saw the movies with when they were out

2732
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:57,260
or relevant and they're like

2733
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:59,260
oh yeah

2734
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:01,260
killing orcs

2735
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,260
do you remember when Legolas killed

2736
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,260
that big elephant all by himself

2737
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:07,260
like that's the sort of people

2738
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,260
who could forget

2739
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:11,260
who could easily slot into like

2740
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,260
a random like gamer racist

2741
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:15,260
stereotype later in life

2742
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:17,260
and they would just be like

2743
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:19,260
I can't believe that my favorite

2744
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:21,260
show where they kill elephants

2745
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:23,260
with one elf has

2746
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:25,260
black people in it now

2747
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,260
I can't believe it

2748
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:29,260
it's problematic because

2749
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:31,260
I like elephants and it's

2750
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,260
bad that they died in that war

2751
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:35,260
leave them out of leave the elephants out of it

2752
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:37,260
I can't believe that

2753
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:39,260
I know exactly what they're gonna do in this show

2754
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,260
they're gonna have a black elf and they're gonna kill two elephants

2755
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:43,260
that's just unrealistic

2756
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,260
they can't kill two elephants

2757
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:47,260
the white elf has to kill more elephants

2758
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:49,260
has to kill

2759
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:51,260
kill cow

2760
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:53,260
that's just more realistic

2761
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,260
I think so

2762
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,260
and talking is all about realism as you know

2763
01:51:57,260 --> 01:51:59,260
that's right

2764
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,260
there's also

2765
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,260
a bunch of critique from the other side

2766
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:05,260
just because of like

2767
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:07,260
for example the beard thing with the dwarven lady

2768
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:09,260
who

2769
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:11,260
and also the haircuts in general

2770
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:13,260
are a little odd of the characters

2771
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,260
like for example that black elf has

2772
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:17,260
like very short

2773
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:19,260
like

2774
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:21,260
super short cut hair

2775
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,260
and a bunch of other

2776
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,260
a bunch of other male elves also have short hair

2777
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:27,260
so it kind of seems like

2778
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:29,260
they're trying to make them

2779
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:31,260
like more masculine in general

2780
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,260
even though they were kind of like

2781
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:35,260
transcending that in the Peter Jackson movies

2782
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:37,260
there's nothing

2783
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,260
there's no real textural basis

2784
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:41,260
I think a black elf would look pretty cool with like dreads

2785
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:43,260
yeah

2786
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:45,260
like long dreads in a big like

2787
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,260
you know tail or whatever

2788
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:49,260
that could be cool

2789
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,260
they gave Elrond very short hair

2790
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:53,260
which is odd

2791
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,260
they did that in like animated movies before

2792
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:57,260
but

2793
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:59,260
theoretically I don't really care

2794
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:01,260
but it does seem like

2795
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:03,260
either they just wanted to make the characters

2796
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:05,260
more distinguishable

2797
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:07,260
or they just wanted to make some of them

2798
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,260
look more masculine more traditionally

2799
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:11,260
masculine also like

2800
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:13,260
making the gender roles a little more clear

2801
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,260
I'm okay with it

2802
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:17,260
if like there's like maybe one

2803
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,260
elf group that like

2804
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:21,260
oh yeah other elves grow their hair long

2805
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:23,260
we cut our short because like

2806
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:25,260
I don't know we live in the

2807
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:27,260
in the hills or whatever

2808
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:29,260
we live in the rolling

2809
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:31,260
hills and it's hot

2810
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:33,260
out there so we cut our hair

2811
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,260
or just cut them short for war

2812
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:37,260
or whatever

2813
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:39,260
you can make up anything

2814
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:41,260
it doesn't exist

2815
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:43,260
yeah but don't you know that they are like

2816
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:45,260
ruining Tolkien's legacy

2817
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:47,260
they are actually going to rewrite the books

2818
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:49,260
and he's dead

2819
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,260
he's dead it doesn't matter

2820
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:53,260
but before we achieve the England

2821
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,260
how would you fear if they cast a white guy

2822
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,260
in black panther

2823
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:59,260
but never paint

2824
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,260
I want to be a puppet

2825
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:03,260
give

2826
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:05,260
no

2827
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:07,260
never give never

2828
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:09,260
never paint is just

2829
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:11,260
he's just concerned about the integrity

2830
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:13,260
of his homeland of England

2831
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,260
you just got to let him

2832
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:17,260
you just got to let him have this one

2833
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:19,260
okay one last

2834
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:21,260
thing on the hair thing

2835
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:23,260
seeing a lot of fan art over the last few years

2836
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:25,260
of the Simmarillion characters

2837
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:27,260
I can kind of understand why they wanted

2838
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:29,260
to give all the elves different hair

2839
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:31,260
cuts because you couldn't distinguish

2840
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:33,260
them otherwise

2841
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:35,260
like I just

2842
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:37,260
posted the fan art of like the entire

2843
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:39,260
like House of Finnaut

2844
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:41,260
and Fingalfin

2845
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:43,260
I guess House of Finnaut

2846
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:45,260
and like they're all just long

2847
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:47,260
haired pretty boys

2848
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:49,260
that's all what they are

2849
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:51,260
they all part their hair

2850
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,260
the same way

2851
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:55,260
and if you have a cast where

2852
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:57,260
like in Lord of the Rings moves you only had

2853
01:54:57,260 --> 01:54:59,260
like one elf that was important

2854
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:01,260
they go last for most of the time

2855
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:03,260
and if you have a cast with like 10 elves

2856
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:05,260
yeah makes sense

2857
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:07,260
you got to do something

2858
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:09,260
you got to do something to make them look

2859
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:11,260
the show can still suck though

2860
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:13,260
but I'm hopeful

2861
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:15,260
I'm always hopeful

2862
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:17,260
I don't know

2863
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:19,260
one thing I always liked about

2864
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:21,260
World of Warcraft is

2865
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:23,260
obviously since it's a game where you can play

2866
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,260
as all of these different fancy races

2867
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:27,260
customization

2868
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,260
is always like key

2869
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:31,260
like the ability to have

2870
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:33,260
many different hairstyles

2871
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:35,260
with new ones added every so often

2872
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,260
various skin tones for

2873
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:39,260
every race

2874
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:43,260
it's great

2875
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:45,260
I like character customization

2876
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:47,260
and

2877
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:49,260
you can make stuff that looks

2878
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:51,260
so different

2879
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:53,260
but still fits within what is

2880
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:55,260
understood to be that kind of a race

2881
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:57,260
like a goblin still looks

2882
01:55:57,260 --> 01:55:59,260
like a goblin even though it's got all these different

2883
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:01,260
things about it

2884
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:03,260
the Peter Jackson movies

2885
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:05,260
work great in my opinion

2886
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:07,260
at least the first three

2887
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:09,260
but I think they did

2888
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:11,260
a little bit of a damage

2889
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:13,260
to the general perception

2890
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:15,260
of Tolkien's world

2891
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,260
because they were so successful

2892
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:19,260
that they outgrew the books

2893
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:21,260
and every new adaptation

2894
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:23,260
has to fight against that now

2895
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:25,260
they kind of marvel-movie

2896
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,260
way more people have seen the marvel movies

2897
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,260
than have read the comic books

2898
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:31,260
so the movie versions are

2899
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:33,260
the version that most people

2900
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,260
or elves have to have long hair now

2901
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,260
forever or else everyone will complain

2902
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,260
wait weren't you

2903
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,260
just complaining about

2904
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:43,260
an elf not having long hair

2905
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:47,260
yeah

2906
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:49,260
I can see both sides of the argument I would say

2907
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:53,260
I hate people who dismiss it

2908
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:55,260
just because they have long hair

2909
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:57,260
but I

2910
01:56:57,260 --> 01:56:59,260
can critique it but I can also see

2911
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:01,260
why they would do it

2912
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:03,260
it's fine

2913
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:05,260
I can also

2914
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:07,260
it's just a thing

2915
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:09,260
it's a hairstyle

2916
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:11,260
you can change your hair and if there's a clan

2917
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:13,260
you have to wear your hair this way

2918
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,260
then it would make sense

2919
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:17,260
that's the fashion

2920
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:19,260
that's what we like

2921
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:21,260
us elves we like doing this

2922
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:23,260
if there's different elves that live in different places

2923
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:25,260
that wear their hair different

2924
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:27,260
you just explain it that way

2925
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:29,260
it's not like a

2926
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:31,260
you don't

2927
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:33,260
baby elves

2928
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:35,260
don't come out of the womb looking

2929
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:37,260
like with that hair parting

2930
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:39,260
with the long hair

2931
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:41,260
you know what's weird

2932
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:43,260
in Song of Ice and Fire

2933
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:45,260
that I sort of knew

2934
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,260
but hadn't really thought about

2935
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:49,260
but is totally

2936
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:51,260
true

2937
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,260
in Song of Ice and Fire

2938
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:55,260
in Planetos

2939
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,260
there's

2940
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:59,260
never straight up just like

2941
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:01,260
pseudo human

2942
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:03,260
basically like Neanderthals

2943
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:05,260
or like even more distantly related

2944
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:07,260
like almost humans

2945
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:09,260
squishers

2946
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:11,260
and there's one from

2947
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:13,260
Sotheros and there's one that lives on that

2948
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:15,260
one little island up to the north

2949
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:17,260
of like

2950
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:19,260
the Dothraki continent

2951
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:21,260
I don't remember what they're called but like

2952
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:23,260
yeah there are these like

2953
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:25,260
people that are like

2954
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:27,260
sort of human and some of them

2955
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:29,260
can sort of speak

2956
01:58:29,260 --> 01:58:31,260
like human language but like

2957
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:33,260
they can't breed with humans

2958
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:35,260
or they'll only have stillbirth offspring

2959
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:37,260
which is like really

2960
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:39,260
freaky

2961
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:41,260
Neanderthals

2962
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:45,260
Neanderthals could theoretically

2963
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:47,260
maybe breed with

2964
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:49,260
Homo sapiens

2965
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:51,260
but I think that's what that's alluding to

2966
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:53,260
the time in history where

2967
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:55,260
Homo sapiens sapiens and Neanderthals

2968
01:58:55,260 --> 01:58:57,260
existed at the same time for a bit

2969
01:58:57,260 --> 01:58:59,260
yeah but like even more

2970
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:01,260
different right like even more

2971
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:03,260
like I don't know

2972
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:05,260
there's one that are down in like the

2973
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:07,260
southern

2974
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:09,260
place the Sotheros that are like

2975
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:11,260
they're very like ape like

2976
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:13,260
it's actually called Sotheros

2977
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:15,260
I don't know if that's like an official name

2978
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:17,260
that might just be a fandom name

2979
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:19,260
there's Westeros and Essos

2980
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:21,260
and that's all I know

2981
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,260
I think

2982
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:25,260
I don't know if it's a fan name or if it's a

2983
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:27,260
planetos is definitely a fan name

2984
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:29,260
that's true the planet doesn't actually

2985
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:31,260
have a name

2986
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:33,260
oh shit I don't remember what these other

2987
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:35,260
people are called but like

2988
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,260
imagine if that was real in the real world

2989
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:39,260
I mean it used to be

2990
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:41,260
I know but like

2991
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:43,260
imagine if there were like

2992
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:45,260
some place in like a jungle

2993
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:47,260
in like I don't know Africa

2994
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:49,260
or like South America or

2995
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:51,260
where you could go and there

2996
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:53,260
yeah and there were like

2997
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:55,260
and there were bigfoots and like you could

2998
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:57,260
talk to them and they could kind of learn

2999
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:59,260
English and talk back to you and they sort of had

3000
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:01,260
a little village they built little huts and lived in them

3001
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:03,260
and they would forage for berries

3002
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:05,260
and stuff and you could even like

3003
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:07,260
go and trade with them if you wanted to but like

3004
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:09,260
and like

3005
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:11,260
someone at some point

3006
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,260
discovered that

3007
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,260
if you fucked one

3008
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:17,260
you could get it pregnant but the baby would be still born

3009
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:19,260
and like

3010
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,260
you don't know who figured that out

3011
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:23,260
but somebody did and we know this

3012
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:25,260
we know this is true

3013
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,260
but don't ask out

3014
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:29,260
probably true of almost anything else in the animal kingdom

3015
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:31,260
except us

3016
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:33,260
it's just for

3017
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:35,260
it's a freaky idea

3018
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:37,260
if I lived near

3019
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:39,260
creatures like that they would freak me out

3020
02:00:39,260 --> 02:00:41,260
a lot

3021
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:43,260
that's all we would show them your mobile phone

3022
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,260
and they wouldn't understand

3023
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:47,260
your apps

3024
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:49,260
like how do I explain my apps

3025
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,260
to this creature

3026
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:55,260
I can't even

3027
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:57,260
begin

3028
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:59,260
to answer that question

3029
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:01,260
hey guys

3030
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:03,260
do you know

3031
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:05,260
why they didn't just ask the eagles to bring

3032
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:07,260
the ring into more door

3033
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,260
cause they were still eggs

3034
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:11,260
they haven't hatched yet

3035
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:13,260
the Ibnis are they like the one

3036
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:15,260
they just live on this one little island

3037
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:17,260
what are they

3038
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:19,260
what's their special thing

3039
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:21,260
they're short

3040
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:23,260
but heavy, broad shoulder

3041
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:25,260
broad chested, have long arms

3042
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:27,260
they kinda sound like neanderthals actually

3043
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:29,260
short and thick necks, massive jaws

3044
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:31,260
and large square teeth, small sunken eyes

3045
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:35,260
yeah they are able to reproduce

3046
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:37,260
but the offspring usually come out deformed

3047
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:41,260
they can speak

3048
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:43,260
but not very well

3049
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,260
I think

3050
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:47,260
Preston's theory is that the others are also just like that

3051
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:49,260
and they're just like another

3052
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,260
people that

3053
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:53,260
struggles up there and that's

3054
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:55,260
why they're attacking us or something

3055
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:57,260
I think he did a video

3056
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:59,260
talking about these

3057
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:01,260
and I think he said

3058
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:03,260
that the others are a little different

3059
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:05,260
the others seem like they have some magical

3060
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:07,260
or technological

3061
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:09,260
explanation

3062
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:11,260
like ice and stuff

3063
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:13,260
Preston's whole thing is that

3064
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:15,260
everything in Game of Thrones

3065
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:17,260
is actually sci-fi

3066
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:19,260
that's his big theory

3067
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:21,260
but the show just kind of

3068
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:23,260
went against all of that

3069
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:25,260
and explained nothing

3070
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:27,260
and it's all just magic

3071
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:29,260
the oily stone

3072
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,260
Preston thinks it's plastic

3073
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:35,260
and

3074
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:37,260
I guess that kinda sounds like how someone

3075
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:39,260
knows what plastic was might describe plastic

3076
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,260
there's a lot of fun things like that

3077
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:43,260
I mean the biggest

3078
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:45,260
clue that convinces me personally

3079
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,260
is that George R.R. Martin is just a sci-fi writer

3080
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:49,260
and he's written so many other sci-fi stories

3081
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:51,260
that have kind of the same things

3082
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:53,260
going on that go on in Game of Thrones

3083
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:57,260
like Hive Minds

3084
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:59,260
and

3085
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:01,260
weird like

3086
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:03,260
genealogical stuff

3087
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:05,260
a song of bits and bytes

3088
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:07,260
the people that may say Preston

3089
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:09,260
just don't understand

3090
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:11,260
that like everything that he says

3091
02:03:11,260 --> 02:03:13,260
is like, he only says it because

3092
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:15,260
it's like George R.R. Martin has written

3093
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:17,260
that exact same thing in a different story

3094
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:19,260
and like

3095
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,260
he's got reasons

3096
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:23,260
for everything

3097
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:25,260
and it's like, I don't know, people come in

3098
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:27,260
with preconceptions, they come in with preconceptions

3099
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:29,260
about what a fantasy story should be

3100
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:31,260
but then Preston was like

3101
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:33,260
well, okay

3102
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:35,260
but like when George

3103
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:37,260
wrote a very similar thing

3104
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:39,260
back in the 70s

3105
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:41,260
here's what the twist ended up being

3106
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:43,260
and it's like

3107
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:45,260
oh, yeah, that is

3108
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:47,260
basically the exact same thing

3109
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:49,260
that's how his writing works most of the time

3110
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:51,260
the children of the forest or whatever

3111
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:53,260
yeah, oh

3112
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:55,260
kind of sounds like he's kind of telling the same

3113
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:57,260
story again

3114
02:03:57,260 --> 02:03:59,260
yeah

3115
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:01,260
it took it back to Lord of Rings

3116
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:03,260
for a second

3117
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:05,260
I have a question

3118
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:07,260
this is a hypothetical

3119
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:09,260
I want to talk about the Ibn Is

3120
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:11,260
no

3121
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:13,260
this is way more important

3122
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:15,260
if Sauron got the ring back

3123
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:17,260
and all the power of Mordor

3124
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:19,260
and all the things he wanted

3125
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:21,260
and then aliens showed up

3126
02:04:21,260 --> 02:04:23,260
would he win, would he be able to defend

3127
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:25,260
Earth with his powers

3128
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:27,260
sorry, would who? Sauron?

3129
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:29,260
Sauron

3130
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:31,260
could Sauron defeat the aliens?

3131
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:33,260
well, there are no aliens

3132
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:35,260
that's a problem

3133
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:37,260
no, no, no

3134
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:39,260
imagine if there were aliens

3135
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:41,260
no, no, no, no

3136
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:43,260
imagine aliens came down

3137
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:45,260
and they were like, beep boop

3138
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:47,260
we're gonna shoot you with a laser gun

3139
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:49,260
like Rick and Morty, you know that show

3140
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:51,260
well, they wouldn't because that's not Iluvatar's plan

3141
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:53,260
for creation

3142
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:55,260
I'm sorry, that's not in the heavenly music

3143
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:57,260
because I love God

3144
02:04:57,260 --> 02:04:59,260
Jesus, and I know these things

3145
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:01,260
no, no, no, Iluvatar

3146
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:03,260
made more than just the things

3147
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:05,260
on Middle Earth, he had other planets

3148
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:07,260
this is so heretical

3149
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:09,260
right now

3150
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:11,260
he's got so many other projects going on

3151
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:13,260
so many irons in the fire and he still hasn't finished his book

3152
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:15,260
he's gonna make

3153
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:17,260
okay, but you know what?

3154
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:19,260
Sauron maybe couldn't deal with the aliens

3155
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:21,260
but Morgoth at the end of the

3156
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:23,260
first age where he had

3157
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:25,260
giant dragons the size of mountains

3158
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:27,260
and

3159
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:29,260
armies of Balrogs

3160
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:31,260
yeah, maybe

3161
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:33,260
I don't know

3162
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:35,260
Sauron's

3163
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:37,260
whole empire

3164
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:39,260
is kind of a pale imitation of what Morgoth had going on

3165
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:41,260
he's just

3166
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:43,260
Morgoth's underling trying to recreate the good old times

3167
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:47,260
on the other hand, the moon

3168
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:49,260
does exist

3169
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:51,260
in Lord of the Rings

3170
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:53,260
so if there was an alien invasion

3171
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:55,260
maybe moon aliens

3172
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:57,260
would be the main aliens

3173
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:59,260
okay, no, but the moon is not actually big

3174
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:01,260
or like

3175
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:03,260
the moon is not like a celestial object

3176
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:05,260
the moon is like a flower

3177
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:07,260
I think

3178
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:09,260
it's a flower of a tree getting carried by an angelic being

3179
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:11,260
it's not our

3180
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:13,260
stone ice moon

3181
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:15,260
little tiny flower bugs

3182
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:17,260
little tiny flower bugs, little tiny hollow night bugs

3183
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:19,260
would come down from the moon

3184
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:21,260
and they'd come down

3185
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:23,260
exactly

3186
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:25,260
that's what I'm saying

3187
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:27,260
that's what I've been saying for years

3188
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:29,260
great, we solved it

3189
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:31,260
yep

3190
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:33,260
would cowboys defeat Mordor

3191
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:35,260
think about this

3192
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:37,260
if cowboys rode into town with their guns

3193
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:39,260
well, Mordor was working on

3194
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:41,260
like, I mean, his Sauron man

3195
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:43,260
was working on like gunpowder

3196
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:45,260
so

3197
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:47,260
they were getting there, they were not that far from cowboys

3198
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:49,260
I'd like to see that

3199
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:51,260
I'd like to see a future where

3200
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:53,260
Sauron got the one ring

3201
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:55,260
and they invented guns

3202
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:57,260
and then we had orcs

3203
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,260
riding wargs

3204
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:01,260
with rifles and guns

3205
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:03,260
going yee-haw

3206
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:05,260
actually, I have good news for you

3207
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:07,260
orcs ride wargs or goblins

3208
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:09,260
goblins ride wargs

3209
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:11,260
goblins do, I don't know what orcs do

3210
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:13,260
I guess they would walk like idiots

3211
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:15,260
are goblins the same as orcs?

3212
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:17,260
in the hobbit, he calls them goblins

3213
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:19,260
because it's more of a children's story, it sounds cuter

3214
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:21,260
I guess, and at some point

3215
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:23,260
he just switches to calling them all orcs

3216
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:25,260
just like the elves are also called gnomes

3217
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:27,260
in the earliest writings

3218
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:29,260
in the hobbit, are the goblins

3219
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:31,260
bigger than Bilba

3220
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:33,260
or are they like human size?

3221
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:35,260
they're like smaller than humans

3222
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:37,260
but bigger than dwarfs and

3223
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:39,260
hobbits

3224
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:41,260
so about how the movie

3225
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:43,260
depicts them

3226
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:45,260
they're a little too big and mighty

3227
02:07:45,260 --> 02:07:47,260
like the urokai are these

3228
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:49,260
giant monsters in the movies

3229
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:51,260
and they're supposed to be

3230
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:53,260
are the urokai sort of like orcish super soldiers?

3231
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:55,260
they are, but they're almost as big

3232
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:57,260
as a human, they still don't get there

3233
02:07:57,260 --> 02:07:59,260
because all evil creations

3234
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:01,260
have to be inferior to

3235
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:03,260
the original

3236
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:05,260
god made beings

3237
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:07,260
I kind of like

3238
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:09,260
that they're giant in the movie

3239
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:11,260
it sells the

3240
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:13,260
scary factor and the danger

3241
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:15,260
it absolutely works

3242
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:17,260
all the practical orcs are amazing

3243
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,260
and that's one of the things

3244
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:21,260
that I really like about this new tv show

3245
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:23,260
is that they're going back to practical

3246
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:25,260
effects for all the orcs

3247
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:27,260
and they hired the same studio

3248
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:29,260
that did them for the movies and they're gonna look disgusting

3249
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:31,260
I remember

3250
02:08:31,260 --> 02:08:33,260
I remember people complaining

3251
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:35,260
about that shot in that one hobbit movie

3252
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:37,260
of like the molten gold

3253
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:39,260
in smog's

3254
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:41,260
smog's treasure

3255
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:43,260
and it looked really bad

3256
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:45,260
it melted faster than

3257
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:47,260
chocolate would melt

3258
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:49,260
the CG is so stupid

3259
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:51,260
gollum looks amazing and

3260
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:53,260
a lot of the orcs

3261
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:55,260
effects look really bad

3262
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:57,260
gollum was like a triumph

3263
02:08:57,260 --> 02:08:59,260
gollum

3264
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:01,260
nobody has

3265
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:03,260
done what they did with gollum

3266
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:05,260
maybe that's not true

3267
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:07,260
but it was a real benchmark

3268
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:09,260
in

3269
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:11,260
not before

3270
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:13,260
but even since

3271
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:15,260
who else even

3272
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:17,260
what's another CG creature that looks as good

3273
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:19,260
as gollum did

3274
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:21,260
I struggle to think of any

3275
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:23,260
off the top of my head

3276
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:25,260
I think one of the greatest things

3277
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:27,260
about gollum is that they always had

3278
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:29,260
them on set, on location

3279
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:31,260
they had the actor

3280
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:33,260
scrub

3281
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:35,260
scrubbing through that little stream

3282
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:37,260
in the landscape of New Zealand

3283
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:39,260
and then they like replaced him

3284
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:41,260
digitally so there was like

3285
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:43,260
kind of little green screen involved

3286
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:45,260
they always had him there

3287
02:09:45,260 --> 02:09:47,260
and then they redid everything in the computer

3288
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:49,260
so it was like a lot of real life reference

3289
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:51,260
I think that's why

3290
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:53,260
gollum is so

3291
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:55,260
so memorable as being

3292
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:57,260
like a really good CG characters

3293
02:09:57,260 --> 02:09:59,260
because you know

3294
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:01,260
when gollum picks up a rock and moves it around

3295
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:03,260
or shuffles on the ground

3296
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:05,260
and then you see the environment

3297
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:07,260
react in a very physical

3298
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:09,260
real looking way

3299
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:11,260
so like things could technically

3300
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:13,260
be better CG characters

3301
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:15,260
but like the way they did gollum

3302
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:17,260
I think is the reason it's so good

3303
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:19,260
that reminds me of

3304
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:21,260
Who Framed Roger Rabbit

3305
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:23,260
you know how like

3306
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:25,260
they would have real props on like

3307
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:27,260
sticks and strings like manipulated

3308
02:10:27,260 --> 02:10:29,260
by people off stage

3309
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:31,260
and then they would animate the cartoon characters

3310
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:33,260
and bring them around

3311
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:35,260
yeah

3312
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:37,260
they would make it as tough

3313
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:39,260
as possible

3314
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:41,260
to add a 2D character into the frame

3315
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:43,260
they would have like shadows moving across the

3316
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:45,260
the set

3317
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:47,260
in like dynamic ways

3318
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:49,260
it's like what if we made it the

3319
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:51,260
most impressive we possibly could

3320
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,260
it would take a lot of effort

3321
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:55,260
and it wouldn't necessarily make the story

3322
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:57,260
better but it would just be cool

3323
02:10:57,260 --> 02:10:59,260
nobody does that anymore

3324
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:01,260
there's too much effort into things

3325
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:03,260
for cool factor they just do

3326
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:05,260
what they are told

3327
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:07,260
I mean that's

3328
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:09,260
I wouldn't say there's nobody but

3329
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:11,260
in general it gets this

3330
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:13,260
I haven't seen anything on the level of Roger Rabbit

3331
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:15,260
in terms of like overdoing

3332
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:17,260
like a 2D animation thing

3333
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:19,260
there was that one like Chip and Dale movie

3334
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:21,260
that tried it and it didn't look

3335
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:23,260
even as good as Roger Rabbit

3336
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:25,260
like having that

3337
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:27,260
combined style

3338
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:29,260
with the voice they had a similar scene

3339
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:31,260
I think they took

3340
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:33,260
one of the funny things

3341
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:35,260
is for some reason they took

3342
02:11:35,260 --> 02:11:37,260
the wrong lesson away from Gollum

3343
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:39,260
they just started casting

3344
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:41,260
specifically anti-circus

3345
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:43,260
as CG characters

3346
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:45,260
like the actor who played Gollum

3347
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:47,260
got really successful playing other

3348
02:11:47,260 --> 02:11:49,260
CG monsters and stuff

3349
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:51,260
it wasn't just

3350
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:53,260
he had a great performance but the technology

3351
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:55,260
and the inventiveness of that

3352
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:57,260
like whole production

3353
02:11:57,260 --> 02:11:59,260
made it great

3354
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:01,260
and they put him in every other thing

3355
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:03,260
like he's that big evil guy

3356
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:05,260
in the new Star Wars movies

3357
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:07,260
like yeah but that's not

3358
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:09,260
wait which guy?

3359
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:11,260
that's funny casting

3360
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:13,260
Snoke

3361
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:15,260
Wait Gollum played Snoke?

3362
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:17,260
yeah

3363
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:19,260
he also played

3364
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:21,260
Planet of the Apes

3365
02:12:21,260 --> 02:12:23,260
Caesar and also

3366
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:25,260
King Kong I believe in the Peter Jackson

3367
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:27,260
King Kong movie

3368
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:29,260
I mean okay I guess

3369
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:31,260
he's everywhere

3370
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:33,260
sure why not

3371
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:35,260
he also played Jon Snow

3372
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:37,260
Jon Snow was completely CG

3373
02:12:39,260 --> 02:12:41,260
yeah

3374
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:43,260
I see

3375
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:45,260
actually it would be kind of cool

3376
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:47,260
if they completely CG Jon Snow after

3377
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:49,260
Steph to make him more in canny

3378
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:51,260
that would be neat

3379
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:53,260
oh like make him

3380
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:55,260
like after he died

3381
02:12:55,260 --> 02:12:57,260
they do like

3382
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:59,260
the thing that they do with actors

3383
02:12:59,260 --> 02:13:01,260
to sort of recreate them

3384
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:03,260
digitally

3385
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:05,260
but they do that with him even though the actor is still alive

3386
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:07,260
but it's like yeah we want you to look weird though

3387
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:09,260
we want you to look like a zombie

3388
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:11,260
that's one of the worst things about Game of Thrones

3389
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:13,260
is that his death didn't affect anything

3390
02:13:13,260 --> 02:13:15,260
nothing happened

3391
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:17,260
it affected people going what's gonna happen next

3392
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:19,260
I better buy anything

3393
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:21,260
hang on no follow up

3394
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:23,260
well it was technically

3395
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:25,260
he got out of his oath

3396
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:27,260
of being a black

3397
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:29,260
knight not a black knight

3398
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:31,260
but he went back to that anyways

3399
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,260
who cares

3400
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:35,260
it was a loophole because

3401
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:37,260
if you made a promise

3402
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:39,260
they didn't even

3403
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:41,260
listen

3404
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:43,260
I know power resides

3405
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:45,260
where men think it resides

3406
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:47,260
but like

3407
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:49,260
you could guard until his death

3408
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:51,260
and there's simply no way around that

3409
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:53,260
you simply cannot

3410
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:55,260
circumvent that unless

3411
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:57,260
there's a tricky little magical

3412
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:59,260
resurrection loophole

3413
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:01,260
so fuck you

3414
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:03,260
Sam also

3415
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:05,260
I think Sam at some point said

3416
02:14:05,260 --> 02:14:07,260
hey we're supposed to guard the realms of men

3417
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:09,260
doesn't mean we have to do it at the wall

3418
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:11,260
we have to do it in general

3419
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:13,260
yeah

3420
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:15,260
that's another tricky little secret loophole

3421
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:17,260
you gotta find a tricky little secret loophole somehow

3422
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:19,260
and they don't even question it

3423
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:21,260
actually that would be fine

3424
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:23,260
that would be cool

3425
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:25,260
if they said oh that's a secret loophole

3426
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:27,260
but then it just goes to other kingdoms

3427
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:29,260
and it's like hey I'm Jon Snow

3428
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:31,260
I used to be a knights watch guy

3429
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:33,260
and nobody questions it

3430
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:35,260
he's not even questioned that people say

3431
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:37,260
hey aren't you an oath breaker

3432
02:14:37,260 --> 02:14:39,260
don't you suck

3433
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:41,260
but nobody does because they don't care

3434
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:43,260
in the later seasons

3435
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:45,260
how's Asha

3436
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:47,260
you know I'll be honest

3437
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:49,260
I didn't watch past the death of Jon Snow

3438
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:51,260
I didn't see the show

3439
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:53,260
after that

3440
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:55,260
I heard it was really bad

3441
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:57,260
I heard it was really bad so I didn't watch it

3442
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:59,260
we're actually watching it together right now

3443
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:01,260
and we just spoiled everything for Asha

3444
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:03,260
when I get the end of season 4

3445
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:05,260
there you go

3446
02:15:07,260 --> 02:15:09,260
I would say Game of Thrones is

3447
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:11,260
good even a bit after

3448
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:13,260
Jon die

3449
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:15,260
death

3450
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:17,260
scenes

3451
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:19,260
gasp

3452
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:21,260
no

3453
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:23,260
he dies

3454
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:25,260
that's not what the pop culture zeitgeist says

3455
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:27,260
the production design is so pretty

3456
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:29,260
I rewatched Game of Thrones

3457
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:31,260
semi-recently

3458
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:33,260
and I came to the decision

3459
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:35,260
that

3460
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:37,260
I like shows even when they suck

3461
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:39,260
when people say

3462
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:41,260
stop to this episode and don't go no further

3463
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:43,260
no that's stupid

3464
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:45,260
it's most of the time not worth

3465
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:47,260
like I don't know

3466
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:49,260
I'd rather watch the thing

3467
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:51,260
and get all of the good out of it

3468
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:53,260
and be a little disappointed

3469
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:55,260
than never know what happens

3470
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:57,260
even though I'll probably hear about it

3471
02:15:57,260 --> 02:15:59,260
really bad shows can be interesting as well

3472
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:01,260
I love the Hobbit movies a lot

3473
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:03,260
even though they have tons of problems

3474
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:05,260
but I just know so much about

3475
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:07,260
the history of them and how they got produced

3476
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:09,260
what all went wrong

3477
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:11,260
and it's just fascinating to see all of that

3478
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:13,260
play out and the potential that they had

3479
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:15,260
and what actually

3480
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:17,260
happened with them

3481
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:19,260
I think that the beginning

3482
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:21,260
of the Hobbit movie is quite nice with the dwarfs

3483
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:23,260
it's so much stuff

3484
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:25,260
they sing that deep deep song that's like really deep

3485
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:27,260
it's the best scene

3486
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:29,260
it's the best scene that whole trilogy is in

3487
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:31,260
and then Bilbo says

3488
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:33,260
literally because they're going downhill

3489
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:35,260
under hill and over

3490
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:37,260
mmm yeah

3491
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:39,260
I like that song by Leonard Nimoyd

3492
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:41,260
about the Hobbit

3493
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:43,260
oh yeah

3494
02:16:43,260 --> 02:16:45,260
oh I don't know

3495
02:16:45,260 --> 02:16:47,260
that's the best Hobbit adaptation

3496
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:49,260
it's the only valid one

3497
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:51,260
no the best Hobbit adaptation

3498
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:53,260
is National Lampoon's

3499
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:55,260
Board of the Rings

3500
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:57,260
oh no

3501
02:16:57,260 --> 02:16:59,260
which I read the first like chapter

3502
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:01,260
of

3503
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:03,260
and oh man

3504
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:05,260
I forget

3505
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:07,260
what they call

3506
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:09,260
they have some stupid other name for Hobbits

3507
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:11,260
in Board of the Rings

3508
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:13,260
but I remember that like

3509
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:15,260
habits I don't know

3510
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:17,260
but they describe whatever they call Hobbits

3511
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:19,260
they describe them as like

3512
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:21,260
like yeah they're small

3513
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:23,260
they're small but they're tough

3514
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:25,260
they can easily defeat

3515
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:27,260
they can easily defeat a creature half their size

3516
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:29,260
if they get the drop on them

3517
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:31,260
and I just thought that was really funny

3518
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:35,260
that's basically all I remember

3519
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:37,260
can you just

3520
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:39,260
now I wonder if you can just do that

3521
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:41,260
like make a parody

3522
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:43,260
a book and publish it

3523
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:45,260
of some big franchise

3524
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:47,260
which is like obviously that franchise

3525
02:17:47,260 --> 02:17:49,260
I guess they don't need

3526
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:51,260
it's been done

3527
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:53,260
if you've seen the Barry Trotter

3528
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:55,260
but freaking fair use

3529
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:57,260
and parody law and whatever

3530
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:59,260
true

3531
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:01,260
I should read those honestly

3532
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:03,260
because now that I know that JK Rowling is horrible

3533
02:18:03,260 --> 02:18:05,260
I might actually prefer those

3534
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:07,260
parody books

3535
02:18:07,260 --> 02:18:09,260
I mean those are old right

3536
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:11,260
yeah they can

3537
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:13,260
I remember seeing them at the same time

3538
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:15,260
the books were coming out

3539
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:17,260
I don't know anything about them

3540
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:19,260
isn't there like a musical

3541
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:21,260
isn't there like a stage play

3542
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:23,260
that's like a parody of Harry Potter

3543
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:25,260
no that was an official thing

3544
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:27,260
it was a real

3545
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:29,260
no not

3546
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:31,260
not cursed child

3547
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:35,260
the burst child

3548
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:37,260
there's a freaking

3549
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:39,260
Harry Potter

3550
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:41,260
parody musical

3551
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:45,260
nope never mind

3552
02:18:47,260 --> 02:18:49,260
maybe it's a YouTube video

3553
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:51,260
I mean there is one called a very Potter musical

3554
02:18:51,260 --> 02:18:53,260
but that's not what I was

3555
02:18:53,260 --> 02:18:55,260
I thought there was a

3556
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,260
is that the little puppet show with Snape Ghost

3557
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:59,260
Snape Snape Snape

3558
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:01,260
Severus Snape

3559
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:03,260
do you know who made that

3560
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:05,260
it was Neil Cisariga

3561
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:07,260
Neil Cisariga

3562
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,260
the guy behind

3563
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:11,260
the guy behind everything

3564
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:13,260
the guy behind fucking everything

3565
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:15,260
you've ever heard of

3566
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:17,260
Minecraft

3567
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:19,260
the guy who did

3568
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:21,260
the guy who did

3569
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:23,260
the freaking ultimate showdown

3570
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:25,260
of ultimate destiny

3571
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:27,260
he did the Harry the Potter

3572
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:29,260
puppet pals

3573
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:31,260
he's lemon demon

3574
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:33,260
mouth sounds

3575
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:35,260
he did

3576
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:37,260
fucking

3577
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:39,260
there's probably like 18 other things

3578
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:41,260
he called John Tron a piece of shit

3579
02:19:41,260 --> 02:19:43,260
that one time and it was really funny

3580
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:45,260
yeah

3581
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:47,260
his crowning achievement

3582
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:49,260
yeah all that other stuff

3583
02:19:49,260 --> 02:19:51,260
is alright

3584
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:53,260
yeah that's his master piece

3585
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:55,260
I'm telling John Tron to go fuck himself

3586
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:57,260
was the piece to resist

3587
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:01,260
he made Brody Quest

3588
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:03,260
if you know that meme video

3589
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:05,260
yes of course

3590
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:09,260
he's a meme master

3591
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:11,260
he's good at making things

3592
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:13,260
that go viral

3593
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:15,260
Potter puppet show was really big when I was in school

3594
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:17,260
same

3595
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:19,260
same

3596
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:21,260
whoa

3597
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:23,260
how do we even

3598
02:20:23,260 --> 02:20:25,260
get on this topic

3599
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:27,260
I've lost the thread

3600
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:29,260
we're just circling from

3601
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:31,260
we're circling the drain

3602
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:33,260
of eternity

3603
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:35,260
Game of Thrones to Lord Rings

3604
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:37,260
back to Harry Potter

3605
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:39,260
as all things go

3606
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:41,260
what would happen

3607
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:43,260
if you gave the ring

3608
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:45,260
to a cricket

3609
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:47,260
no

3610
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:49,260
you know what

3611
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:51,260
it's rock paper scissors

3612
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,260
Game of Thrones

3613
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:55,260
Game of Thrones beats

3614
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:57,260
Lord of the Rings

3615
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,260
because Game of Thrones is a dark

3616
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:01,260
is a dark

3617
02:21:01,260 --> 02:21:03,260
subversion of fantasy tropes

3618
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:07,260
Lord of the Rings beats Harry Potter

3619
02:21:07,260 --> 02:21:09,260
because Lord of the Rings is good

3620
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:11,260
and Harry Potter beats

3621
02:21:11,260 --> 02:21:13,260
Game of Thrones

3622
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:15,260
because it made more money

3623
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:17,260
I don't know

3624
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:19,260
Harry Potter should not be

3625
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:21,260
made to all the money

3626
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:23,260
you know

3627
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:25,260
they all made a shit ton of money

3628
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:27,260
when it comes to

3629
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:29,260
childhood film franchises

3630
02:21:29,260 --> 02:21:31,260
it used to

3631
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:33,260
that I like

3632
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:35,260
there was Lord of the Rings

3633
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:37,260
and Harry Potter coming out at the same time

3634
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:39,260
but then there was Pirates of the Caribbean

3635
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:41,260
I think Pirates of the Caribbean is better

3636
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:43,260
than Harry Potter

3637
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:45,260
it's not based on a book

3638
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:47,260
it's based on a

3639
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:49,260
Disney ride

3640
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:51,260
no

3641
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:53,260
it's not based on a book series

3642
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:55,260
give me a break

3643
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:57,260
it's got to be based on a book series

3644
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:59,260
I could write a book about it

3645
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:01,260
and then it would be based

3646
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:03,260
still

3647
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:05,260
Princess Bride

3648
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:07,260
that's based on a book

3649
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:09,260
is Princess Bride better than Harry Potter

3650
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:11,260
in my current estimation

3651
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:13,260
I would say

3652
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:15,260
it's better than Harry Potter

3653
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:17,260
I probably wouldn't have said so as a kid

3654
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:19,260
people say that

3655
02:22:19,260 --> 02:22:21,260
Percy Jackson is the good version

3656
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:23,260
of Harry Potter

3657
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:25,260
I've never read it

3658
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:27,260
after my time

3659
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:29,260
but I have heard that

3660
02:22:29,260 --> 02:22:31,260
during my time

3661
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:33,260
the people that read

3662
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:35,260
Percy Jackson

3663
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,260
are too young to have real opinions

3664
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:39,260
so I won't trust that until

3665
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:41,260
maybe for like 5 more years

3666
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:43,260
and if they still say that then maybe

3667
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:45,260
maybe

3668
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:47,260
you guys ever read the Spooks

3669
02:22:47,260 --> 02:22:49,260
series of novels

3670
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:51,260
good question

3671
02:22:51,260 --> 02:22:53,260
they probably have a different title in German honestly

3672
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:55,260
it's about this

3673
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:57,260
it's been a long time since I've read these

3674
02:22:57,260 --> 02:22:59,260
but

3675
02:22:59,260 --> 02:23:01,260
it's like a wizard thing

3676
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:03,260
but with very specific rules

3677
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:05,260
vampires

3678
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:07,260
can't cross like a line of salt

3679
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:09,260
so if you're summoning a vampire

3680
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:11,260
for a thing you have to make sure your salt line

3681
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:13,260
is done and there's pentagrams

3682
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:15,260
that's a classic vampire rule

3683
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:17,260
yeah it's a lot of classic

3684
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:19,260
mythical wizarding

3685
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:21,260
rules and

3686
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:23,260
you're a spook that's the name of your job

3687
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:25,260
as you go to places and you

3688
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:27,260
sort out problems as a spook

3689
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:29,260
and there's the Spooks Apprentice

3690
02:23:29,260 --> 02:23:31,260
who's the 7th son of a 7th son

3691
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:33,260
means you're allowed to be a spook

3692
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:35,260
this guy

3693
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:37,260
he's a wizard spook man

3694
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:39,260
and he gets this youngster

3695
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:41,260
under his wing

3696
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:43,260
and there's an adventural 3 or 4

3697
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:45,260
and I enjoyed them very much

3698
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:47,260
that sounds like something I would

3699
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:49,260
have been really into

3700
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,260
it reminds me of the

3701
02:23:51,260 --> 02:23:53,260
Bartimeo sequence

3702
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:55,260
Bartimeo's trilogy, Pog, yes I read those

3703
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:57,260
it's like 4 books I think

3704
02:23:57,260 --> 02:23:59,260
but I think the 4 porn

3705
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:01,260
is actually like a prequel

3706
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:03,260
that takes place in like

3707
02:24:03,260 --> 02:24:05,260
super long ago times

3708
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:07,260
I don't remember

3709
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:09,260
those were good too

3710
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:11,260
Ever heard of Wizards Hall?

3711
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:13,260
Nope

3712
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:15,260
Wizards Hall is

3713
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:17,260
a single novel

3714
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:19,260
about a kid

3715
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:21,260
who goes to wizard school

3716
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:23,260
and it came out 6 years before

3717
02:24:23,260 --> 02:24:25,260
Harry Potter

3718
02:24:25,260 --> 02:24:27,260
and I actually had read it

3719
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:29,260
before Harry Potter

3720
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:31,260
and it was like wow

3721
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:33,260
this is kind of similar to that other book

3722
02:24:33,260 --> 02:24:35,260
but nobody knows about Wizards Hall

3723
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:37,260
it never

3724
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:39,260
kept, it never continued

3725
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:41,260
so I don't know

3726
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:43,260
that's it, that's it, that's the thing about

3727
02:24:43,260 --> 02:24:45,260
Wizards Hall

3728
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:47,260
Did everybody see another British

3729
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:49,260
book series that came out before

3730
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:51,260
Harry Potter

3731
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:53,260
was like

3732
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:55,260
the worst witch

3733
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:57,260
it's like a book franchise

3734
02:24:57,260 --> 02:24:59,260
I've never seen that somewhere

3735
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:01,260
they made a TV adaptation

3736
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,260
oh yeah there's also a movie

3737
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:05,260
that features

3738
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:07,260
what's his name

3739
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:09,260
something curry, Tim Curry?

3740
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:11,260
Tim Curry, Tim Curry

3741
02:25:11,260 --> 02:25:13,260
yeah as a wizard that the girls

3742
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:15,260
spoon over

3743
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:17,260
hmm

3744
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:19,260
oh these are from

3745
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:21,260
oh wow, okay I mean

3746
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:23,260
some of them came out in like the 70s

3747
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:25,260
but they were

3748
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:27,260
they were still coming out in like

3749
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:29,260
the 2010s

3750
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:31,260
I remember this book cover

3751
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:33,260
I don't know if I read it but I remember

3752
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:35,260
seeing this in a library

3753
02:25:35,260 --> 02:25:37,260
post

3754
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:39,260
image

3755
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:41,260
the worst witch has been running for longer than

3756
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:43,260
The Simpsons

3757
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:45,260
Holy shit, yeah

3758
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:47,260
I thought nothing has

3759
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:49,260
before The Simpsons

3760
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:51,260
we didn't have

3761
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:53,260
what's known as a televisions

3762
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:55,260
oh no

3763
02:25:55,260 --> 02:25:57,260
the tragedy

3764
02:25:57,260 --> 02:25:59,260
yeah I feel like I

3765
02:25:59,260 --> 02:26:01,260
missed out on a bunch of those

3766
02:26:01,260 --> 02:26:03,260
because I was so hyper fixated on

3767
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:05,260
Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings when I was young

3768
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:07,260
hey you know

3769
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:09,260
what though? I think

3770
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:11,260
this book

3771
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:13,260
this book came up in my image search

3772
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:15,260
and I feel like we should

3773
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:17,260
talk about it

3774
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:19,260
I'm sorry my internet is being shitty but the

3775
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:21,260
image will load shortly and it's gonna

3776
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:23,260
blow you away

3777
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:25,260
with how funny and silly and goofy and

3778
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:27,260
kooky

3779
02:26:27,260 --> 02:26:29,260
the thing that it will show you

3780
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:31,260
is

3781
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:33,260
just you wait

3782
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:35,260
and he's second now

3783
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:37,260
that bar is almost full there we go

3784
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:43,260
I assume this is like a Christian

3785
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:45,260
like an evangelical Christian thing

3786
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:49,260
why don't we celebrate

3787
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:51,260
Halloween

3788
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:53,260
I try to witness this don't celebrate anything I think

3789
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:55,260
I mean that

3790
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:57,260
and like Christians who think

3791
02:26:57,260 --> 02:26:59,260
anything that's remotely about magic

3792
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:01,260
is saintannic

3793
02:27:01,260 --> 02:27:03,260
yeah that's I think there are more

3794
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:05,260
I think there are more evangelicals

3795
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:07,260
than there are Jehovah's Witnesses

3796
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:09,260
but I mean I guess their reasons are similar

3797
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:11,260
yeah I'm

3798
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:13,260
trying to read the description here on

kids on Halloween will don their paladin

armor they get their sword

3828
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:15,260
and they just lay all the monsters

3829
02:28:15,260 --> 02:28:17,260
go out and slay all the other kids yeah

3830
02:28:17,260 --> 02:28:19,260
well you shouldn't

3831
02:28:19,260 --> 02:28:21,260
told you told you told you

3832
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:23,260
your quote unquote fun would harm you

3833
02:28:23,260 --> 02:28:25,260
you didn't listen

3834
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:27,260
you know I never celebrate the Halloween

3835
02:28:27,260 --> 02:28:29,260
and I would have liked

3836
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:31,260
an explanation because all American cartoon

3837
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:33,260
shows had Halloween

3838
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:35,260
yeah

3839
02:28:35,260 --> 02:28:37,260
they didn't

3840
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:39,260
when I was in Poland

3841
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:41,260
I mean they did they did Halloween

3842
02:28:41,260 --> 02:28:43,260
they didn't really like do it

3843
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:45,260
to the same extent

3844
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:47,260
like

3845
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:49,260
we definitely didn't

3846
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:51,260
have trick or treating like I saw yeah

3847
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:53,260
I saw some people walking around in costumes

3848
02:28:53,260 --> 02:28:55,260
but I didn't really see any like trick or

3849
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:57,260
treating exactly

3850
02:28:57,260 --> 02:28:59,260
which is I only ever went trick or treating

3851
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:01,260
with my mom

3852
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:03,260
when I was very little which is very weird

3853
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:05,260
because like our country is like way

3854
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:07,260
safer than the U.S.

3855
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:09,260
like yeah if anything

3856
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:11,260
we should go out trick or treating

3857
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:13,260
even more

3858
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:15,260
yeah I mean

3859
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:17,260
all right I mean

3860
02:29:17,260 --> 02:29:19,260
there's a I mean I'm taking

3861
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:21,260
this based off of like just seeing

3862
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:23,260
American TV and movies where like

3863
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:25,260
Halloween episodes they're always

3864
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:27,260
in the suburbs

3865
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:29,260
and oh yeah

3866
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:31,260
there's more of like cul-de-sacs

3867
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:33,260
and like more of a I don't know

3868
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:35,260
just I have like two streets to go down

3869
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:37,260
and there's not much that can happen

3870
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:39,260
where everyone's looking outside all the time

3871
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:41,260
yeah it's sort of a

3872
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:43,260
contained but I don't know how much more

3873
02:29:43,260 --> 02:29:45,260
safe that is than like a London suburb

3874
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:47,260
where the houses are smaller

3875
02:29:47,260 --> 02:29:49,260
and closer together

3876
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:51,260
but it's still like a suburb

3877
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:53,260
where I grew up was not good

3878
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:55,260
for trick or treating at all

3879
02:29:55,260 --> 02:29:57,260
I mean we did it a little bit

3880
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:59,260
we would drive to a neighborhood that was a little bit better

3881
02:29:59,260 --> 02:30:01,260
for it but

3882
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:03,260
we were like super big on trick or treating

3883
02:30:03,260 --> 02:30:05,260
I mean we did it

3884
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:07,260
I dressed up one time for Halloween

3885
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:09,260
because I found a book in a library

3886
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:11,260
that was like fun

3887
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:13,260
children's crafting tips for Halloween

3888
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:15,260
and I dressed up as a spider

3889
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:17,260
at like

3890
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:19,260
face paint at like multiple eyes

3891
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:21,260
painted on my face and had like a green

3892
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:23,260
like net for like trees

3893
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:25,260
to like put trees in or something

3894
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:27,260
around me I was walking around like that

3895
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:29,260
all day just going to the mall

3896
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:31,260
with my parents or something and people

3897
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:33,260
looked at me very weird like

3898
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:35,260
it was not expected

3899
02:30:35,260 --> 02:30:37,260
for a child to be in costume

3900
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:39,260
at Halloween

3901
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:41,260
When do you ever get the word costumes?

3902
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:43,260
Fushing

3903
02:30:43,260 --> 02:30:45,260
Well we have like Carnival

3904
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:47,260
like that's like our costume

3905
02:30:47,260 --> 02:30:49,260
thing

3906
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:51,260
but that's also kind of regional here

3907
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:53,260
like it's not happening everywhere

3908
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:55,260
One time I went to

3909
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,260
I was in Dusseldorf

3910
02:30:57,260 --> 02:30:59,260
and there was a

3911
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:01,260
there was a festival going on

3912
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:03,260
and there were people in costumes

3913
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:05,260
there were some I remember

3914
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:07,260
some people were dressed as the Beagle Boys

3915
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:09,260
there were other costumes but I remember

3916
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:11,260
there were people in costumes at the point

3917
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:13,260
and it wasn't Halloween it was some other like

3918
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:15,260
some other holiday that people were doing

3919
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:17,260
We have that period between

3920
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:19,260
November and February

3921
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:21,260
where it's like fushing season

3922
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:23,260
and at the beginning at the end the celebrations

3923
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:25,260
like I said it's kind of regional

3924
02:31:25,260 --> 02:31:27,260
and there's a lot of like

3925
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:29,260
parades and stuff

3926
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:31,260
like dances

3927
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:33,260
That's when we would like dress up in school

3928
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:35,260
and like play games

3929
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:37,260
and gym hall or whatever

3930
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:39,260
But it's not spooky themed

3931
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:41,260
Halloween is cool because it's

3932
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:43,260
spooky themed. Carnival is just like

3933
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:45,260
general dress up

3934
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:47,260
So you get two opportunities to dress up

3935
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:49,260
in costumes

3936
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:51,260
Yeah kind of

3937
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:53,260
Yeah

3938
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:55,260
It's not but it doesn't have the trick

3939
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:57,260
or treating it doesn't have going out at night

3940
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:59,260
without your parents and getting sweets

3941
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:01,260
That's cool

3942
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:03,260
I wanted that

3943
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:05,260
like in my

3944
02:32:05,260 --> 02:32:07,260
American cartoons

3945
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:09,260
It's just like one of my American cartoons

3946
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:11,260
TV shows and movies

3947
02:32:11,260 --> 02:32:13,260
I like never went trick or treating without my parents

3948
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:15,260
because like

3949
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:17,260
when I was a kid parents would drive me

3950
02:32:17,260 --> 02:32:19,260
to a neighborhood that was like

3951
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:21,260
trick or treat friendly and like by the time I was

3952
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:23,260
like old enough that

3953
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:25,260
I was like drive myself

3954
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:27,260
and I didn't really want to be like

3955
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:29,260
doing it

3956
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:31,260
You know

3957
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:33,260
It's a little cringe if you know what I'm saying

3958
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:37,260
Yeah

3959
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:39,260
They get the point

3960
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:41,260
At some point it becomes less cringe again

3961
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:43,260
and you wish that you could do it

3962
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:47,260
I mean I guess

3963
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:49,260
I've been googling the worst witch

3964
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:51,260
because I've convinced

3965
02:32:51,260 --> 02:32:53,260
that I did see this TV show

3966
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:55,260
on CBBC at some point

3967
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:57,260
and I think I did

3968
02:32:57,260 --> 02:32:59,260
and I think I did also have a crush on the main actress

3969
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:01,260
Wait what?

3970
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:03,260
The worst witch

3971
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:05,260
Oh yeah

3972
02:33:05,260 --> 02:33:07,260
1998 to 2001

3973
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:09,260
That's the one I watched as a kid

3974
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:13,260
Look at this opening like

3975
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:15,260
credits where they're like green screened

3976
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:17,260
like swiveling around

3977
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:19,260
on the brooms

3978
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:21,260
It's funny that this did come out before Harry Potter

3979
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:23,260
It does look a lot like it

3980
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:25,260
And it's basically

3981
02:33:25,260 --> 02:33:27,260
just the plot of

3982
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:29,260
Little Witch Academia

3983
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:31,260
because it's an old girl's school

3984
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:33,260
Yeah

3985
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:35,260
But they're all British in this one

3986
02:33:35,260 --> 02:33:37,260
I assume

3987
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:39,260
That was a BBC thing of course they are

3988
02:33:41,260 --> 02:33:43,260
I'm sorry the best

3989
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:45,260
The best Harry Potter

3990
02:33:45,260 --> 02:33:47,260
alternative is still BP Blocksberg

3991
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:49,260
That was

3992
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:51,260
that was my

3993
02:33:51,260 --> 02:33:53,260
big Harry Potter alternative

3994
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:55,260
It's like a big German TV show

3995
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:57,260
and like audio book character

3996
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:59,260
She's a witch

3997
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:01,260
and she goes on adventures

3998
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:03,260
and there's a movie that came out around the same time

3999
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:05,260
as Harry Potter and it's

4000
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:07,260
very much copying the Harry Potter aesthetic

4001
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:09,260
and the music and

4002
02:34:09,260 --> 02:34:11,260
but still good

4003
02:34:11,260 --> 02:34:13,260
still good and not transphobic

4004
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:15,260
and great

4005
02:34:15,260 --> 02:34:17,260
That's all I wanted to be

4006
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:19,260
Now I'm thinking about it

4007
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:21,260
Was Harry Potter the first

4008
02:34:21,260 --> 02:34:23,260
big male

4009
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:25,260
witch thing

4010
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:27,260
Because there's a lot of witches

4011
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:29,260
as a female archetype

4012
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:31,260
Well

4013
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:33,260
Wizard's Hall is about a boy who goes to wizard school

4014
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:35,260
So Wizard's Hall

4015
02:34:35,260 --> 02:34:37,260
You did it

4016
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:39,260
I think it's amazing that Hogwarts

4017
02:34:39,260 --> 02:34:41,260
is called school for witch

4018
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:43,260
craft and wizardry

4019
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:45,260
You have to

4020
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:47,260
gender divide that

4021
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:49,260
If a witch does it

4022
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:51,260
it's a witchcraft

4023
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:53,260
Why?

4024
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:55,260
That part of it has always been

4025
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:57,260
in history

4026
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:59,260
Witches are women

4027
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:01,260
and wizards are different

4028
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:03,260
But it's a real world for them

4029
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:05,260
So they should just have one term for it

4030
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:07,260
Okay

4031
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:09,260
But it's not like magicians

4032
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:11,260
It's not like JK came up with that

4033
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:13,260
Yeah

4034
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:15,260
It's like historically grown maybe

4035
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:17,260
I mean JK Rowling

4036
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:19,260
would come up with like some stupid

4037
02:35:19,260 --> 02:35:21,260
like oh it's witchcraft

4038
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:23,260
if you were born a woman

4039
02:35:23,260 --> 02:35:25,260
if you have like a womb

4040
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:27,260
it only counts as witchcraft

4041
02:35:27,260 --> 02:35:29,260
It's like biological

4042
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:31,260
You will never be able to wizardry

4043
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:33,260
Uterus magic

4044
02:35:33,260 --> 02:35:35,260
We can always tell

4045
02:35:35,260 --> 02:35:37,260
We can always tell

4046
02:35:37,260 --> 02:35:39,260
This is how we can explain

4047
02:35:39,260 --> 02:35:41,260
This is how we can fix

4048
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:43,260
this is how we can fix JK

4049
02:35:43,260 --> 02:35:45,260
because there literally is no difference

4050
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:47,260
between witchcraft and wizardry

4051
02:35:47,260 --> 02:35:49,260
We can just explain gender to her like that

4052
02:35:49,260 --> 02:35:51,260
and she's like oh I get it

4053
02:35:51,260 --> 02:35:53,260
it's just about the words you use

4054
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:55,260
but it's the same oh

4055
02:35:55,260 --> 02:35:57,260
I've been so wrong

4056
02:35:57,260 --> 02:35:59,260
She would literally say

4057
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:01,260
that the power of the testicles

4058
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:03,260
is what makes it wizardry

4059
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:05,260
I don't believe it

4060
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:07,260
If you had a testicle you can't do witchcraft

4061
02:36:07,260 --> 02:36:09,260
Absolutely would

4062
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:11,260
You're wrong

4063
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:13,260
They are the same

4064
02:36:13,260 --> 02:36:15,260
They are the same spells

4065
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:17,260
and the same potions and whatever

4066
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:19,260
and I'm pretty sure there's no difference at all

4067
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:21,260
it's just two different words

4068
02:36:21,260 --> 02:36:23,260
for the same thing

4069
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:25,260
Expelliarmus he him

4070
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:27,260
Yeah

4071
02:36:27,260 --> 02:36:29,260
Expelliarm

4072
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:31,260
Wait you say

4073
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:33,260
Expelliarmus

4074
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:35,260
Women

4075
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:37,260
I don't know

4076
02:36:37,260 --> 02:36:39,260
No, no, no

4077
02:36:39,260 --> 02:36:41,260
Men say

4078
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:43,260
There are no pronouns in Harry Potter

4079
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:45,260
Women say

4080
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:47,260
It's the ways to do it

4081
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:49,260
I don't know if people heard

4082
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:51,260
my funny joke

4083
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:53,260
Yeah

4084
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:55,260
I gotta listen to it next week

4085
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:57,260
I'm gonna really listen to it

4086
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:01,260
My head

4087
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:03,260
Back to Lord of the Rings though

4088
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:05,260
I'm sorry

4089
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:07,260
One last Lord of the Rings fact

4090
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:09,260
Galadria's husband

4091
02:37:09,260 --> 02:37:11,260
Not a guy

4092
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:13,260
Caliborn

4093
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,260
What's his name?

4094
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:17,260
Caliborn

4095
02:37:17,260 --> 02:37:19,260
From Homestuck

4096
02:37:19,260 --> 02:37:21,260
I've never seen a single Homestuck

4097
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:23,260
You should read Homestuck because

4098
02:37:23,260 --> 02:37:25,260
Alright

4099
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:27,260
Here's an obscure fact

4100
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:29,260
that I'm not sure about

4101
02:37:29,260 --> 02:37:31,260
but you might be able to recall

4102
02:37:31,260 --> 02:37:33,260
talking about a green sun

4103
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:35,260
as like if you're thinking of

4104
02:37:35,260 --> 02:37:37,260
making a world

4105
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:39,260
and you make a green sun

4106
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:41,260
As just an example of

4107
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:43,260
a fantasy thing

4108
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:45,260
you should have a reason for it

4109
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:47,260
or something, I don't remember

4110
02:37:47,260 --> 02:37:49,260
There's a quote attributed to J.R. or Tolkien

4111
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:51,260
about a green sun

4112
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:53,260
with regards to writing

4113
02:37:53,260 --> 02:37:55,260
theory

4114
02:37:55,260 --> 02:37:57,260
or how to create fantasy worlds

4115
02:37:57,260 --> 02:37:59,260
and Andrew Hussey heard that

4116
02:37:59,260 --> 02:38:01,260
and he thought, well, yeah, I could just take

4117
02:38:01,260 --> 02:38:03,260
that exact thing

4118
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:05,260
That's the lesson

4119
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:07,260
that was supposed to be learned from that

4120
02:38:07,260 --> 02:38:09,260
I mean, I'm sure he liked

4121
02:38:09,260 --> 02:38:11,260
Tolkien's work in general

4122
02:38:11,260 --> 02:38:13,260
I just thought that would be a cool thing to lift

4123
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:15,260
There's a green sun

4124
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:17,260
in Homestuck

4125
02:38:17,260 --> 02:38:19,260
I mean, the green sun could have been any color

4126
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:21,260
It could have been any color

4127
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:23,260
That's the point of Tolkien's

4128
02:38:23,260 --> 02:38:25,260
Yeah, Tolkien's

4129
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:27,260
just came up with some random shit

4130
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:29,260
as an example

4131
02:38:29,260 --> 02:38:31,260
I mean, it's like

4132
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:33,260
it's sort of like if he had made a

4133
02:38:33,260 --> 02:38:35,260
if there was a fish

4134
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:37,260
and he'd made it red

4135
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,260
because it's a red herring

4136
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:41,260
and it's just a reference to a thing

4137
02:38:41,260 --> 02:38:43,260
Okay, okay

4138
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:45,260
I didn't know that actually

4139
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:47,260
Yeah, Caliburn

4140
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:49,260
Great guy, completely irrelevant

4141
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:51,260
for most of the time because Caliburn

4142
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:53,260
is like the most important person

4143
02:38:53,260 --> 02:38:55,260
and super powerful

4144
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:57,260
Caliburn is one of the wisest elves

4145
02:38:57,260 --> 02:38:59,260
in Middle Earth, but that's

4146
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:01,260
they all are

4147
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:03,260
Yeah, there's no real evidence

4148
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:05,260
He doesn't really do anything, he's just a trophy husband

4149
02:39:07,260 --> 02:39:09,260
But the thing

4150
02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:11,260
of Caliburn is

4151
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:13,260
he has a very funny name

4152
02:39:13,260 --> 02:39:15,260
because his Teleri name

4153
02:39:15,260 --> 02:39:17,260
from the elves that lived by the sea

4154
02:39:17,260 --> 02:39:19,260
and they have their own language

4155
02:39:19,260 --> 02:39:21,260
called Teleri

4156
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:23,260
I guess it's like an accent of Sindali

4157
02:39:23,260 --> 02:39:25,260
like that, but his original

4158
02:39:25,260 --> 02:39:27,260
Teleri name is

4159
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:29,260
Telepono

4160
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:31,260
like

4161
02:39:31,260 --> 02:39:33,260
Telepono

4162
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:35,260
Wow, cool

4163
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:39,260
Sounds almost like a request

4164
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:41,260
And I think talking

4165
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:43,260
every day for that

4166
02:39:43,260 --> 02:39:45,260
and I'm very happy that this is in there

4167
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:47,260
That's your Tolkien fact

4168
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:49,260
That's why he's the best

4169
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:51,260
writer ever

4170
02:39:51,260 --> 02:39:53,260
Yes

4171
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:55,260
That's

4172
02:39:55,260 --> 02:39:57,260
That's it

4173
02:39:57,260 --> 02:39:59,260
That's a freaking George Lucas

4174
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:01,260
Oh yeah

4175
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:03,260
Well this guy's name in the original language

4176
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:05,260
is Telepono

4177
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:07,260
because it's like

4178
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:09,260
it rhymes

4179
02:40:09,260 --> 02:40:11,260
with

4180
02:40:11,260 --> 02:40:13,260
Teleponography

4181
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:15,260
Because he's a really sexy guy

4182
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:17,260
I think Tolkien didn't have a choice

4183
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:19,260
on television

4184
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:21,260
You know

4185
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:23,260
I think Tolkien didn't have a choice

4186
02:40:23,260 --> 02:40:25,260
He couldn't name him anything else

4187
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:27,260
because the languages make so much sense

4188
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:29,260
that just historically

4189
02:40:29,260 --> 02:40:31,260
it must have been Telepono

4190
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:33,260
This is just the words that are his name

4191
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:35,260
You can't call him anything else

4192
02:40:35,260 --> 02:40:37,260
What does it mean?

4193
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:39,260
Oh wait, I should look that up

4194
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:41,260
It probably means something important

4195
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:43,260
Tree of the silver bird

4196
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:45,260
How does elf language work?

4197
02:40:45,260 --> 02:40:47,260
Is it like

4198
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:49,260
based on your place of birth

4199
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:51,260
and how many

4200
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:53,260
thumb wars you won

4201
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:55,260
you get named a certain thing

4202
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:57,260
Your parents both give you different names

4203
02:40:57,260 --> 02:40:59,260
and then at some point

4204
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:01,260
you choose your own name based on

4205
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:03,260
That's just like warrior cats

4206
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:05,260
Maybe

4207
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:07,260
Okay, alright

4208
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:09,260
Elves are warrior cats, I get it

4209
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:11,260
By the way, Telepono means

4210
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:13,260
silver tall

4211
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:15,260
because he had silver hair and was very tall

4212
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:17,260
This is literally no other way to describe him

4213
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:19,260
He's teleporting

4214
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:21,260
It's kind of a boring name

4215
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:23,260
actually

4216
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:25,260
Yeah, even how it sounds

4217
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:27,260
Elves just

4218
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:29,260
I think name themselves

4219
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:31,260
after the legends that they make

4220
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:33,260
You know what, that is

4221
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:35,260
kind of like a warrior cat's name though

4222
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:37,260
isn't it?

4223
02:41:37,260 --> 02:41:39,260
Well, no, he would be called

4224
02:41:39,260 --> 02:41:41,260
Can a cat be tall?

4225
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:43,260
He would be called silver thrush

4226
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:45,260
or something, or he would be called

4227
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:47,260
tall leaf

4228
02:41:47,260 --> 02:41:49,260
or something like that

4229
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:51,260
because you have to have an adjective

4230
02:41:51,260 --> 02:41:53,260
and a thing

4231
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:55,260
in nature, or it's two things in nature

4232
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:57,260
right?

4233
02:41:57,260 --> 02:41:59,260
Is it a cat name?

4234
02:41:59,260 --> 02:42:01,260
Yeah

4235
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:03,260
Is it why warrior cats can have names?

4236
02:42:03,260 --> 02:42:05,260
How can you say that? Wait, isn't that

4237
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:07,260
the same generation as Percy Jackson

4238
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:09,260
I feel like that's the same thing

4239
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:11,260
Maybe a little older

4240
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:13,260
I think it's a little older than that

4241
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:15,260
Maybe

4242
02:42:15,260 --> 02:42:17,260
It's one of these series with way too many books

4243
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:19,260
I mean, I never read it

4244
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:21,260
Yeah, it's still going

4245
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:23,260
I mean, so is Percy Jackson, I believe

4246
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:25,260
at least some of the spin-off series

4247
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:27,260
Wow, okay

4248
02:42:27,260 --> 02:42:29,260
How could you write all the time?

4249
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:31,260
How could you do that?

4250
02:42:31,260 --> 02:42:33,260
I mean, they probably have

4251
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:35,260
I mean, warrior cats

4252
02:42:35,260 --> 02:42:37,260
they have ghost writers and stuff

4253
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:39,260
They're dead?

4254
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:41,260
Yes

4255
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:43,260
They die?

4256
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:45,260
They kill them and they enslave their spirit

4257
02:42:45,260 --> 02:42:47,260
and they said, you will

4258
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:49,260
You will write about these cats

4259
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:51,260
You'll work off your sins

4260
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:53,260
in the typewriter minds

4261
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:55,260
you will type

4262
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:57,260
until your spirit is cleansed

4263
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:59,260
of evil

4264
02:42:59,260 --> 02:43:01,260
I know nothing about no warrior cats

4265
02:43:01,260 --> 02:43:03,260
but I just assume they go with the lore

4266
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:05,260
that cats all have nine lives

4267
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:07,260
and that's why the series is so long

4268
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:09,260
It's like eight times before

4269
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:11,260
that story's over

4270
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:13,260
is a thing in them

4271
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:15,260
or something

4272
02:43:15,260 --> 02:43:17,260
I don't really know too much

4273
02:43:17,260 --> 02:43:19,260
about it

4274
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:21,260
What do we think

4275
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:23,260
about

4276
02:43:23,260 --> 02:43:25,260
Frickin' Ask PCP

4277
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:27,260
questions? Hell yeah

4278
02:43:27,260 --> 02:43:29,260
I feel like we've been gone for a while

4279
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:31,260
Okay

4280
02:43:31,260 --> 02:43:33,260
Well, I've got one, this was actually asked

4281
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:35,260
of me before

4282
02:43:35,260 --> 02:43:37,260
Ask PCP, so I'm gonna honor it

4283
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:39,260
This is from

4284
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:41,260
Coco Peloton

4285
02:43:41,260 --> 02:43:43,260
It's also ugly

4286
02:43:43,260 --> 02:43:45,260
I can't leave a voicemail for the podcast

4287
02:43:45,260 --> 02:43:47,260
I wanted to say, one piece

4288
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,260
Dragon Ball Super and one punch man

4289
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:51,260
all ended their current arc this week

4290
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:53,260
and they were all shit endings

4291
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:55,260
Tell me why, Benzane

4292
02:43:57,260 --> 02:43:59,260
Why is Oracle

4293
02:43:59,260 --> 02:44:01,260
It's because

4294
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:03,260
I don't know

4295
02:44:03,260 --> 02:44:05,260
I know

4296
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:07,260
why people would be upset

4297
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:09,260
there's like a choice was made

4298
02:44:09,260 --> 02:44:11,260
Wait, I know what happened

4299
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:13,260
I actually know what happened

4300
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:15,260
Can you say it?

4301
02:44:15,260 --> 02:44:17,260
Someone didn't join the crew

4302
02:44:17,260 --> 02:44:19,260
right?

4303
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:21,260
Yeah, it's like a potential

4304
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:23,260
crew joining thing

4305
02:44:23,260 --> 02:44:25,260
I have no real opinion

4306
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:27,260
I have no real opinion

4307
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:29,260
I mean it was to say, it's Yamato

4308
02:44:29,260 --> 02:44:31,260
I

4309
02:44:31,260 --> 02:44:33,260
from my perspective, I heard people say

4310
02:44:33,260 --> 02:44:35,260
Yamato joins the crew and I thought

4311
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:37,260
that seemed like really quick

4312
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:39,260
but then again

4313
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:41,260
it probably took less chapters

4314
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:43,260
for Sanji to join

4315
02:44:43,260 --> 02:44:45,260
for instance

4316
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:47,260
I think at this point, a character

4317
02:44:47,260 --> 02:44:49,260
joined it because it was like Jinbei took

4318
02:44:49,260 --> 02:44:51,260
so much longer

4319
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:53,260
than you would have expected from officially

4320
02:44:53,260 --> 02:44:55,260
They were teasing Jinbei

4321
02:44:55,260 --> 02:44:57,260
they were edging with Jinbei for years

4322
02:44:57,260 --> 02:44:59,260
and years

4323
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:01,260
and people really wanted

4324
02:45:01,260 --> 02:45:03,260
carrot to join

4325
02:45:03,260 --> 02:45:05,260
which I don't

4326
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:07,260
hate her, but I don't get

4327
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:09,260
the appeal of her being in the crew

4328
02:45:09,260 --> 02:45:11,260
she's just sort of nice

4329
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:13,260
She's cute and nice

4330
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:15,260
but does that

4331
02:45:15,260 --> 02:45:17,260
mean you should be part of the sohats?

4332
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:19,260
She doesn't have quite as much of

4333
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:21,260
a role to play

4334
02:45:21,260 --> 02:45:23,260
either socially

4335
02:45:23,260 --> 02:45:25,260
or strategically in the crew

4336
02:45:25,260 --> 02:45:27,260
so that's that

4337
02:45:27,260 --> 02:45:29,260
but then Yamato's

4338
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:31,260
coming in

4339
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:33,260
as another potential heavy hitter

4340
02:45:33,260 --> 02:45:35,260
in the late game of the one piece

4341
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:37,260
story

4342
02:45:37,260 --> 02:45:39,260
but he's like

4343
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:41,260
he's a

4344
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:43,260
he's a powerful ally

4345
02:45:43,260 --> 02:45:45,260
to protect

4346
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:47,260
Wano when they leave

4347
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:49,260
so I feel like

4348
02:45:49,260 --> 02:45:51,260
it's not like he's not gonna be

4349
02:45:51,260 --> 02:45:53,260
in the manga anymore

4350
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:55,260
there's gonna be

4351
02:45:55,260 --> 02:45:57,260
stuff happening with all these characters

4352
02:45:59,260 --> 02:46:01,260
and I feel like being literally on the crew

4353
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:03,260
doesn't mean much because there's so many characters

4354
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:05,260
that are allied with the crew

4355
02:46:05,260 --> 02:46:07,260
that are going to show up again

4356
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:09,260
either as enemies or allies

4357
02:46:09,260 --> 02:46:11,260
in whatever huge conflict

4358
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:13,260
is gonna be coming up

4359
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:15,260
with the coming to the end

4360
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:17,260
of the actual story

4361
02:46:17,260 --> 02:46:19,260
so I don't feel like

4362
02:46:19,260 --> 02:46:21,260
it's the same as having a new character

4363
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:23,260
on for another like 20 years of adventures

4364
02:46:25,260 --> 02:46:27,260
do you think that's what this person

4365
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:29,260
is saying it's shitty because

4366
02:46:29,260 --> 02:46:31,260
of that? I think they're just like

4367
02:46:31,260 --> 02:46:33,260
they wanted it to be like an official thing

4368
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:35,260
lots of people did

4369
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:37,260
but instead no

4370
02:46:37,260 --> 02:46:39,260
and I'm like I don't mind

4371
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:41,260
I think it's cool

4372
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:43,260
I just want to see what happens next

4373
02:46:43,260 --> 02:46:45,260
I mean I

4374
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:47,260
was surprised that when Jinbei joined

4375
02:46:47,260 --> 02:46:49,260
because I kind of felt like

4376
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:51,260
I didn't need any more members

4377
02:46:51,260 --> 02:46:53,260
and I guess I kind of still feel like

4378
02:46:53,260 --> 02:46:55,260
that but I mean

4379
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:57,260
whatever

4380
02:46:57,260 --> 02:46:59,260
I'm not like against the idea entirely

4381
02:46:59,260 --> 02:47:01,260
so I guess I

4382
02:47:01,260 --> 02:47:03,260
I'm pretty neutral on it although I haven't finished

4383
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:05,260
I haven't actually gotten there

4384
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:07,260
I'm like 12 chapters behind or something so

4385
02:47:07,260 --> 02:47:09,260
I should catch up

4386
02:47:09,260 --> 02:47:11,260
so I can have a real opinion

4387
02:47:11,260 --> 02:47:13,260
um okay

4388
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:15,260
uh well anyway

4389
02:47:15,260 --> 02:47:17,260
let me

4390
02:47:17,260 --> 02:47:19,260
someone else asked me

4391
02:47:19,260 --> 02:47:21,260
is Ben caught up to one piece yet

4392
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:23,260
and I just answered that question

4393
02:47:23,260 --> 02:47:25,260
I did catch up a while ago but now I'm behind

4394
02:47:25,260 --> 02:47:27,260
um alright

4395
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:29,260
so let me

4396
02:47:29,260 --> 02:47:31,260
see here who responded

4397
02:47:31,260 --> 02:47:33,260
to the tweet

4398
02:47:33,260 --> 02:47:35,260
okay

4399
02:47:35,260 --> 02:47:37,260
Sankishi Seidel

4400
02:47:37,260 --> 02:47:39,260
if I'm saying that right

4401
02:47:39,260 --> 02:47:41,260
says everyone is talking like the voicemail

4402
02:47:41,260 --> 02:47:43,260
era is over can't you just back up the existing voicemails

4403
02:47:43,260 --> 02:47:45,260
uh yeah

4404
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:47,260
the reason why it's not

4405
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:49,260
ready is because

4406
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:51,260
I cleared a lot of it out

4407
02:47:51,260 --> 02:47:53,260
and I thought I just had to clear out some

4408
02:47:53,260 --> 02:47:55,260
space

4409
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:57,260
and it didn't work and I guess actually I need

4410
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:59,260
to clear out like all the space

4411
02:47:59,260 --> 02:48:01,260
so it was sort of my bad

4412
02:48:01,260 --> 02:48:03,260
but not really

4413
02:48:03,260 --> 02:48:05,260
it should have worked

4414
02:48:05,260 --> 02:48:07,260
it just didn't

4415
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:09,260
um okay next one

4416
02:48:09,260 --> 02:48:11,260
hey Ben I got an asked PCP for you

4417
02:48:11,260 --> 02:48:13,260
uh spotify

4418
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:17,260
yeah

4419
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:19,260
I think um it's not just spotify

4420
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:21,260
the problem is like you can't download

4421
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:23,260
the episodes conveniently anymore

4422
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:25,260
really

4423
02:48:25,260 --> 02:48:27,260
I can't listen to them if I don't have internet

4424
02:48:27,260 --> 02:48:29,260
and that's a bit annoying

4425
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:31,260
yeah I know

4426
02:48:31,260 --> 02:48:33,260
I said before

4427
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:35,260
I think I'm just gonna have to accept

4428
02:48:35,260 --> 02:48:37,260
that like some of the apps will just

4429
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:39,260
not have the first episodes on them

4430
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:41,260
like they're just gonna have to delete

4431
02:48:41,260 --> 02:48:43,260
the old episodes

4432
02:48:43,260 --> 02:48:45,260
they're all on the website

4433
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:47,260
they're all on the website

4434
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:49,260
almost all on youtube

4435
02:48:49,260 --> 02:48:51,260
so I don't know at some point

4436
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:53,260
I give up

4437
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:55,260
I will do that

4438
02:48:55,260 --> 02:48:57,260
I just haven't done it yet

4439
02:48:57,260 --> 02:48:59,260
but yeah I gotta do it

4440
02:48:59,260 --> 02:49:01,260
you're right

4441
02:49:01,260 --> 02:49:03,260
demonica knight asks

4442
02:49:03,260 --> 02:49:05,260
PCP who has the biggest butt

4443
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:07,260
between Ben and Gibb

4444
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:09,260
and rank the butts of all PCP members

4445
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:11,260
thank you

4446
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:13,260
and wait there's an image

4447
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:15,260
um

4448
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:17,260
no

4449
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:19,260
here

4450
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:21,260
oh well yeah

4451
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:23,260
I would agree with this

4452
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:27,260
I mean I personally been working out

4453
02:49:27,260 --> 02:49:29,260
like doing squats more recently

4454
02:49:29,260 --> 02:49:31,260
and more regularly

4455
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:33,260
so my butt's bigger than it was

4456
02:49:33,260 --> 02:49:35,260
that's a point in my favor

4457
02:49:35,260 --> 02:49:37,260
I don't know

4458
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:39,260
I don't think I have a particularly large butt

4459
02:49:39,260 --> 02:49:41,260
um

4460
02:49:41,260 --> 02:49:43,260
I don't know

4461
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:45,260
I genuinely don't know

4462
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:47,260
how to answer

4463
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:49,260
uh can I

4464
02:49:49,260 --> 02:49:51,260
can I rank the butts of all PCP members

4465
02:49:51,260 --> 02:49:53,260
no

4466
02:49:53,260 --> 02:49:55,260
yeah people say Nate has a big butt

4467
02:49:55,260 --> 02:49:57,260
which is very funny

4468
02:49:57,260 --> 02:49:59,260
that does kind of have a big butt because of all the exercise he used to do

4469
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:01,260
lol

4470
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:03,260
actually he might still but like

4471
02:50:03,260 --> 02:50:05,260
I assume so

4472
02:50:05,260 --> 02:50:07,260
I don't know if that's

4473
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:09,260
no

4474
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:11,260
because it's not like he was like

4475
02:50:11,260 --> 02:50:13,260
big all over

4476
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:15,260
because he was like really buff

4477
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:17,260
no but like his butt was

4478
02:50:17,260 --> 02:50:19,260
yeah

4479
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:21,260
his thighs were quite large for

4480
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:23,260
okay well here's the thing

4481
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:25,260
his squats were bad

4482
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:27,260
he was bad at squatting so I don't think

4483
02:50:27,260 --> 02:50:29,260
that it was like oh he just worked his like

4484
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:31,260
his glutes out that much

4485
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:33,260
and naturally is like that

4486
02:50:33,260 --> 02:50:35,260
well yeah good for you

4487
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:37,260
I guess

4488
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:39,260
all I noticed is that one screenshot from the

4489
02:50:39,260 --> 02:50:41,260
Brad Garlinghouse music video

4490
02:50:41,260 --> 02:50:43,260
where it's gigantic

4491
02:50:43,260 --> 02:50:45,260
I

4492
02:50:45,260 --> 02:50:47,260
I don't know the exact one you're talking about

4493
02:50:47,260 --> 02:50:49,260
I think it got reposted in your server

4494
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:51,260
two days ago or something

4495
02:50:51,260 --> 02:50:53,260
cool

4496
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:55,260
uh

4497
02:50:55,260 --> 02:50:57,260
people be talking

4498
02:50:57,260 --> 02:50:59,260
as for everyone else I have no idea

4499
02:50:59,260 --> 02:51:01,260
I just wore like baggy trousers

4500
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:03,260
or it wasn't looking

4501
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:05,260
so I don't know

4502
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:07,260
p-blade spirit asks

4503
02:51:07,260 --> 02:51:09,260
Ben do you have a favorite brand of

4504
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:11,260
gummies as a gummy candy fan

4505
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:13,260
I quite like the albany's brand

4506
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:15,260
or alternatively is there a brand

4507
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:17,260
that you'd compare the ones you'd make want to make to

4508
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:19,260
um

4509
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:21,260
is albany's the one

4510
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:23,260
the bears that have the a on them

4511
02:51:23,260 --> 02:51:25,260
those are okay

4512
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:27,260
those are fine

4513
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:29,260
ooh I like um

4514
02:51:29,260 --> 02:51:31,260
it's kind of a basic bitch

4515
02:51:31,260 --> 02:51:33,260
but I really like

4516
02:51:33,260 --> 02:51:35,260
I really like gushers and like

4517
02:51:35,260 --> 02:51:37,260
fruit by the foot and that stuff

4518
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:39,260
that stuff's really good

4519
02:51:39,260 --> 02:51:41,260
I really like um

4520
02:51:41,260 --> 02:51:43,260
I don't know if I have a favorite brand

4521
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:47,260
uh

4522
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:49,260
I like uh

4523
02:51:51,260 --> 02:51:53,260
I like grapefruit flavored ones

4524
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:55,260
whenever I go to like a candy store I look for grapefruit flavored gummy candy

4525
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:57,260
whenever I can find those

4526
02:51:57,260 --> 02:51:59,260
I really like those

4527
02:51:59,260 --> 02:52:01,260
um

4528
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:03,260
I don't really have a favorite brand

4529
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:05,260
I like a wide spectrum of them

4530
02:52:05,260 --> 02:52:07,260
I like the juicy ones

4531
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:09,260
I like the jelly-ish ones

4532
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:11,260
I like the hard ones

4533
02:52:11,260 --> 02:52:13,260
I like the chewy ones

4534
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:15,260
I can appreciate

4535
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:17,260
I appreciate all different

4536
02:52:17,260 --> 02:52:19,260
there's such a spectrum

4537
02:52:19,260 --> 02:52:21,260
I think so

4538
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:23,260
I like to think so

4539
02:52:23,260 --> 02:52:25,260
um

4540
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:27,260
okay next one is from

4541
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:29,260
jjava arts

4542
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:31,260
if you could trade any one of your talent skills

4543
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:33,260
with one of your friends

4544
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:35,260
which one would you choose and why

4545
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:39,260
talents skills

4546
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:41,260
uh

4547
02:52:41,260 --> 02:52:43,260
would I have to trade all of my talents

4548
02:52:43,260 --> 02:52:45,260
with all of their talents

4549
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:47,260
well I'd say no

4550
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:49,260
to all things

4551
02:52:49,260 --> 02:52:51,260
I like my talents

4552
02:52:51,260 --> 02:52:53,260
one I'm trying to think

4553
02:52:53,260 --> 02:52:55,260
if you could trade one of your talents

4554
02:52:55,260 --> 02:52:57,260
with one other talent

4555
02:52:57,260 --> 02:52:59,260
with someone else's

4556
02:52:59,260 --> 02:53:01,260
um

4557
02:53:01,260 --> 02:53:03,260
I mean I would I think I've said this

4558
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:05,260
if you could trade any one of your talent skills

4559
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:07,260
with one of your friends

4560
02:53:07,260 --> 02:53:09,260
which one would you choose and why

4561
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:11,260
I trade um

4562
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:13,260
my

4563
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:15,260
here's the thing though

4564
02:53:15,260 --> 02:53:17,260
can I never learn that skill again

4565
02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:19,260
I think so yeah

4566
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:21,260
because you'll never you'll never be talented

4567
02:53:21,260 --> 02:53:23,260
if you trade it away you'll never be talented at it

4568
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:25,260
but like you can be

4569
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:27,260
untalented but work really hard

4570
02:53:27,260 --> 02:53:29,260
and like like what does talent mean

4571
02:53:29,260 --> 02:53:31,260
here no talent is everything

4572
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:33,260
you can't do anything without talent don't you know

4573
02:53:33,260 --> 02:53:35,260
oh god

4574
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:37,260
I think I mean obviously

4575
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:39,260
they just mean like look some

4576
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:41,260
people some people are just bad at something

4577
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:43,260
and I think if you if if we're

4578
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:45,260
taking this question seriously

4579
02:53:45,260 --> 02:53:47,260
if you trade away your talent it means you

4580
02:53:47,260 --> 02:53:49,260
become bad at it like you you can no

4581
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:51,260
longer do it well

4582
02:53:51,260 --> 02:53:53,260
hmm

4583
02:53:53,260 --> 02:53:55,260
I mean what am I talented at then

4584
02:53:55,260 --> 02:53:57,260
because I could

4585
02:53:57,260 --> 02:53:59,260
choose something that I'm sort of good at but I don't

4586
02:53:59,260 --> 02:54:01,260
care too much about losing and then just

4587
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:03,260
yeah like a really good thing in return

4588
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:05,260
you could definitely you could definitely game this question

4589
02:54:05,260 --> 02:54:07,260
I could I could be like oh my my

4590
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:09,260
talent at crochet like I'm sort of

4591
02:54:09,260 --> 02:54:11,260
good at crochet I made those little booties

4592
02:54:11,260 --> 02:54:13,260
for risker

4593
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:15,260
but like I could trade that for like

4594
02:54:15,260 --> 02:54:17,260
munchies

4595
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:19,260
like speaking

4596
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:21,260
to a crowd ability

4597
02:54:21,260 --> 02:54:23,260
I mean I know what I would trade for

4598
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:25,260
is I would trade for Maryweather's

4599
02:54:25,260 --> 02:54:27,260
marketing savvy

4600
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:29,260
in a second

4601
02:54:29,260 --> 02:54:31,260
that's the most valuable is just

4602
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:33,260
liking anime though that's the most valuable skill

4603
02:54:33,260 --> 02:54:35,260
that anyone that I know

4604
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:37,260
possesses so that's what I'm going for

4605
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:39,260
what do I trade for it

4606
02:54:39,260 --> 02:54:41,260
I don't know

4607
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:43,260
my huge day

4608
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:45,260
what do I need it for

4609
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:49,260
useless get it get it out of here

4610
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:51,260
hasn't been used in years

4611
02:54:53,260 --> 02:54:55,260
my my ability to

4612
02:54:55,260 --> 02:54:57,260
grow a full beer

4613
02:54:57,260 --> 02:54:59,260
that can go

4614
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:01,260
that's a talent that takes it out of dedication

4615
02:55:01,260 --> 02:55:03,260
oh yeah you got a home

4616
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:05,260
you know you got you start with natural talent

4617
02:55:05,260 --> 02:55:07,260
but then if that's a talent I would also like to

4618
02:55:07,260 --> 02:55:09,260
get rid of that please

4619
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:11,260
okay

4620
02:55:11,260 --> 02:55:13,260
can we instead

4621
02:55:13,260 --> 02:55:15,260
can we instead trade

4622
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:17,260
like something we're really bad at

4623
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:19,260
against something you're just

4624
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:21,260
okay at

4625
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:23,260
what

4626
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:25,260
you've completely

4627
02:55:25,260 --> 02:55:27,260
spit in the

4628
02:55:27,260 --> 02:55:29,260
spirit of this question

4629
02:55:29,260 --> 02:55:31,260
okay yeah but I just

4630
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:33,260
I'm just reconstructing the question I want to trade

4631
02:55:33,260 --> 02:55:35,260
I want to rather be bad at something

4632
02:55:35,260 --> 02:55:37,260
else instead of being bad at that thing

4633
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:39,260
also trade like a bad talent

4634
02:55:39,260 --> 02:55:41,260
for a different bad talent that you didn't

4635
02:55:41,260 --> 02:55:43,260
already have

4636
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:45,260
what do you mean a bad

4637
02:55:45,260 --> 02:55:47,260
what do you mean a bad talent

4638
02:55:47,260 --> 02:55:49,260
negative talent a negative talent

4639
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:51,260
something that you're bad at

4640
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:53,260
traded for something that someone else is bad at

4641
02:55:53,260 --> 02:55:55,260
yeah and the thing the thing that you were

4642
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:57,260
bad at just you become neutral

4643
02:55:57,260 --> 02:55:59,260
you become I guess okay at it

4644
02:55:59,260 --> 02:56:01,260
neither good or bad

4645
02:56:01,260 --> 02:56:03,260
then I would like to trade

4646
02:56:03,260 --> 02:56:05,260
my inability to drive a car

4647
02:56:05,260 --> 02:56:07,260
safely

4648
02:56:07,260 --> 02:56:09,260
with you know what

4649
02:56:09,260 --> 02:56:11,260
yeah that is a good one to get rid of

4650
02:56:11,260 --> 02:56:13,260
yeah I don't know

4651
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:15,260
like fishing

4652
02:56:15,260 --> 02:56:17,260
I don't need to be good at fishing

4653
02:56:17,260 --> 02:56:19,260
are you good at fishing

4654
02:56:19,260 --> 02:56:21,260
do you have a friend who's bad at fishing

4655
02:56:21,260 --> 02:56:23,260
oh wait no

4656
02:56:23,260 --> 02:56:25,260
dang it I need to find one

4657
02:56:25,260 --> 02:56:27,260
so now you have to pick one of your friends and

4658
02:56:27,260 --> 02:56:29,260
publicly say that they're bad at something

4659
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:31,260
I should be like yeah I want that

4660
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:33,260
what are your bad at

4661
02:56:33,260 --> 02:56:35,260
uh

4662
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:37,260
self confidence

4663
02:56:37,260 --> 02:56:39,260
no I also don't want to be bad at that

4664
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:41,260
that's that one

4665
02:56:41,260 --> 02:56:43,260
uh

4666
02:56:43,260 --> 02:56:45,260
all my friends are too talented I don't find

4667
02:56:45,260 --> 02:56:47,260
something you're calling your friend you're free

4668
02:56:47,260 --> 02:56:49,260
you're friend zoning it

4669
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:51,260
ashi you're getting friendzoned

4670
02:56:51,260 --> 02:56:53,260
hmm

4671
02:56:53,260 --> 02:56:55,260
okay I guess I would be fine with

4672
02:56:55,260 --> 02:56:57,260
being bad at cooking

4673
02:56:57,260 --> 02:56:59,260
if you were neutral at cooking

4674
02:56:59,260 --> 02:57:01,260
wait you're not bad at cooking

4675
02:57:01,260 --> 02:57:03,260
at all

4676
02:57:03,260 --> 02:57:05,260
hmm okay

4677
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:07,260
let's move on

4678
02:57:07,260 --> 02:57:09,260
I just haven't like

4679
02:57:09,260 --> 02:57:11,260
harnessed it
