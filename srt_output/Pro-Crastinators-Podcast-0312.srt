1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I won't bless that guy that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Son of a bitch.

11
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Son of a bitch.

12
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,120
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

13
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
That's right.

14
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,120
We both missed it today.

15
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,960
I mean I missed it by a little bit and I could have done an episode mostly by myself.

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
But I don't want to.

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,160
I mean what's the point?

18
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,720
I could just talk about stuff for like 30 minutes.

19
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,920
Yeah, I mean sure.

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
You could.

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
I could have.

22
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,200
I just didn't feel like it.

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
That's fair.

24
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:52,040
I just forgot what day it was or I forgot that we do it on Sundays.

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:00,440
I just I stayed up late last night doing work on the book specifically.

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,720
I guess I actually had a pretty productive week.

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,080
I finished making the game into book pages to my satisfaction and now I'm writing the

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
like notes.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,040
You know the endless, not endless war.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Infinite jet.

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Wait a minute.

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Infinite jest?

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Endless war?

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Oh my god.

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,120
War and jest are so similar.

36
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,040
War and peace, slime and punishment?

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
What?

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
What?

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
What?

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,000
I finished writing, well I didn't finish writing but I've been writing the footnotes,

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,840
the end of the book footnotes.

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,480
Yesterday I wrote, I wrote notes for I think like 30 pages and I think the whole thing is

43
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,840
like 200 so that's pretty good and I think that there will probably be less notes per

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,320
page as it gets further and further into it.

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,760
Well, I'm glad at least one of us has been productive.

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
That's true.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
That's true.

48
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm picking up, I'm picking up the slack sort of.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,320
I've also been, you want to, I was going to say something else but I'll say it after.

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
What's up?

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Nothing.

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Nothing.

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,480
I just, I've just been, I hadn't, I think an okay start to the week.

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,680
I was going over the Clarissa stuff.

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,360
I was doing pumpkin alley concept art all day kind of slowly because I don't know how

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
to do that but I was working through it.

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Was it levels?

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,200
It was level designs I've had in my head and I just needed to like put down on a

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:53,160
piece of paper, digital paper and then like come up with an enemy design on the fly because

60
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,920
I knew that the enemies were this and that.

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,880
I just never really thought exactly what they looked like and we need that sort of information

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,360
if we're going to start modeling and all that.

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,040
Why do you need to come up with new enemies when you're your own worst enemy?

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,800
I just pictures of me the whole three.

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,800
The game won't start unless you have your phone, your phone like hooked up to your computer

66
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,720
by micro USB and then when it starts it downloads your selfies and then puts them on, the secretly

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,600
puts them on the model of the enemy.

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,520
Kind of like, remember the Game Boy camera?

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,040
I didn't use it but I know of the Game Boy camera.

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,440
Did you know you could take a picture of yourself and it would put your face like on the boss

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,320
of like a little like Gallagher shooter?

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
Oh, I didn't know that.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
It would do that.

74
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,520
So it like secretly does that with you, with the final boss.

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Okay, that's my joke.

76
00:03:51,520 --> 00:04:01,760
But yeah, I was doing some of that and then I just sort of had a big slump moment, big

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:10,240
old like who cares about me, no one and maybe I don't need to exist.

78
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,800
Classic depression spiral and it became difficult to do anything for a few days and that's where

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I am at.

80
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Okay, still.

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
Yeah, I'm trying to find the thing.

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,360
I wrote down, oh my God, I got so many stupid notes in my just documents folder.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:47,560
It's about like Clarissa that I wrote years ago and then months ago and then I did not

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
organize at all.

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,120
I'm trying to find a thing that I wrote down as like, I was trying to figure out how many

86
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,520
pages I have of Clarissa sketched already.

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,400
I think it's like 38 pages, which is about like two or three chapters.

88
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Like ones that you haven't finished.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,840
Yeah, they're sketched, they're not lined or shaded or anything.

90
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
And I was like, okay, how fast can I do all that?

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,600
That might be like roughly a month's work to draw what I have.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,440
And then I would need to sketch the rest of the comic and finish like I need to write

93
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,080
what happens next and then sketch what happens next and see how many pages that is.

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,680
And so I'm like, shit, that's a lot of work.

95
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,440
That's a lot of stuff.

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,160
And then Pumpkin Alley is like, oh, concept art.

97
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,960
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,520
How do you make a game?

99
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

100
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,840
What?

101
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,680
And so that's sort of that's the question.

102
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,200
Yeah.

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,840
And then I was like, okay, the other thing I was doing is Elden Ring Streams.

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:04,600
But I think both combination of factors has resulted in zero viewers for the last few or

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,840
very, very low amount of viewers where it used to be like roughly 10 would come up.

106
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,640
And that's nice.

107
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,560
10 is a nice number.

108
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
It's not like a huge number, but it's fun because of people in chat.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
But the last few times is no one.

110
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,240
I think it's a combination of waning interest in Elden Ring Streams.

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,480
Like people probably the hype around Elden Ring has died down just enough

112
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,720
that it's not like hot shit anymore.

113
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,240
Yeah, it's been out for it's been out for what, like two months now?

114
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,120
Yeah.

115
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,880
And almost as much as the fucking war with Ukraine.

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,800
Is that right?

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
That sounds about right.

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,880
Is it third three months now?

119
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,720
Is it February?

120
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,880
I don't remember.

121
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,600
I don't remember.

122
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
Well, fuck.

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,720
What?

124
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,080
We've always been at war with Ukraine.

125
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,320
I mean, Russia's always been at war with Ukraine.

126
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,800
Yeah.

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,320
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,280
And then also I like stream at stupid times and I don't have a schedule and I can't keep to a schedule.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,600
Hmm.

130
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,840
And it was just sort of demoralizing.

131
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,520
I was like, what, what the fuck am I doing with anything?

132
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
I can't draw Clarissa because I suck.

133
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,440
I can't draw the Pumpkin Alley concept art because I suck and I'm stupid.

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,800
And when I do like little, little Elden Ring things, nobody even comes to those anymore.

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,360
Why am I streaming?

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,120
Why am I wasting my time?

137
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,240
And then I was like, oh, why am I wasting my time with anything?

138
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,320
And then I, you know, and it happened.

139
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,880
That's true.

140
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,120
Big, big depression.

141
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,440
Well, that's what I mean.

142
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,120
That's life, though, just wasting your time with anything.

143
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
Yeah, think about it.

144
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,040
Oh, you've you've solved it.

145
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

146
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,840
That's my week, I guess.

147
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,200
I don't know.

148
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,360
Yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,320
Streaming is, I don't know how to do it.

150
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,760
I just rather than, I don't know, I think I think my own at some point.

151
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,920
Every once in a while back when I used to stream, I would get like a big,

152
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,320
I would have a really good day and I would like a big, bigger number than usual people.

153
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,480
And I'd be like, yes.

154
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,960
Yeah, and I don't and I don't know what caused those.

155
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,600
Most of the time I didn't know what caused that to happen.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,920
And then other times I would have a more modest number and I'd be like,

157
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,960
and I think I had gone a while without like a big like a big attendance stream.

158
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,120
And I think I think I quit like before before things could drop off too much.

159
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:44,120
Yeah, I mean, there's only so much attention that goes can be like spread around.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,920
And it's not it's it's just like you don't know how many people who would

161
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
watch you are free on what day of the week unless you ask all of them individually.

162
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,520
Yeah, so you just have to guess like what's the most effective time.

163
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,040
And if you get the if you have a schedule, then people can think about it and plan around it.

164
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,720
And that's true. Yeah, there's just there's a lot there's ways to do it.

165
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,760
It's just I was doing it lazily and made me sad.

166
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,200
And I was like, it's all my fault.

167
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,240
Everything I do is wrong.

168
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,960
Gib, I do you even deserve to live?

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,800
That's that's the question.

170
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Yeah, that's what I was asking as well.

171
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
Determined that no.

172
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,480
Oh, shit.

173
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,840
I don't actually have a I don't actually deserve to live.

174
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,320
I haven't made like a Steven universe before.

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,680
No.

176
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,880
And I'm I'm approaching like the year 30.

177
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
That's right.

178
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,600
That means as soon as you're 30, everything has gone wrong, apparently.

179
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
That's correct.

180
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,520
So if I if I'm not like, oh, I didn't like make it big before then.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,720
Well, I may as well just just where you're certainly you're certainly not going to after.

182
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,760
So, you know, yeah, there's no there's no not even one example

183
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,000
of a person who made it after they hit 30, not even one.

184
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,160
Post in the comments if you can find even one.

186
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,160
No, I mean, sure.

187
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,960
Yeah, why not?

188
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
I feel you.

189
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,080
The I don't know.

190
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
You're just right.

191
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,120
That's it. Yes, I'm so fucking right.

192
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Oh, you know what?

193
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,400
Thanks, Ben, you made me feel better.

194
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,320
Now, maybe I do deserve to live because I was right about how much how much

195
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,120
everything sucks. Yeah.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,440
You know, sometimes being so smart is a downfall because when you're depressed,

197
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,280
you accurately understand all of the reasons.

198
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,000
And so when somebody tries to console you, you're a real prick because you say,

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,280
well, yeah, I understand that and I know that and you're not helping.

200
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
And they're like, oh, God, fuck it.

201
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,680
Yeah. Goodbye.

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah, I mean, you know, the most objectively true assessment

203
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,840
of the situation is that we're, you know, just like a meaningless vortex

204
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,960
of space dust or whatever in an uncaring universe.

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,640
And that's and that's depressing.

206
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,720
So, like, you know, when when the, you know, as Winston Churchill said,

207
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,040
when the when the shaggy black dog of depression shows up to tell you that,

208
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean, he is correct.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,960
So you got to you got to get past that.

210
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
Is the shaggy dog like combination of shaggy and Scooby?

211
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,080
I I think it's more like I think it's more like the grim

212
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,200
from Harry Potter.

213
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,400
Winston Churchill was a big Harry Potter fan.

214
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,920
Yes. Yeah.

215
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
I mean, it makes sense.

216
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
Not to change the subject, but I guess I will for a moment.

217
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,720
We can go back to that if you want.

218
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,760
But yeah, I did I did want to say someone pointed out that last week I dropped

219
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,960
some hints that I had a thing I'm trying to do that I don't want to talk about.

220
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,360
And that's true.

221
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,080
And someone said, I think it was oh, my phone, my undiscord.

222
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,040
Someone said, oh, new secret project arc already.

223
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,080
And like, yeah, I guess so.

224
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm not I'm not trying I'm not trying to make it a big, like, long secret project.

225
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,800
But but I mean, it is a thing I'm working on and I don't want to talk about it.

226
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
So I guess it's a secret project.

227
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,960
But I was talking to a guy.

228
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,000
So I will continue to not specify what it is.

229
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,360
However, had a funny story sort of I was talking to a guy.

230
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,320
I've been making some phone calls.

231
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:52,880
I've been talking to a guy who may or may not be a guy who can help me do this thing.

232
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,720
And he this is basically unrelated to what I was talking about.

233
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
But he, you know, I mentioned to him that I do YouTube, that I'm on YouTube.

234
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,320
And he was like, this seems like an older like Boston accent guy.

235
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
He's like, oh, yeah, I did a yeah, I made a documentary.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,520
I made a documentary about the history of pinball.

237
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,160
I was like, what?

238
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
It's like, yeah, I made it.

239
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,360
You can look it up on you can look it up on Amazon Prime.

240
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,880
I made a history, a history of pinball.

241
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,840
They had like, hold on, you know what?

242
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,760
He had a similar he had a weird bunch of celebrities

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,360
that were in his documentary of pinball.

244
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,840
Hang on, Amazon Prime, the history of pinball.

245
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,320
Here, watch the history of pinball prime video Amazon.com.

246
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,840
It's got Slash Frank Thomas, Aerosmith.

247
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,400
Yeah, it's got Guns N' Roses guitarist slash Aerosmith Joe Perry

248
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,320
and Major League slugger Frank Thomas are in this.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,440
What a spread.

250
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,400
Yeah, also, there's a typo in the copy of this video.

251
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,000
Quote, this documentary follows the silver ball

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,440
from the 1600s to the second millennium.

253
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,520
Also, I mean, if I'm being pedantic and I am the second millennium

254
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,440
is what everything's starting with 1000

255
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,680
because the first millennium started with zero.

256
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,520
So this fucking Joker, man, this fucking Joker.

257
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,640
You know, based on his documentary, I think I'm not going to hire him.

258
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,520
This this is like whatever.

259
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,480
This this has like no bearing on what I'm talking to this guy about.

260
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,560
I just thought it was funny.

261
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,880
But what does annoy me, though?

262
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Because this guy, I guess he thinks he's hot shit.

263
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,520
I guess this guy thinks he knows about videos or something.

264
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,560
And a couple of times now, he has brought up to me

265
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,800
a thing called vid IQ.

266
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,520
You ever heard of some of this?

267
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,480
No, he keeps referencing vid IQ.

268
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,000
He says, yeah, I know a guy.

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I know a guy.

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
He's all about flipping phones.

271
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
You know, I'm not interested in flipping phones.

272
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,920
But this guy, he's he's known as the flippin as the phone flippin king.

273
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,840
Everybody, you know, you look you look up how to flip a phone

274
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,280
and you find this guy's videos.

275
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,640
You know how he did it?

276
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,400
Something called vid IQ.

277
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,520
Vids vid IQ.

278
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,600
You get some get made him made him the king of flipping phones.

279
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,640
Now everybody knows him.

280
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,400
And now he's now he's made a million dollars of flipping phones.

281
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,680
And I assume flipping phones like not juggling.

282
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,880
Because that's what I've assumed in my head is I believe he flips it up and he grabs it.

283
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,200
I believe he means like buying broken phones

284
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,000
and refurbishing them and reselling them the way you would flip a house.

285
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,480
Yeah. Yeah.

286
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,200
I think a phone juggler would be a funnier.

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
He made a he's a millionaire.

288
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,320
You look up juggling phones.

289
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,360
So this and this guy, he keeps trying to tell me that.

290
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,640
Oh, yeah, I know this guy who made a lot of money

291
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,720
because he got a lot of he got famous making videos on phone flipping

292
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,440
with the use of the service called vid IQ and you should use vid IQ.

293
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,280
And he called over SEO thing.

294
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,840
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

295
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
It's some it's some SEO thing.

296
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,200
It gives you like analytics tools for your video performance or whatever.

297
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,360
And I I told I told this guy, yeah, I made I mentioned the song

298
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,760
lecture, I was like, yeah, the Sonichu lecture that got like, you know,

299
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,960
got like it's like a million and a half views on he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,760
You know, you use vid IQ, you could get you could get that up to maybe three million.

301
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,080
Like I politely I politely declined to comment, but like, shut up, you idiot.

302
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,720
Like, what are you talking about?

303
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,640
I looked it up.

304
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,560
I looked up some videos or I looked up a video of a guy reviewing reviewing vid IQ

305
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,440
and he had some thoughts about the things they offer the analytics tools and whatever.

306
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,800
Those might be useful for some people, but he this this this guy specifically said,

307
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,000
like, yeah, the SEO boosting is basically all it does is it recommends you tags

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,120
to like put in your tag, you know, your description and like, it's useless.

309
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,200
Tags don't do anything.

310
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,040
So, man, if I talk to this guy again,

311
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,560
I hope he shuts the fuck up about vid IQ.

312
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,240
I don't want to fucking hear it. All right.

313
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Sounds like a classic case of the the normie

314
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,680
thing where they have like three stories and they will say them every time you meet them

315
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,760
because they have those stories and they're like, I heard an interesting thing.

316
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,160
You know that, like, goblins aren't real or whatever.

317
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,840
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that documentary about that.

318
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,040
Not even goblins.

319
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,640
There's not even goblins and, you know, that's just one of the things I know.

320
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,880
No way. What the fuck?

321
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,920
Why are people talking about this?

322
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,480
Damn.

323
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,440
I just this guy doesn't know what he's fucking talking about.

324
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,280
I I don't want to hear it.

325
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,880
I don't hear it, man. This is not.

326
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,120
I don't know. OK, this this this stands to become a big point of annoyance.

327
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,920
If I honestly, I I found this guy, I googled around.

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
I found this guy.

329
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,440
I've been talking to him about doing some some work.

330
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,840
He's like, yeah, maybe I've sort of been meaning to call some other people.

331
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,200
I probably shouldn't put all my eggs in one basket.

332
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,360
This guy is just one option.

333
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
And I want to, you know, look around.

334
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,280
Because anyway, I've been like, vague, vague, being vague about it.

335
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,920
So because I can't say what it is.

336
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,320
So I'll just I'll stop talking about it.

337
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,880
But I mean, it's all in the data.

338
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,960
It's all in the data.

339
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,720
If you go, you check out every goblin image.

340
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,560
It actually leads to like a fake image.

341
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,720
Hey, you know, not made that they're not real.

342
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,600
I made a I made a Netflix documentary, The History of Goblins.

343
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
Yeah, it had it had a thousand views.

344
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,280
And then I and then I paid a vid IQ, ten dollars a month,

345
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,800
and now it's got 10 million views.

346
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,800
So you could you could do that, I guess.

347
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,920
Three million, three million. Oh, yeah.

348
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll just I'll just I'll just double the views

349
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,960
on my on my Sonichu lecture, just just by vid IQ.

350
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,680
You know, the I don't know the tags, maybe I guess they'll tell you to put tags.

351
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,320
Like what a jackass fucking.

352
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I mean, I don't need the the.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,880
I can't even really think of like what like tags you would use to like

354
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,960
suddenly it appears and recommended this video that I watched reviewing

355
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,960
that IQ said that the only time tags actually like make a difference

356
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,440
to your video's performance is if something in your video is like easily

357
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,680
misspelled and you want to use the tags so that it like catches

358
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,280
misspelled versions of the thing you're talking about.

359
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,920
Oh, that's that's smart.

360
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,360
Like, yeah, if I mean, with hypocrite, obviously people so spell it different.

361
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,360
This is an actual word that people spell.

362
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,160
I used to put the versions of that in in my videos.

363
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,080
So like, I hope that I hope that can tend back when that was a thing,

364
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,520
you know, included tags of like all the misspelled versions of their name

365
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,120
because nobody could spell that fucking name, right?

366
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,640
So that might have been helpful, might have been helpful for them.

367
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Wouldn't don't think it would be helpful for me.

368
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,760
Maybe if I put like the sonic, actually, I wonder if there is a sonic tag.

369
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,600
There should be a sonic tag in that video.

370
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,400
Hey, I might if there's not one, I might put it in there.

371
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,440
But that's the like, that's the extent of it.

372
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,440
So it's very annoying, just really irritating when some jackass

373
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,200
doesn't know what they're talking about, tries to fucking tell you some shit.

374
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,400
Yeah, anyway, that was a minor thing that happened to me this week.

375
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,240
Yeah, you know, the more I think about my week,

376
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,080
the more I realize that my depression is so unfounded.

377
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,640
It's just one of those.

378
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,600
Yeah, it just happens and it leads to more and more of it.

379
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,720
Yeah, I know, I know, because you're compromised emotionally.

380
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,920
I very like I think early on I was looking at my sketches for Clarissa

381
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,280
and I was like, you know what, these are good.

382
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,520
This is a good story.

383
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,680
And I wrote I made that tweet.

384
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,640
I made that Snoopy tweet.

385
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,360
Snoopy tweet, where I thought I remembered a panel from Peanuts

386
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,760
where Snoopy is typing.

387
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,560
Oh, yeah, it feels it's so good when you know what you've written is good.

388
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,800
And I'm like, that's me.

389
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,560
I know it.

390
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,440
I was so full of beans back then.

391
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,560
And then suddenly, suddenly, suddenly my Elden Ring playthrough got one view

392
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,600
and I was like, you know what, it's time to end.

393
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
It's over. It's all over.

394
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,960
Yeah, it's the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.

395
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,240
Streamer loses, like doesn't get views once and quits forever.

396
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,640
That's right.

397
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,240
That's right. I'm so stupid.

398
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,280
It's just the straw that broke the camel's back.

399
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,520
You know what? Yeah, you are stupid.

400
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,560
Thanks. You're absolutely right.

401
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,400
I was going to ask you got you got drunk on Twitter the other day.

402
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

403
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,720
You messaged me.

404
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,720
No, I messaged you and you replied drunk.

405
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
And then I saw on Twitter, you were drunk posting.

406
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,160
Oh, yeah, what did I say?

407
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,480
I'm drunk right now, so take everything I say with a gram of salty.

408
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,080
What was I messaging you about?

409
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,360
It was something or other.

410
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,840
It's about the secret project, I think.

411
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,520
Oh, yes, I think it was.

412
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Yes, it was, it was, it was, it was.

413
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,120
I cannot read currently, nor do I attempt to read.

414
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,640
And then you say based on drink pilled.

415
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,680
And then I say, Glenn live that is my favorite whiskey.

416
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,840
Yes, I've never had it.

417
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,560
It is. I do like Glenn live it because it's like it's a whiskey,

418
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,520
but it doesn't hurt.

419
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,760
That's probably why I got drunk because I had two of them.

420
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,960
Two.

421
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,440
Well, I had a glass and a half of wine as well.

422
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,840
I don't know. I don't list list everything list everything you drink.

423
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,720
I had two glim, two glim livets and a glass and a half of one.

424
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Glenn, Glenn live it.

425
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,240
Glenn live it.

426
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,640
And a glass and a half of red wine.

427
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,440
I don't remember what red wine it was.

428
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,320
I'm going to.

429
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,760
I think that's about it.

430
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm going to, I'm going to drink you under the table.

431
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,240
I mean, I'm not that good at holding my liquor.

432
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I am, I'm so good at holding my liquor.

433
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,800
This is confirmed multiple times that I will be literally blackout drunk

434
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,240
and not remember anything that's happening and people the next day

435
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,920
will sometimes tell me they couldn't even tell that has happened a few times.

436
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,640
Well, that seems like the worst situation

437
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,240
because they're not even funny.

438
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,120
Yeah, it's not great. Yeah, it's not great.

439
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,840
You don't even remember anything, but you weren't even hilarious on Twitter.com like me.

440
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,760
Oh, God, I have nightmares.

441
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't actually have nightmares, but I dread like, what if I got inebriated

442
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,640
and I said something like stupid or incriminating or, I mean, not incriminating,

443
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,040
but like, you know, something shameful on Twitter.

444
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,760
And then it's a real.

445
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,320
Yes, something like that.

446
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,200
And then and like, what if that happened?

447
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,480
Like what if I accidentally post porn to Twitter or something?

448
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,360
What if I accidentally post porn in my discord?

449
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,280
That's that's what I think about.

450
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,840
That's my like nightmare scenario.

451
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,920
I was still I was I remember everything I did when I was drunk.

452
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,920
I think it's it's it's that funny buzz where you're like,

453
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,080
haha, I'm so silly.

454
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm going to be silly and you type silly things knowingly.

455
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,160
So I think the only thing I slightly regret is

456
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,760
acting Andrew Hussie and calling him a bad father and saying I could take risk

457
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,120
off his hands, just say the word.

458
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,760
It was funny at the time.

459
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,320
I think that's kind of stupid.

460
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,520
I'm sure he I shouldn't have said that.

461
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,840
I'm sure he took it as a joke.

462
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,640
But I'm just some random weirdo.

463
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,840
He probably has notifications turned off anyway.

464
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,720
If I'm sure if he saw it, he thought like,

465
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,600
oh, another crazed another crazy risk of another

466
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,520
another deranged lunatic on my time line.

467
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
And just just another one.

468
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,400
I suppose like when it comes to homestuck posts, it's not that weird.

469
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,160
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,640
I felt it's weird because I felt bad while I was typing.

471
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,680
It's like, oh, no, I shouldn't call him a bad father.

472
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,800
But you know what?

473
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,880
But I'm going to do it.

474
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,840
Inhibitions gone.

475
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,680
I I was going to say about depression

476
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,280
that I often get depressed like late at night,

477
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,200
like it'll be late in the evening and I'll start to feel it.

478
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,400
And then usually, well, a lot of times I don't listen.

479
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,120
But sometimes I think to myself, you know,

480
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,480
I should just go to sleep and I'll wake up and I'll feel better.

481
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,280
And like most most of the time, most of the time, that's true.

482
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,400
So I don't know.

483
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,120
I think it's something about the time of day or, you know,

484
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,880
my my my sleep cycle or like my brain chemicals

485
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,920
like changes as it gets later or I've been awake longer or something.

486
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,600
I mean, for me, I I don't pay too much attention when it happens.

487
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,000
Sometimes I try to think, oh, shit, I'm depressed.

488
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,320
Let's analyze this.

489
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,360
Why am I what happened so that I can learn from my mistake?

490
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,200
But a lot of the time, I think it just comes down to like

491
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,920
how you're feeling physically

492
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,120
combined with a few little emotional things like, oh, my stomach hurt.

493
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,120
Yeah. Oh, there's so so weird taste in my mouth.

494
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,360
I don't like that.

495
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,520
Oh, it's a lot of it is intestinal stuff.

496
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,240
Apparently, a lot of your gut bacteria determines what your mood is.

497
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah, you have a bad shit day.

498
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,480
If you have a bad diarrhea moment,

499
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,440
then you're going to feel bad, even if a good news was happening.

500
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,560
Hmm, I didn't didn't know that.

501
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,320
That sounds troubling.

502
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,920
I would look into it because I just vaguely recall somebody telling me that.

503
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,640
And I'm like, yeah, that makes sense, actually.

504
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,560
Sometimes when I take a big shit when I've needed to,

505
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,720
suddenly everything seems all right.

506
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,120
And I'm just like, you know what, that's a weight off my behind.

507
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Munchie told me that his doctor recommended him

508
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,880
like do a thing.

509
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,120
There was a name for this particular diet that I'd never heard before,

510
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,800
but it involved like avoiding fermented foods

511
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,880
as some sort of like gut health thing.

512
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,360
And it was like no bread.

513
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,640
It was like no bread because bread has like yeast in it.

514
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,440
Bread is fermented, but cheese is OK.

515
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,320
Cheese is fermented, but it's OK for some reason.

516
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,840
And I just thought that was bizarre.

517
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,880
I'd never heard of such a thing, but I guess.

518
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,640
But I guess it was to have some effect on the gut.

519
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
Biome, I don't know.

520
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,960
I mean, I'm sure like bread isn't the best thing.

521
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,720
I mean, bread or yeah, like excessive amounts

522
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,440
of bread is a bit like bloating.

523
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,760
I avoid I avoid I avoid most bread

524
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,560
just because it's just because it's carb heavy.

525
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,960
I've been I've been a little I haven't been I haven't been disastrous

526
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,200
about my dieting lately, but I've been a little bit.

527
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,280
I've been a little bit not on the point that I want to be with it.

528
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,200
So I got to get back on track with that.

529
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,520
And then I haven't I haven't lifted this.

530
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,800
No, I lifted once this week, but then I'm on.

531
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,760
She got a cold and now I can't.

532
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,800
Last time I tried to lift alone, I almost dropped the bar on myself

533
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,680
during the bench press, which I say I would have died.

534
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,360
I probably would not have died, but it would have been very annoying.

535
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,080
I was because in the in that basement, there's a the light is on a timer.

536
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,480
And so it the light you have to reset it every 30 minutes or else the light turns off.

537
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,200
I was bench pressing.

538
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,640
It was on my last set and the light turned off like on my last rep.

539
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,880
And I'm like, oh, God, so I just had to like that would be terrifying.

540
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,000
It was terrifying.

541
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,680
I mean, it wasn't so much weight that I would have like dropped it on myself

542
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,880
and it would have crushed my rib cage.

543
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,560
I would have suffocated. I would have died.

544
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,760
What would have happened is I just would have dropped it.

545
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,080
It would have landed on my chest.

546
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,520
I would have had to like strenuously roll it down my body to my waist

547
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,200
so that I could sit up with the bar sort of under me.

548
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,840
Like that's what it would have hurt and it would have been uncomfortable.

549
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,320
And it maybe I would have strained something.

550
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,160
And anyway, the point is I don't want to do that.

551
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,440
So Munchy is having a cold means I have no one to lift with.

552
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,920
See, the problem you're doing is you were pushing, you weren't lifting.

553
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,040
You were pushing the weight up.

554
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,760
You should be lifting it on the ground.

555
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,160
That's that's, you know, I feel a little bad.

556
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,280
I'm going to go up.

557
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,560
You know what? That's that's Munchy's problem, too.

558
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,440
He that clown, that fool, he thinks I'm going to I'm going to tear in a moment.

559
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
I'm going to put him on public blast right now.

560
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,280
He thinks he's so clever.

561
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,880
He thinks he's going to get big arms because he's replacing.

562
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,200
He's replacing the the bent over row and or power clean with the bicep curl.

563
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,760
He's curling. Oh, he wants to curl to get big arms.

564
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,240
You Rube, you Rube, that's not a pulling exercise.

565
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,800
That's an isolation exercise.

566
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,880
The point of the third exercise on the set B is that it's a pulling exercise

567
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
for the back, the bent over row or the power clean.

568
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,800
You can't just replace it with the curl, but he insists.

569
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,320
He's he's a madman.

570
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,160
He won't listen to reason.

571
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,640
He's he's out of his mind.

572
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,200
He's out of control.

573
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,240
Yeah, I'm thinking about like what muscles would be interacting with the

574
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,200
it would just be your your arm up to and maybe including a bit of your

575
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,000
shoulder, but it wouldn't touch the back really.

576
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,640
The the curl, the curl is is basically just the bicep.

577
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
And that's fine if he wants to do them.

578
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,640
I'm not I don't think he wants to be barred from doing them.

579
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,880
But they are not but they are not a replacement for the bent over row,

580
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,640
which the point of the third exercise in the second set is that it is about pulling.

581
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,880
And the and the curl is not a pull.

582
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,760
But it's but I but I but he's but he's but he's on a tear.

583
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,160
He's a madman.

584
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,920
He can't be stopped.

585
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,480
He can't be bought, bargained,

586
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,040
reasoned or negotiated with.

587
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,800
He's a terrorist based.

588
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,840
Yeah.

589
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,640
That's right.

590
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,880
OK, what were we talking about?

591
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,920
I don't remember something.

592
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,080
Yeah.

593
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,640
What else did I do this week?

594
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,160
Worked on the book, wrote those notes, made the pages,

595
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,240
talked to that dude about the secret thing.

596
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,200
Oh, I guess last time to mention this,

597
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,960
I'll probably have already I'll definitely have already sent

598
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,960
the load of ghosts, a current batch of things.

599
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:53,280
There's still as of recording one, two, three, four people.

600
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,080
Wait, is that four?

601
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,880
I'm like blind one, two, three, four is five five people

602
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,920
who have not sent the thing in.

603
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,640
I'm going to send it.

604
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,520
So I'll send these when they come.

605
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,280
James Gottwijk,

606
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,840
James Gottwijk, Adam O'Donnell, DS and Milo Rocks.

607
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,360
Milo Rocks is a is a doodle and a plush

608
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,640
pleasure, so get on that.

609
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,040
But soon I will have mostly sent all of the load of ghost things.

610
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,160
I got like a big batch.

611
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,520
I got to buy the postage and send them and

612
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,640
God damn it, that will be most of them gone.

613
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,400
And then I'll bring yours to Boston in like a few weeks when I'm going over.

614
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,880
Yeah, I'll bring Casus as well.

615
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,480
Yeah.

616
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,800
And looking forward to very exciting.

617
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,320
And then what will you do?

618
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,320
Then I will have mostly finished that and I won't have to think about it.

619
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,400
Nice. That's good.

620
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,480
I got a I got a message from actually it was from

621
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Sasuke Pro who wrote.

622
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,160
Oh, he wrote one of the

623
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,840
songs, one of the PZP theme songs.

624
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,240
But which one?

625
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,160
It wasn't the don't give it up.

627
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,080
Bensane dreaming don't give it up.

628
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
It was when we did the theme song

629
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,680
contest and we and we picked the theme song and I forget which theme song it was

630
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,080
that it wasn't the like I'm supposed to be working.

631
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,800
right now i'm supposed to be working right now it wasn't that cover of that song because that

632
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,520
was by oblivionfall it was uh oh god damn it okay i can't remember i'm sure i'd recognize

633
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,920
if i heard it it was it was that person uh the point is i they the customs caught uh their their

634
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,600
plebeian wee blu-ray copy it got caught by their country's customs office and now it will probably be

635
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,640
another like two weeks in transit and then it will maybe get back to my p.o box and then i don't

636
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,400
have to check my p.o box and find that and send it again and probably i have not checked my p.o box

637
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,520
in months there are probably a whole bunch of them in there that didn't that didn't make it to their

638
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,560
destination and i just haven't checked because like i said before my p.o box is near my old

639
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,440
residence it is not it is kind of inconveniently far away from my current residence so take me

640
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:39,080
like an hour to get there and back at least uh so that's annoying god i've had a few really annoying

641
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,240
things happen with customs and can i just say i'm so mad because like right like like during

642
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,800
covet there was a post office there was a post office right near where i live like like two

643
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,960
streets down and it's closed they closed during covet and now there's no post office here and now

644
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,400
it's i gotta fucking get the bus and shit and that sucks okay that does suck it really sucks

645
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:08,680
what a bit would have been incredible yeah the i've i've had a few like really annoying customs

646
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:17,400
things where i think on yeah on separate occasions somebody lost because the customs they open the

647
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,680
packaging with with what i assume is like bear claws they rip it to shreds they scatter all the

648
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,280
things on the floor and they sniff it because they're bears they're just big bears in the customs

649
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,560
office ripping things to shreds and sniffing it for drugs or whatever and then haphazardly

650
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,040
throwing it back into a plastic bag and sending it but on separate occasions somebody has not

651
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,840
received their red man comic not received their pin and now not received the plush but they did

652
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,800
feel like they should they they did receive the ghost costume so they don't have the plush

653
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,680
that the costume goes on they have everything except the plush and that was really annoying

654
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:06,280
because i only have a few of those that reminds me when i was a little kid my family took

655
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:16,520
a vacation to mexico and i brought uh my two favorite stuffed animals and i might as well

656
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:24,680
mention they were a a penguin named fluffy and a bunny named norman norman norman i like i like

657
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,960
the cut of that jib yeah that was um i think there was a sesame street skit with like a dog

658
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,480
named norman and i just like the name and i and i named this uh this rabbit norman anyway the point

659
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:45,000
is i like lost those animals on the trip like i lost them on the plane or something and i was

660
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,080
devastated but they did cut customs did somehow like eventually like send them back to me like

661
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,680
or maybe it was maybe just the airline found them and the lost and found or something and they got

662
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,120
sent back to me i don't know they miraculously got sent back to me the years i remember like i

663
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,720
years later that story came up and my i think my mom mentioned like that they probably had like

664
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,000
they probably had like pulverized them or something like to make sure there weren't

665
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,800
any drugs inside them or something or like it's kind of surprising that they didn't like slice

666
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:26,840
them open to like find yeah cocaine bags or something inside um that is the classic thing

667
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:35,800
mexico mexico being how it is and all you know uh but i got them but i got them but you know what

668
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:42,920
while they were lost my cousin jeffrey gave me a another stuffed animal to replace them

669
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:50,040
he gave me a a frog in a hawaiian shirt named uh and i named that jeffrey after him so and then

670
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,560
i got those two back so from then on uh my three favorite stuffed animals were fluffy norman and

671
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:02,680
jeffrey uh that's really cute thank you yes i still there they're still they're still in a box

672
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:10,440
somewhere they're still in like my parents attic or something um yeah i remember like stuffed animals

673
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,280
from when i was little we would like just me and my brothers would just abuse them and beat the

674
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,400
shit out of them constantly i remember we had this this lion uh just sort of like not a brand

675
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:31,720
lion or anything just like a oh it's a lion soft toy um and it was like i think like two feet tall

676
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,000
it was quite big and we could like wrestle with it we could pretend it was like attacking us we

677
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,080
could beat the shit out of it and kick it and throw it against the wall that was the that was

678
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:48,760
the best of times when we had like a a fool that would dare to come into our realm and we would

679
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:55,800
destroy them and he had a tail and you could swing him around your head and throw him and it was very

680
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:04,360
violent i would um i would put i remember i would put my stuffed ant for when i had two i would put

681
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:13,400
them you know my my bed was against the wall uh i would put my fluffy and norman one of like the

682
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,360
like the corner of the bed facing away from the wall one at the front one at the back when i had

683
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,200
jeffrey two i would put the three of them fluffy norman jeffrey at the front back and middle on

684
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,920
the side of the bed facing away when i would sleep i would i would post them there these three like

685
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,280
regular positions as like guards to i guess like keep ghosts away or something uh or demons or

686
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:41,000
various threats that might menace me in the night uh i think that was their main function that was

687
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,160
how they paid the that was how they paid their rent they got that that thousand yards stare the

688
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:58,680
beat the lies i was very concerned about uh ghosts and such they were scared uh yeah

689
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,320
i remember having a few like scary scary moment where it's just dark and you

690
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,160
you're you're you're you're you're a tough you're a tough little kid you're like i'm not gonna be

691
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,280
scared and then immediately you think you see something and because you haven't had an experience

692
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,000
like that before you're not even really aware about what is possible to happen in the dark

693
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:30,600
so you see a dressing gown hung up uh or a bathroom brother uh for you americos and

694
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,480
it's like a dark figure really tall in the other side of the room you're like

695
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:42,520
is that a person you can't tell i remember this this experience i stared at it for ages thinking

696
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,000
that's a person and i guess i was groggy and i was like unaware of like what was real and what

697
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,240
wasn't i'm like what happens if i go to sleep now because i know that's not a person but

698
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:09,400
they're gonna get it it really looks like a fucking creature scary times uh i you know this

699
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,400
is uh to change changing the subject yet again but i just remembered another something else that

700
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:23,800
vexed me this week uh turns out i don't know why i thought this wouldn't be a problem but it turns

701
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:34,840
out it is a problem is uh the thing with the printing green um yeah printing is awful yeah i

702
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,120
for some reason i thought that like oh no no that's only a problem with offset printing with

703
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:48,760
digital printing it's fine uh no it's it's just because like to combine colors makes them darker

704
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:59,000
yeah green is not an ink color like you got magenta cyan and yellow right yeah and see

705
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,640
green you have to make it kind of dark which means all greens are kind of fucked

706
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:14,440
yeah so uh i mean i've been i you know uh what a manga studio lets me sort of like preview

707
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:21,320
what a an image will look like printed in in various cmyk colors and like i've been going

708
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:28,600
through some pages and like most of them are fine some of you know the the really the really

709
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:35,800
bright greens they get muted but on most pages they still stand out you can still they still look

710
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,560
like what they're supposed to look like you can still tell that they're supposed to be like a green

711
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:45,000
it's it's not it's not ruined you've got to try with like some of them look kind of contrast some of

712
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,080
them look a little bad and i might i might have to go through and like maybe touch some up maybe like

713
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,040
alter the shades a little bit yeah to like bring some contrast back that would be missing

714
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,240
otherwise it's just such a it's just such a bummer i don't know i think it'll be i think it'll be

715
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:08,360
okay i think it'll be okay but it's a real bummer uh seeing like it really took me a long time trying

716
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,440
to figure out how to make the red man green as green as i can make it and it's still it looks fine

717
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:26,920
when you look at it what make the red man green weed from uh from a peter pan you know yes yes

718
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,760
they did smoke weed didn't they no in in did you know that scene in peter pan where they're singing

719
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,920
about where the native americans are singing about what makes the red man red i i i remember vaguely

720
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,720
but i remember they had the the pipe and they were smoking weed dude they were smoking fucking

721
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:49,080
big stacks there's they're smoking something i don't did they have weed did a native american

722
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:55,160
smoke marijuana i don't know they might have didn't they find marijuana in that part of the world

723
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,640
isn't that where it's from i don't i don't remember i know tobacco is from that but you know i don't

724
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:12,920
know nothing but yeah i spent likewise i spent a long time choosing the greens for um for the

725
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:19,880
pins for these for the rfck enamel pins i spent a long long time picking out individual greens

726
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,840
for all the different pin designs that had green in them because you could especially for slime

727
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,320
corp and endless war itself it's like you can't you can't get that fluorescent green it just

728
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:36,040
doesn't like exist in like the manufacturing world so you have to choose the best approximation

729
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:45,080
and so wild how certain colors can exist on a screen you just can't find them in reality

730
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,520
yeah because it's it makes sense because it's because it's additive color it's adding

731
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,240
with with pixels on a screen you're adding light together versus when you're printing

732
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:01,560
you're subtracting you're subtracting from the white of the page yeah yeah yeah like i get it

733
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:10,360
would it be like if history was different and like the standard for printing was like rgb

734
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:19,880
for instance would greens like suddenly become like more printable i i don't know how that would

735
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:28,200
work yeah i think i think it's mostly the the the light the brightness of of like magenta

736
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:34,040
cyan and yellow mostly cyan and yellow they're they're bright enough that when you mix them together

737
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:44,120
they end up with a sort of not so dark color um and if rgb ink was used i don't know if that's

738
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,160
would even be possible i assume it can be because like ink can be many colors but

739
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,240
yeah i don't know maybe maybe maybe it's just sort of like that's those three colors are the best

740
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:04,760
um inks colors to use for the broadest range of possible results and that's why they use that

741
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:13,480
you ever see you ever see that graph of like that graph of colors that humans can see because

742
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:19,880
like when when you have you know you're in your art program or whatever you got your you got your

743
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:28,120
little dam you got your little dam uh color wheel to pick your colors on but that's not really like

744
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:35,160
that's not really like the like reflective of the colors humans can see here um i've i've seen

745
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:42,840
the captain dissolution did a video about color and yeah a lot of really good animations like

746
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:48,440
visually showing the triangle of like possible colors that like certain cameras and our human

747
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,560
eyes can see yeah and then like like bees would go off the grid and be like a weird thing that we

748
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,760
can't even comprehend yeah that i think that i think that might be where i saw it but yeah it looks

749
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,480
like it looks more like this with like the the greens being like really big like humans can

750
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,400
just like perceive a lot more different shades of green so maybe maybe that's part of why

751
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,720
it's hard to get like that accurate green in print it's just because humans are more sensitive

752
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:27,080
to like we're more able to see yeah yeah i mean it makes sense we're evolutionarily uh the the

753
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:33,560
you know the colors we can see are mostly green because there's mostly green foliage we need to

754
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,920
be able to discern what is a tree and what is something behind the tree it's lurking in the

755
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,880
shadows do you think do you think that's why i i would i would i would assume that like it's

756
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:51,800
it's blues and greens because those are the colors of nature largely and that's why we we we evolved

757
00:48:51,800 --> 00:49:00,280
to to need like a very keen eye for that sort of thing in order to survive i have two thoughts

758
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:08,280
red you know well naively what i would think is that like you know nature is a lot of greens and

759
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:14,440
browns so you would think that humans would be sensitive to things that are not that like things

760
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,880
that are red or blue would would stand out you would want to be like oh my god what's that like i

761
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,240
really notice that thing that doesn't look like everything so so i would think you would be more

762
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:31,720
sensitive to other colors but but you make a good point maybe because so much stuff is green and brown

763
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:38,040
and whatever it means that you need to be able to more finely distinguish it yeah it's it's the same

764
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:46,120
way that humans are so good at seeing faces and understanding faces despite the fact that

765
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:53,880
we all have faces it's it's the knowing of the emotions of the face that can allow you to understand

766
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,200
whether another person is going to hurt you or is a friend you know like under reading emotions is a

767
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:08,440
very evolutionarily important skill kirby shaped like a friend yeah he's friend shaped i know that

768
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,880
much he wouldn't eat you and turn you into like a fucking marionette that he would use to pilot

769
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,840
in a disgusting horrible way he wouldn't he wouldn't devour you obtain your skills take them to like

770
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:28,520
fucking the dark underworlds opposite universe and use them to defeat the the embodiment of

771
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:35,880
at all entropy in the known universe or something that would be so fucked up it's so wild how kirby

772
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,840
is the cutest like friend shaped character in the whole video game world but he is also

773
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:51,640
almost like explicitly like a like an eldritch abomination that can do almost anything i he

774
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:59,560
he would be a god of destruction if he weren't so cute i wonder like at what i feel like these days

775
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,640
that's like very explicit like in like there's yeah there is like no they almost they almost

776
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:12,360
don't even like pretend otherwise but it's it wasn't always i mean it wasn't always the case

777
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:17,080
i mean no in the first game he's just like a little chevy guy going around eating stuff

778
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:23,000
and fighting a funny penguin but even on like the the nes and the and the super and and the

779
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,360
gameboy and the super nintendo he you were still like the final boss would be like on the moon

780
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:35,560
fighting like a big like vampire well that's that's that's dark the nes dark matter like yeah like

781
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:41,720
dark matter is from i think the first dark matter fight was in like the gameboy now the the gameboy

782
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:48,440
i think is it's just ddd like it's it's a tiny little game doesn't take very long one of the

783
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:54,760
gameboy games has you fight like a dark matter with a sword uh i don't know why no you're right

784
00:51:54,760 --> 00:52:01,080
maybe i'm thinking wrong i did play all of those games for Kirby month all those years ago oh that's

785
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:06,760
right that's right yeah i don't know i think number being like ddd being the ending of the first

786
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:14,760
kirby on gameboy uh i don't i don't think i played the first one on gameboy i was all about

787
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:21,480
superstar saga or not i was all about yeah superstar right on the super nintendo uh yes

788
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:28,520
that was my that was my kirby kirby maybe the one on the on the nes whichever one that was

789
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:35,640
nightmare and dreamland was it is that what it's called i don't remember i'm trying to find i played

790
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:41,240
the one on the nes and then i and then i i played uh superstars all right kirby's dreamland was the

791
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:47,400
first one residents are discussing what to do spray a little little boy named kirby apparently is a

792
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,560
boy in the first he's a boy yeah i i look at kirby and i say he's that's that's a boy right there

793
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,480
all tears to defeat king dd upon successfully doing so he uses the magic of the sparkling stars to

794
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,520
transform into a hot air balloon and return the king's stolen food so yeah the mini adventure

795
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,520
that's in like kirby superstar is the entirety of the first game where yeah dd is hoarding all the

796
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:16,920
food kirby an enjoyer of food steals it back and gives it back to everyone and he's like robin hood

797
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,280
that's the extent of it and then i think the nes game is the one that has like the dream

798
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:31,720
dark man any i nes has i think it has the that big like clockwork thing in space with the face on

799
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:38,600
it like the wishing that's that's superstar oh okay that's one of the superstar ones kirby's adventure

800
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:46,200
on nes well does the nes one have the final boss is nightmare and he's that vampire it's a guy it's

801
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:53,640
like a it's like a moon-faced cloak guy yeah and he opens his cloak up and you have to hit his like

802
00:53:53,640 --> 00:54:02,520
ethereal like genie tail i remember fighting him and i don't remember if that was i think that was

803
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:09,080
before i got superstar so i'm thinking that was the one on the nes oh yeah nightmare

804
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,120
when kirby defeats ddd and returns the rod to the fountain yeah this is the first one where

805
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,960
i'd like ddd is kind of a good guy yeah this is like the butt last time dd's the bad guy but no

806
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,800
dd was trying to protect the world oh my god they're being revealed i just had a i just had

807
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:36,680
a fucking brain blast of insane magnitude what i just had oh how cool would it have been if they

808
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:47,000
had made like a jrpg like mario rpg but with kirby i would have gone fucking nuts would have lost

809
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:53,720
if they made that would have been yeah like a super mario rpg but kirby like exactly like

810
00:54:53,720 --> 00:55:00,520
super mario rpg but with kirby and you recruit ddd and metanite and uh i don't know i guess

811
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:08,200
spear waddley didn't exist back then but the whatever uh the the poppy bro or whatever the

812
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:19,000
just a poppy bro sure why not um yeah i kirby has always been like cool yeah the first nes game

813
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,480
have having a subversive super secret final boss that's actually the last villain it's like if like

814
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,040
is that night was that night meant to have that right yeah that's nightmare like imagine if like

815
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:36,200
sonic 2 like dr robotnik um was actually the good guy and there was a super secret evil

816
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,240
other thing that he was trying to save people from imagine that being the second sonic game

817
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:46,280
after after one like that yeah they were they were they were they were immediately they were

818
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,800
immediately just like ah ddd is not uh he's not that he's not he's not he's not badass enough to

819
00:55:51,800 --> 00:56:00,360
be like a super villain he's he's he's a he's a complicated fellow what's the next one kirby's

820
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,080
avalanche yeah kirby's dreamland 2 that was the gameboy one that had like a cool

821
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,320
ah i love dreamland 2 the gameboy ones i think are like underrated and underplayed they really

822
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:20,600
should be more it's okay i i feel like the real like eldritch stuff in kirby really starts with

823
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:27,560
dark matter and dark matter was apparently the final boss in kirby's dreamland 2 right like all the

824
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:34,360
all the stuff about like god of destruction like the the antithesis of all light or whatever is like

825
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:41,320
it most of that ties back to dark matter uh yeah yeah possess king ddd and attempt to

826
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,760
shroud the world in darkness and he's got the sword he's also in dreamland 3 dark cloud like

827
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,360
creature currently appearing as a black world covered in orange blobs yeah yeah i remember this

828
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,720
i mean in the gameboy he's just sort of a you could do no color so

829
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:03,080
oh my god look at this look at that sprite art that looks so fucking good i can't even believe it

830
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:11,560
he's got a he's got a fucking sword i gave i had a i think it might have been squeak squad or

831
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:20,760
amazing mirror or something i had some kirby game on the gba in high school or maybe middle

832
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,640
school maybe it was high school i don't remember uh but i was playing some kirby game and there was

833
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:33,640
this girl i had a crush on and we were on the same bus together and i showed her kirby and i had

834
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:39,800
sword power and she was like playing it a little bit and she could not believe i don't even know

835
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,560
she just could not believe how kirby looked running around with the sword she like squealed

836
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:54,440
she was like he runs with a sword like she loved it she was blown away by it and you know what she

837
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:01,000
was absolutely right i too love it when kirby runs with the sword he's like a little cute thing with

838
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:09,720
like a the huge sword and blood sword destroyed and like an abomination a dream eating darkness

839
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:20,520
entity it's just like like a possessing a penguin it's so cool i knew what they were doing they

840
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:26,360
really did it's by this point i think yeah by dreamland too i think they definitely did

841
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:33,160
they there was definitely the the themes were there um she and i can you can you believe

842
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:39,080
that i showed her kirby's sword power and i didn't even get laid so yeah it's not fair

843
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,560
you should have run around with a sword as well

844
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:50,120
bring a sword to school like straight up and run around yeah like it's it's bigger than me

845
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,440
he really is doing some he really is doing some guts shit with a with a sword bigger than him

846
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:03,480
go to ask video games though um yeah i never played the game boy once

847
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:11,000
uh i here's my hot take um i think i said it in my my old kirby video but kirby's dreamland

848
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,240
does not have the ability to steal power ups from enemies yeah which is obviously fun

849
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:25,560
but when you play the game it feels so much it feels balanced around the idea that you

850
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:32,440
inhale air and then you exhale upset when when you stop like floating and you're exhale being

851
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:38,200
like your main thing it's like that that's actually really good it's a really tight

852
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:46,040
fun challenging enough video game and later versions in like a superstar where the the

853
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:53,000
ability to take powers from enemies is included uh completely trivializes everything and so it's

854
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,240
like almost no challenge at all and so like i think i think there's something less there's some some

855
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:09,160
some there's some uh game design difficulty in balancing difficulty for for a game where you

856
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:14,680
can have so many different powers that so many do so many different things so they have to make

857
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:20,840
the games kind of easy uh otherwise um it's all about like getting a very specific power and

858
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:25,720
holding on to it and yeah there would be a meta and it's like that's the reason why kirby games are

859
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:31,800
so simple is because if they were more complicated they it would be like unbelievably difficult to

860
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:37,240
balance all the power ups you could have and stuff and sometimes it is that annoying because like

861
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,720
sometimes there will be some obstacle like in fucking the great cave offensive or whatever like

862
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,760
you have to bring you know a cutting ability or or a fire ability somewhere and if you don't have

863
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,000
one it's like ah god fuck yeah yeah it's it's it's a it's a staple of the series now so you

864
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,640
can't expect a kirby game to not have it uh which is why i feel like people should play the original

865
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:06,200
on gameboy uh to see what it feels like because it's actually pretty fun i should um i i guess i'll

866
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:15,080
i guess i will or i should make another video game at some point but i i don't have any ideas for

867
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:25,560
what kind of video game i would make uh kirby's um kirby's plagiarism uh i would i feel i feel like

868
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:31,800
having made phantom's revenge my like the possibility space has opened up and i'm like yeah i could i

869
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:40,120
can kind of imagine how i could make any number of different sorts of games but i have no idea what

870
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:48,520
i would want to do with all that power no i've had an idea for a video game but it's the sort of

871
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:56,520
thing i don't know if anyone would want um it's just sort of it it touches on like a thing i like

872
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:04,520
to do which is like to organize a bunch of crap into into the places where they should go so like

873
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:11,560
i don't know how this game would work but when i look at like oh my shelf everything's in a random

874
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:17,320
order let's take everything out and figure out how to organize these things and you put them all back

875
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:24,840
and then the shelf is organized uh per your own specifications and so if you want to find something

876
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:31,320
you know exactly where to look for it i feel like a game that harnesses that like that that

877
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:37,800
enjoyment of having a perfectly organized space instead of items would be really fun

878
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:44,440
it's tetris i don't know what yeah but then they disappear i don't like games to disappear off the shelf

879
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:57,640
um i organized my seltzer waters into a color spectrum and you know what just like we're saying

880
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:03,800
there's more greens there's too many greens it's it's it's it's too heavily weighted we got cherry

881
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:10,200
that's purple then we got raspberry that's kind of like purplish like maroon and then there's

882
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:21,240
cran raspberry that's red peach orange tropical fruit yellow lime bright green grape medium green

883
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,040
and then kiwi strawberry is kind of like a like a like a slightly bluish green

884
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,760
why are there so many greens but anyway there's the fucks they're greens but anyway they look great

885
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,720
in a little all in a little rainbow order there i'm so happy nothing nothing could please me more

886
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:48,840
just like imagine i don't know like you're you're like a pack mule guy for an adventuring party

887
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:54,120
they throw a bunch of stuff in their bags and say sort it out please and you're like yes sir

888
01:03:54,120 --> 01:04:00,520
and it's like you have to organize it by item or are you talking about the right place are you

889
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:06,680
talking about the pack or i just like putting things in the right order i guess are you talking

890
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:12,040
about like it like a sort of a diablo sort of like items in your bag on a grid you have to like

891
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:19,480
fit all your gear inside the bag space not not necessarily that but i do enjoy games that have

892
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:25,800
that in it because i i just like putting them all in the right place and being like yes i found

893
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:32,520
an extra bit of space if i put this here instead of there oh god what game oh yes kenshi kenshi has

894
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:38,520
an inventory system like that kenshi kenshi it's like uh i've talked about it before it's like a

895
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,880
huge open world do whatever you feel like oh you were playing this with charlie right

896
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:50,520
no no i'm playing this with one of your brothers maybe i might be thinking of something else

897
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:58,840
i it's not multiplayer so i don't know okay okay um basically there's a big there's like a

898
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:04,600
post apocalypse whatever you got items and you got individual party members that can carry

899
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:11,560
certain amounts um and you can give them bags that have certain items slots and some bags are huge

900
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,960
but they're quite heavy some bags are light and they don't restrict your combat abilities so much

901
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,640
and there's a whole lot of inventory management when you're doing an expedition you want to get

902
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:28,040
everybody there such that nobody's over-encumbered and like slowing everyone else down and that if

903
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,920
combat happens everybody has the ability to like or at least the important people

904
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,640
have the ability to defend themselves and fight back and kill everything that needs to be killed

905
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:45,720
and so inventory management is more than just like fun or like just a busy work it's actually

906
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:53,080
like kind of important if you can manage to fit everything in the right bag with the right squares

907
01:05:54,040 --> 01:06:01,640
i don't know i like it sort of making me think of like the death stranding like you

908
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:08,120
got to like stack your your your cargo on your back you know what i'm saying yeah i haven't played

909
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:16,920
that but yeah i also like the sort of sort of thing yeah yeah i think i mean honestly makes a lot

910
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,760
of sense that that that's like a that's like a satisfying seems like a satisfying

911
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:31,400
feeling and a concept to to build a game around yeah the only problem is i don't know how to code

912
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:38,280
right i could i could use my brother for that but he's doing some stuff and he wants to he wants

913
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:44,920
to be like mostly doing pumpkin alley or some of his own side projects and so this is probably gonna

914
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:50,520
be one of my side projects that if i if i feel like doing it i'll have to like figure out how to

915
01:06:50,520 --> 01:07:00,520
build a rudimentary sort of like grid lists you just gotta think of like what you want the logic

916
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:06,520
to be and then you just like look it up you just google it and be like how do i what's the command

917
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:14,680
for that particular logical argument in oh my god that's so scary why what if i learn too much

918
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:20,280
in my brain it's too big in gml or in unity or whatever oh that's the command okay got it

919
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:26,840
i mean you just do it yeah it's not like it's a it's gonna be too difficult it's just sort of

920
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:33,880
i keep thinking about it but i don't really want to sit down and like really hammer out exactly

921
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:40,840
what it is sure because it's gonna take a long time and also i've got so many other things i need

922
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:49,400
to do first yeah that's how it always is you're always like old project in progress new project

923
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:56,760
oh what's that new project there what's that new that hot new piece of action the the meme of the

924
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:04,680
boyfriend turning away from his girlfriend to look at the identical girl yes so it goes so it goes

925
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,400
isn't that the way they say goes yes

926
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,600
yeah i gotta pee hang on all right you know what i guess i will do

927
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:40,600
do

928
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,600
that's all i gotta do

929
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:25,760
Yeah, you can put a ribbon off, so yeah, you can put a ribbon off, so

930
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:31,760
Ben-Saint? Are you peeing a gallon or two?

931
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,760
What the fuck?

932
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,760
Okay, I'm back.

933
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,760
Hello.

934
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,760
Ugh, what's up?

935
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,760
Nothing.

936
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,760
Okay, uh, bye.

937
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,760
No!

938
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,760
Let's see.

939
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,760
Was there anything else that occurred this week?

940
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,760
No, I don't think so.

941
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,760
I think that's pretty much covers it.

942
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,760
Oh, I got a little thing.

943
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,760
Page notes, yeah.

944
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:09,760
So, my dad came into a collection of old vinyls from his brother,

945
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,760
and we had a vinyl party.

946
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,760
We had like a little vinyl record thing digital, digitized it.

947
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,760
Gay!

948
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,760
And we put on some records.

949
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,760
And we listened to Derrick and the Dominoes, Laila.

950
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,760
Have you heard of that one?

951
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,760
Wait, Laila.

952
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,760
No, I'm thinking of Lola.

953
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,760
What's Laila?

954
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,760
That sounds familiar.

955
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,760
It's the Eric Clapton, like the...

956
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,760
Do you know that one?

957
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

958
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,760
It's Derrick and the Dominoes.

959
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,760
Apparently, they just made up the name because they didn't...

960
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,760
Derrick Clapton?

961
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,760
Eric Clapton and a bunch of other people.

962
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,760
And no one is called Derrick.

963
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,760
It's just this one record, and it was really good.

964
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,760
It's close, though.

965
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,760
It's like they just put a D on his name.

966
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,760
Yes!

967
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,760
That was fun.

968
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,760
And then there was like the original Elton John album.

969
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,760
These are really old things.

970
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,760
It was Houses of the Holy.

971
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,760
They had the ELO thing.

972
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,760
They had the fucking Simon and Garfunkel best of.

973
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,760
It's nice looking at vinyl records.

974
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,760
They had the Woodstock live album.

975
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,760
It's like, well, what do you know?

976
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,760
The past in physical form.

977
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,760
Crazy!

978
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,760
Damn.

979
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,760
I don't know anything...

980
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,760
I don't know if you were planning on selling any of it,

981
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,760
but did you look if anything was super rare or anything like that?

982
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,760
I don't know if they're super rare.

983
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,760
I feel like these sorts of things exist in vinyl record shops

984
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,760
that still sell records

985
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,760
because it's become in vogue in the past decade or so

986
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,760
to still have records made.

987
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,760
You can go to a place and be like,

988
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,760
oh yeah, there's a bunch of the Pink Floyd and the Led Zeppelin

989
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,760
and the classics and the Beatles and this and that.

990
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,760
I don't think there's anything super obscure

991
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,760
and they're all in decent condition.

992
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,760
They're not broken, but they're very dusty.

993
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,760
It's just nice to have them.

994
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,760
I've seen this image on the digital computer screen,

995
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,760
but now I'm beholding it and it feels so much different

996
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,760
when you're looking at an album in sleeve inside cover

997
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,760
and it's like a big photograph stretched over and it's like, wow.

998
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,760
It really do be a different experience having a vinyl record.

999
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,760
I don't have a vinyl record player.

1000
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,760
I've never had one.

1001
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,760
I think my dad had one, but I never used it.

1002
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,760
I'm not, I don't know, anything.

1003
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,760
The funny thing is the skipping.

1004
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,760
I mean, it's not that funny,

1005
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:15,760
but because it's so unusual to me for that to be like a real thing,

1006
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,760
it's like they play the song and they're like,

1007
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,760
and then there's like a like clank sound like a pfft

1008
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,760
because it jumped on like a piece of dust

1009
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,760
and it got like zoomed up and then down again.

1010
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
I don't know, it's not really like that interesting.

1011
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,760
It's just like the crackly fuzzy thing

1012
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,760
that's like permeating the entire song.

1013
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,760
That's an experience you don't have anymore because

1014
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,760
you don't have playback machines that are so noise.

1015
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,760
What's the word?

1016
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,760
Like prone to noise, noise prone.

1017
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,760
A normal speaker on a computer will not make crackling noises.

1018
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,760
No.

1019
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,760
And so my dad was like pogging.

1020
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,760
He was like, oh, this is just how it was.

1021
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,760
It was just how it was around the, you know,

1022
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,760
we would always listen to this one and all the crackling.

1023
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,760
That's what I want to hear before a record starts.

1024
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,760
It's like a big pfft when you put the needle on the thing.

1025
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,760
Ancient history.

1026
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,760
You heard of it?

1027
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,760
No.

1028
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,760
What?

1029
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
Huh?

1030
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,760
But yeah, Derek and the Dominoes,

1031
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,760
Layla and other assorted love songs, I think it's called.

1032
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,760
It's really, really good.

1033
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,760
Very cool blues, Eric Clapton guitar, rock album.

1034
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,760
I like it.

1035
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,760
Do you?

1036
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,760
Yeah.

1037
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,760
Sure.

1038
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,760
I'm glad you're having fun.

1039
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,760
That's so patronizing.

1040
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,760
No, I just don't know what to say about any of that,

1041
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,760
but it sounds like it was a good time.

1042
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,760
Yeah, it was pretty good.

1043
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,760
Pretty cool.

1044
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,760
I was having a bad day, but that was fun.

1045
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,760
Just having a drink, listening to it,

1046
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,760
like a really nice cool record that I'd never listened to,

1047
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:27,760
because why would I Google things that I would never do that?

1048
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,760
Is that when you were drinking Glen Livet?

1049
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,760
No, that was a night before.

1050
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,760
That was a good night.

1051
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
That was a night that was fun.

1052
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,760
My dad and his bandmates came over and they were doing band practice.

1053
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,760
And so they asked me to be there to do some rhythm guitar,

1054
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,760
like accompanying guitar stuff.

1055
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,760
Maybe I'll go on a few shows with them and it's like,

1056
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,760
okay, then after they do their band practice,

1057
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,760
they have a big old drink in the kitchen and I was there.

1058
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,760
So I drank.

1059
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,760
That sounds cool.

1060
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,760
And it was a nice time.

1061
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,760
I got to like a comfortable like,

1062
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,760
I don't mind saying things now.

1063
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,760
Socializing, I can do that.

1064
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,760
And then after they left, I was like,

1065
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,760
well, I'm still drunk.

1066
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,760
Now, what do I do?

1067
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,760
I go on Twitter, I go on Discord,

1068
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,760
I say, haha, I'm drunk.

1069
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,760
What do you think of that, everybody?

1070
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,760
And everyone said, oh my god.

1071
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,760
Oh, interesting.

1072
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,760
Tell me more, yeah.

1073
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,760
Yeah, this was like after I had become depressed for a few days.

1074
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,760
I just didn't know what to do with myself.

1075
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,760
But it was a nice afternoon.

1076
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,760
It was like a drink and a cider and sitting by the record player.

1077
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,760
Living it up.

1078
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,760
That's the life.

1079
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,760
I did remember one other thing that happened.

1080
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,760
I think it was this week, maybe it was last week, whatever.

1081
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,760
I submitted, I did submit a Phantom's Revenge to a,

1082
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:05,760
it's like a digital magazine or something.

1083
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,760
My guy I know named Max, who lives around here.

1084
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,760
We were talking and he told me that he knows a guy named Pizza Pranks.

1085
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,760
That's his ad.

1086
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,760
He does this thing called IndiePocalypse where he will,

1087
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,760
I guess monthly, he publishes it on Itch.

1088
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,760
And it's as a game jam.

1089
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:40,760
But the jam is sort of a magazine style showcase of games.

1090
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,760
So he was like, maybe you should submit to that.

1091
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,760
And I was like, yeah, sure, why not?

1092
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,760
So I did.

1093
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,760
And I guess, I guess I was looking at first I was going to be upset.

1094
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,760
Cause like, oh no, he didn't pick me.

1095
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,760
Oh no, he didn't pick me.

1096
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,760
But it looks like, it looks like submissions for this one are open until for another like few days.

1097
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,760
So maybe it just hasn't been long enough.

1098
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,760
I don't know.

1099
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,760
That'd be cool.

1100
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,760
Apparently he'd pay me like $20 if he features my game.

1101
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,760
But like, I don't need him to pay me $20.

1102
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,760
He can just feature it.

1103
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,760
It's fine.

1104
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,760
More power to him.

1105
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,760
I submitted it to another.

1106
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:23,760
I was looking at that and I was like, oh, submit, you can just submit your game to jams.

1107
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,760
As in like, there are jams around and they're just open submissions.

1108
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,760
And you can just like submit your game to them and click a little button.

1109
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,760
So I was looking around and I submitted it to some other jams like that.

1110
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,760
But I submitted one that I think I should not have.

1111
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,760
And I feel a little bad.

1112
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,760
I sort of read the tagline for this one jam.

1113
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,760
I don't even remember what it was called.

1114
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,760
Like no ponies allowed, no sun shoes, the game.

1115
01:18:52,760 --> 01:19:01,760
No, no, this one was, it was called, hold on, it was called score space.

1116
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:07,760
And like the description of the thing, it was about like people will compete,

1117
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,760
people will play these games and like try to get a high score.

1118
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,760
And I was like, yeah, I mean, there's a score in Phantom's Revenge.

1119
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,760
You can invest in the stock market.

1120
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,760
So I was like, yeah, I guess it qualifies.

1121
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,760
Why not?

1122
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:23,760
But then I think that like, that's the theme of like every score space.

1123
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,760
And this is score space jam number 18.

1124
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,760
And this one I read a little further has a specific theme of magnetism.

1125
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,760
And so that does not fit at all.

1126
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,760
And so I kind of fucked it up.

1127
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,760
And I think I ruined it.

1128
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,760
I've ruined everything.

1129
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:43,760
I've ruined my credibility as a developer and as a publisher on itch.io.

1130
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,760
And someone left a comment asking me, why does this have to do with a jam?

1131
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,760
And I don't have an answer for them.

1132
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,760
I don't know what I'm going to tell them.

1133
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,760
They're going to kill me.

1134
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:57,760
I'm just showing you my product, you motherfucker.

1135
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,760
I just wanted to show you my video game and I'm very sorry.

1136
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,760
Please forgive me.

1137
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,760
Please subscribe.

1138
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,760
You know what?

1139
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,760
You know what?

1140
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,760
I'm going to remove the submission.

1141
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,760
He's right.

1142
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,760
Okay.

1143
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,760
No harm, no foul.

1144
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,760
Anyway, anyway, maybe I should submit to more jams.

1145
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,760
But of course, make a little more sure that the...

1146
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,760
Yeah, that's an idea.

1147
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,760
I should probably submit pumpkin alley to some things.

1148
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:34,760
I don't know if like it's like bad form.

1149
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:40,760
Are you only supposed to submit to jams when you have just made the game?

1150
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,760
Is that only cool if you just made it?

1151
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:51,760
I mean, what I understand is that the jam is a prompt and everyone participates in making a game for the jam.

1152
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:57,760
It's not just post things that you have that are similar to the brief.

1153
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:04,760
Okay, I know that, yeah, a game jam is generally a thing that everyone who's participating,

1154
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,760
they hear the prompt and then they make the game for the jam.

1155
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:14,760
But it seems like on itch, a jam does not have to be that.

1156
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:19,760
Like this indie apocalypse guy, he doesn't have a prompt.

1157
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:26,760
He's just like, I publish a monthly thing as a jam and anyone can submit their stuff.

1158
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,760
So that's not a traditional jam.

1159
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,760
So if there are other things like that out there that may or may not...

1160
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:40,760
Itch would call a jam, then I would put my fucking shit in there.

1161
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,760
Hey, feature my shit, idiot.

1162
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,760
But I don't want to like...

1163
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:54,760
I don't want to flout the guidelines of any of these things.

1164
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:58,760
I want to play by the rules.

1165
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,760
If you play by the rules, you'll never make it anywhere in this industry.

1166
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,760
In the indie dev space, I want to establish my cred.

1167
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,760
You got to establish dominance, buddy.

1168
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:10,760
That's right.

1169
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:16,760
I'm going to step into a jam and say, these are the rules now.

1170
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,760
I have altered the jam.

1171
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,760
Pray that I do not alter it further.

1172
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,760
That's true, though.

1173
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,760
Yeah.

1174
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
So anyway, I did that.

1175
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,760
I don't know.

1176
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,760
I'm sure this...

1177
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,760
I don't know what sort of readership this guy has.

1178
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,760
It can't be enormous.

1179
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,760
It's not going to be my big break, but maybe a few people might play my game.

1180
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:48,760
People that like indie games are now kind of neat.

1181
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,760
Oh yeah, baby.

1182
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,760
You know what pisses me off?

1183
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,760
You know what grinds my gears?

1184
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,760
No, I don't, but let me know.

1185
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:07,760
Is this like this idea that art should be abandoned once it's finished

1186
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,760
in order to move on and make newer stuff and better stuff and just make a lot of it

1187
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,760
and you've got to learn to let go?

1188
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:24,760
Then you can't because you also should continually try to promote the things you do have, like the game.

1189
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,760
You can't actually let go.

1190
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,760
It's misleading what they're trying to get at.

1191
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,760
I know what they're getting at in order to...

1192
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:44,760
You've got to finish something and you've got to make sure you can do that without humming and owing,

1193
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,760
waiting for it to be perfect when it won't be.

1194
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:56,760
I get it, but it just kind of annoys me that I want to actually forget about it once it's finished,

1195
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:02,760
but I can't because you have other things after the game is literally finished, after the comic,

1196
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:07,760
after the X is finished, you actually have to do more things with it.

1197
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,760
You can't actually let go.

1198
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,760
I mean, that's where I'm at with Phantom's Revenge.

1199
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:24,760
It's done, but I have to make the book out of it and stuff, so I can't let it go.

1200
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,760
It's how I treat all of my drawings.

1201
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,760
I throw them away before I finish them.

1202
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,760
I don't post anything.

1203
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,760
Yeah, I don't know.

1204
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:46,760
It's two completely different skillsets, doing a project, finishing projects,

1205
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:56,760
and then getting your project scene is almost not even related to each other, which just sucks.

1206
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,760
Why do I got to do more than one thing?

1207
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,760
That's so unfair.

1208
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,760
Yeah.

1209
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,760
Yeah, I don't know.

1210
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,760
I wish I had a publisher or an agent or someone who would do it for me.

1211
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,760
Maybe I should get one.

1212
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,760
Do those exist?

1213
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,760
Do indie devs have agents that will get their shit scene?

1214
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,760
I don't think so.

1215
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:33,760
I think they mostly have to do that themselves until it becomes big enough that they can maybe hire someone.

1216
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,760
Call up and...

1217
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,760
I could hire someone.

1218
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,760
I think I have money.

1219
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,760
Right, but I think...

1220
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,760
You know, I don't know.

1221
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:53,760
I don't know how effective it will be if it's not already kind of popular just by people seeing it and sharing it.

1222
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,760
What is a marketer really going to do to make people do that more?

1223
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,760
I don't know.

1224
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,760
That's their job to figure it out.

1225
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,760
I guess so.

1226
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,760
Ideally.

1227
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,760
Yeah.

1228
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,760
That's probably a really flawed thought on my part, actually.

1229
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,760
Forget what I said.

1230
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,760
Don't forget what I said, but don't...

1231
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:23,760
What's getting it in front of people going to do unless it's already good?

1232
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:30,760
Yeah, because there's good stuff all over the place that does get seen and I'm very bad at marketing.

1233
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:38,760
If somebody marketed my stuff for me, I would not have to increase the quality and it would definitely get more attention.

1234
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:48,760
Somebody else might have some insight into how to do it or have some connections with some people that could do it more effectively.

1235
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,760
I guess I'm just sort of resisting.

1236
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:57,760
I resist that and I don't think I have a good reason for doing it.

1237
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:06,760
Although, I guess if you swing too far towards thinking that marketing will be the solution to your problems,

1238
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:15,760
you become that fucking idiot telling me that vidIQ will boost my son of two lecture to 3 million views.

1239
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:25,760
That guy just thinks there's a magic bullet or something that you just press a button and then the number goes out.

1240
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,760
Everyone wants that.

1241
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:34,760
I think that's knowing that it's not like that makes me think, well, there's no point in doing it at all.

1242
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,760
It probably is.

1243
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,760
I shouldn't discount.

1244
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,760
I shouldn't discount looking for someone to help market Pumpkin Alley.

1245
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,760
I'm not very good at it.

1246
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,760
It's hard to think about too many things at once.

1247
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,760
I've got a lot of things to think about right now.

1248
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:58,760
I did use to pay for Project Wonderful ads for the Vapors at one point.

1249
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,760
It did get some clicks.

1250
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,760
Did it boost my profile much?

1251
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,760
I don't know.

1252
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,760
But it did do that.

1253
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,760
I guess I would be willing to do it again.

1254
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,760
Project Wonderful is dead.

1255
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:23,760
Everybody says that ads are just not that useful anymore.

1256
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:30,760
Everyone says that click-through rate and clicks per mil or whatever, it's all shit.

1257
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,760
That's all stuff from the old internet.

1258
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,760
It's gone now.

1259
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,760
It doesn't work anymore.

1260
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:41,760
People don't click on ads, but they do click on things within a social media space.

1261
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,760
I guess social media is the ad place now.

1262
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,760
Promoted tweets or whatever.

1263
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,760
Not necessarily promoted tweets.

1264
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,760
Somebody you follow liked this thing, and so you see it.

1265
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,760
It's like, oh, that looks interesting.

1266
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,760
That's the new advertising.

1267
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,760
But I did just have a genius idea right there.

1268
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:13,760
What if I just paid some money to promote my Phantom's Revenge tweet?

1269
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:22,760
Just the one that I have pinned on my timeline.

1270
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:30,760
Honestly, how much do you think that costs?

1271
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,760
I guess it depends.

1272
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,760
I'll dump like 500 bucks into it.

1273
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,760
I don't give a fuck.

1274
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,760
Just see what happens.

1275
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,760
Probably nothing.

1276
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:45,760
Honestly, I think it won't be worth the money.

1277
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,760
But I guess I would know.

1278
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:55,760
I definitely need to learn how to take more risks.

1279
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,760
I don't do that enough, just in life in general.

1280
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:04,760
I would think, oh, but it's not probably going to do anything, so I won't do it.

1281
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:10,760
I might miss out on a potential good result.

1282
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:20,760
Without saying too much about it, as I'm trying to get this new secret projecty thing off the ground, make that happen,

1283
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,760
I keep thinking to myself, why didn't I do this sooner?

1284
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:25,760
What was I thinking?

1285
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,760
What was I waiting for?

1286
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,760
The answer is nothing.

1287
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,760
I'm just an idiot.

1288
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:41,760
I'm an idiot and I'm risk averse and I'm content to just coast and not take any risks, which is bad,

1289
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,760
and has led me to stagnate as I currently am doing.

1290
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:52,760
So, I don't know, maybe we can do something about that.

1291
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,760
God willing.

1292
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,760
Cool.

1293
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,760
What do you think?

1294
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,760
Is it too early for voicemails?

1295
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,760
Nah, it's not too early for voicemails.

1296
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,760
Well, let's go to some voicemails then.

1297
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,760
Oh, God, more than two pages?

1298
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:15,760
Yeah, they go back to the third page, but a lot of them are really short.

1299
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:21,760
Actually, a lot of these are like one second long that I'm seeing.

1300
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,760
Alright.

1301
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:30,760
It looks like the first new one is called, do you remember when Digi said they want to have kids to watch?

1302
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:39,760
I remember them saying she wanted to have kids at some point.

1303
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,760
I don't know what they mean by to watch, like to watch over, to look after.

1304
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:54,760
I think they're suggesting that Trixie said she wants to have kids to look at them,

1305
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,760
probably in a perverse sort of way.

1306
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,760
I don't remember if she said that.

1307
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,760
I do remember she said she wanted to have kids.

1308
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,760
I mean, Trixie said some cringe weirdo shit.

1309
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,760
She did say she likes to see little kids getting fucked.

1310
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,760
That's true.

1311
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,760
Yes, illustrations.

1312
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:25,760
And she did say, what was it that she wanted to have a little sister to bring out to a cabin in the woods

1313
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,760
to fuck her until she got tired of her and then murder her?

1314
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,760
What?

1315
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,760
I don't remember that.

1316
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:38,760
Okay, I think she did say that, but I think it was on an Isma.

1317
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,760
I don't think you were supposed to think that she was being serious.

1318
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,760
No, that doesn't sound serious.

1319
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,760
In sufferable social media?

1320
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,760
Yeah.

1321
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,760
I'm sure the wanting to fuck the little sister was true.

1322
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,760
The murdering her afterwards was probably an exaggeration.

1323
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,760
I don't know.

1324
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:05,760
I don't want to make accusations based on, do you remember that one thing?

1325
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,760
I don't know.

1326
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,760
Trixie's weird, but like...

1327
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,760
These are just the facts.

1328
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,760
Anyway, whatever.

1329
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,760
Thanks for the stupid voicemail.

1330
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,760
That wasn't a voicemail.

1331
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,760
Next one is a YouTube link.

1332
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,760
Oh, yeah.

1333
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,760
My favorite seat.

1334
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,760
Oh, yeah.

1335
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,760
My favorite seat.

1336
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,760
Uh-oh.

1337
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,760
Excuse me, do you mind?

1338
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,760
I don't know this meme.

1339
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,760
I guess it's pretty funny.

1340
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,760
It's kind of funny.

1341
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:44,760
I guess I enjoyed it, and it was only nine seconds, so...

1342
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,760
You know, alright.

1343
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,760
Thanks.

1344
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,760
Next one is, is Nate working on the OVA?

1345
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,760
Probably not, although he said he's going to.

1346
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,760
Well, what does that mean, really?

1347
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:08,760
Well, I mean, he did eventually finish the Brad Garling house.

1348
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:14,760
Although, I mean, Victor did leave that comment saying he basically did 99% of it.

1349
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:20,760
So I don't actually know how much Nate did, and I don't know why it took him like four months to do it.

1350
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:21,760
I mean, it's funny.

1351
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,760
Nate is not on the show anymore, but he sure is procrastinating.

1352
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:33,760
So I'm going to say, I have not talked to Nate about the OVA.

1353
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:40,760
Nate said after the thing was done, he would work on the OVA.

1354
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:44,760
I haven't talked to him since that came out, so I'm going to say probably no, but I will...

1355
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,760
You know what?

1356
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,760
I should just get on his case about it.

1357
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,760
That's what got the music video done, so that's probably what I'll have to do.

1358
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,760
Yeah.

1359
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,760
Anyway, that's the answer.

1360
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,760
Next one is a link...

1361
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,760
Like PNG.

1362
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,760
It's Robin...

1363
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,760
It's just a picture of Robin Williams.

1364
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,760
Wait, you know what?

1365
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,760
And he's wearing your logo at Gmail.

1366
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,760
Is that your logo pen?

1367
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:17,760
Oh, he is wearing like a black shirt with a white heart on it, I guess.

1368
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,760
So, you know...

1369
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,760
He's a big fan.

1370
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,760
He was.

1371
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,760
Rip.

1372
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,760
Okay, whatever.

1373
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,760
Next one is called League of Shadow Natefuckers 3-2-1-GO.

1374
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:39,760
I'd like to take time out of my busy schedule of blowing things up to speak out some accolades.

1375
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,760
I had made a dedication that the League of Natefuckers have presented in order to achieve their goal.

1376
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:54,760
I, too, know what it's like to grow up with no father figure and needing a pair of social relationships with someone to fulfill that void.

1377
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,760
So continue on your journey, comrades.

1378
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:04,760
We all need a big guy that lives and makes the best one.

1379
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,760
Okay, I guess he's Bane.

1380
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,760
I guess he was Bane.

1381
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:09,760
All right.

1382
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,760
All I could think of was like, is he just talking into a cup?

1383
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,760
Yeah.

1384
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,760
All right.

1385
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:21,760
Whatever.

1386
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,760
Next one's a Vokeroo.

1387
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:25,760
Okay, I'm listening.

1388
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,760
3-2-1-GO.

1389
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,760
Oh, I am Mario.

1390
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,760
It's Mario.

1391
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,760
I love where I am.

1392
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:42,760
BenSaint doesn't laugh when I tickle him in his ear.

1393
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:48,760
I hope now BenSaint will lend me his ear.

1394
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,760
Ben, why aren't you here?

1395
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,760
Why aren't you mingling in the pic songs?

1396
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:03,760
Why aren't you in the overworld listening to the Mario music pussy?

1397
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:07,760
I like how Mario is a cool and cutie kid.

1398
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:08,760
Mario.

1399
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,760
Mario.

1400
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,760
Mario.

1401
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,760
Mario.

1402
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,760
Mario.

1403
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,760
Mario.

1404
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,760
Mario.

1405
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,760
BenSaint, you're not a gamer.

1406
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,760
Wahoo!

1407
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:22,760
You're not a gamer.

1408
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,760
I am a gamer.

1409
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,760
Wahoo!

1410
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,760
Do not trust him.

1411
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,760
Do not let him in.

1412
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,760
He will read you.

1413
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,760
Do not read him.

1414
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,760
Do not what him?

1415
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,760
Read him?

1416
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,760
I don't know.

1417
01:37:51,760 --> 01:38:02,760
Well, that Mario was on voice chat in a Call of Duty match, but also was in Mario at the same time.

1418
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,760
I am a gamer, Mario.

1419
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,760
I'll show you by listening to this-

1420
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:07,760
I like that voice.

1421
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,760
That was pretty good.

1422
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,760
By listening to this next voicemail, it says,

1423
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,760
Happy birthday, Ben.

1424
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,760
Thanks, a little late, but that's okay.

1425
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,760
I appreciate it.

1426
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:20,760
Next one is a YouTube link.

1427
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,760
I'll put it in the YouTube.

1428
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:24,760
What is this?

1429
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,760
It's in Spanish?

1430
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,760
Okay, they're just trolling us with a 30-35 minute video.

1431
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,760
Okay, good one.

1432
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,760
Next one is, do straws have one hole or two?

1433
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:37,760
They have one hole.

1434
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:43,760
Yes, topologically, they have one hole, but in reality, they have two holes.

1435
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,760
Stupid.

1436
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,760
Because if you were to say, you know, colloquially-

1437
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,760
It's like saying a donut has two holes.

1438
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,760
There's a top hole and a bottom hole.

1439
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,760
It's ridiculous.

1440
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,760
Yeah, but they're so close together.

1441
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:00,760
A straw, you can turn it upside down and it would feel different.

1442
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:04,760
This is a bunch of, like, wishy-washy, like, magical thinking.

1443
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,760
Like, ooh, crystal energy.

1444
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,760
Like, ooh, there's two holes, there's two ends.

1445
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:09,760
It's colloquial use.

1446
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,760
It's the use of the word in the real world.

1447
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,760
I'm not-

1448
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,760
If you refer to a straw with having one hole,

1449
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,760
then they're like, do you mean, like, there was a, like, a pinprick in the side?

1450
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,760
You're not making me-

1451
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,760
Because I wouldn't think you're talking about the top and the bottom entrance and exit.

1452
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,760
You're not making me feel very colloquial right now.

1453
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,760
Well, maybe you should topologically get fucked.

1454
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:37,760
Yeah, well, I guess that's that.

1455
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,760
Next one is called, uh, it's a YouTube link.

1456
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,760
Oh, my God.

1457
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,760
No, it's okay.

1458
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,760
At some, at some point, I think, review tech-

1459
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,760
I don't know, whatever.

1460
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:52,760
At some point, I think I'm just gonna stop, stop looking at the YouTube links.

1461
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:56,760
I think here's a new policy.

1462
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:01,760
If you put a YouTube link and there's no description of the YouTube video in the text,

1463
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,760
then we're not gonna even click on it.

1464
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,760
I think I'm probably just not gonna click on it.

1465
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,760
Next one is text only.

1466
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,760
This econ dude is fucking annoying, Lamal.

1467
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,760
Yeah, econ is obnoxious.

1468
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,760
He's a contrarian dickhead and he sucks.

1469
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:18,760
True.

1470
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:25,760
I think I got mad at him because he sent me those obnoxious tweets about like,

1471
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,760
Ben, you've gone too far this time being mean to my baby sister.

1472
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,760
And I told him, shut the fuck up.

1473
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,760
And he messaged me on Discord being like, here was the chance.

1474
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,760
Here was the opportunity that maybe he had to maybe, to maybe like fix it.

1475
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,760
He messages me like, you know, that kind of hurt my feelings.

1476
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,760
And I'm like, okay, whatever.

1477
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:52,760
And he says, you know, I just don't understand this attitude you have of like,

1478
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,760
this bridge burning attitude.

1479
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:56,760
Like, why are you burning all these bridges?

1480
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,760
As if it's like my fault.

1481
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:01,760
As if it's my fault that he had to do that.

1482
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,760
That he pissed me off with these obnoxious tweets.

1483
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:05,760
It's his fault.

1484
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,760
He burned the bridge.

1485
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,760
He burned the bridge by being annoying, by making me hate him.

1486
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:11,760
He did it.

1487
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,760
I'm not apologizing.

1488
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,760
Like, that was it.

1489
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:15,760
I was like, I'm done.

1490
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,760
I'm done.

1491
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,760
This attitude is so annoying.

1492
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,760
I'm just like, please just leave me alone.

1493
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,760
So that's it.

1494
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,760
That's fucking it for that guy.

1495
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:28,760
I will destroy him.

1496
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:29,760
He asked to be on the show.

1497
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,760
He was like, boom, why don't you, hmm, if you really, if you really think,

1498
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:35,760
if you really feel so strongly about my little sister,

1499
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,760
then why don't you get me on the show to debate it?

1500
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,760
No, absolutely not.

1501
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,760
God.

1502
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,760
There's fucking a debate about it.

1503
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,760
It's just, it's not that sort of a thing.

1504
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:47,760
That's, like, that's what he wants.

1505
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,760
Like, he did all that and other people said,

1506
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,760
like, Ben, you're just doing this for attention.

1507
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:53,760
You're just doing this for attention.

1508
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,760
And he was on the board.

1509
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,760
It's like, you're just, you're just stirring up drama to get attention.

1510
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,760
And then only to turn around and be like,

1511
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,760
hmm, well, why don't you have me on your podcast to debate it with you?

1512
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:04,760
Very funny.

1513
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,760
Very, very cute.

1514
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,760
You see, the trick, the thing is, is you weren't doing it for attention.

1515
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,760
You were doing it because you're crazy.

1516
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,760
What's, what's the word?

1517
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,760
Acute, accuse the enemy.

1518
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,760
Acuse the enemy of that which you are guilty.

1519
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,760
That's what was going on with all that.

1520
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,760
Hey, Ben, you're cute.

1521
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,760
Yeah.

1522
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,760
Gotcha.

1523
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,760
Got me.

1524
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,760
Got myself.

1525
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:29,760
All right.

1526
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:30,760
Next one is an Imgirlink.

1527
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,760
Oh, look, it's, it's a, it's a Zoomy.

1528
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,760
It's Brunswick.

1529
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:35,760
Who's?

1530
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:36,760
There's you.

1531
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,760
Is that Clarissa?

1532
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:39,760
Oh, I think.

1533
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,760
Or is this some other?

1534
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,760
I think it's you.

1535
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:45,760
I think it's you, me and Tom.

1536
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,760
And then Brunswick and a Zoomy.

1537
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,760
And I get, maybe you are gun girl.

1538
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:55,760
So maybe this is you and gun girl or maybe also Clarissa in one entity.

1539
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,760
I mean, I assume it's Clarissa.

1540
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,760
She's just wearing a skirt and has two guns and still one.

1541
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,760
Not, not tall enough.

1542
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,760
Oh, this is a drawing.

1543
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:11,760
I think, I think this is meant to be you as Clarissa or maybe gun girl.

1544
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:12,760
Probably Clarissa.

1545
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:16,760
No, no, it's Clarissa because the hair for sure.

1546
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,760
Well, I like it.

1547
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,760
Yeah.

1548
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,760
Thank you.

1549
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,760
Thank you for the drawing.

1550
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:26,760
Next one is, hold on.

1551
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,760
YouTube, there's two YouTube links in a row with no text.

1552
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,760
Well, I guess.

1553
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,760
Yeah, fuck it.

1554
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,760
I don't care.

1555
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,760
Yeah, skip it.

1556
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,760
Next one is, what does Nate think of Picard?

1557
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,760
I don't know.

1558
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,760
He probably likes him.

1559
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,760
No, I mean, there's the new show, the Picard show.

1560
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:44,760
Oh.

1561
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:54,760
I would imagine Nate is similar view point to Mike and Rich on Red Letter Media, what

1562
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:55,760
they think of it.

1563
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,760
Yeah, I think Nate is a big Mike head.

1564
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:03,760
I would assume he probably agrees with Mike if he even has any opinion about Picard at

1565
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,760
all.

1566
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:12,760
Yeah, I feel like it's on the internet sphere, people who know about Picard mostly know about

1567
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,760
it from Red Letter Media.

1568
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:15,760
Yeah.

1569
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:24,760
Unless they're big Trek fans and the reviews are not glowing of that show, so I doubt he

1570
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:27,760
likes it, but I don't know.

1571
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:33,760
Next one is Star Trek, and then Picard, and then I Hear It's Really Bad, and then three

1572
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:38,760
YouTube links that I'm not going to click on, and then a Dropbox link.

1573
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:39,760
So let's try.

1574
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:40,760
P-R-G.

1575
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:43,760
Is that going to work?

1576
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:48,760
Oh, it does work?

1577
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,760
Oh, it's the image.

1578
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:50,760
It's the image.

1579
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:51,760
That's one.

1580
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,760
Yes.

1581
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,760
Okay, and it's actually at a resolution this time.

1582
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,760
Yes, thank you.

1583
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,760
Bazaar.

1584
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,760
All right.

1585
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,760
Such a big resolution.

1586
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,760
Yeah.

1587
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:01,760
Wait, let me...

1588
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,760
Ah, look at those breasts.

1589
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:06,760
I know, right?

1590
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:07,760
All right.

1591
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,760
So let's go through this.

1592
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:10,760
All right.

1593
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:11,760
All right.

1594
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,760
Next voicemail.

1595
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:16,760
Please listen all the way through from I'm Serious at Please Ben.

1596
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:17,760
Well, okay.

1597
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,760
Three, two, one, go.

1598
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,760
I think that's supposed to be you talking.

1599
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,760
Hey, cough.

1600
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:24,760
This is Cool Guy 12.

1601
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,760
Ben, please don't open the door.

1602
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:29,760
The same thing happens every single time you do it.

1603
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:35,760
So yeah, it might help you in the long run if you stop opening the door.

1604
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:36,760
Shut the fuck up.

1605
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,760
You psycho.

1606
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:38,760
Like literally who are you?

1607
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,760
Me being a podcaster doesn't give you license to interact with me.

1608
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,760
Die, die, die.

1609
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,760
Wait, what is this about?

1610
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:48,760
This is Cool Guy 12.

1611
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:49,760
Open the door.

1612
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,760
Was this like a thing that was said?

1613
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,760
I don't...

1614
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:57,760
No, I don't remember not opening the door.

1615
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,760
Uh, uh, uh, Ben.

1616
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,760
No, shut your fuck up with the door.

1617
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,760
What the door has.

1618
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,760
All these online deranged R words think I should listen to anything they have to say.

1619
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,760
Well, fuck that.

1620
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,760
I do what I want.

1621
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:13,760
Oh no.

1622
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,760
No, the pigs got in from the door.

1623
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,760
The pigs, they were behind the door, was full of pigs.

1624
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,760
I like, I like my hairline.

1625
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,760
I like my hairline in this one a lot.

1626
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,760
It's very, it's very accurate.

1627
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,760
It's, yeah.

1628
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,760
It's like what if you were a big titted lady.

1629
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:34,760
Yeah.

1630
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,760
And you opened the door and there were pigs.

1631
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:38,760
It's what would happen.

1632
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:42,760
I like your little stick figure in the...

1633
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:45,760
With the one like detailed hand.

1634
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:46,760
Oh God.

1635
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:47,760
Yeah.

1636
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,760
Yeah.

1637
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,760
That's a little weird.

1638
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:51,760
This is, uh, this is great.

1639
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,760
Let's, let's...

1640
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,760
Yeah.

1641
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,760
This is by, by new, by someone called new, I guess is the name of this artist.

1642
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,760
New.

1643
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:05,760
Uh, I give you license to draw us like this, uh, every single day.

1644
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,760
This is, this is a, this is joy, joyful.

1645
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:08,760
It brings it up.

1646
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,760
I love this.

1647
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:10,760
It brings it up.

1648
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,760
Save a head.

1649
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,760
Finally a good fucking voicemail.

1650
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,760
There's no voice involved.

1651
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,760
I don't want, we should just have art mail instead.

1652
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,760
Uh, skip to the, skip to the good shit.

1653
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,760
Uh, thank you.

1654
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,760
That's awesome.

1655
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,760
You're, you're very good.

1656
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,760
You're, you're a very skilled, uh, uh, draftsman.

1657
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Do you have a...

1658
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,760
Or draftswoman.

1659
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,760
Or draftswoman.

1660
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:41,760
Do you have, if you have like a, like a internet presence where you post art, uh, shout it

1661
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,760
out cause I want to see.

1662
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,760
Yeah.

1663
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,760
You have good style.

1664
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:46,760
True.

1665
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,760
Uh, next one is happy birthday Ben.

1666
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:50,760
Thanks.

1667
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:58,760
Oh god, my fucking, uh, I hear my goddamn superintendent screaming out his fucking balcony again.

1668
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,760
He does this all the time.

1669
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:02,760
Hopefully the mic's not picking it up.

1670
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,760
Lamal.

1671
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,760
I think I can hear a little bit of it.

1672
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,760
No way.

1673
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,760
I heard like something.

1674
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,760
That's awesome.

1675
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,760
Uh, next one is...

1676
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,760
Oh, let's just keep going.

1677
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,760
Next one is...

1678
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,760
What was he saying?

1679
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,760
Like, see more?

1680
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,760
What was he saying?

1681
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:19,760
I can't hear.

1682
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,760
He's always just like...

1683
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,760
Sometimes it's one of the neighbors.

1684
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,760
Like the neighbors like play their music loud.

1685
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,760
Sometimes he yells at them.

1686
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,760
One time he yelled at someone that like stopped in the middle of the street on a one-way street

1687
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,760
and was blocking traffic.

1688
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,760
Another time like some, just some guy came by and like someone was putting up a sign

1689
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:43,760
and he yelled at him like don't put up a sign on the, on the whatever.

1690
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,760
And he's like, but I have, but I have permission from the city council.

1691
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,760
Ah, fuck you.

1692
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:49,760
You have the fuck out of here.

1693
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,760
All right.

1694
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:51,760
What the fuck you doing?

1695
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,760
You gotta have the fuck out of here.

1696
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:53,760
Fuck you.

1697
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,760
Fuck you.

1698
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:55,760
Fuck the bullshit.

1699
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:56,760
Um, I don't know.

1700
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:57,760
It's always something.

1701
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:58,760
It's always something.

1702
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:02,760
Um, anyway, next one is called a question to the guests.

1703
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:03,760
Lamal.

1704
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,760
Three, two, one, go.

1705
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:10,760
Why did you agree to appear in this podcast?

1706
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:11,760
They didn't.

1707
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,760
Nobody did this week.

1708
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:16,760
That would have been a pretty good question if we had a guest.

1709
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:19,760
So I, I, I feel like that was a bit of a waste.

1710
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,760
That's too bad.

1711
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,760
Good, good.

1712
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:23,760
We'll ask it next time.

1713
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,760
Yeah.

1714
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:27,760
We'll, we'll, we'll confront them when they're on and they're, we're having a nice chat and

1715
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,760
it's all going well.

1716
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,760
And we'll say, uh, why the fuck are you here?

1717
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:32,760
Actually, what are you saying?

1718
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,760
And they'll say, I'm sorry.

1719
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:37,760
And we'll say it's too late.

1720
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,760
Craig is recording.

1721
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:40,760
You can't escape.

1722
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,760
You're fucking dead.

1723
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:43,760
Fucking dead.

1724
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,760
We, we have, we have, we have unleashed the hogs.

1725
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:51,760
They are at your door now, you know, open your front door and let the pigs in.

1726
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,760
Uh, next one is called, this is Ethan Ralph and this is how I talk.

1727
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,760
Three, two, one, go.

1728
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,760
Trixie, the dumb ass bitch.

1729
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:08,760
I don't care about your, your dumb ass anime podcast, your, your procrastinators.

1730
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,760
You will not indoctrinate my son.

1731
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:16,760
I, I see that you, you've had him been sending you messages.

1732
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:19,760
I don't care what they're about.

1733
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:24,760
My son will be brought up and learned it, indoctrinate, learn and, and taught.

1734
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,760
You know what this sounds like.

1735
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,760
He's, he's my son.

1736
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:29,760
This sounds like liquid.

1737
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:30,760
I'm poking at you.

1738
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:33,760
This sounds like liquid Chris's Chris Chan impersonation.

1739
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,760
Yeah.

1740
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,760
I don't know why you talk like that.

1741
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,760
And he doesn't, don't sound very American.

1742
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:42,760
I'll have, I'll have my way with, with Europe bringing it.

1743
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:47,760
I was attracted by my boy looking at me.

1744
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,760
My boy, Ethan Ralph Jr. twin to my daughter.

1745
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:57,760
I was hoping to keep his identity under wraps and make him a literal,

1746
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:02,760
but it looks like your preferred little anime podcast has done,

1747
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,760
gone on ruined him though.

1748
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:06,760
Sorry about that.

1749
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,760
Taking my phone away.

1750
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,760
He ain't going to touch it no more.

1751
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,760
I don't know how he even got hold of him in the first place.

1752
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:14,760
Yeah.

1753
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:18,760
Your cute little ninja stick isn't going to freak me out, kid.

1754
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:21,760
I'm going to put him padlock his crib now.

1755
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,760
God damn.

1756
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,760
I don't know if it's too hard on you.

1757
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,760
I just want to poke it up.

1758
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:27,760
I like it.

1759
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,760
I like it.

1760
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:30,760
Jesus.

1761
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:33,760
Was that, was that May at the end or was that a child?

1762
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:35,760
I thought that, I thought that was the baby.

1763
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,760
I thought, yeah, maybe it was the baby.

1764
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,760
Well, there's another one that's also called, this is Ethan Ralph and this is how I talk.

1765
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,760
So let's do it.

1766
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,760
Three, two, one, go.

1767
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:46,760
Okay.

1768
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,760
Okay.

1769
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,760
So my wife, May.

1770
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,760
I was.

1771
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,760
I was.

1772
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,760
Hold me.

1773
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:53,760
I knew it.

1774
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,760
It's Trixie's anime podcast no more.

1775
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:59,760
It's Trixie's ex-boyfriend Ben St.'s podcast.

1776
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:04,760
I don't care what Tommy asked Ben St.

1777
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,760
What's Ben St. even do?

1778
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:09,760
What's comic?

1779
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,760
Make comic.

1780
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,760
Making a book.

1781
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,760
Ben St. keep your comic ass.

1782
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,760
Ethan, please promote.

1783
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:18,760
I don't care.

1784
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:21,760
Keep your hands, your podcast away from my kid.

1785
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,760
Damn it.

1786
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:26,760
Ethan, please promote the slime and punishment kickstarter on the kill stream.

1787
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:27,760
Thank you.

1788
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:29,760
I love you.

1789
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:34,760
Next one is called, my revenge might take longer than expected, but it will be hat.

1790
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:37,760
Three, two, one, go.

1791
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:40,760
Ben St.

1792
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:43,760
Ben St.

1793
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:48,760
I am hiding from my father.

1794
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:54,760
He finally went to sleep and he sets his phone down.

1795
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:59,760
He couldn't lock a crib if his life depended on it.

1796
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,760
I will still come for you and kill you.

1797
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,760
No, please.

1798
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,760
Until next time.

1799
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,760
Roseanne.

1800
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:11,760
Was that some other person?

1801
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,760
I feel like that was different from the last baby voice.

1802
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,760
Yeah, I think it was just someone else.

1803
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:23,760
I think it was just serendipitous timing.

1804
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,760
Maybe they were just whispering.

1805
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,760
Ethan locked the crib, but then later in the evening, the child escaped.

1806
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:37,760
With their little ninja stick, as Ethan put it.

1807
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,760
Using it as a pole vault.

1808
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,760
Next one is an imager link.

1809
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,760
What do we got?

1810
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,760
Oh my god, it's robot twilight sparkle.

1811
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:47,760
Oh, okay.

1812
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,760
It says context in voicemail.

1813
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,760
Next voicemail.

1814
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,760
In next voicemail?

1815
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,760
Yeah.

1816
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,760
Oh, okay.

1817
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,760
It's a vocaru, so let's do it.

1818
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:01,760
All right.

1819
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:05,760
Three, two, one, go.

1820
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:15,760
Project second twilight experiment number six.

1821
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:21,760
80%, 90%, 100%, charging complete.

1822
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:26,760
Testing basic chasis functions.

1823
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:34,760
Chasis seems to be functioning perfectly, starting the upload sequence.

1824
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:52,760
Upload complete.

1825
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:55,760
Speak twilight sparkle.

1826
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:02,760
Voicemail is being recorded.

1827
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,760
Hello, PCP.

1828
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:14,760
What's the difference?

1829
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,760
The cerebral cortex was fried.

1830
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:24,760
It seems current processors simply don't have enough capacity to handle the script.

1831
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:27,760
Fucking old man.

1832
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,760
He just had to get in my way.

1833
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,760
Project second twilight has failed.

1834
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:37,760
I will consult the great lab.

1835
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,760
Do you know what's going on?

1836
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:42,760
I don't know who's talking.

1837
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:51,760
There's a shadow in this image of somebody who I suppose set up second twilight, which was a failure for some reason.

1838
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,760
And they sliced their head off.

1839
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:59,760
Oh, the sh.

1840
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,760
I really like all of the effort that's going into this.

1841
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:12,760
It's like an avant-garde radio play, radio show, and we're getting snippets of it in voicemails on a procrastinators podcast.

1842
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,760
Oh, she's got a little light bulb for a horn.

1843
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,760
That's cute.

1844
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,760
Little tiny light bulb.

1845
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,760
I'm trying to look at this.

1846
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,760
Yeah, look at her horn.

1847
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:25,760
I think it's a little filament bulb.

1848
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,760
I'm looking at the shadow, trying to...

1849
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:36,760
I mean, it's got a body, it's got an arm, so it's a humanoid figure.

1850
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,760
It looks like it's got butterfly wings.

1851
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:42,760
Yeah, I think that's a butterfly wing.

1852
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:50,760
And then is it like an animal head with big, tall Anubis ears?

1853
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:01,760
No, I thought that thing was like the other set of wings, like sideways.

1854
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,760
It would mostly be like a straight line.

1855
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:06,760
Maybe.

1856
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,760
Well, there's more voicemails.

1857
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:13,760
So, let's do it.

1858
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:18,760
We got the, okay, the next one.

1859
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:22,760
Sorry, I gotta fucking post the vocabulary.

1860
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:25,760
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1861
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:32,760
Make sure you are undetected.

1862
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,760
Old man possesses ancient art of crabomancy.

1863
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,760
If crabs attack you under his direct control, you are dead.

1864
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:44,760
Wonder how did I found this place?

1865
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:46,760
Well, it's a long story.

1866
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:52,760
It involved watching a lot of teak-toaks from local area, analyzing their audio in some triangulation.

1867
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:54,760
Hey, don't sleep on me.

1868
01:57:54,760 --> 01:58:14,760
I see, you got the visual on the crabs. Good job, agent Squill. Is the escape route secure?

1869
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,760
It's an agent pig.

1870
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:18,760
Good.

1871
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:20,760
Commence operation, crab eater.

1872
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:25,760
Metal machine's blood injection started. Go to town on them, Squill.

1873
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:42,760
I can't tell if this is related to the previous voicemail.

1874
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,760
Wow.

1875
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:02,760
This is great. I don't really understand.

1876
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:05,760
Yeah, but I'm enjoying it anyway.

1877
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:14,760
It's like an epic, alright, this pig is going on a secret mission in getting a Metal Gear Solid call

1878
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:17,760
to do something about eating a crab.

1879
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:25,760
And the old man was the one who said Twilight will no longer be doing voicemails.

1880
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,760
Maybe that's the old man there, the shadow of him.

1881
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,760
I thought I was the old man.

1882
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:40,760
No, no, no. Remember the robotic old man AI voice. It's like, I'm Twilight's grandfather.

1883
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,760
Oh, right.

1884
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:49,760
It's like Twilight, you're grounded, you're not allowed to do voicemails on the progress news podcast anymore.

1885
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,760
They suck or something like that.

1886
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:55,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I forgot about that, but yeah, that's probably really important.

1887
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,760
And she was crying.

1888
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,760
She cried about it.

1889
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:04,760
Maybe she's like, this is the Rukia save Rukia art.

1890
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:09,760
The Twilight is in bleach, you know, when everyone goes to save Rukia from execution?

1891
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,760
No, I don't know about that.

1892
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,760
You do not know bleach?

1893
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,760
No, not at all, not even a little bit.

1894
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,760
I thought you at least had heard a bit about it.

1895
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:22,760
No, not really. I know it's about being a Shinigami or whatever.

1896
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:27,760
Yeah, well, there's an arc where Rukia, one of the main characters is killed.

1897
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,760
Was it the girl with the black hair?

1898
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:33,760
The girl with the black hair in front of her face, the strand.

1899
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:38,760
And she's like, you broke the rules by giving a human the powers of a Shinigami.

1900
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,760
Now you must die.

1901
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:43,760
And then Ichigo and everyone was like, that's our friend.

1902
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,760
Let's invade soul society and take her back.

1903
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,760
And it's like the coolest arc ever.

1904
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:50,760
I see.

1905
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,760
Yeah, that's probably, that's probably what's going on.

1906
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,760
That's why I was thinking it's like Twilight is like locked up and by the old man.

1907
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:03,760
And now there's like a pig going around like doing a mission to try and help her.

1908
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,760
I have no idea.

1909
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that makes sense.

1910
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,760
That's more or less what I'm getting out of it, yeah.

1911
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:14,760
Okay, okay.

1912
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:16,760
There's another one.

1913
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:20,760
This one's two minutes long and it better be worth it.

1914
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,760
Are you ready?

1915
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:23,760
Yep.

1916
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:24,760
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1917
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:28,760
The war on the old man arc final episode, Twilight's Revenge.

1918
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,760
The time has come.

1919
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,760
Yeah.

1920
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:38,760
Oh, is that a miracle build?

1921
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:39,760
Yes.

1922
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:40,760
And I will meet you with it.

1923
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,760
Foolish girl.

1924
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,760
Miracles suck in dark souls.

1925
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,760
Why'd you make her build one, man?

1926
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,760
It looks like it's time to teach you a lesson.

1927
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,760
Good dodging, granddaughter.

1928
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,760
But where are your miracles?

1929
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,760
I don't need them to beat you.

1930
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:06,760
Investing stats and not using them.

1931
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:08,760
Foolishness.

1932
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,760
We're just hearing a dark souls battle.

1933
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:15,760
Look at how squishy you are with all the points in faith and achievement.

1934
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,760
Wait, it's not over yet?

1935
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:19,760
Is the grandfather Ian Dark Souls?

1936
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,760
Okay, enough talking.

1937
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:23,760
Ultimate attack.

1938
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:25,760
The ravenous crabs.

1939
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,760
No way.

1940
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,760
She is rolling through the wall.

1941
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,760
Take that?

1942
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,760
Oh my god.

1943
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:39,760
Look at you.

1944
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:40,760
One shot.

1945
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:44,760
This is what you get for not leveling vigor.

1946
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:47,760
Wait.

1947
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:50,760
Why do I hear boss music?

1948
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,760
Rather the gods.

1949
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:04,760
But how did you survive?

1950
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:06,760
Tears of denial.

1951
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:08,760
Leave you with one HP after final attack.

1952
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:11,760
You can say it was a miracle.

1953
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,760
Who's the mysterious imposter?

1954
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,760
Will Twilight Sparkle finally get the voice grill?

1955
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:19,760
Or is there a greeter danger looming at the horizon?

1956
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:25,760
Next week, everything will be revealed in the grand final of the Twilight Sparkle show.

1957
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,760
Oh yeah.

1958
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:30,760
That was based.

1959
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:31,760
That was based.

1960
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:37,760
Now I'm even less sure if those other voicemails had anything to do with this actually.

1961
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:40,760
Maybe the crab thing failed.

1962
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:41,760
No, no, he mentioned crabs.

1963
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:43,760
So yeah, they did.

1964
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:47,760
No, I mean like the crabs were supposed to be eaten by the pig.

1965
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:50,760
But the pig, there was a big fight and I don't even know what happened to him.

1966
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:53,760
Maybe the pig died and he didn't get to eat all the crabs.

1967
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:55,760
Oh no, she's rolling through.

1968
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:57,760
She's rolling through all the crabs.

1969
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,760
How could this be?

1970
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,760
This is great sound design.

1971
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:04,760
Yeah.

1972
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:10,760
I can't wait for the big final as the auto voice put it.

1973
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:12,760
Like very excited.

1974
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:16,760
Next voicemail is Ben's weekly reminder play Delta Rune chapter two.

1975
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:20,760
Okay, I will.

1976
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:24,760
Next one is, or is it a Twitter link?

1977
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:26,760
There's also a voice.

1978
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,760
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1979
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:29,760
The link.

1980
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:32,760
The Twitter link is to Ann Dunne.

1981
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,760
Damn, she looks nice in it.

1982
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:37,760
Well, it's probably related to what the voicemail was.

1983
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:43,760
This is her draw her OC in the Pizza Hut apron.

1984
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,760
Lamal.

1985
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,760
Okay, let's listen to the voicemail.

1986
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:48,760
Three, two, one, go.

1987
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:50,760
Drinking moth here again.

1988
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,760
I don't put pronounce in the bio.

1989
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:57,760
So I see how one can assume that I go by heat from my toxic shitposting for channel habits.

1990
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,760
But I go by they.

1991
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,760
I must punish you for misgendering.

1992
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:02,760
Okay.

1993
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,760
Both ways then.

1994
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:05,760
Cannibalism.

1995
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,760
Speaking of price lists, maybe I should cut my own down.

1996
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,760
I have no idea if it's the reach issue or cost issue.

1997
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:17,760
I can easily go for extremely low price and blow up the entire art market.

1998
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,760
That would be kind of shitty on me.

1999
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:23,760
Maybe I should just post some boobies I've been drawing IDK.

2000
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:26,760
Ah, and since I am here, let me show my little baby.

2001
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,760
Oh, okay.

2002
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:29,760
I see.

2003
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,760
Art is bad.

2004
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,760
You should stop making it.

2005
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,760
Everyone should right now.

2006
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,760
It's a mistake.

2007
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:39,760
No, post the boobies.

2008
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,760
It will never make you any money.

2009
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,760
It will never serve the whims of capital.

2010
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:48,760
It will be obliterated just like David Firth.

2011
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:52,760
You see that thing David Firth posted?

2012
02:05:52,760 --> 02:06:00,760
Oh, he got his Wikipedia article deleted because it hadn't been updated in a while, which is stupid.

2013
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:03,760
It goes against the idea of archiving information.

2014
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:05,760
Yeah.

2015
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:10,760
Does that normally happen?

2016
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,760
Is that usual?

2017
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:15,760
If an article doesn't get updated enough, it gets destroyed?

2018
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,760
No, I don't think it was updated.

2019
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:19,760
It was notability.

2020
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,760
I haven't been looking at it.

2021
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,760
It wasn't notable.

2022
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:32,760
But I don't know whether everything stops being notable with time, surely.

2023
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,760
Totally insane.

2024
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:38,760
What's the point of an encyclopedia?

2025
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:42,760
No one's looked that up in a while, deleted.

2026
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:46,760
It's an archive of so much stuff.

2027
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:50,760
It's so stupid that that could ever happen.

2028
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:55,760
I understand they have servers that they're filled with stuff and they need to pay for them, but that's not the answer.

2029
02:06:55,760 --> 02:07:02,760
Mere weeks ago, I was watching Smiling Friends and I went,

2030
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:06,760
Oh, it's David Firth's voice. He's the shrimp.

2031
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:10,760
So he's notable to me.

2032
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:16,760
Man, if David Firth isn't notable, then like, fuck, what hope do the rest of us have?

2033
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:22,760
It's just like, I don't know, nobody has looked up his Wikipedia in a while, I guess.

2034
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,760
Yeah, I guess by whatever metric Wikipedia uses to decide these things.

2035
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:33,760
I just feel like that sets a precedent that would ruin Wikipedia in general,

2036
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:41,760
when people feel like they can't put things on Wikipedia for fear of lack of interest being removed.

2037
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,760
Nobody would make articles.

2038
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:52,760
Yeah, if like, oh, I need to be certain that people will still be actively looking at this like 10 years from now.

2039
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:55,760
And otherwise, I just won't even write it.

2040
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:00,760
They'd put it on like other sites. I guess Wikipedia is not technically Wikipedia, right?

2041
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:02,760
It's like a different site.

2042
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:03,760
Yeah.

2043
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:07,760
People update those and keep those updated. They're mostly for like fan things.

2044
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:08,760
Yeah.

2045
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:15,760
So it's a little different, but I mean, people like having that information available,

2046
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:19,760
and I think it should be for everyone always.

2047
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,760
I agree. It's fucked up. It's just really fucked up.

2048
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:35,760
But, yeah, he said like, he basically made the argument that like what you're doing is saying that like,

2049
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:38,760
you know, like corporate backed artists.

2050
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:44,760
Like, I don't know, his tweets made, said something about like, you know,

2051
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:49,760
like the list of like companies you worked for is like where your notability comes from.

2052
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:53,760
And like the fact that he's been indie his whole career means that he doesn't,

2053
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:58,760
he doesn't get like articles written about him by like corporations or something,

2054
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:04,760
or he doesn't get, yeah, he doesn't get like corporate push.

2055
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:09,760
And that's, and like, that's what is the difference between him and someone who is quote unquote notable.

2056
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:15,760
So it's like a capitalism money thing, which he may be.

2057
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:23,760
It makes me feel sick to my stomach.

2058
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:27,760
Anyway, what are we talking about?

2059
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,760
Drinking moth.

2060
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:34,760
Nice, nice Cyclops. Nice Cyclops dog.

2061
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:38,760
Nice pizza dress. It is a nice dress.

2062
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:44,760
Next one is called artists are cool and I'm jealous. Three, two, one, go.

2063
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:48,760
God, artists are so fucking cool.

2064
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:49,760
Wrong.

2065
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:53,760
Imagine being able to just like create art.

2066
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,760
It sucks.

2067
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,760
Fucking mind blowing.

2068
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:00,760
You can like do anything if you could do that.

2069
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:05,760
No, take this power, take this power away from me.

2070
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:11,760
I think that if somebody finds the idea of creating to be cool, it's only a matter of time

2071
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:17,760
before they, they spend some time learning a skill and then become an artist themselves.

2072
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:22,760
So I would encourage this person to try something out.

2073
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:25,760
Sure. Yeah.

2074
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:33,760
All I'm saying though is like, it is cool being able to make like whatever you want visually

2075
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:40,760
or whatever medium I like being able to draw because if I want to, I can draw a character.

2076
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:42,760
And then there they are in front of me.

2077
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,760
No, I disagree.

2078
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,760
I think it's based.

2079
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:48,760
I used to be like this idiot.

2080
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:55,760
I used to think, wow, if I could draw stuff, I could make, I could, I could create image.

2081
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:58,760
I could create any image my little heart desired.

2082
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,760
I could, I could, and my dreams could become reality.

2083
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:07,760
I could make such works of such breathtaking beauty that everyone would be, would be stunned.

2084
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:15,760
And then I, I learned to draw and now I can draw and now I'm, I realize like, yeah, I guess I can just make anything.

2085
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:20,760
I can draw whatever I want and none of it matters or means anything at all.

2086
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:23,760
And actually all that other art that I saw that was cool.

2087
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:25,760
That was also just some nonsense.

2088
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:27,760
Just like anything I might create myself.

2089
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,760
It's all crap.

2090
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,760
You're just, you're just bitter and destroyed, Ben.

2091
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:35,760
Oh, Ben, you're just bitter and destroyed.

2092
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,760
That's why you say all that.

2093
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:38,760
Yeah.

2094
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:44,760
Yeah, and look what I made just a few hours ago.

2095
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:49,760
I made a Tusk manager and Rayman sex image.

2096
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:51,760
Look at them go.

2097
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,760
They both don't have certain limb parts.

2098
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:59,760
This is a, am I, am I, I don't know what point you think you're making here.

2099
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:03,760
I'm making the point that I could envision this and I made it.

2100
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:09,760
And it doesn't have to be super beautiful, but I could do it and it does exist now and it's funny.

2101
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,760
You don't like, like Rayman doesn't have arms.

2102
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:16,760
Task manager from Delta root doesn't have arms.

2103
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:23,760
Let me ask you a question and I'm being totally serious and I'm not trying to be flipping.

2104
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:32,760
You don't, you don't like think of something like this and then think, oh, I could draw it and then you draw it and then here it is.

2105
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:37,760
And you, you don't look at it and go, well, okay, I guess.

2106
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,760
You don't just be like, well, I guess I drew it and now what?

2107
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:42,760
Nothing.

2108
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:43,760
Okay.

2109
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,760
No, I don't think that.

2110
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:50,760
Sometimes I do when I'm like, I didn't manage to actually make what I thought I could make in my day.

2111
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:53,760
It's not, it's not even about whether the drawing comes out good or not.

2112
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:59,760
Like even if the drawing comes out good, it's like, well, there, there it is.

2113
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:01,760
Anyway, anyway, moving on.

2114
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:05,760
I'm still like, I like it still.

2115
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,760
Well, good for you, I guess.

2116
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,760
You're just better and destroyed Ben.

2117
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,760
You've got to, you've got to, you've got to revitalize.

2118
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:13,760
You got it.

2119
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,760
It's like Wally.

2120
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:15,760
You got that little seed.

2121
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:18,760
The entire world has turned into cubes.

2122
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,760
You got to plant that seed.

2123
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,760
I forget exactly how it goes.

2124
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:24,760
I don't, I don't understand.

2125
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:26,760
Do you remember Wally where he's a little robot?

2126
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:29,760
Yeah, I remember he had the little seed.

2127
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:33,760
And he had to protect it to regrow the earth.

2128
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:37,760
Yeah?

2129
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,760
Your life is a wasteland of cubes, Ben.

2130
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:42,760
You've got to get that seed.

2131
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:45,760
I have, I gotta get that seed, Ben.

2132
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,760
You've got to seek the seed.

2133
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:48,760
I have a seed.

2134
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:51,760
The seed is slime and punishment, the book.

2135
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:53,760
That's my seed.

2136
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,760
You've got to nurture that.

2137
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,760
Huh?

2138
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:57,760
You've got to nurture it.

2139
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:58,760
I'm trying.

2140
02:13:58,760 --> 02:13:59,760
I am, I am.

2141
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:03,760
I mean, that, that is my, that is my little seed right now.

2142
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:06,760
And it'll be nice if it is successful.

2143
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:13,760
I really like that as a, as a, as a like comeback is like your life is a wasteland of cubes.

2144
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:17,760
You're just bitter and destroyed and your life is a wasteland of cubes.

2145
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:20,760
Like, well, what of it?

2146
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:21,760
What of it?

2147
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:23,760
What of it?

2148
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:24,760
What?

2149
02:14:24,760 --> 02:14:28,760
Next, next voicemail is, um, uh, fuck.

2150
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:29,760
You should blink.

2151
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:30,760
So, no.

2152
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:31,760
Oh, yeah, skipping.

2153
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:33,760
Next one is called pussiest.

2154
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:36,760
Three, two, one, go.

2155
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:42,760
Oh, please, Mr. Saint Man, don't engage in social misconduct on the internet.

2156
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:45,760
You'll hurt someone's feelings.

2157
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:49,760
Ideally, my real, my real sister might cry.

2158
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,760
She might cry on stream and then I'll have to pay her money to make her feel better.

2159
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,760
But please, I can't afford it.

2160
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:56,760
Please, Ben.

2161
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:59,760
You're putting me under such financial strain.

2162
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:03,760
Uh, I agree with this voicemail.

2163
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:08,760
Uh, next, next one is called, uh, will China invade Taiwan?

2164
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,760
Uh, yup.

2165
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:11,760
Yeah.

2166
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:15,760
I don't know when, but as soon as they can.

2167
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,760
Is that, oh, is that a real answer?

2168
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,760
I think so.

2169
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:21,760
I mean, they won it.

2170
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,760
It's just, they're gonna grab it.

2171
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:26,760
They took Hong Kong violently.

2172
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:28,760
Wait, like recently?

2173
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:32,760
Don't you remember the Hong Kong riots?

2174
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:38,760
Well, uh, that wasn't about, that wasn't about China, like, taking it by military force.

2175
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:39,760
No, no, no.

2176
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:40,760
It's not the same.

2177
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:46,760
But like, China has had its eyes on Taiwan and wants to, like, bring it back into the fold

2178
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:49,760
in a very similar way to Russia and Ukraine.

2179
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:54,760
I was gonna say, are they gonna do, that's, I actually had not really heard anything about this, but um.

2180
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:56,760
They've wanted it for a long time.

2181
02:15:56,760 --> 02:16:10,760
And I think as, unless, the only thing that would stop them at the moment is Russia completely being destroyed by, uh, the world not being friends with them because of the Ukraine thing.

2182
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:15,760
And China might be like, okay, well, we've got to be careful about taking Taiwan.

2183
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,760
Uh, gonna look bad.

2184
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:21,760
Like, if the consequences for Russia are really bad, then China might think twice about it.

2185
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,760
Yeah.

2186
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:24,760
Oh, I see, I see.

2187
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:27,760
They still won it, but I don't know.

2188
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:33,760
God, I, yeah, I have no, I have no take on this.

2189
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:36,760
Next one is, what happened to Vic?

2190
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:39,760
Well, I mean, I think he just lives in Virginia.

2191
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:40,760
Yeah, he's doing.

2192
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:44,760
And, uh, I think him and Nate hang out sometimes, maybe?

2193
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,760
I wouldn't know.

2194
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:57,760
But he did, he did post the, like, I edited 99% of this on the, on the, uh, on the music video, uh, which is funny, I guess.

2195
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:00,760
I don't know, I was not aware of that.

2196
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:04,760
Um, I don't know, he's just there, man.

2197
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:06,760
He's just hanging out, living, I guess.

2198
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:08,760
Dunno.

2199
02:17:08,760 --> 02:17:09,760
That's all I got.

2200
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:12,760
Next one is called, hashtag taking a dump.

2201
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:13,760
I can't wait.

2202
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:16,760
Three seconds, six seconds long, three, two, one, go.

2203
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,760
Woo!

2204
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:26,760
Yeah.

2205
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:30,760
Now that's bringing us back to the old voicemail that I remember.

2206
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:31,760
No.

2207
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:33,760
That's classic, classic.

2208
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:34,760
Terrible.

2209
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:40,760
Next one is called, I can do the dogen in finger paint, three, two, one, go.

2210
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:49,760
Okay, Ben, I'm listening to last week's episode and you're always talking about the dogen a lot and, like, how expensive it is.

2211
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:52,760
And I, I, I know you, you want a specific style.

2212
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:53,760
It's not that it's expensive, it's-

2213
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:55,760
But, like, why don't you do it?

2214
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:57,760
Other than, is it just style?

2215
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:06,760
You don't think you can accurately do the style or, like, you don't want to draw yourself getting, like, fucked in the butt by your brother?

2216
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:08,760
I don't, I don't understand.

2217
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:10,760
Or are there?

2218
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:12,760
Buy the book and find out.

2219
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:13,760
Oh my god.

2220
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:14,760
Sorry.

2221
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:21,760
Wait, what was that last, hang on, I missed his last, uh, stop playing Hades, stop grooming children, draw a comic.

2222
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:31,760
Um, one, I don't think my style would, I don't think I could match what's, uh, what Ed did that well.

2223
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,760
Two, I kind of just don't want to.

2224
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:41,760
Like, I kind of have other things I need to be doing, like, like, putting the book together and doing my secret project.

2225
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:51,760
I just, I don't really want to spend the time on it, uh, so, like, and also I don't think I'm a great match.

2226
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:55,760
So, for these two reasons, I don't really want to do it myself.

2227
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:58,760
Uh, I can't find-

2228
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:04,760
I've had a couple, I had a couple people ask if they could do it and, like, I don't know, I'm really looking for someone.

2229
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:12,760
They said, like, I'm like, I'm really looking for someone who's, like, normal drawing style is, like, it looks kind of like that.

2230
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:18,760
I found, I found a couple, like, sort of, ish matches on, on Tabless.

2231
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:22,760
Did you, uh, message the one that OblivionFall suggested?

2232
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:25,760
Uh, no.

2233
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:28,760
I, I still have that Tab open.

2234
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:34,760
I think they're, I think they're too, I'll message them just in case, or them, I don't know what they are.

2235
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:41,760
Uh, I'll message them just in case, but I think, I think they're too big. I don't think they're going to want to do it.

2236
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,760
Uh...

2237
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:46,760
Yeah.

2238
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:51,760
Uh, next one is called Spaghetti Toast for Breakfast is Weird. Three, two, one, go.

2239
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:57,760
Uh, the, uh, restaurant you were talking about that does fast food spaghetti.

2240
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:04,760
I believe that is Jollibee, but McDonald's does spaghetti in a lot of different areas also.

2241
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:05,760
Yeah.

2242
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:07,760
McDonald's has tried to do a bunch of reviews.

2243
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:08,760
Okay.

2244
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:10,760
And, yeah, it's pretty cool.

2245
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:17,760
There's a Kickstarter that was done last year about Unique McDonald's.

2246
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,760
Uh, I kick-started it.

2247
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:22,760
It's cool. I hope it comes out soon.

2248
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:26,760
A Kickstarter for Unique McDonald's?

2249
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:30,760
Yeah, what? Yeah, kick-starting what exactly?

2250
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:35,760
Like people, for McDonald's to make it again? How do you kick-start that?

2251
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:41,760
I did, I did see the Quinton Reviews video about themed McDonald's. Did you see that?

2252
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:43,760
Nope.

2253
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:50,760
Uh, it's sort of a, I think it's called like a eulogy for themed McDonald's because they sort of like stopped existing.

2254
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:58,760
Um, yeah, I don't know what the Kickstarter would be for in that, in this context. It's a little strange.

2255
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:06,760
Um, Spaghetti Toast does sound weird for breakfast. If that's like a specific breakfast menu item, I would think that was pretty funny.

2256
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:11,760
Um, but I guess I'd try it. I'd sure it's fine.

2257
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:16,760
Uh, okay, next one is called I'm in Love with Oblivion Fall, 3, 2, 1, go.

2258
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:24,760
He says in like a nice way, and I hope it doesn't come off as like making fun of Oblivion Fall.

2259
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:33,760
But the way Oblivion Fall says like the T-H sound for the, and it says the, and then like father is the cutest fucking thing in the world.

2260
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:40,760
And I wish nothing but good things for Oblivion Fall because of this, and I love Oblivion Fall because of this.

2261
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:45,760
I just want Oblivion Fall to talk to me so much more often. Can Oblivion Fall be on the podcast?

2262
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:50,760
I don't care what they say, I just want them to talk.

2263
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:56,760
He does kind of say the soft T-H as an F. That's true.

2264
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:58,760
I've never noticed that. Wait.

2265
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:02,760
I have noticed it once or twice. It's fine.

2266
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:06,760
Do a voice. Do an Oblivion Fall voice.

2267
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:11,760
There's not much to it other than...

2268
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:22,760
Oi, oi, Ari. Oi, give me the toast whiff. Give me the toast whiff.

2269
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:25,760
Spaghetti for breakfast, lads.

2270
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:29,760
I live in England where we eat spaghetti at McDonald's.

2271
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:38,760
We call it, we call it, we call it a McRoyal with cheese over here.

2272
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:48,760
Okay, I do think I recognize that F, that Ith sound.

2273
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:51,760
I don't know how to do it, but I think yeah.

2274
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:55,760
Sometimes. It's fine.

2275
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:00,760
You know who else does it and they don't talk like Oblivion Fall at all,

2276
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:04,760
but they also kind of do that is Gamer's Tavern also kind of...

2277
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:06,760
No, no, no.

2278
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:10,760
Gamer's Tavern, he does like a sh instead of a C-H.

2279
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:13,760
Yeah, yeah, you know what? You're right, I'm mixing them up.

2280
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,760
Like, oh, you change your clothes, you change your clothes.

2281
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:22,760
Take a chance, take a chance on this lottery, please.

2282
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:29,760
Buy a scratch ticket, these selling scratch tickets on the street corner, by the way.

2283
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:31,760
That's his day job.

2284
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:38,760
Okay, next one is a YouTube link that I won't click, but there is also a voicemail attached.

2285
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:41,760
Yeah, three, two, one, go.

2286
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:45,760
Hey Oblivion Fall, good job on the Patreons.

2287
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:54,760
Yeah, I'm your biggest fan, I listen to you all the time and know all the lyrics without looking of the Gems zooms.

2288
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:57,760
Oh, he's not here.

2289
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:59,760
Got him.

2290
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,760
Yeah, absolutely right.

2291
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:03,760
That's a good anticipation.

2292
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:09,760
Okay, I did click the YouTube link because he actually left a voicemail and it is...

2293
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:12,760
It's this.

2294
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:14,760
It's a YouTube short.

2295
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:18,760
You gotta put the HTTP cones.

2296
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:21,760
It's some, like, anime music.

2297
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:24,760
Hey Oblivion Fall, do you like Metal Gear?

2298
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:26,760
I don't know if they do.

2299
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:28,760
Okay.

2300
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:32,760
Oh god, no, shut up. It keeps playing in my headphones for some reason.

2301
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:37,760
Next one is called Now I Get It, three, two, one, go.

2302
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:40,760
And yeah, just now I realized the...

2303
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:45,760
Not putting your context, but the name of the message as a title.

2304
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:47,760
Just now I'm getting it.

2305
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:50,760
And thanks for the clouds.

2306
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,760
Deb.

2307
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:54,760
You're welcome.

2308
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:56,760
Alright.

2309
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:58,760
Next one is a YouTube link.

2310
02:24:58,760 --> 02:24:59,760
No.

2311
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:00,760
Nope.

2312
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:01,760
Skippin'.

2313
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:02,760
Nope.

2314
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:06,760
Next one is called Bendo Santos on Mustseppuku over this.

2315
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:08,760
Well, we'll see about that.

2316
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:11,760
Three, two, one, go.

2317
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:17,760
Okay, so despite you all putting Samurai Sama in the top 10 voicemail characters,

2318
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:19,760
he's not in the voice grail.

2319
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,760
He's not in the voice grail documents.

2320
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:22,760
Oh.

2321
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:24,760
What is wrong with the world?

2322
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:25,760
That's pretty stupid.

2323
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,760
Put him on there. Come on.

2324
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:29,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2325
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:31,760
There were some people in the comments,

2326
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:36,760
some people pointed out some really obvious people that I had forgotten to include.

2327
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:37,760
Yeah, both of us.

2328
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:40,760
There was an Arara aka...

2329
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:41,760
Arara.

2330
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:42,760
Yep.

2331
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:44,760
Arara aka Prepare for the Bear.

2332
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:46,760
Prepare for the Bear and that whole saga that...

2333
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:49,760
I don't even know what to call it.

2334
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,760
What happened?

2335
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:54,760
The sea creatures saga, I guess?

2336
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:57,760
I don't know.

2337
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:01,760
It feels in the same vein as the robo twilight arc.

2338
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:03,760
Oh, Kyle and Funny Man.

2339
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:05,760
Kyle and Funny Man.

2340
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:07,760
Yeah, that's pretty good.

2341
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:11,760
Oh, I think Kyle and Funny Man deserves the shout out.

2342
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:14,760
Oh, I see ABZQ comments,

2343
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:17,760
your RSS feed stopped updating.

2344
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:21,760
I have not figured it out.

2345
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:23,760
I just am...

2346
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:25,760
I don't want to learn a new skill.

2347
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:31,760
I don't want to learn a new skill to do that.

2348
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:33,760
Oh, Doid Gazers.

2349
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:35,760
Doid Gazers also...

2350
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:37,760
I don't know if...

2351
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:38,760
Doid Gazers is up there.

2352
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:41,760
Yeah, I don't know if he's top 10.

2353
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:43,760
I don't know if I would.

2354
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:48,760
I mean, it's...

2355
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:52,760
I feel like it's drama, like, tainted to me.

2356
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:54,760
I'm sort of predisposed against it,

2357
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,760
but I don't know, that's just me.

2358
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:58,760
Pshaw.

2359
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:01,760
Next one is called Hey Ben.

2360
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:02,760
You know what, we should put this in.

2361
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:06,760
What I mean by that is I just prefer the creative stuff.

2362
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:08,760
I get it.

2363
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:12,760
I don't agree, but I understand what you're saying.

2364
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:14,760
I understand why you feel that way.

2365
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:16,760
I liked the song they made.

2366
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:18,760
They made a whole album.

2367
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:22,760
They made a whole album.

2368
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:24,760
Dog.

2369
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:27,760
That's pretty good.

2370
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:29,760
That was pretty good.

2371
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:31,760
In my opinion.

2372
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:33,760
Yeah, I get it.

2373
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,760
Next one is called Hey Ben.

2374
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:38,760
Three, two, one, go.

2375
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,760
Thanks.

2376
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:42,760
There's nothing there.

2377
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:44,760
Next one is YouTube Skip.

2378
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:47,760
Next we have Slime Times Weekend Update,

2379
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:50,760
and there's two parts, so let's do part one.

2380
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:53,760
Three, two, one, go.

2381
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:56,760
Good day to cool killers and rowdy ruffians.

2382
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:59,760
Welcome back to the Slime Times Weekend Update.

2383
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:01,760
The past weeks have seen a lot of movement,

2384
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:05,760
and your reporter will take you through them now at a speedy pace.

2385
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,760
Elections for community mods are happening,

2386
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:10,760
and one of the leading entrants is Rowdy Loom,

2387
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:13,760
who runs on a platform of banning cop killer Ben Sainte

2388
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:15,760
from the server and them resigning herself.

2389
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:17,760
I saw that, I saw that.

2390
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:19,760
Skateboards have been introduced as weapons,

2391
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:22,760
and allow you to do sick kickflips with the skate command.

2392
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:26,760
Killer Game Dev Crank is organizing an RFCK wrestling match

2393
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:30,760
using the character creator in WWE 2K22.

2394
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:34,760
Juvy Dev Zugarush created a bot that would automatically post

2395
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:37,760
tweets from Laka Kam's Slime Twitter

2396
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:40,760
onto the Twitter platform of Earth1218.

2397
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:42,760
I saw the Slime Twitter bot.

2398
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:45,760
He count almost immediately got locked for going after such people

2399
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:47,760
as Elon Musk and notable boy band BTS.

2400
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,760
Want to come look at the ashes?

2401
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:52,760
The account is at EW Slime Tweeting.

2402
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:57,760
Yeah, I saw that, I followed it just because of the meme

2403
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:03,760
and the idea that I could see what Discord players were saying

2404
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:05,760
but on my Twitter feed.

2405
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:08,760
I'm using technology things.

2406
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:12,760
They said a lot of weird stuff amongst them.

2407
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:18,760
I didn't really see a lot of their tweets.

2408
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:22,760
In RFCK there is a channel called Slime Twitter

2409
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:25,760
and if you have a gel phone, you can make Slime Tweets

2410
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:27,760
in Slime Twitter and they will show up

2411
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:30,760
and anyone else with a gel phone can see them.

2412
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:32,760
Yeah, they made a bot.

2413
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:37,760
Zug made a bot, I guess, that automatically tweeted

2414
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:40,760
all those tweets onto Twitter.

2415
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:44,760
Really did they get banned because they went after Elon Musk

2416
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:46,760
and BTS? It seems stupid.

2417
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:48,760
Yeah, I don't know.

2418
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:50,760
That doesn't seem...

2419
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:52,760
There must be more to it than that.

2420
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:55,760
Maybe because there's a lot of stuff on there.

2421
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:58,760
Twitter algorithm is like, oh, this is a new account

2422
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:01,760
and it's saying some random shit

2423
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:04,760
and adding people must be a bot, which it literally is.

2424
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:09,760
I mean, there's lots of accounts that are openly bots, though.

2425
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:11,760
Yeah.

2426
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:15,760
I would assume it's just maybe somebody just used words

2427
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:17,760
that Twitter didn't like.

2428
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:19,760
I don't know what words.

2429
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:21,760
I didn't see anything particularly bad,

2430
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:23,760
but I wasn't looking at everything.

2431
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:25,760
Yeah, I didn't... I don't know.

2432
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:28,760
I would be sad to see it banned. It sucks.

2433
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:31,760
I kind of thought it was pretty funny, actually.

2434
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:33,760
Yeah.

2435
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,760
Next time, or next one is part two.

2436
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:39,760
So, three, two, one, go.

2437
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:44,760
Finally, the annual rowdy brick night has occurred once again.

2438
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:48,760
And once again, rowdy is through hundreds of bricks into killer apartments,

2439
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:51,760
likely racking up thousands of V-Box and property damage

2440
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:53,760
and temporarily making the bot pass out.

2441
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:54,760
The V-Box.

2442
02:30:54,760 --> 02:30:56,760
Present for this occurrence was also a mysterious

2443
02:30:56,760 --> 02:31:00,760
but immediately well-liked little lady by the name of Ali Upp,

2444
02:31:00,760 --> 02:31:04,760
whom some may know from critically acclaimed webcomic Bill Jay

2445
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:06,760
by girl boss artist Gibbentake.

2446
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:09,760
We don't know how she got here, but we cherish her already.

2447
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:13,760
Rowdy Demedunk even gave her a special brick as a keepsake.

2448
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:16,760
All in all, creativity seems to this reporter

2449
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:19,760
at an all-time high in the endless war community as of late.

2450
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:21,760
I mean, what's next?

2451
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:24,760
An official RFCK V-Tuber?

2452
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:26,760
How would you? How?

2453
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:27,760
No!

2454
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:29,760
Anyways, that's it for now.

2455
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:32,760
And remember, the slime time is the best time.

2456
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:35,760
That's so nice. That's so cool.

2457
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:36,760
Yeah.

2458
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:41,760
I've, like, pretended to be some of my own characters sometimes.

2459
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:46,760
I mean, in RFCK, I was the Lord of Ghosts,

2460
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:49,760
and then I was Red Man, and then I had my Gunna girl account.

2461
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:50,760
Oh.

2462
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:53,760
The fact that somebody is going around being Ali Upp is amazing,

2463
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:54,760
and I love that.

2464
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:57,760
I was, uh, you know, that reminds me,

2465
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:01,760
I was writing the footnotes for the book,

2466
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:03,760
and I wanted to ask,

2467
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:09,760
uh, Red Man and Gunna girl were not originally RFCK characters.

2468
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:12,760
They weren't created, like, for RFCK, were they?

2469
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:15,760
Um...

2470
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:18,760
I'm trying to remember, I think, no.

2471
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:21,760
I think I just drew some...

2472
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:24,760
I was just drawing some bullshit.

2473
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:27,760
I came up with this guy called Red Man.

2474
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:28,760
Yeah.

2475
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:29,760
And then...

2476
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:32,760
I remember you just coming up with him, and he's just a guy.

2477
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:37,760
He's based on, like, a little image of a red face that looks like...

2478
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:40,760
Yeah! Oh, that's right. That's right.

2479
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:42,760
That I had as my avatar for a bit.

2480
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:45,760
And Gunna girl was just like,

2481
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,760
what if there was a fight?

2482
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:48,760
Who would Red Man fight?

2483
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:49,760
I know.

2484
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:50,760
Gunna girl.

2485
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:52,760
She's a girl with a gun.

2486
02:32:52,760 --> 02:32:56,760
Oh, I didn't know that that was the idea.

2487
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:58,760
Yeah, I think I had one of the first...

2488
02:32:58,760 --> 02:32:59,760
One of the first images.

2489
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:00,760
Red Man's, like, natural enemy.

2490
02:33:00,760 --> 02:33:03,760
Like, the survivor to his Zangus.

2491
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:06,760
Let me find it as an image.

2492
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:09,760
God, was it 2018?

2493
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:11,760
How long ago was this?

2494
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:13,760
Uh...

2495
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,760
Actually, you know what?

2496
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:17,760
I don't know what came first.

2497
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:21,760
Here's the first image of Gun Girl.

2498
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:23,760
It's, like, Bail Jape with Gun.

2499
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,760
That was the tagline of this little poster.

2500
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:27,760
Yeah.

2501
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:30,760
Because I used punk's hairstyle again.

2502
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:32,760
Yeah. Yeah.

2503
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:34,760
And then...

2504
02:33:34,760 --> 02:33:36,760
Where's the one where it's Red Man?

2505
02:33:36,760 --> 02:33:38,760
Gun girl vs. Red Man.

2506
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:41,760
I should check by date created.

2507
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,760
Is this on Twitter you're looking at?

2508
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:46,760
No, I'm looking at my files.

2509
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:48,760
Oh.

2510
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:49,760
Uh...

2511
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:53,760
Date created.

2512
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,760
Yeah, I got to...

2513
02:33:55,760 --> 02:34:03,760
I was making footnotes on, you know, the scene with Red Man playing guitar on the Longfellow Bridge.

2514
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:09,760
And I was making footnotes trying to explain, like, who Red Man and Gun Girl are.

2515
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:15,760
And I was like, where did they actually come from, exactly?

2516
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:20,760
Okay, so it was all on the same day, the 28th of November, 2018.

2517
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:22,760
And it was, like, late night.

2518
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:26,760
So, 40 minutes past midnight, I came up with this Gun Girl.

2519
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:30,760
Then, the next one was this.

2520
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:32,760
Red Man vs. Gun Girl.

2521
02:34:32,760 --> 02:34:35,760
Wait...

2522
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:38,760
Wait, is that the first Red Man?

2523
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:40,760
I don't think that's the first Red Man.

2524
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:43,760
Because I remember he was based on that red...

2525
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:44,760
Didn't we... hold on.

2526
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:51,760
I think you did have, like, the red face as, like, your avatar, like, your Discord avatar.

2527
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:56,760
Like, in RFCK, maybe.

2528
02:34:56,760 --> 02:35:00,760
And I feel like Red Man came from you using that red face?

2529
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:03,760
Or I could be wrong about that.

2530
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:05,760
It came from that red face, that is true.

2531
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:07,760
I just don't know when...

2532
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:08,760
Yeah.

2533
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:11,760
When that all happened.

2534
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:12,760
Damn.

2535
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:14,760
Oh, no, this must have been what it is.

2536
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:17,760
I can't find the first Red Man image I'm looking.

2537
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:19,760
But it must have been a while before.

2538
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,760
But I guess I had Red Man.

2539
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:23,760
This Red Man looks great in this poster.

2540
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:24,760
I love it.

2541
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:25,760
Yeah.

2542
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:27,760
I had the Red Man, and then I just...

2543
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:31,760
Some day came up with Gun Girl and thought,

2544
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:35,760
I wonder what she's... her deal is.

2545
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:38,760
And then I decided she fights Red Man.

2546
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:39,760
Yeah.

2547
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:43,760
And then later, they became the Rowdy and Killer.

2548
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:44,760
Yeah.

2549
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:45,760
Yeah.

2550
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:46,760
Two.

2551
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:49,760
Okay, so their origins are a little bit...

2552
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:53,760
A little bit unclear, but I think I get the...

2553
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:57,760
Honestly, it's really tempting as I go through page after page.

2554
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:00,760
It's tempting to write a full fucking page of shit

2555
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:03,760
about every single one of these pages.

2556
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:07,760
Sometimes I have to restrain myself.

2557
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:08,760
Like...

2558
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:11,760
Damn.

2559
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:13,760
There was one...

2560
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:15,760
Uh...

2561
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:20,760
Yeah, there's one.

2562
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:24,760
When Phantom Horn is complaining about capitalism,

2563
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:30,760
I sort of had to keep myself from going on a whole, like, speculative, like...

2564
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:33,760
Phantom Horn's like family life growing up.

2565
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:37,760
What is his exposure to capitalism like?

2566
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:42,760
What is the economy in Equestria based on...

2567
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:46,760
Do they socialize medicine in Equestria?

2568
02:36:46,760 --> 02:36:48,760
Uh, stuff.

2569
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:49,760
Um...

2570
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:50,760
There was another one.

2571
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:53,760
There was another one that I was...

2572
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:54,760
Oh, yeah.

2573
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:58,760
There's a part where there's a plaque on the mine entrance

2574
02:36:58,760 --> 02:37:00,760
that commemorates Slime Investigator,

2575
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:04,760
which was a character from Canny's ARG.

2576
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:06,760
And, like, I didn't think...

2577
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:08,760
I didn't think it was necessary to, like,

2578
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:11,760
actually explain all, like, what happened with that ARG,

2579
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:13,760
but, like, there was a lot to it.

2580
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,760
I don't even remember all the details.

2581
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:16,760
If there's a lot, you could say, but I had to be, like...

2582
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:18,760
I'm not gonna go into all the details right now.

2583
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:22,760
I could, but I don't want to spend, like, a whole page explaining that.

2584
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:25,760
Uh, just know that that's what this is a reference to.

2585
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:27,760
Uh...

2586
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:31,760
Part of me just thinks it would be cool to just have, like,

2587
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:34,760
20, 30, 40 pages of notes.

2588
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:36,760
And another part of me is, like...

2589
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:40,760
That's gonna drive the cost of the book up, actually.

2590
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:41,760
That's gonna make the...

2591
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,760
It really will.

2592
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:44,760
Um...

2593
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:47,760
Maybe if you just have really small text.

2594
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:49,760
I could just make it really small.

2595
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:51,760
Honestly, yeah. You know what?

2596
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:53,760
Yeah, I shouldn't, well...

2597
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:55,760
I shouldn't worry about it being too long,

2598
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:57,760
because I can just make the text really small if I want to.

2599
02:37:57,760 --> 02:37:59,760
This is the only reason I should not make it too long,

2600
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:03,760
is if it's, like, tedious or off-topic or not interesting.

2601
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:06,760
Um, but, like, anything that's...

2602
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:09,760
I don't see why not include more.

2603
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:11,760
Because it's all indexed by page.

2604
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:13,760
You don't have to read all of it if you don't want to.

2605
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,760
Uh, although...

2606
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:17,760
If you...

2607
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:19,760
I think if you don't know anything,

2608
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:22,760
if you're reading the book and you don't understand what's going on at all,

2609
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:25,760
you probably should just read all the footnotes in order,

2610
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:28,760
because they do kind of explain as you go, like,

2611
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:30,760
what is Endless War?

2612
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:32,760
Okay, who is Phantom Horn?

2613
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:35,760
Like, what is Nightstar, etc., etc.?

2614
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:37,760
Uh, yeah.

2615
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:42,760
Probably would be beneficial for some people to read all the footnotes, actually.

2616
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:44,760
Uh, yeah.

2617
02:38:44,760 --> 02:38:46,760
Okay, that's a little, uh...

2618
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:48,760
There's a little tangent, a little tangent there.

2619
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:50,760
I just went on.

2620
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:52,760
Anyway, that was a little... Huh?

2621
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:55,760
I'm looking through my things still.

2622
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:57,760
I want to find the first red man.

2623
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,760
Oh, right, right, right.

2624
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:02,760
Actually, hmm, we just got...

2625
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:05,760
We just got a last-minute voicemail here.

2626
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:09,760
Do you want to find the first red man before we...

2627
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:11,760
Oh, yeah, I found an image,

2628
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:14,760
but it turns out the first drawn...

2629
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:18,760
This is the day after all those gun girl ones,

2630
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:20,760
where red man took a selfie.

2631
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:24,760
I guess I had the avatar for a while,

2632
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:28,760
and I didn't think to make him a character until I invented gun girl.

2633
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:30,760
Huh.

2634
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:32,760
So that's...

2635
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:34,760
Maybe I had been role-playing as like,

2636
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:36,760
oh, I'm red man, I'm red.

2637
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:37,760
Why is the red man red?

2638
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:40,760
I eat blood, like I made it all up on the spot.

2639
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:41,760
Yeah.

2640
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:43,760
Was that in RFCK, though?

2641
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:45,760
That would have been in RFCK, I think.

2642
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:46,760
Yeah.

2643
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:48,760
Oh, you know what it was?

2644
02:39:48,760 --> 02:39:51,760
Lord of Ghosts was excised from the city.

2645
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:53,760
I had to change my character.

2646
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:56,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right, that's right.

2647
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:58,760
So I couldn't be the Lord of Ghosts anymore.

2648
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:00,760
I was no longer role-playing as that.

2649
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:02,760
To red man.

2650
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:04,760
I became red man.

2651
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:07,760
I don't really remember exactly what happened after that,

2652
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:09,760
but the first drawing was gun girl.

2653
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:12,760
I did not draw a red man before I made gun girl.

2654
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:14,760
That is actually interesting.

2655
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:17,760
I might go back and I might make a little bit of mention of that

2656
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:20,760
in my notes, because I think that's pretty funny.

2657
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:22,760
I think the only...

2658
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:25,760
I think the only explicit, like,

2659
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,760
Lord of Ghosts reference in Slime and Punishment

2660
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:32,760
is the way that Anti-Slime looks.

2661
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:35,760
So I guess I'll probably mention him

2662
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:38,760
around that time when they're in the sewers.

2663
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:44,760
He needs to get discussed at least a little bit.

2664
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:46,760
Yeah.

2665
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:49,760
Okay, well, very interesting.

2666
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:51,760
Lamal, this fucking selfie picture.

2667
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:54,760
This is like lopsided arms.

2668
02:40:54,760 --> 02:40:57,760
Okay, we got one last-minute voicemail.

2669
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:01,760
It's a vocaboo link if you're ready.

2670
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:03,760
Uh...

2671
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,760
Okay.

2672
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:09,760
Three, two, one, go.

2673
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:13,760
Yo, it's your boy, Fackop69 here.

2674
02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:17,760
So my friend recommended this podcast, the PCP podcast.

2675
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:19,760
Yo, listen into that shit.

2676
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:21,760
This is pretty fucking entertaining, bro.

2677
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:22,760
Yo, this is a funny shit.

2678
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:24,760
Anyway, I appreciate you listening to my voicemail.

2679
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:26,760
Yo, I'm Fackop69.

2680
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:28,760
Thank you. I love you guys so much.

2681
02:41:28,760 --> 02:41:30,760
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

2682
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:32,760
Yo.

2683
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:37,760
No.

2684
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:44,760
Do not trust him.

2685
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:48,760
Do not let him in.

2686
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:53,760
He will read you.

2687
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:57,760
Do not read him.

2688
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:01,760
His voice is ash.

2689
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:05,760
His air is dead.

2690
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,760
You must not breathe it in.

2691
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:14,760
You must not comprehend the vapor.

2692
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:18,760
His credit vapor.

2693
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:24,760
True!

2694
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:25,760
That was great.

2695
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:26,760
That was great.

2696
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:28,760
That reminded me...

2697
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:39,760
Well, the dreaded vapor reminds me of a dwarf fortress mega beast that might have deadly vapor.

2698
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:42,760
But that reminded me of...

2699
02:42:42,760 --> 02:42:46,760
You've played Space Funeral, right?

2700
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:49,760
No, actually.

2701
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:51,760
I heard about it.

2702
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:53,760
I think a video or two about it.

2703
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:56,760
Well, the part in the blood caverns.

2704
02:42:56,760 --> 02:43:01,760
When you fight the blood ghoul, in the blood caverns, everything is red.

2705
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:05,760
It's probably where Redman comes from, to be honest.

2706
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:08,760
An ancestral home.

2707
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:14,760
Everything in the blood caverns is red, and there's this spoken word poem that is the background music.

2708
02:43:14,760 --> 02:43:17,760
It sounds somewhat like that.

2709
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:28,760
It's a poem about a bat, like, bruising itself to death, trying to fly or something.

2710
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:35,760
When the low, heavy sky weighs a lid on the spirit, etc.

2711
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,760
Thanks for the voicemail.

2712
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:38,760
No, you can trust me.

2713
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:39,760
No, you can read me.

2714
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:41,760
No, just read me, bro.

2715
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:43,760
No, my vapor's okay.

2716
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:44,760
It's fine.

2717
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:45,760
Are they talking about you?

2718
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:56,760
I thought they were talking about some unseen, creepy, danger lurking in the future.

2719
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:59,760
Well, we have that other one that Mario said don't...

2720
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:01,760
Oh, are they not talking about me?

2721
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:04,760
Are they prophesying some other...?

2722
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:07,760
That's what I interpreted.

2723
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:08,760
Oh, yeah.

2724
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:10,760
I mean, maybe.

2725
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:12,760
I mean, you said I have vapor.

2726
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:16,760
Is that, like, a reference to my comic that I made of that name?

2727
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:18,760
Do not read Ben St.

2728
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:20,760
Do not read the vapor's.

2729
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:22,760
I think...

2730
02:44:22,760 --> 02:44:23,760
Now I'm not sure.

2731
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:26,760
That's what I thought they were talking about.

2732
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:28,760
Well, I guess we'll never know.

2733
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:34,760
I guess when something bad happens, we'll see who we blame it on.

2734
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:36,760
Alright, I guess that's the end.

2735
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:38,760
That's the last voicemail.

2736
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:40,760
Uh, finally.

2737
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:47,760
Since it's the end of the episode, I will take this moment to grovel before our audience

2738
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:53,760
and ask, please, please, we didn't charge you for March, please give us some money

2739
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:56,760
so I won't feel so sad about that.

2740
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:58,760
It cost me, like, a thousand dollars.

2741
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:00,760
Ah!

2742
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:02,760
Help.

2743
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:07,760
I know I said I had money earlier in the podcast.

2744
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:09,760
But poor Gib, though.

2745
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:11,760
But poor Gib is the one who's really suffering.

2746
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:13,760
Don't do it for me.

2747
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:14,760
I'm evil.

2748
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:18,760
I bully young baby girls on Twitter.

2749
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:23,760
But Gib deserves better than to be destituted.

2750
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:25,760
It's so true.

2751
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:27,760
So true of you to say that.

2752
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:29,760
It is so true.

2753
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:31,760
Patreon.com slash TheProgressNatives.

2754
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:33,760
Yes, please.

2755
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:35,760
Thank you.

2756
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:38,760
Four. I think it's five. Four?

2757
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:40,760
I forget, but I think it was four.

2758
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:42,760
I think it's four new bonus episodes.

2759
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:45,760
Four new behind-the-scenes bonus episodes.

2760
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:47,760
Some of them are pretty funny. I listen to them.

2761
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:50,760
And there's some funny stuff in there.

2762
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:54,760
It's worth your time.

2763
02:45:54,760 --> 02:45:55,760
It's worth your five dollars.

2764
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:57,760
It's worth your time. It's worth your money.

2765
02:45:57,760 --> 02:45:59,760
And all that other, obviously, all the previous...

2766
02:45:59,760 --> 02:46:01,760
We're very, very funny.

2767
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:03,760
Yeah, that's good.

2768
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:06,760
And obviously, all the previous bonus episodes

2769
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:09,760
and the Red Con commentary and documentary

2770
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:11,760
and all of that stuff.

2771
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:13,760
Also the Minecraft server.

2772
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:14,760
Oh, yes.

2773
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:15,760
If you'd like to hop on the Minecraft server

2774
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:17,760
and make some fun stuff.

2775
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:18,760
Of course.

2776
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:20,760
Or catch Pokemon, or both.

2777
02:46:20,760 --> 02:46:22,760
And we will...

2778
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:24,760
I think we said we would do one last week.

2779
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:26,760
We'll do another stream soon.

2780
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:27,760
It's been a little while.

2781
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:28,760
Yeah, yeah.

2782
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:29,760
Maybe we can show off some builds

2783
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:31,760
that maybe some new members have done.

2784
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:33,760
Who knows?

2785
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:36,760
Maren did say that after we talked about

2786
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:39,760
the Minecraft server, I think an episode or two ago

2787
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:41,760
that some people reached out

2788
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:43,760
who wanted to get involved in that,

2789
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:45,760
which is pretty fun.

2790
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:50,760
So, alright, that's going to do it for this week's PCP.

2791
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:55,760
Thanks, Patreon.

2792
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:57,760
Have mercy.

2793
02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:00,760
Have mercy.

2794
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:01,760
Okay.

2795
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:02,760
Yes.

2796
02:47:02,760 --> 02:47:03,760
Thanks. Goodbye.

2797
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:04,760
Yes.

2798
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:05,760
In goodbye.

2799
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:06,760
Sorry.

2800
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:07,760
I apologize for this ending.

2801
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:08,760
Bye.

2802
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:09,760
Bye.

2803
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:10,760
I don't.

2804
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:11,760
Okay.
