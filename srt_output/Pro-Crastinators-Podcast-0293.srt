1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Anyway, here is the new theme song I thought of for the PCP. It goes a little something like this.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ah! I wouldn't fucking shit so bad! Thank you.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The PCP makes me come, come, come right now!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's me, Ben Saint, and Gibbontake.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's Christmas Eve, Ben.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, will this episode be out on the 24th of December?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, and a magical, well, you know, that's actually perfect, because I have a present.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I have a Christmas miracle, a bundle of Christmas joy to deliver on this Christmas Eve, and do you know what that is?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is it the Phantom's Revenge?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's Phantom's Revenge, and you're fucking stalking for fucking Christmas, for fucking Yule! Bitch!

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I would be playing.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You'll be taking revenge as Phantom Horn and killing people.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is, um, yeah, it is, it is, it is like, it is like basically done.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If I did, if I did not have to record this podcast and then do some holiday bullshit today, I would say I am definitely releasing it today.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When I'm recording this, but I will certainly be releasing it tomorrow at the very latest.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Incredible.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, so, you know, ho ho ho, Merry Christmas!

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For patrons only, of course, because it is still the beta release.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
When's the Chad Alpha release coming out?

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was thinking about this, the Chad Alpha release will be out when the beta version stays up for patrons for a little while, so they can play it and report any bugs to me.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The beta release is the finished version, the alpha version will just be bug-fixed and bug-tested a bit, and might have some minor changes, but the game will be basically the same.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, and then I have to, I have to draw some pages of slime and punishment to basically set up why the events of Phantom's Revenge are happening.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So the alpha version I will put out after I do a little bit more slime and punishment to like, you know, basically I have to finish slime and punishment, which will not take very long, because it's not that much left to it.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So then once that's done, then the alpha release, and then maybe in the future when I decide, haha, it would be funny to go back and add in keg mode.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Then after I, if I ever decide to add in keg mode, then that will be the Ligma release after that.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But that's a hypothetical.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So that's the plan.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Merry Christmas, everybody.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm very happy.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've been tweeting a lot of it.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, man.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't want to gush.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't want to gush too much about it, but I think, I think people will be blown away.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think people will be blown away by certain parts of it.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think there will be parts in it where people like, look at it and they like, slap their hand on their forehead and they go, I can't believe.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Are they fence palm?

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I say, I can't believe that Saint would do that.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, I can't.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, but in like a good way.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In a good way.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I promise.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Other than the fact that I noticed one sprite is like off and I need to fix it.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That was like, I was, I was, I was playtesting it last night and there was one sprite.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I was like, shit, I got to fix that one sprite.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Other than that, it's at the point where literally the only thing that I need to do is just play it through a bunch of times and, and just decide how many podrans to give in your inventory to make it like balanced and fair.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And like all I have to do is decide like six podrans, seven podrans, eight.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And that's it.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And that's like the last thing.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Very exciting.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Very tired.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I stayed up all night, almost all night last night doing that.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I wanted to get it done before today because I got to do shit today, but oh well, it's fine.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How long since the beginning of the project then?

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Will it have been it?

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, I, I thought that I wanted to get it out today as in the day of recording because it was the 19th because I remembered that on December 19th last year.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I made a cryptic tweet that was that said, I have begun a mysterious construction.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh yeah, I remember that.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Referring.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Right.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But I turned out I was wrong, actually, and I made that tweet on December 15th.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So it's actually already past the exact one year anniversary, which like whatever.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And actually, it's not even really true because that was when I started programming the game, but I had already started drawing sprites for it like a while before that.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Like I had drawn, yeah, some sprites and just just as sort of like a ha ha.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What if I did this and then I drew a bunch of sprites and I was like, yeah, I should actually start working on that.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And then I did.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So it's been about a year.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I was working.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I worked in it a little bit like a month or two beforehand before I actually so in like the most general sense, I guess maybe like a year and like two a month or two, something like that.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So it's been about a year basically.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then, you know, now it's a video game.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now it's a video game.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Patreon.com slash Ben St.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Gonna be a beta tester and also get your name in the credits.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, give turned her microphone off.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How, how strange.

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sorry, somebody came to the door.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, it's okay.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It gave me time to plug my shit once, once more.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So that's fine.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So that's, that's all epic.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm glad it's finally getting to a finished state.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, me too.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You and me both.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And it's been.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's been a journey, I tell you.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I've been, I've literally, I've spent like all of December working on it like all day every day.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Almost.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I mean, you know, not like 24 hours a day, but like, you know, probably, probably about

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
like eight to 10 hours a day, Monday, Sunday through Saturday, except when I go to like

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
work out with my secret project is similar in that it has taken a while and it is very

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
close to being finished and show showable.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But right now I don't know whether it'll be ready by the time this episode comes out.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So I still don't want to like, I don't want to, I don't want to say anything.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't want to say a single dang word.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I don't take, don't take this the wrong way, but I know that I was saying that like

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Phantom's Revenge was almost done since fucking like April.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So I don't know.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, I mean, do you really think it's like a week out?

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like it's that close?

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The bulk of the project, yes.

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I think the last thing left is like management, like media marketing menagerie.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like it's making it look nice so that when I, because I don't want to just come on to

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the procrastinated podcast and say, hey, download the thing.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Link in description.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't want to just, I want it to be like a bit bigger than just this podcast reach.

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And for that, it needs marketing and it needs like a big push.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't really know how to market.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just thinking.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How they marketed.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How did you know that how they marketed is a series with a narrative?

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I didn't.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What was the narrative?

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you remember that was like the tagline?

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I remember the tagline, but I have no idea what it was in reference to.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I guess.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, it was going to be about the series that Trixie gave up on and didn't finish

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
just like everything else.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Enough about that.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When you say you want to do a marketing push and you want it to be bigger and expand to

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
reach.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At least like, it's hard like not to spoil it for people who still don't know.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I've talked about it on my Patreon.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So if you want to, which I'm caught up with, by the way, I'm caught up on the Money Spenders

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
podcast.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The Money Spenders podcast over on give and take, patreon.com slash give and take.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So I explained what it is, but nobody has seen any of it yet.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think you have seen like a small bit.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've showed you.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You mean the project.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Tom.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But that wasn't.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You mean, you mean the secret project?

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You've seen a little bit of it.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But nobody.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wait, I didn't say, I'm like, I didn't, have I said anything thus far in the podcast

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that like alludes to what it is?

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hopefully.

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I mean, I don't really know what the benefit is of keeping it super secret.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Whatever.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Psychological benefit.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But I'm very, very psyched about it.

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't think I said anything.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I was just double checking.

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Lamau.

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm very psyched about it.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I wish I could talk about it.

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I think I've got like family stuff because next week is like the Christmas week.

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm seeing relatives and I wanted to be cleaning up for like a Christmas party or doing a Christmas

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
party and then there's Christmas.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So it's hard to like fit in hours to do stuff.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But I think still quite possible before the end of the year.

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It'll be out.

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Pog.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's rad.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I mean, for me, I also, you know, I would like for the game to get seen outside of, you

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
know, the PCP circles.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So I guess my plan for that is my plan for that is like, well, I guess I'll make an itch

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
page.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I guess I'll.

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Geez.

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I wonder if I asked Jim Storm dancer for a plug.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If he would plug, if he would like give me a retweet or something on it.

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That would be cool.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That'd be pretty epic.

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I guess I don't, I guess I'll put it on my website, whatever that's worth.

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, I'll be tweet.

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll probably be tweeting about it for a while.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I've changed my whole, I've changed my avatar and my tagline and stuff on Twitter.

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The other than like making an itch page, I don't really know how to like, you know, push

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
it in the media, in the media landscape.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think it's weird because like yours is a very specific thing.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It is a part of a larger piece, which is a niche of a niche.

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And so like it's true need to just trick people into downloading and playing it.

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Literally, that's the goal.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The phantom's revenge is a year long effort post of a Trojan horse to like trick people

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
into playing a game that is narrative heavy to make them wonder like what's the story

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
about and then go read my comic.

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is the kind, Cheesy Manfredo could learn a thing or two about how to get people to

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
read Villainverse.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was going to say the, I think there's a somewhat of a culture on itch for people to

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
just take a random game, buy it or get it and do like a review or a let's play of it

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and then you can see the let's play.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They would post the let's plays underneath.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So like when my brother and I made run away from snakes for Balejap, that was on his itch

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and people let's play it.

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
People didn't know what the thing was, but it was just like it's a pumpkin girl.

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
She's running away from snakes, makes sense and they did a little let's play.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's like a very small channel, not like a big deal, but it was nice to see like just

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
random strangers who had no idea what any of this was giving it a go and talking about it.

214
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That is nice.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I added, you know, there's a feature in Phantom's range.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It does count your playtime.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It counts your total playtime before you win and it counts like the time of your run basically.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So at the end it displays a little like a little like in-game timer.

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So, you know, it's built for speedrunning.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I was yesterday, just yesterday I was agonizing over like,

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
should I make, should I make pausing the game stop the timer or should I make pausing the game?

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In the end I decided to, in the end I decided to make pausing the game not stop the timer

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
because it just seems like cheating.

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's on the one hand it seems like cheating and like if you pause the game,

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't see why it should be like, oh well this time doesn't count because it's like a short game.

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
On the other hand there was sort of a strat.

227
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is all stupid.

228
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is all like assuming that anyone cares to speedrun the game which would be nice but like,

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
why would I assume that they would?

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But if they did, there was an advanced strat where you could pause the game right at the end of an attack

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and then the attack would complete and then you would, you know, with the game pause.

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So you could actually like, you could turn the timer off while the attack was completing

233
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
in between like when one character's attack begins and the next attack, or one starts and the next one.

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh like the animation would continue?

235
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, basically you could use pause exploits to stop the in-game timer during like attack animations is what I'm trying to say.

236
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So does it not really pause?

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I decided to take that out because it does pause, it does not, pausing the game does not pause animations.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It only pauses like menu inputs basically.

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay.

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So it doesn't really do anything actually.

241
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I mean since it's a turn-based game, like, you know, you might as well just let the, well it opens the menu.

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It opens the menu and it lets you toggle, it gives you the, okay, one of the complaints that I had about the game the first time,

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the alpha, was that it was possible to get to a state where you had no more resources at all and you couldn't do anything.

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You could not attack, you could not pass the turn, you just had to sit and like look at it.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It was a soft lock basically.

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So in the menu I added an option to like if you get stuck you can just restart the run.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And also in the menu there is an option that you can toggle on and off called repeat cutscenes which is basically if you've been passed a section before,

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you can turn repeat cutscenes off and then it will skip the dialogue and it will just play the animations and just skip right,

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
right on speed mode, not the first time you see it, like the first time you see it you have to see the dialogue,

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
but like the second and further on times if you just want to like, because I imagine that probably there would be some people who were playing it

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
over and over again trying to beat it and they would get really sick of the dialogue.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So I was like okay I'll give them an option to just turn it off so they can just kind of like blast through it as fast as is reasonable.

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So that's really what the pause menu is for.

254
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You don't actually need to pause the game for any like practical reason.

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Uh yeah.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Video games.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Man, I don't know.

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I wonder, you know I was thinking the probably the biggest effort post I ever made before, well I guess the two biggest effort posts,

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
the first one would probably be Vapors Chapter 1.

261
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I worked on that for like six months.

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And then the Champion Chapter 1 was even bigger than that.

263
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I worked on that for almost a year maybe?

264
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Dang.

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't even remember.

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And I hope, I feel like after I've released the first Vapors I feel like that was like a big turning point for me where suddenly I had something,

267
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I had done something that I could point out and say like this is what I did.

268
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I did this thing.

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is like something I can sort of hang my hat on and build an identity around that I made this thing.

270
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And I guess I hope that having spent all this time and built Phantom's Revenge it will do something similar for me.

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It will be another feather in my cap so to speak and it will advance my career online in some meaningful way.

272
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know what way exactly but that's the hope I guess.

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I hope it's not all for the sake of like haha I made a silly game and it's funny that I did that.

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh well, never mind.

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You know what I'm saying?

276
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah, I don't know commercially how well something like that could do because of how niche it is.

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I don't think any of the time spent making like an art piece is necessarily wasted if people in your audience can like appreciate it.

278
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I guess it would be nice if like maybe just people who are into indie games like the indie gaming scene maybe noticed it

279
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
because it is one such thing of those types.

280
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I guess that's what I hope for is indie game people see it and they're like hey that's a game that a guy made and it's pretty cool.

281
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It would be pretty cool to be like you know you made your game and then oh what was this new Mathematosis video?

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh my god.

283
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That'd be neat, that'd be neat.

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think my instinct, I'm gonna make the beta version a little bit easier.

285
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The alpha version was really hard.

286
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I made some concessions to player ease to like in the alpha.

287
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think I need to make a few more.

288
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I think I need to make it even more lenient to make it like playable by human beings.

289
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Someone on Twitter asked me like will this version be playable by humans?

290
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, I don't need to demand perfection.

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I need to demand perfection from the player.

292
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I just want them to, I said this before, I just want the game to be, you can't beat it unless you know what you're doing.

293
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
As long as you need to, as long as to some extent you need to know what your strategy is for beating it

294
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and that's required to beat it, then like it's okay.

295
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's the threshold of difficulty that I'm looking for.

296
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There's like a couple types of games where like a game where you can be like really bad and still have fun

297
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
but if you want to be incredible and do like speedrun stuff, the world's your oyster

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and you can really super min-max your movement and stuff like that.

299
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Those work good in like 3D games where the amount of places you can be and it's like very wide

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but like moving around a character and just jumping a little bit, that's just generally fun.

301
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And then there's like games that you're making where like the skill floor is a little higher but not too high.

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I hope it won't be too high.

303
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't want it to be insanely high.

304
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't know games of this genre too well.

305
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's kind of like turn-based Final Fantasy-esque stuff, RPG thing.

306
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But Final Fantasy is extremely basic and you can just go grind out levels and be overpowered if you really need that.

307
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is more like a puzzle game it seems, or at least that's what I got from the previous version

308
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
where you need to figure out all of the different mechanics in order to figure out the puzzle of what to do.

309
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It is a bit of a puzzle presented as a JRPG menu-based battle.

310
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There's sort of a, I would say there are a couple different tricks you have to figure out.

311
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There's more than I think you would expect.

312
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I think the Alpha version, very few people were able to beat it.

313
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And those that did, all of them, I think all of them had a moment where they thought they figured it out.

314
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And then they were like, oh I got it, I get what I need to do.

315
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And then they did it, they were like, so here's what I'm going to do, here's the plan.

316
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And then they did it and they executed on it perfectly.

317
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And then they still lost and they were like, oh my god, I can't believe it.

318
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But then they figured out there was just another step to it that they had missed.

319
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So your sort of game is a higher skill floor.

320
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So the difference between people who can beat it and people who can beat it really well and quickly is not very big.

321
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So as long as the floor isn't too high, I think it'd be enjoyable.

322
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I kind of think of like a Phoenix Wright game as like a similar sort of puzzle where if you pay attention to the dialogue that's said in the game,

323
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
you configure almost everything out without guesswork and reloading saves.

324
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But if you are like, you don't put the pieces together, sometimes it's a little bullshit.

325
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But I've played through recently having not, like I kind of forgot the, it's been a year since I played them.

326
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I kind of forgot the solutions to puzzles.

327
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And I found that if I paid attention to what was being presented to me, I could figure out what the game like was hinting at.

328
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And I did figure out things and it felt really, really good to like combine that observation with the correct answer and do it every time.

329
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It was great.

330
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The difficulty, Phantom's Revenge, I wanted it to be not insanely difficult, but I wanted it to be somewhat difficult because like it's sort of like a narrative thing.

331
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Like the story of the game is that Phantom has gone somewhere to do something and what he's doing is dangerous and if he fucks up, he's going to die.

332
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And I want like you to feel that way as the player. You're like, I need to be careful and not fuck up or I will die and it will upset me.

333
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So it's like, it's like narrative coherence or whatever.

334
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I want, it's a Gazampt Kunstwerk is what I'm saying.

335
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's all the, all the, I want, yes, I want Ludo narrative harmony is what I'm saying. I'm a genius.

336
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Ludo narrative euphoria.

337
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes, yes.

338
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So that's why that's it's it's not it's not difficult just because I think games that are hard are fun are cool, even though I do think that it is.

339
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah, it is satisfying to successfully complete a puzzle that that, you know, where you I mean,

340
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I don't like things that are on like on on what's the word on figure out a ball you couldn't see it coming and you get yet to trial and error trial and error.

341
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's the worst thing I think in a video game is trial and error.

342
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh, well, that's the worst thing Ben saying is the worst thing.

343
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay, sorry.

344
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You will definitely have to lose a few times.

346
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Well, I mean, in Phantom's Revenge and figure out why you died to be like, hmm, what can I do differently?

347
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
There was a bit of that necessary, I think.

348
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That's that's okay.

349
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's okay.

350
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
If it's to folks for different folks, I guess it's it's it's a pet peeve of mine because it's it's not really that big a deal.

351
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's like, you know, uncharted.

352
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:27,000
A lot of a lot of where the enemies come from is like, they just pop into frame and they just you don't know exactly where is the safest place to be at any given time.

353
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And if you're found out of position on the wrong wave, it's kind of impossible to get to a safe place and win on that very hard difficulty.

354
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So it is a trial and error game.

355
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But but the part the things they do are like the same every time.

356
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So you can figure it out down.

357
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But I just I just don't like the trial.

358
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah.

359
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't like making errors.

360
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's cringe to.

361
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Okay.

362
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Okay.

363
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The alpha version was very much trial and error because you you had to like you had to get to you basically had to get to a room to find out what was in the room.

364
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And then by the time you got there, it would be too late to like figure out like, OK, how what am I going to do?

365
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
How am I going to respond to what's in the room?

366
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Like, what's my strategy here?

367
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You basically had to memorize the level layout and then like plan accordingly to be to be ready for the room when you got there.

368
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So to make it a little more forgiving, I changed it so that you no longer like now when you beat one room, you don't immediately go to the next one.

369
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You get to like you get to like prepare yourself to move on to the next room.

370
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And I also added a scout command that tells you what's in.

371
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Phantom does a little like peering animation.

372
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He's going like, huh, what?

373
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And it tells you like it tells you what's in the next room before you go there.

374
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So so the game is more like Dark Souls now and that in theory, you could beat it on your first try because you you can know what's ahead.

375
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If you are scrupulous about it.

376
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So I did.

377
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You're right.

378
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Your trial and error is OK in moderation, but there's such a thing as too much.

379
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So you cut down on it.

380
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I did make some accommodations.

381
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I think an acceptable amount of trial and error is like baby steps at the beginning where you're like, oh, I don't know what I'm doing and you're expected to make mistakes.

382
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But the consequences for those are not like start the whole game over.

383
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's it's just like you get hurt a bit and you could still recover and win from there.

384
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The the line for me is that in the in the alpha without those features, the trial and error was around like you would know a player would know what they wanted to do.

385
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But like they would they would know what they had to do, but they would get somewhere and then be like, well, it's already too late.

386
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I've already I've already not set up to do the thing that I want to do and like I have to just redo it.

387
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I wanted to make it so that like if you're being careful and like you you have to play it and you have to do trial and error until you understand like, OK, this is how I need to respond to this situation.

388
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And once you learn that, then you can as long as you know, OK, this situation is coming up so I know in advance what I need to do to respond to it.

389
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And in the game doesn't push you into it without time to prepare and then fuck you.

390
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You don't have to like have it fucking memorize.

391
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You don't need to have the whole game.

392
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't want you to need to have the whole game memorized.

393
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I just want you to understand how the game works and know how to respond to it when it does things.

394
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I don't want you to memorize what things it's going to do to you completely.

395
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
OK, I think that probably explains everything.

396
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's the sequelitis episode about Mega Man that Egoraptor did years ago.

397
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Which part?

398
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The part where they show you the things happening so you can understand.

399
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Oh, when you get these enemies do this pattern and in a safe environment so you can observe that and when they're in a more dangerous environment, you know what to do.

400
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That's the sort of building up.

401
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
If you're paying attention, you can anticipate what to do when a thing happens.

402
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And so you would have an enemy that's like, oh, it's a Gribbly grab and you have to step on those guys.

403
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You have to stomp on them and that's how you get them.

404
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then there's a big Gribbly grab and it's like, oh shit, well it looks the same.

405
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Maybe if I step on it with this big hammer thing.

406
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You got to use the giant foot power up to step on that guy.

407
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So it's like you can deduce what to do even though you've never seen it before.

408
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, basically.

409
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,000
When I envisioned Phantom's Revenge, I describe it as I had a vision.

410
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And when I mean a vision, I literally in my mind, I saw the picture.

411
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Like this is what the game looks like.

412
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And then I made it look exactly like that and I'm like, yes, this is my vision.

413
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I hope that it is also fun as a game, as a designed game in addition to looking the way that I wanted it to look.

414
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I mean it was conceptualized as an image first and a game second.

415
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But I think I made it work, I hope.

416
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
LeMau.

417
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Based.

418
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Based.

419
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Based.

420
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Based to have like a moment because I think lots of artists have moments where they're like, oh, that would be perfect.

421
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, I got to make it?

422
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh, fuck that.

423
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And it's too hard.

424
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah.

425
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And you made it.

426
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, I sort of had to figure out like what the game was, like what the challenge of it was.

427
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:15,000
There were a bunch of different ideas I had for what it could be and what the story could be and what the enemy types could be.

428
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And I eventually settled on a fairly simple version of it that was like, okay, this is enough for me to execute on the idea.

429
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I mean, there's, I think I decided to just simplify it and make it like, okay, kind of the minimum amount of like different enemy types and whatever for like a quick narrative experience.

430
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Like a condensed, a densely packed, relatively short game.

431
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I didn't want to like overcomplicate it or anything.

432
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I was, there's only like, there's only like a few enemy types.

433
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
There's like five or six different enemy types and some of them are like unique.

434
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You only encounter them once.

435
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So there's only three regular enemy types.

436
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But it's like the way you deal with like different configurations of them is the strategy part.

437
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I'm very excited.

438
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Game's going to be, game's basically done.

439
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Game's going to be done like tomorrow.

440
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But it will be done.

441
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It will, it will, it will most assuredly be out when you're listening to this.

442
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I will definitely stream myself playing it when I have access to the author.

443
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh my God.

444
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
That would be super epic.

445
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Spoilers, spoilers though.

446
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Oh, spoilers for anyone.

447
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yeah, that will, you know what I mean?

448
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
All the cutscenes that I was planning on putting in the game are in it.

449
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
All like the boss encounters are in it.

450
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
All the sprite work is more or less final.

451
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
So yeah, it is a, it's basically, the beta version is basically the full game.

452
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So complete spoilers.

453
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh yeah.

454
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'll wait, I think, until the alpha.

455
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
When do you think the alpha will be out?

456
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh, that's hard to say.

457
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I would like to get it out in the next like month or so.

458
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Okay, so it's a longer process.

459
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But it will depend on how, it will depend on how many bugs people find and how bad they are.

460
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like I don't know exactly what's going to be, what it's going to take to fix it.

461
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm sure people will find bugs.

462
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I just don't know how catastrophic they'll be.

463
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So I don't know.

464
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
But hopefully not very long.

465
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I think, I would say, I would say you probably don't have to wait for the final version.

466
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Well, you could.

467
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm debating whether I think it would be, it would make more sense for you if you wanted to stream it to wait for the alpha or just stream the beta.

468
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It is the complete game, so you could do it.

469
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But do I want you to push the game before it's available for everyone?

470
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Or do I want you to push it while it's still a Patreon exclusive?

471
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Hmm, what's the financial move here?

472
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What would Ben, the card share, let me put on my churning hat.

473
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What would churner Ben say?

474
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Like a milk churner hat?

475
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't know.

476
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I would take the game and I would churn it.

477
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes, I'm going to churn it.

478
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That's what I'm going to do on social media.

479
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm just going to be Phantom's Revenge posting for a while until the full release and until that's all done.

480
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm going to be pushing it as hard as I can.

481
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's like I spent a year on it and I want, this is going to be my thing for a while, that I made a video game.

482
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I think it's fair. I think I've earned it.

483
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes.

484
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm not a comics guy anymore.

485
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Nah, fuck that.

486
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That shit doesn't even move.

487
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You see in these video games, they move.

488
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
They're better.

489
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah.

490
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Alright, enough about that.

491
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I guess people would want me to talk about the podcast situation.

492
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, sure.

493
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That was like we recorded the last episode before Nate had announced Talking Pirates.

494
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The same day he announced Talking Pirates and we were all a bit like, what, huh?

495
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yes, it was a bit, it was a little weird.

496
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It felt a little bad.

497
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It was weird.

498
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So basically Nate approached me earlier saying, we're clearly not interested in the podcast anymore.

499
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Shall we close the Patreon and all that?

500
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And I was like, it's true.

501
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We're not pushing to get the thing recorded.

502
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We're both tired of doing the podcast, I guess.

503
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
We're not gagging to do it as we once were.

504
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And so it made sense to close the Patreon and all that.

505
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And I didn't expect, it was his wording.

506
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I just didn't expect a one-piece review show to immediately come up with just Nate.

507
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
No.

508
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And I was a little sad and I went to DMs and I explained to him I was a little sad because it basically felt like

509
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I don't want to do a show with you specifically anymore.

510
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You got disappeared like that guy in that Stalin picture?

511
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yeah.

512
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And I want to make it clear that I don't really have a problem with Nate doing a show about one-piece review.

513
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
People have told me to do my own and then compete.

514
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I have no real interest in doing that anymore.

515
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So whatever.

516
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It was really just like, I was sad for personal friendship reasons because we'd been growing apart.

517
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And that's sort of indicative of us growing apart was Nate taking the podcast and just doing it by himself.

518
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And no hate towards him.

519
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm just a little somber about the whole thing.

520
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

521
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah.

522
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Well, I mean, he's not really around at all anymore.

523
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I mean, as far as I can see.

524
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So I get you.

525
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I think it's it's part of it's it's definitely part of a larger trend where he is gone.

526
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yes.

527
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So I guess that was all I really needed to say about it.

528
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Just in case people were curious about my thoughts.

529
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's it.

530
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't mind if you watch it.

531
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It sounded like it's some of the people in my discord were talking about it and it sounded like.

532
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I mean, it seems like it's more it's not he calls it a show.

533
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He calls it talking pirates like it's a show, but it's just him on stream on like his regular streams just talking about one piece.

534
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Right.

535
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That's what it sounded like.

536
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I haven't seen it.

537
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know.

538
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Well, I haven't seen it either.

539
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So I don't know.

540
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'll never I'll never get to be I'll never guess on the podcast.

541
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Like I said, I would.

542
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yes.

543
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Time has made a liar of me.

544
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It'll it'll if if if the podcast I don't think the name I think it's it's gone unsaid.

545
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But I think the idea is that the podcast was the show that me and Nate did.

546
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
If I were to do my own pirate talking one piece review show, I'd have to call it.

547
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Pirates talking.

548
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It would be the opposite of talking pirates.

549
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Pirates speaking spoken word on on all hands on deck for the new episode of one piece manga review.

550
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I am having a brain blast.

551
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
OK.

552
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
A a like government pirate is a corsair.

553
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So what if it was like Corsair's Discoursing or like Discourser?

554
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Discourser's got an opinion.

555
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

556
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I don't know.

557
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I it's a little bit erudite.

558
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I think not everybody knows what a corsair is.

559
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But maybe it's OK.

560
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's a high brow.

561
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Oh, I haven't.

562
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I learned that from school.

563
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
What's that?

564
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
OK.

565
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Well, that's an idea.

566
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You can have that for free if you want it.

567
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah.

568
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Wasn't there a Starcraft unit called the Corsair?

569
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I don't know.

570
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I think there might have been a Protoss unit called the Corsair.

571
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And I think that might be where I actually learned the word.

572
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Protoss?

573
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Wait, I got I got I got.

574
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh, I thought you said Star Trek.

575
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
No.

576
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No.

577
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
My god.

578
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I can't believe all things that have star in the name are the same.

579
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yes.

580
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's the it's the it's that one.

581
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's that one ship.

582
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm not even going to show it because it doesn't matter.

583
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But yes, there is a core a Protoss ship called the Corsair.

584
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So there you go.

585
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I was right.

586
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah.

587
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Like a rebrand.

588
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
All right.

589
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Like like a like a CP9 agent.

590
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
A world government now.

591
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The government discusses those damn dirty pirates.

592
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The government discusses.

593
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It'll be like a boardroom meeting with all the the the admirals and vice admirals

594
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and be like, what are we going to do about this damn dirty monkey D Luffy?

595
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
What has he been up to this week?

596
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Let's read the latest chapter one piece to find out.

597
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
How about you call it like dispatches from Marine HQ or something?

598
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Really, the possibilities are endless.

599
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Something must come.

600
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Something must be very compelling to me about like an in universe review show, like a like

601
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
a like a review that takes place inside the world of the work that it's reviewing, because

602
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that's what TBAP was.

603
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And now I'm I'm envisioning like, what if you reviewed one piece, but you did it?

604
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah, but you did it as like a you pretend you're a Marine general being like, ah, these

605
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
fucking ah, this this worse generation is making such a ruckus for me on the fucking on

606
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
in my island in the grand line is making my job so hard.

607
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I don't know.

608
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That would be pretty funny.

609
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I guess that sort of thing is my jam.

610
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Initially, we were talking about the thing of the show and like what visually to put on

611
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
there.

612
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And I just thought it's like, what if we had like a little intro where the seagull drops

613
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
the latest chapter as like the newspaper and we're on the ship and we're reading it.

614
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
That's that's like the the intro for the anime.

615
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Right.

616
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's like the little seagull drops the newspaper.

617
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Am I crazy?

618
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I don't think not the same.

619
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Not every time.

620
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I think it's just a thing that happens on some episodes.

621
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We're like, oh, our bounties have increased and the seagull is always delivering the mail.

622
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, OK.

623
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So we would have that as like our.

624
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Oh, like let's see what's happened.

625
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But we didn't like in any way think like talk about it in character.

626
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It's funny.

627
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's a good idea.

628
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's a good idea.

629
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's like it's dropping the new chapter.

630
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah, basically.

631
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah.

632
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That's very cute.

633
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I like that sort of thing.

634
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Well, that's that.

635
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
No, dad, that's that's what happened.

636
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Man.

637
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yeah, cool.

638
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That's it.

639
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That's all I got.

640
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Because I haven't done anything except work on my fucking game this month.

641
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I have no.

642
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I've been mostly working on my secret project as well.

643
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
They paid my taxes with my new credit card and I'm going to get I'm going to get the

644
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
sign up bonus.

645
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm a third of the way towards getting a sign up bonus.

646
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Haha, churning American Express Blue Business Cash is the new one.

647
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Pretty epic.

648
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't care.

649
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
OK.

650
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Nice.

651
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah.

652
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah.

653
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah.

654
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

655
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah.

656
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Yeah.

657
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, let's let's talk about Christmas because it's almost going to be that time.

658
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Oh, right.

659
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It's Thanksgiving.

660
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Wait.

661
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's Christmas Eve.

662
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Okay.

663
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah.

664
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I mean, you're supposed to be thankful.

665
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's like, oh, thanks for the gift, everybody.

666
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
My my brain.

667
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I thought like, oh, it's the day before Thanksgiving before Christmas.

668
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And then and my brain transformed that into the holiday before Christmas.

669
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And I was like, oh, yeah, Thanksgiving.

670
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's Thanksgiving.

671
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah.

672
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So I'm doing a little over it over at the Munchie and Kazi's house.

673
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
They're doing a little gift gift swap secret Santa thing with some people and I bought

674
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
a gift for that.

675
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm going to that's what I have to do today.

676
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
That's the reason why the game will probably not be out Sunday.

677
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It'll probably be out Monday instead.

678
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You can blame them.

679
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And then and then my parents are going to pick me up on the Christmas Eve.

680
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I think we're going to do a family thing.

681
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I think they're bringing a COVID test.

682
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm going to take like a COVID quick test before we go to that, which frankly makes

683
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
me very happy because I noticed I didn't realize this.

684
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But like this past week or two, COVID numbers are going crazy in Massachusetts anyway.

685
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I mean, I think everywhere, but like in Massachusetts, they're like getting like as bad as like they

686
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
ever were, which is bad.

687
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So I'm happy that everyone will be COVID testing before we do our stupid little family get

688
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
together, which I'm not even looking forward to.

689
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And frankly, if the COVID test was positive and I didn't have to go, I would say, well,

690
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
there's never been a better time to get the coronavirus.

691
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
At least I don't have to do this shit.

692
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But I guess we'll see.

693
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah, I got to take a COVID test today because we're going to see Grandma tomorrow.

694
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We're going to drive all the way over to where she is.

695
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
We're going to bring the dog in the car as well.

696
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Did I mention that like two weeks ago or so, I got my first COVID test?

697
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You did.

698
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah, they stuck the thing up my nose and it was very...

699
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah, we've got like self-test things.

700
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We have to do that yourself with a funny little thing on a stick.

701
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, really?

702
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And then you put it in a little...

703
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, I've done that a couple of times.

704
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I think it feels better when it's like in your own power.

705
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You can decide how hard or fast to do it because I do it very slowly and it's like...

706
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So I'm going to have to do it again for the...

707
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Okay, that's fine.

708
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It wasn't that bad.

709
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
No, I thought it might be really bad but it wasn't that bad.

710
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It's just because it's a place in your body that you've never scratched before because it's impossible to do that.

711
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Like deep in your nose, you can't scratch that.

712
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You can't swab that normally.

713
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's like nerves that have never ever felt the touch of another thing.

714
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What the hell is this?

715
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
This is a funny story.

716
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
This is a funny story.

717
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And I guess I'll tell it because like, fuck it, who cares?

718
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I dated a girl who was into sneezing as like a kink and she taught me how to make myself sneeze

719
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and it involves sticking something up your nose.

720
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So I kind of have experience sticking stuff up my nose.

721
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So like I think I'm probably more equipped to do a COVID self-test than most actually.

722
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
What about the sneezing?

723
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Was it like the volume of it?

724
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
What do you mean?

725
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Like what did she like about the sneezing?

726
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I think it was like the kind of like the build up and then like the release.

727
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Like it was like the build up and release.

728
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It wasn't like a snot thing.

729
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It wasn't like about that.

730
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
It was about the sneeze itself and I think it was about the build up and release of the sneeze.

731
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Like I can see the parallels there.

732
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

733
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It is kind of funny.

734
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It's not the weirdest.

735
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I've never known anyone else who was into that specifically.

736
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's very unusual, but it's not the weirdest kink I've ever heard of.

737
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Like I don't get it.

738
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
If I got it, I would have it and I don't.

739
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
But like I kind of see it.

740
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I understand the logic there.

741
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I think of like a loud big sneeze as like a shotgun blast, which is not sexy, but it is cool.

742
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:47,000
There's the least scary way to do it is you take a paper towel and you twist it until it sort of becomes like a soft spike.

743
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And then you kind of stick that up your nose and it takes some practice, but there's like one or two spots.

744
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
There are a couple of spots inside your nose where if you...

745
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Endspots?

746
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Like a G-spot, but an N-spot.

747
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Ew, gross.

748
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
There are a couple of places where if you touch it, it'll make you sneeze very quickly.

749
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
If you're really a pro like me, I guess, you can use a bobby pin or something like RIDGID.

750
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And you can stick it up there and like, you know...

751
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It doesn't have to really go that far up, but like it feels like it's going really far up.

752
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Don't try this at home.

753
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm not encouraging anyone to stick bobby pins up their nose or anything.

754
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
No, that sounds terrible.

755
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm just saying I have done it and kind of know how to do it in a way that is like not particularly uncomfortable.

756
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You're adept at like luck picking your nose.

757
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I learned.

758
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah, I learned.

759
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Lamal.

760
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I don't know.

761
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Man, that's just a thing.

762
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That's just life, I guess.

763
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Crazy shit.

764
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I sure hope the Omicron variant doesn't stop me from flying on January.

765
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Oh, I hope so too.

766
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Is the news...

767
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I was looking at the charts.

768
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Is the new spike because of Omicron?

769
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It's probably just because of the holidays, right?

770
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It's people seeing each other for the holidays.

771
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
People going out shopping and seeing each other again.

772
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
We had the same spike last year at like the same time.

773
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It's also colder, so like people be sneezing more.

774
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah.

775
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I am ashamed to admit that I have not yet signed up for a booster.

776
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I haven't either.

777
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I guess I should do that.

778
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I should have done it like a few weeks ago.

779
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I haven't done it yet.

780
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The other reason I got the vaccines earlier was because the NHS texted me and said,

781
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Alright, get your thing, here's a link.

782
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm like, okay, I don't want to do any work for this.

783
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Just tell me where to go and I'll do it.

784
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But now I got to sign up for the booster or else wait for them to tell me, which might take a while.

785
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah, they have not sent me any encouragement.

786
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I haven't gotten any message.

787
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
No, I got an email that was telling me boosters are available.

788
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I haven't gotten texts or anything.

789
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah, I should have done it a few weeks ago and now I feel very silly

790
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because now it's too late for me to get one before Christmas and see the family and stuff.

791
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So that's why I was relieved to hear that I guess we're all doing like at home COVID tests

792
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
before we do the get together, like, you know, good for them.

793
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Glad my family is okay about that stuff.

794
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Most of my family are not complete shit.

795
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's just good.

796
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yeah, I think there's only been so far one family member like a relative

797
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that has expressed doubt over the existence of COVID.

798
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Come on.

799
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
This was a while ago, but it was still like, come on.

800
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It was the argument was like, I just don't know anybody

801
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
and they were living in a part of the country that was very low emission, low transmission.

802
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
There wasn't a lot of people getting it over there.

803
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So she just didn't physically know anyone who had got it.

804
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And then we were there and we explained, oh, no, we had a friend whose whole family got it.

805
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And she was like, what?

806
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Oh, it wasn't even really that bad.

807
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It was just sort of like, yeah, okay, you're an idiot, though.

808
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

809
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It doesn't sound like the worst.

810
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I also, I mean, I don't know anyone in real life.

811
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I know people online who have had it or got it.

812
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I guess my dad, he tested positive for it, but then he had like no symptoms.

813
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So it may have been a false positive.

814
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
We're not really sure.

815
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So I'm not sure if that counts.

816
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Oh, man.

817
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Coronavirus, it's tricky.

818
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I heard some people saying that the Omicron variant, and I hope this is true.

819
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I kind of hope this is true, that the Omicron variant is more transmissible, but less severe, which would be kind of good.

820
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
If a less severe variant became the dominant strain.

821
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I think that would be good.

822
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's the thing people were talking about ages ago in like early 2020 where like virologists were like saying a virus survives best when its host does not die.

823
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So it will tend to become something more akin to a common cold or a flu, which is something that nobody really, people die from it still every year.

824
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
But like, it's not like the massive killer, the plague that we were dealing with earlier.

825
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So it might be doing that right now, like getting into a stage where it just is the sort of thing you would catch if you go outside and sneeze.

826
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:34,000
You'll be a bit poorly for a bit, and then you'll be getting better, but I don't know yet how far along that is.

827
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It still seems like as deadly enough as like the Delta.

828
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I haven't heard enough information.

829
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You know, the initial spike in cases carried with it like a big spike in deaths because like, you know, hospitals were overcrowded.

830
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You know, since then like cases spike and deaths, deaths increase with the spikes, but not like to the extent like big, big spike in Massachusetts lately, one of the biggest spikes ever over the last few weeks in cases.

831
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Deaths are up, but only like a little up.

832
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:26,000
They're up to like maybe like 25 a day, 30 a day from like, you know, whereas like back in the in the original, it was like, I think like, was it 1000s a day?

833
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
No, there's no way.

834
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
In a bussen?

835
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
No, no, he can't have been 1000s a day.

836
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
COVID cases.

837
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
No, I'm talking about Massachusetts specifically.

838
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Okay.

839
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Oh my God.

840
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I guess I'll just show it because it's a, so this, this, oh God, no, this is cases in Massachusetts over, over like the full pandemic.

841
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So as you see, cases are up.

842
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Cases, cases are looking good.

843
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
We're getting there.

844
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Is there, do you have a death thing?

845
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yes, yes, I do.

846
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Because deaths looks like this.

847
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
There you go.

848
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So, you know, you see very clearly the earlier strains of the virus were more deadly.

849
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Okay.

850
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So at the very, very height, we were doing like 100 plus a day in deaths.

851
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And now, you know, when they're, when they're, God, look around like July, man, around July, there were like no cases.

852
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
We have to go back.

853
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
We have to go back.

854
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah.

855
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But then, so, you know, deaths are up, but they're up to like 20 a day, not like, not like 100 a day.

856
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So, you know, I mean, it could be better, but it could be a lot worse too.

857
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And I guess it's, I guess it's the case of like treatments are getting more effective.

858
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I guess it's, I guess it's a combination of treatments getting more effective, but also probably the most vulnerable have already died off.

859
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Right.

860
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So that was the first wave.

861
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Then it was, and then hospitals are no longer as overcrowded.

862
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Hospitals are more prepared for it.

863
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Treatments are more effective.

864
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Maybe it's also the case that the virus is mutating and becoming less deadly in order to better propagate itself.

865
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Could be part of it.

866
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah, I think it's, it's likely, but I'm just spitball and just guessing.

867
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah.

868
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It makes sense in theory.

869
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Who really knows?

870
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah.

871
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:41,000
The only thing I'm really worried about is the hysteria and whether a lockdown will happen before I can fly over.

872
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I mean, you know, whatever, it's, it's like, maybe I get a COVID, maybe it's a little bad.

873
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I hope you don't get a COVID.

874
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I hope you don't give me a COVID.

875
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yes, but like on the only assumption that it's, I've got two doses of the vaccine already.

876
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I probably will be able to get a booster before I go.

877
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Likely not going to be a big deal if I get it.

878
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I just want to be able to fly.

879
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Just want to be able to fly.

880
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I just want to pump some CO2 into that atmosphere.

881
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That's all I'm really doing.

882
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
That's all I really want.

883
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yes.

884
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yes.

885
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Yes.

886
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Don't we all?

887
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah.

888
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I don't know.

889
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I hope I think we're on the same page about all this.

890
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I love the Corona virus.

891
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I love lockdowns.

892
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I love communism.

893
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I love Democrats.

894
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I love Kamala Harris.

895
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Man, I got there was a clip.

896
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
There was a clip on Twitter the other day that was so incredible.

897
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It was Charlemagne the God was interviewing Kamala Harris and Kamala and he asked her.

898
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
He asked her who's who's the president?

899
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Joe Biden or Joe Manchin?

900
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Do you know who Joe Manchin is?

901
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
He's a guy who's integral to something, I guess.

902
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
He is a Democrat.

903
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:24,000
He and Kirsten Sinema are the two Democrats that are basically ruining everything and voting against all of the progressive bills that we need every Democrat to vote for in order to pass.

904
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And these two people are like build back better bill, infrastructure bills, child tax credits.

905
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
No, I don't like it because the coal industry or something.

906
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Joe Manchin is the main guy.

907
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:48,000
He's the one Democrat who's just like, I'm just not going to vote for anything that the Democrats want.

908
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm just going to ruin everything because people are paying me to do that.

909
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So he's blocking all these bills.

910
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And Charlemagne the God asked Kamala Harris who's the president here?

911
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Joe Biden or Joe Manchin?

912
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And first there's like a weird thing where like an aide starts talking on the other end of the call.

913
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
They start pretending like Kamala can't hear him.

914
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
They're like, we're having difficulty hearing you.

915
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We're having difficulty, we're having technical difficulties.

916
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And then they finally get past that and he asked the question again and Kamala gets so mad.

917
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
She gets like flustered and like she starts pointing and she starts being like,

918
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
don't be talking like you're a Republican asking who the real president is.

919
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Which is just very funny and like just like pretended he asked a different question.

920
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Just like faked outrage and like, you know, because Republicans are like, election was faked, right?

921
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
From still the real president.

922
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So it's like, and like obviously that's not what he's saying.

923
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But she like worked herself into a fucking fury and was like questioning,

924
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
questioning whether Joe Biden is the president is what a Republican would say.

925
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You can't ask you what the fuck and I am in charge.

926
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
He is in charge and I am in charge.

927
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
She got like so, it was so embarrassing.

928
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Like I couldn't believe it.

929
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I love her though.

930
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I stan a girl boss.

931
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:24,000
First woman ever to wield presidential power while Joe Biden was anesthetized for a routine colonoscopy.

932
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Da, progress.

933
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The wheels of progress are turning.

934
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:36,000
The only thing I know about Kamala is that she's a cop and she has done bad cop things before.

935
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
She has a DA prosecutor.

936
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Put lots of people in jail for nonviolent marijuana offenses.

937
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And she laughs about it.

938
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Hee hee.

939
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Yes, and she cackles about it.

940
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
She makes jokes about it.

941
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Lovely woman.

942
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We do a little incarceration.

943
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
We do.

944
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

945
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
For real.

946
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:03,000
So, you know, that's politics, I guess.

947
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's looking good.

948
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It's looking good.

949
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
The future is looking bright.

950
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
No.

951
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Okay.

952
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

953
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

954
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
How dare you?

955
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That was a lie.

956
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
How dare you, Ben Sainte, have positivity?

957
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That was a bold-faced lie that I, like the mainstream media, decided to propagate.

958
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I do love communism though.

959
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I do love Joe Biden's communism.

960
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I do love Kamala Harris' radical communist agenda.

961
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
That much we can all agree on.

962
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I got some money.

963
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I got some money because I applied for something called an economic injury disaster loan.

964
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Last year, I applied for it because I file my taxes as like a, because I'm an independent

965
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
contractor, so I file as like basically a one-man business that I am the only employee

966
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
of.

967
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That's how I file my taxes.

968
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So, and there was a thing called the economic injury disaster loan where if you are a business

969
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,000
and you have less than 10 employees, which I have one, so I do, and you live in a low-income

970
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
area, which technically, I looked at the map and technically, yes, I did last year, and

971
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I still technically do this year since I moved.

972
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But you could file for this thing called an economic injury disaster loan.

973
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And if you got approved for it, two things happened.

974
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
One, you immediately got something called an economic injury disaster loan, an EIDL,

975
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
targeted advance, and two, you were approved for the loan.

976
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And the targeted advance is just an extra loan that you don't have to pay back.

977
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So, I applied for this loan and I got approved for the loan and they were like, you're approved

978
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
for the loan.

979
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Here's some free money.

980
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You don't have to pay it back.

981
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Now, how much would you like to borrow on top of that?

982
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And I was like, none.

983
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Bye.

984
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Free shit.

985
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That was last year.

986
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And then this year, they sent me a reminder that like, hey, so you actually can, like,

987
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
you only applied for like the first part of it.

988
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
There's more.

989
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You can apply for like the rest of it.

990
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And I was like, oh, well, I guess I will.

991
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
They were like, just tell us, just give us like all your tax information, all the money

992
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
you made, give us a report month by month because there's a criteria for it.

993
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
This is funny.

994
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
There's a criteria for qualifying for this.

995
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
During a certain period, it could be any like three month period in 2020 versus 2021,

996
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
you had to have made a certain amount less this year than you did last year.

997
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Or no, it was 2019 versus 2020.

998
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And this is, this is great.

999
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
The way it worked out is because I did, I reported my income exactly as, as it happened.

1000
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Right.

1001
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I didn't like, I didn't have to like, do any like creative accounting or anything.

1002
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I just reported the facts exactly as they were.

1003
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:24,000
But because in 2019, I ran the Vapors to Kickstarter, which made, you know, $12,000.

1004
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:31,000
That one month, I made way more than I made like the next year, that same period.

1005
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So because yes, there was a period during, during 2019 where I made significantly more

1006
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
money than I made during the same period in 2020, I then qualified for the second round

1007
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
of EIDL.

1008
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And they were like, yeah, you're qualified.

1009
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
You live in a low income area and your income went down according to our metrics.

1010
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Here's some more free money.

1011
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Here's another targeted advance.

1012
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Would you like to borrow money this time?

1013
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
No.

1014
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Okay.

1015
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Well, go, go with God.

1016
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So I guess I should say thanks to everyone who donated to that Kickstarter because it

1017
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
made me money again from the government.

1018
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So pretty, pretty cool, pretty cool.

1019
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I thought it was funny.

1020
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I thought it was funny that that worked out very well for me and I'm very happy.

1021
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I feel, I feel blessed.

1022
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I feel privileged.

1023
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I got really lucky.

1024
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yeah.

1025
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It's pretty cool.

1026
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Pretty cool and shit like that happens.

1027
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Yeah.

1028
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Unfortunately, my Lord of Ghost Kickstarter was in 2020.

1029
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
So I, if there was a similar thing I could do, it would not work.

1030
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah.

1031
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I made a lot more money in 2020 than I did in 2019 because of that Kickstarter.

1032
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I, because of things like that, I made, I made more, I overall made.

1033
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Wait a minute.

1034
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Am I, am I stupid?

1035
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Did this, did Lord of Ghost happen this year?

1036
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
What do you mean?

1037
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
2021.

1038
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I think it did.

1039
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yes.

1040
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Okay.

1041
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Law.

1042
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Law.

1043
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
2020 and 2021 are the same year.

1044
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
There's no difference.

1045
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Yeah.

1046
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Yeah.

1047
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
They blend into each other.

1048
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Wait.

1049
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Fuck.

1050
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Fuck.

1051
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
What was it?

1052
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
What was I saying?

1053
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Money.

1054
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Money.

1055
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Yes.

1056
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
No, no.

1057
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I have, I have like an actual point to make.

1058
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh, no.

1059
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Kickstarter.

1060
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Kickstarter.

1061
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Oh, okay.

1062
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Oh, I overall, I overall made more money in 2021 than I did in 2020, despite that weird

1063
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,000
work where like one month I made a lot more money in 2020 or 2019 because of the, whatever.

1064
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I made, I made more in 2021 and I, and I made more in 2021 than I expect to make in 2022.

1065
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
So I mentioned, I mentioned the other day.

1066
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I mentioned on the last episode that I had a secret secret project and again, I'm still

1067
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
not going to say what my secret secret project is, but I tease it on Twitter the other day.

1068
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I added, I added Trixie and I said, I am going to humiliate Trixie and I'm going to make a

1069
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
bunch of money doing it.

1070
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And there's nothing she can do to stop me.

1071
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That, that is, that is, is a, is a tease.

1072
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
That's a tease for the secret project, which I will announce in the new year.

1073
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And the reason I'm waiting to announce it in the new year is because I don't want to

1074
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
make that money this year because I want to wait until 2022 because I think it will be

1075
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:45,000
taxed less on it because I don't think I'm going to make as much money in 2022 as I made in 2021.

1076
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
So that's why I'm waiting to announce it.

1077
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Otherwise I would announce it right away, but it's going to be funny.

1078
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It's going to be funny.

1079
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Ben's got a rap career.

1080
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Ben's going to rap.

1081
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Oh, it's, it's, it's the diss track, the diss track theory.

1082
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
By the time this comes out, it will be what five days away from New Year's.

1083
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So it will be like, I don't know.

1084
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I'll let, I'll let people speculate.

1085
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I don't care.

1086
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I don't care.

1087
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
It's fine.

1088
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Got the time between Christmas and New Year's is kind of magical.

1089
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I don't know what it is.

1090
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
There's nothing like special going on.

1091
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
It's just sort of like the, the, the big like stress is getting things ready for Christmas.

1092
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Everything's ready for New Year's is really just, I don't know, buy some more alcohol,

1093
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
like get ready to drink some more.

1094
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And you just sort of hang out for a few days.

1095
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
It feels, feels good.

1096
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I can't wait.

1097
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I can't wait for after Christmas and before New Year's and then New Year's.

1098
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I love New Year's.

1099
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It's the best holiday of the year.

1100
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I have to wait the longest amount of time before it can happen.

1101
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I guess it will be a, I guess it will be like five days where I just don't have to do anything.

1102
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I guess I hope that I will be using it to crank out some, some slime and punishment phantoms revenge work on the route to the alpha release.

1103
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
There's too many projects.

1104
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
There's too many things.

1105
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm, I have, I have worked so hard this month.

1106
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I have done, I have been more productive this month than I have in forever.

1107
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And it's because I was shooting for that December, December 19th launch date.

1108
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And I think I want to just keep on a roll with it.

1109
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Like I want to, I don't, I like, I don't want to take a break.

1110
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I don't want to wait any longer.

1111
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I just want to keep cranking it out when, when, when the alpha, after the beta release comes out,

1112
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
start drawing the rest of the comic, get it done like fast.

1113
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Don't want to fucking drag this shit out any longer than I have to.

1114
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Uh, I'm like, I'm like accustomed to having my nose to the grindstone now.

1115
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So like, might as well just, might as well just stick with it.

1116
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
You know?

1117
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah.

1118
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I, the, I've also been working hard on the secret project, but I've tried to like,

1119
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
occasionally jump into like getting some more of the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter stuff done as well.

1120
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
That's so close now.

1121
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I mentioned on Twitter a little while ago that I was, I was stressing out.

1122
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I was freaking out out over typography and fonts and how I need the right font.

1123
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Cause all I'm doing right now is just making the thank you backers Kickstarter backers page.

1124
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Then I can set it to print.

1125
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's hard.

1126
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Can I ask like specifically what is, is it just the typography for the backers page?

1127
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It's, um, yeah, I've done like, there's like three pages.

1128
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
There's the intro page where it's like, Hey, my name is Gibb and take this is my comic.

1129
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And here's a little backstory.

1130
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Um, there's that.

1131
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
That's done.

1132
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I think I've written that in a way that's like not stupid and it feels sort of professional,

1133
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
but isn't like too professional.

1134
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So I feel like it's just, it's just informational.

1135
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
You know, I gave just a quick note.

1136
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I made a similar thing.

1137
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I added a, uh, an option in the main menu of Phantom's revenge that just says, what is this?

1138
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And when you click it, it just gives you a little like, like, like backstory lore readout of like this.

1139
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
What, like, what is this game's deal?

1140
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
What is, what is this relevant to?

1141
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Well, it's a comic and then the comic is about a game and there's a rough character from a YouTube show and blah, blah, blah, blah.

1142
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Just like someone who's never seen it before.

1143
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
If they picked it up, they could read that and be like, Oh, okay.

1144
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
That's what this is.

1145
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I think you should hide that inside like an about thing that seems like just sort of generic information.

1146
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Cause if, if, if a player, if a player who doesn't know what it is, it's like, I wonder what this is.

1147
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And there's like, what is this?

1148
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
They click that and then they learn all this stuff.

1149
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
All at once.

1150
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
They're like, Oh God, maybe I shouldn't play this.

1151
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:31,000
You don't want them, you don't want them to ever think that they should, they should be, be able to easily ignore that menu option and think it's nothing special.

1152
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I feel like once they're looking at it, they're, they're gonna, they're gonna click play.

1153
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Yeah.

1154
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I think so.

1155
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Hopefully.

1156
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Yeah.

1157
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Once, once they're there, I've got them.

1158
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I've hooked them.

1159
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I think, I think, I hope.

1160
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Anyway, was I saying something tight?

1161
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
You were saying about the typography and which, which things you needed for.

1162
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Oh yeah.

1163
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And then there was the, there's just a page saying this is the ghost story section.

1164
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I've done that.

1165
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
That looks pretty nice.

1166
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So it's all of the people, all of their links.

1167
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And then there's just the, the backers page.

1168
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I think I fucked myself with this because in the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter thing, the page says, with all the tears, your, the font of your name in the back of the book will be larger than the previous tier.

1169
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And I thought that was funny.

1170
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
But, but actually going to do it, I'm like, oh God, this is a nightmare.

1171
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It's a mess.

1172
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Of, of formatting.

1173
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I have to, I have to decide whether to like, how big they get.

1174
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:49,000
What is the smallest font that is like, and I don't want people to feel like being in the back of the book is like, oh, those are the little losers with a tiny name.

1175
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
No, they should feel like that.

1176
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
They didn't pledge more.

1177
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I mean, yeah, but I also, it's a balancing act.

1178
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It's also like, I'm not sure whether to separate them by tier and then do them alphabetically within the tier, or to just have all the names alphabetically.

1179
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And then sometimes the name is really big or like medium size or small, depending on their pledge tier.

1180
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I would, and that would be really weird to read.

1181
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I, yeah, I think probably separating them by size is a lot simpler.

1182
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah.

1183
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Cause then you just have blocks.

1184
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I, yeah.

1185
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
But then it's like, there's not an equal number.

1186
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Like the blocks aren't even size.

1187
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
There'll be like three tier levels.

1188
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And then the fourth one covers the entire rest of the page.

1189
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Then I have to go to another page and it's like, oh God.

1190
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And then I, I want the fonts to be good.

1191
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I don't want to have to use different fonts for different groups of people.

1192
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I hate it.

1193
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I hate formatting this.

1194
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
The biggest mistake in the world.

1195
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Cause now this is the bottleneck and I, it hurts, it hurts my brain to look at it.

1196
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I see, I see.

1197
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I don't know.

1198
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Sucks, I guess.

1199
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I think I found an okay font.

1200
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,000
But I haven't known to spend a long, long time going over fonts, trying to find the perfect fonts.

1201
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Cause when you find that perfect font, it's like, ooh, that's the one.

1202
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Ah, that's just what I wanted.

1203
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
That's the exact tone I was going for.

1204
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I don't know what tone I'm going for.

1205
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,000
It's just sort of like, I want it to be visible so that people can read their name and not be like, what the fuck is this?

1206
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:41,000
And I also don't want them to be too thick so that I could fit more of them on one page to minimize the amount of pages I need to print.

1207
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Cause it's well over a hundred now, a hundred pages.

1208
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I gotta like, keep it as, keep it, I don't know, keep it not bad, keep it good.

1209
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I just want it to be good.

1210
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
You gotta keep it 100, you gotta keep it 100 pages.

1211
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,000
But then so many things will be deleted, all of the ghost stories will fall out.

1212
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Is it, is it more than a hundred pages?

1213
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah, with the ghost stories and the beginning and like the, the lot of ghosts itself is like 98, 95 pages.

1214
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Oh shit.

1215
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Sorry.

1216
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Fuck, sorry.

1217
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I barely slept last night.

1218
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Oh shit, it's longer than I, it's longer than I thought.

1219
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Yeah, it's big.

1220
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
You know, it's just so entertaining that it just flies by when you read it so.

1221
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
That's good.

1222
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Yeah.

1223
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I'm proud, I'm proud of my ghost story.

1224
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I really like it.

1225
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, it's a really good one.

1226
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
They're all really good.

1227
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
But yours is like.

1228
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I have not seen.

1229
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Refined Ben St. style.

1230
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Yeah, it was, it was a bit of an effort post.

1231
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I have not seen, I've seen some of Kaz's and I think that's it.

1232
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I don't think I've seen anybody else's.

1233
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
But I'm looking forward to it.

1234
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Wait, give me one second.

1235
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I need to grab a drink.

1236
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Back with my pure Aqua key lime flavored sparkling water beverage with other natural flavors.

1237
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Wow, so interesting.

1238
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Thanks.

1239
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
One of them from Aldi.

1240
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:21,000
One of the best tasting sparkling water beverages I've had, but probably one of the least pure.

1241
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Contains fucking bullshit like potassium benzoate, SSL fame, potassium and aspartame, which is a big cringe.

1242
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Because at least sweeten it with sucralose.

1243
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
You fucking hacks.

1244
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So I probably won't, I probably will not get these ones again, even though they're very tasty.

1245
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
The strawberry one is very good.

1246
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
It's okay.

1247
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
They're, they're, they're equally good alternatives.

1248
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah, so hopefully I can do my secret project and get the Lord of Ghost comics printed soon.

1249
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
It may roll over into January.

1250
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I'm not too worried about that.

1251
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It's kind of like everything's going to be stressful until February.

1252
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Because if I can go to America in January and see everyone, that means I won't have, I won't be able to do.

1253
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It's kind of like a deadline to get certain things done, like the Lord of Ghost's printed and maybe shipped.

1254
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And depending on how long that takes, I might have to wait until I'm back from going to America before I can do all that.

1255
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Which would be like suboptimal.

1256
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It would be not the best.

1257
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
It'd be, it'd be kind of cool.

1258
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,000
If I could bring like a bunch of the comics with me and the plushes.

1259
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And then like give them to people who like I can, who pledged and I can just give them to them in person if they're there.

1260
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Or I can give you a bunch to send off to people for cheaper mailing costs.

1261
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Yes, yes.

1262
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And that all depends on things being done before like the, like, I don't know, the second week of January.

1263
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So I don't have a lot of time to do all that and that's, it's, it feels like I can't relax even after Christmas, even after New Year's.

1264
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
But I guess it's not the biggest deal.

1265
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
There's always some shit to be doing.

1266
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Yeah, it's not the biggest deal.

1267
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Like if I come back at the end of January and I'm like, then I can do it.

1268
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I'll just do it.

1269
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It'll be fine.

1270
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:53,000
It would just be great to have like nothing hanging over my head or much less hanging over my head while I'm over there.

1271
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And for the New Year to be new projects, like pick up old projects, finish those or do new projects.

1272
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
No more Kickstarter.

1273
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I hate it.

1274
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Sucks.

1275
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It's a terrible idea.

1276
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Except it's fine.

1277
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
It's not even, I don't know.

1278
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I might do one again for like the Bail Jade book.

1279
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
You know, I don't know.

1280
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I have the, I felt the same way after I did like Vapors 1 and Vapors 2.

1281
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
They both took a really long time to actually get fulfilled.

1282
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It was a lot of work.

1283
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And for a long time I was still like, you know, doing envelopes, going to the post office.

1284
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I think I kind of just got used to it after a while and like stopped minding it.

1285
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And then like when I was doing, you know, people were buying Road to Radcon and shit.

1286
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And I kind of was like, hey, I kind of like this.

1287
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Like someone will just send me some money.

1288
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And then I just fill out an envelope, take it up, get a little stack of them, take them to the post office, just do a little errand.

1289
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And then I didn't really mind it so much.

1290
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And I think, I don't know, maybe it just, maybe it's become a part of me.

1291
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Maybe I did so many envelopes and trips to the post office that I've just, I've learned to love my chains.

1292
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I don't know.

1293
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
The bird has come to love its cage.

1294
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
It's a cool thing to be able to do.

1295
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And like, I'll be glad when it's over, I'm sure.

1296
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
But like, I don't think it's like something I hate.

1297
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It's just a bit stressful.

1298
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
The stressful part of it, you know what it is, you know what, it's actually not that.

1299
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:48,000
The difference is when it was the Kickstarter, I was like, oh my God, it's been months since I did the Kickstarter.

1300
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It's been so long.

1301
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I've kept everyone waiting and it's still not done.

1302
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And it's still not done.

1303
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
But with the Road to Radcon, it was just like, I have a thing.

1304
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
People can buy them whenever they want.

1305
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And then when they do, you know, maybe like a week later or two weeks later, I put it in the mail.

1306
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And it's not like an obligation, you know, after the initial round of people that did, you know, pay Kickstarter stuff and were entitled to.

1307
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,000
After that, like extra people buying them, it was not like a past obligation that I had to think about, like, oh, I promised this months and months and months ago.

1308
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It was like an extra thing where someone, it was like, you know, yeah, it was like that.

1309
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I didn't feel like a, I felt like I was already done and I didn't hang it over my head.

1310
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It was just like a new thing that was just sort of ongoing.

1311
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
So it felt different in that way.

1312
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
I don't know if there's any lesson to be learned from that.

1313
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I'm still going to do, I'm still going to do Kickstarter in the future.

1314
01:25:48,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Like I'm going to, when, when Slime and Punishment is done, next Kickstarter, maybe even soon, maybe even like early next year, depending on how fast I can get it sorted out.

1315
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Kickstarter for Slime and Punishment, book form.

1316
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
That's going to be, I'm pretty excited for that, actually.

1317
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
That's going to be sweet.

1318
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
That's going to be fucking epic.

1319
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah.

1320
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
That's right. I said epic.

1321
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I feel like I need to, to finish more projects before I can kickstart other things.

1322
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I still want to finish Clarissa.

1323
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I still want to finish the Lord of Ghosts because it needs an act three.

1324
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah.

1325
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Well, I mean, you haven't even finished fulfilling for your last Kickstarter.

1326
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
So yeah, I wouldn't be thinking about a new one just yet.

1327
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Oh no, no, but like, yeah, yeah.

1328
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
For whatever project I pick up next, it will be to finish something I already have going rather than to kickstart.

1329
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Like Bailjap.

1331
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Oh, that will be much later.

1332
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh, sure.

1333
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

1334
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It's been a while, it's been, yeah, it's been two years.

1335
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's been over two years for me since my last Kickstarter.

1336
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So I think I'm, I think I'm ripe.

1337
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I think I'm ripe for another one.

1338
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Has it been two years since Vapors 2?

1339
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Yeah, it was in like October of 2019.

1340
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
The fuck?

1341
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I know, I know, it's so fucked.

1342
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I'm old now.

1343
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I was young then and I'm old now.

1344
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's fucked up.

1345
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
How do people do things?

1346
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I don't get it.

1347
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
A lot of people do things?

1348
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
No, how do people do things?

1349
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Um, very carefully.

1350
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:39,000
You're about like, oh, I'm 20 and I'm doing things and I just did another thing and here I go doing more.

1351
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And you're like, oh, it's been like three years and I didn't notice.

1352
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Great.

1353
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
What kind of things?

1354
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I don't know.

1355
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I guess it's just sort of like a work ethic thing, maybe.

1356
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I like the focus a little bit to work so hard that I can get an entire comic done, actually done.

1357
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:18,000
And, you know, I feel like I can work really fast, but only in very short bursts and then I completely lose track of time and it's been a year.

1358
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And then I can like work really hard and in three months I can have like another comic.

1359
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I feel like, I don't know, it's so hard.

1360
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I always feel like, damn, I've done so little, right?

1361
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Every time I finish a project, I look back and like, wow, that took me like six months.

1362
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Wow, that took me a year.

1363
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Like, wow, I wasted all that time.

1364
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I could have done it so much faster.

1365
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And it's always true, but it's always like, yeah, well, but you know, at least I did something.

1366
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
It's not like I didn't do anything.

1367
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
It's really hard for me to gauge like, am I doing a lot with my time?

1368
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Am I doing not much with my time?

1369
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Am I wasting my time?

1370
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Am I using it well?

1371
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And it's like, I don't know.

1372
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I don't know.

1373
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I don't know how to...

1374
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
It's so hard to gauge that.

1375
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Because like who am I, what's the, am I comparing it against like the average other person?

1376
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I guess, I would be comparing it against myself.

1377
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Like the speed at which I did something and then the lack of doing anything is noticeable.

1378
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:48,000
If I could work at that speed for an entire year, I would have so much more done.

1379
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I generally not try not to think about it too much, but...

1380
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
If I had worked...

1381
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It does get to me.

1382
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Yeah, if I had worked at the rate that I am working on it now.

1383
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Phantom's Revenge would probably have been...

1384
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I would say it would have taken about half the time, maybe even.

1385
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I mean, it's hard to say.

1386
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Maybe definitely six months or less.

1387
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I probably could have done it in half the time.

1388
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
But you know, I was doing other stuff too.

1389
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I was not solely focused on it for the whole year.

1390
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So in hindsight, like should I have focused on it?

1391
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Was the other stuff I was also doing worth the extra time?

1392
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I don't know.

1393
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Maybe.

1394
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Who knows?

1395
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It's just, it's impossible.

1396
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
It's an impossible question.

1397
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Damn, I feel like I was gonna maybe say something else about that, but maybe not.

1398
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Maybe I was just gonna repeat myself again.

1399
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Yeah, I don't know if there's much to say.

1400
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
It's just sort of like art, creativity, careers.

1401
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I'm doing stuff.

1402
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I'm very excited for Slime and Punishment Kickstarter.

1403
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Super excited for that.

1404
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Cannot wait to be able to do that.

1405
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I cannot wait for having a completed Kickstarter that didn't fail.

1406
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Oh, sure.

1407
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Yeah, true.

1408
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Hey, remember Plebe and the Weeb?

1409
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Nope.

1410
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Who's that?

1411
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Hey, what ever happened to those Blu-rays?

1412
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
They were bad.

1413
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
What ever happened to all that money people paid for those Blu-rays?

1414
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Like the discs and then didn't do anything with them.

1415
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Oh, that's crazy.

1416
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
That's crazy.

1417
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
That's funny.

1418
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
That's great.

1419
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
That's just, I get weird.

1420
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I guess sometimes things like that just happen and nobody is responsible for it.

1421
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Sometimes just God just does things like that and makes it happen.

1422
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Oh, people are responsible.

1423
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
The people who pledged for it are responsible for not making it happen.

1424
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Right.

1425
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:18,000
If they really wanted those Blu-rays that they paid money for, they would have additionally secured a Blu-ray burner

1426
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:28,000
and made the ISO file for the Blu-ray and got done all the work to package it

1427
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
and done all the work for fulfilling those orders.

1428
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Just for instance.

1429
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
If the backers had really wanted it, they would have done that.

1430
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
But unfortunately, they didn't.

1431
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
So the person they gave money to is just, their hands are tied.

1432
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
They just, what are they supposed to do?

1433
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
What are they supposed to do?

1434
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Just pull themselves up by their bootstraps and buy a Blu-ray burner?

1435
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Gib, don't be ridiculous.

1436
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Do you remember, did you see that?

1437
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Did you see that she actually said that?

1438
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
She literally said, this is a direct quote.

1439
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
The bootstraps?

1440
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Yes, direct quote.

1441
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
What am I supposed to do?

1442
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Just pick myself up by my bootstraps and buy a Blu-ray burner?

1443
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
With what money?

1444
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
The money they gave me to do that?

1445
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Are you joking?

1446
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Unreal.

1447
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
No, it was that.

1448
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
I mean, it's already bad.

1449
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
That's what she said.

1450
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
But to say it like that.

1451
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Totally insane.

1452
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Totally.

1453
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
What did they expect me to do?

1454
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Have money when they gave me it?

1455
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Separated from reality.

1456
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Excuses so deep in cope that they just like circle around

1457
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:50,000
and become a black hole singularity, sucking everything else inside of them.

1458
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Cope so deep that information cannot even escape from its gravitational pull.

1459
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
All information is destroyed when passing through.

1460
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And the only thing that emanates out is black body radiation.

1461
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Pure noise.

1462
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
No signal.

1463
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
All right.

1464
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
That's fun.

1465
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
As always, the Blu-ray, the plea for the wee Blu-rays.

1466
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Very funny.

1467
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Very funny.

1468
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Duh.

1469
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Anyway, what was I talking about before I got on that?

1470
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Kickstarter.

1471
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Oh, Slime and Punishment Kickstarter.

1472
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Yeah, it's going to be good.

1473
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
That's it.

1474
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Yeah.

1475
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Oh, I'm going to have to shop around for like book.

1476
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I'm going to have to find like a book binding service, like a book.

1477
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
You know, maybe I could even now be like sending off orders for like sample books.

1478
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Just like, hey, guy, send me like a sample book just so I can see like what the binding will look like and stuff.

1479
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I should be, I actually did, I did a while ago do like page.

1480
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Like I took all the panels and I organized them into pages.

1481
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Like for eventual print.

1482
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:17,000
You know, I've made more, I made more pages after that, but I do have like a large section of the book arranged into pages to be eventually printed.

1483
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
So some of the work is done already.

1484
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Because I knew I knew I would do it eventually.

1485
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And the time is, the time is nearing.

1486
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
The time is close at hand.

1487
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Oh, yeah.

1488
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Well, hey, we've been going for about what, like two hours now?

1489
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Oh, yeah, hour and a half.

1490
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I kind of want to get going fairly soon.

1491
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
So what do you think about starting voicemails?

1492
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That's fine.

1493
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Yep.

1494
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Okay, cool.

1495
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Yeah, let's fucking get on with it.

1496
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Let's get on with it then.

1497
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
How many pages do we have?

1498
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
What's the other area?

1499
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Yeah, they're kind of a, not a huge amount, but like a kind of medium high amount.

1500
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
So let's try to bang them out.

1501
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
So I see the first one is from Janess.

1502
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
All right, three, two, one, go.

1503
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Happy six year anniversary, PCP.

1504
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I've been enjoying listening to your show weekly since early 2018.

1505
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Thank you guys so much for spending a few hours each week entertaining your audience.

1506
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
You guys are a symbol for me that I need to live up to.

1507
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Aw, shucks.

1508
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Has it really been six years?

1509
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
This show?

1510
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,000
We've, this is, we're almost at episode 200 or 300.

1511
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:47,000
It's wacky because like the pony that MLP has been like, it's over a decade since that began.

1512
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
No.

1513
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
It started in 2010.

1514
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
No, you're kidding.

1515
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yeah.

1516
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
No fucking way.

1517
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And I think I got into it in 2012.

1518
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
So it's like nine years since that.

1519
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Ancient, ancient fucking history.

1520
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So I say, I guess six years.

1521
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And here, and here I am still making my fucking brony game.

1522
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Hell yeah.

1523
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Some things never change.

1524
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Well, thank you.

1525
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Okay.

1526
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Next one is called Sports Manga.

1527
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Three, two, one, go.

1528
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Hello Ben, Gibb, and possibly others.

1529
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
How you doing?

1530
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Great.

1531
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
All right.

1532
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Y'all should read them on this, One Outs and Blue Lock.

1533
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
One Outs and Blue Lock?

1534
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Never heard of them.

1535
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
My favorite sports manga is Ice Shield 21.

1536
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
You heard of that?

1537
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I have read a lot of it.

1538
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah.

1539
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I said last episode, and I will reiterate that I do think American gridiron football is the coolest professional team sport.

1540
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I think it's cooler than Euro football.

1541
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I think it's cool.

1542
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It's way cooler than baseball.

1543
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Fuck baseball.

1544
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It's cooler than basketball.

1545
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It's pretty neat.

1546
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And it made for a good manga.

1547
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Ice Shield 21 is a cool manga.

1548
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I like it.

1549
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Yes.

1550
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It's very good.

1551
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Yeah.

1552
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Next one is called One Outs, and the one after it is called Blue Lock.

1553
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So it's probably the same guy.

1554
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Okay.

1555
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
One Outs.

1556
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Three, two, one, go.

1557
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Ben is a psychological baseball battle manga akin to Death Note, with a tagline, Nobody Wins But I.

1558
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
It features matches with pulsating plays and stellar schemes, playing both of the game and the player's psyche,

1559
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
home by Toshikitoa, our gambling-addicted ace pitcher.

1560
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Whoa.

1561
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Who, in every chapter, strikes out every team he pitches, stacking millions of yen during his off-season debut games.

1562
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:06,000
And that's only after using the Japanese's propensity for excitation to scam a rookie batter out of a couple hundred bucks American, by the way,

1563
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
during a 1v1 pitcher versus batter game.

1564
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
It only gets better from there.

1565
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Check it out.

1566
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Okay.

1567
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I could see how that would be cool.

1568
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
That sounds pretty good, actually.

1569
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Art.

1570
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
All right.

1571
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Next one is Blue Lock.

1572
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Three, two, one, go.

1573
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Blue Lock, Gibb, is a psychological soccer survival game manga.

1574
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:37,000
It is about the Japanese Football Association funding an eccentric football scientist to create the ultimate player.

1575
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So he makes a facility that is a coloring game to weed down 150 applicants to a single striker for the Japanese under-19 team.

1576
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I think just read the mini-battery royale basically in the first three or four chapters with the lost person to touch a ball after two minutes, gets kicked out,

1577
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
and he can never join the Japanese national team ever.

1578
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
The same penalty anyone who gets eliminated will face.

1579
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
The cast is great, and the art is gorgeous.

1580
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Boichi Murata, gorgeous.

1581
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Sunken Rock, Dr. Stone, Ice Shield 21, One Punch Man, gorgeous.

1582
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
It's great.

1583
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Check it out.

1584
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Same artist.

1585
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I think one-out sounds cool, Air.

1586
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1587
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It's hard for me to think of a sports manga and be like, oh, that sounds fun, because I don't like sports, but usually they are pretty good.

1588
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It's just a shonen thing, but with points that are normal instead of killing people.

1589
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I think Ice Shield 21 is probably the sports manga I've read the most.

1590
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:53,000
It might be the only one that I've read a significant amount of.

1591
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I should go back and finish it.

1592
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I never finished it.

1593
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Okay, next one is called One Lock.

1594
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Three, two, one, go.

1595
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Also, both manga have anime.

1596
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,000
The one-out anime only covers about 8 volumes of the 20 volumes of the manga, and it only came out in 2008.

1597
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
The Blue Lock anime, on the other hand, is only coming out in 2022.

1598
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
The manga is still running.

1599
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
One-out is completed, and the off-roar and the one-on-concorted Myers game, which is also great.

1600
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Blue Lock is at 154 chapters, so it'll at best cover 24 chapters.

1601
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
If it's only 12 episodes.

1602
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Sorry I sent you a little once, by the way.

1603
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
It was Sunday night when I started playing the latest podcast episode.

1604
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Senso Sensei saying Sayonara.

1605
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Nice.

1606
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I think...

1607
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
One-out sounds kind of interesting, actually.

1608
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Your description sold me on it.

1609
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I might hold those names in my memory for a week, and then forget to look into them.

1610
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
For a moment.

1611
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
For a transient moment.

1612
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
It disappears like tears in the rain.

1613
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yes.

1614
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Alright, next voicemail is an image.

1615
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Let's look at it, shall we?

1616
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Okay, so we've got BGE introducing Talking Pirates, my new one-piece discussion show.

1617
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And then this is a Twitter reply.

1618
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Twitter reply is a blue-haired SJW, I guess.

1619
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
A PCP fan.

1620
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Adding, is your image clean enough now, or is there someone else that needs to be purged?

1621
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Was it worth it?

1622
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Did the cool kids start inventing you to play now that you got rid of the undesirables?

1623
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Best guy ever says yes.

1624
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Well...

1625
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Did they, though?

1626
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Did they?

1627
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Did they what?

1628
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Did who what?

1629
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Did the cool kids start inviting him now to play now that he's gotten rid of all the undesirables?

1630
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I don't know if they did.

1631
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
This is the typical PCP fan, though. This is true.

1632
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Yes.

1633
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Can't deny it.

1634
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Alright, next one is rfckolive321go.

1635
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Approximately six years ago, I started working on a D&D setting and it got out of hand and eventually became its own system.

1636
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And I had started work on a free RPG Maker game based in it.

1637
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It's gonna be fucking huge.

1638
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And I've been working on it for about three months.

1639
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:53,000
And just a few days ago, my husband's Microsoft Surface that this was being, you know, made on, bricked.

1640
01:43:53,000 --> 01:44:01,000
And so this is a reminder to everyone out there to back up your shit right now.

1641
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Do it right now because I didn't and now I have to start all the way over.

1642
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
That sucks.

1643
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
That's awful.

1644
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
That sucks.

1645
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
On an unrelated note, though, I'm just gonna guess.

1646
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess, Olive, that you've probably never made a game before.

1647
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:35,000
And I think it's probably a bad idea for you to jump into it with the idea that you're going to make a huge, epic, sprawling game.

1648
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:46,000
It's, I don't think, I don't, I think is, it sounds, sounds rough, sounds, sounds rough of many, many such cases.

1649
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And they don't tend to work out very well.

1650
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Think of it as a learning experience, I guess.

1651
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I bet, I bet.

1652
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Now I could be totally off base with this, but if I'm right, I bet that if you went back and you tried to make that game again,

1653
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:09,000
that first three months you spent figuring it out, if you tried to go back and replicate everything, you could do it so much faster, the second time.

1654
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah.

1655
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Because you would know so much more and you would have, you would remember, I bet you could do it in half the time or less.

1656
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
And the skills you learned doing that would transfer to everything.

1657
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Everything.

1658
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I genuinely feel like I just barely figured out how to make like scenes, like cutscenes in like game maker.

1659
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I feel like just this month I finally figured it out after working on the game for a year.

1660
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
And I was like, oh, I get it.

1661
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Oh, okay.

1662
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I kind of have figured out sort of like a system that kind of works and is like makes it, sort of makes it flow.

1663
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And there's so many things in Phantom's Revenge that like I'm looking at now and I'm like, why didn't I

1664
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
standardize this?

1665
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Why did I just like, didn't I, didn't I make this like a fixed thing?

1666
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Why didn't I base these things on like a set of global variables that I could have referenced here, there and everywhere?

1667
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Like why did I, why did I do all kinds of things?

1668
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:13,000
My shit, my shit is a mess and there's all kinds of things in the game that like just look, they look weird.

1669
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:20,000
When I see them like they look weird to me and I'm like, I know why that's weird and it's because I did it in a stupid way

1670
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
because I have no idea what I was doing.

1671
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I cobbled it together well enough.

1672
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And my game is tiny.

1673
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
My game is 12 rooms long.

1674
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
So, yeah, I don't know.

1675
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Shit's hard.

1676
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Shit's really, really hard.

1677
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Okay, next one is called X7.

1678
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Three, two, one.

1679
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Actually, wait, give, did you have anything else, do you have anything to say about that one?

1680
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,000
About making a game for, you know, you were saying basically what I would be saying.

1681
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Okay.

1682
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
All right.

1683
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Sweet.

1684
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
All right, X7.

1685
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Three, two, one, go.

1686
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
He's coming.

1687
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Why is he coming?

1688
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Yeah.

1689
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
He must be.

1690
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
What did he see?

1691
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
He likes whatever he likes it, or is he just happy to see me?

1692
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Hey, hey, is that cum in your pocket?

1693
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Are you just happy to see me?

1694
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Okay.

1695
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Like the implication being that the cum could be from some other means.

1696
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I was just, I was just carrying this around.

1697
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
No, this.

1698
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Oh, this cum.

1699
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Oh, this cum.

1700
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
No, no, no.

1701
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
This is business.

1702
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Those from a prior engagement.

1703
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Okay.

1704
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Next one is a pasted bin.

1705
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Oh, it didn't.

1706
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Hold on.

1707
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
It's a pasted bin link.

1708
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:57,000
It says, how would you react if Nate invited you to be guests on the gamer zone?

1709
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
It would be pretty weird.

1710
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I don't know.

1711
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Okay.

1712
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Part of me wants to say that I would take it as like an insult because like, like because

1713
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:25,000
we already have a podcast and like, why are you inviting me to be on your podcast when

1714
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
like we already had a podcast.

1715
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And, you know, the more I think about it, the more I think, yeah, that is how I should

1716
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:39,000
feel because, you know, like at, like at Radcon, like Nate and Trixie were talking about, like

1717
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
they were, they were talking about the canton.

1718
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:45,000
They were talking about like making canton into its own thing separate from the PCP,

1719
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,000
basically like subsuming the PCP and like, you know, make basically turning us all into

1720
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
canton employees.

1721
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
It was more, okay.

1722
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
It was more Trixie.

1723
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
It was more Trixie that was talking about that.

1724
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
But Nate was kind of, Nate seemed to more or less be in agreement with it.

1725
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So I would kind of be like, bro, we already have a podcast.

1726
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Come on, come on our, why not come back on our podcast and talk about it.

1727
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Yeah.

1728
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I think I would be a little insulted.

1729
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
I don't know.

1730
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I would need like a really good, a really compelling reason to go onto the gamer zone and not feel

1731
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
like I've been co-opted.

1732
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
So, yeah.

1733
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
That's my answer.

1734
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
The next one is called Saber Spark is VV.

1735
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Saber Spark is too hard to listen to.

1736
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Three, two, one, go.

1737
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Hey, Ben, could you do me a favor and like Saber Spark 64 just released an hour long video

1738
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
and I want to listen to it.

1739
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I don't want to listen to Saber Spark talk for an hour.

1740
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I can't listen.

1741
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I can't listen to Saber Spark talk.

1742
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Could you dub over Saber Spark's memes?

1743
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Easily done, my friend.

1744
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Easily done.

1745
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And like pre-release it on your channel or something.

1746
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Completely steal what Tom's top five influential games are.

1747
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:24,000
But I don't want to hear him talk about it with Saber Spark.

1748
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:31,000
I would do that except then I would have to listen to Saber Spark in order to know what I have to say.

1749
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:38,000
You turn on like auto-generated English captions and then you get the transcript.

1750
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And I would have a mostly accurate script.

1751
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Mostly accurate but slightly garbled.

1752
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Slightly garbled, strange version of it.

1753
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Slightly auto-corrected.

1754
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Yeah, okay.

1755
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Could be fun.

1756
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Alright, next one is

1757
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,000
VVV on Instagram at VinnyVidiVichi4.

1758
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Alright, three, two, one, go.

1759
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Hey, Gab.

1760
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Would you mind checking your Instagram?

1761
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I added you a million years ago and I sent you a funny here and there.

1762
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Oh.

1763
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,000
And then I forgot about it until I got into this Jack and Daxter group

1764
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
and I made some cool art.

1765
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
I just thought you'd appreciate it.

1766
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I think it was cool.

1767
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I'm looking.

1768
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I have two accounts so maybe it's on one of them.

1769
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I don't check too much.

1770
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Oh, applications.

1771
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
They sure do suck.

1772
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
True.

1773
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Alright, I'm just going to do the next one.

1774
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
The next one is called Thread Derailed.

1775
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Three as in PoeDcast.

1776
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Three, two, one, go.

1777
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Yo, Nate killed the PoeDcast to make his stupid talking pirates thing.

1778
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Talk about top-ten anime portrayals.

1779
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Am I right, guys?

1780
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Hmm.

1781
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
A little bit.

1782
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Yeah.

1783
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
A little bit.

1784
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
A little bit.

1785
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Next one.

1786
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Okay, next one is a Vokeru link.

1787
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
And it seems to be from Doidgazers.

1788
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
So that's exciting.

1789
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Let's give that a listen.

1790
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Oh god, it's two minutes long.

1791
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Three, three, two, one, go.

1792
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Merry Christmas, fuckers.

1793
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It's me, Doidgazers.

1794
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:45,000
And today we are releasing our brand new hot single featuring me,

1795
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
me, the Golden Bitch, and Riley.

1796
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
They done let the Jiggers in the door.

1797
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,000
They done let the Jiggers in the door.

1798
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
They done let the Jiggers in the door.

1799
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
They done let the No Good Jiggers in the door.

1800
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Why GG, why GG.

1801
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
They done let the Jiggers in the door.

1802
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
They done let the No Good Jiggers in the door.

1803
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,420
I'm gonna shoot a horror-cury.

1804
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:15,540
The book is wrong with you.

1805
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:16,040
The fuck?

1806
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,260
Oh, you like the PCP?

1807
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:18,580
The book is wrong with you.

1808
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:19,080
The fuck?

1809
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:21,800
Oh, my user's got that VPD and content coming soon.

1810
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,300
Soon.

1811
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:23,560
No cancer without late consent.

1812
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:25,280
He's dead to me and you.

1813
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,600
I'm hanging out with Riley.

1814
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,040
Call us Yggers on the moon.

1815
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:28,600
On the moon?

1816
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:31,680
Give us all your money, Radcon 2022.

1817
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,280
And then you're a motherfucker.

1818
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:34,560
Call you Sonichu.

1819
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,060
Yeah.

1820
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:37,080
As for all your slanderer, it might be like Maddox.

1821
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:37,580
And soon.

1822
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:38,080
Oh, soon.

1823
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,800
So over the PCP, all they do is tell those lies.

1824
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,300
Why?

1825
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:44,340
So Ygg, you can see it in my soul aside.

1826
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:45,860
I think you're just jealous because I'm

1827
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:47,380
hanging out with older guys.

1828
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:50,180
And you are just mad because you never go outside.

1829
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:50,680
Never.

1830
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:53,380
All these PCP fans are originally on my side.

1831
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:54,980
They were only knowing because of me,

1832
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,540
your successes might not hide.

1833
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:59,620
If I compare our patriots almost every single night

1834
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:02,780
and keep rewatching all these videos from when we were tight,

1835
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:03,380
we were tight.

1836
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:06,380
They don't let the Yggers in the door.

1837
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:09,620
They don't let the Yggers in the door.

1838
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:12,740
They don't let the Yggers in the door.

1839
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:15,980
They don't let them know good Yggers in the door.

1840
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:17,060
Ygg.

1841
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:19,100
Ygg.

1842
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:20,340
Ygg.

1843
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:22,260
Ygg.

1844
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:25,380
They don't let the Yggers in the door.

1845
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:28,500
They don't let them know good Yggers in the door.

1846
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,940
Merry Christmas, fuckers.

1847
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:31,820
Here's a verse from the busier.

1848
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:34,820
21's a wrap and all you did was get sissy-er.

1849
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:36,460
Your secret projects kept you busy,

1850
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:37,820
but I was keeping busier.

1851
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:41,060
I've been smoking so much weed that my head's feeling dizzy-er.

1852
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:42,700
My verses are my curses, man.

1853
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:43,580
Shut the fuck up.

1854
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:43,940
Yeah.

1855
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:46,700
All you do is run your mouth, so shut the fuck up.

1856
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:47,540
Shoot it.

1857
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:50,060
You're obsessed with me and Trixie, and it's kind of fucked up.

1858
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:50,380
It is.

1859
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:53,060
Like I get it, you're a hater, and you like making stuff up.

1860
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:53,860
It's all made up.

1861
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:54,580
Ygg.

1862
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,540
W-A-T-P, the PCP.

1863
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:56,940
Again.

1864
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:59,620
You know why I think I might have smoked too much PCP?

1865
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:00,100
Maybe.

1866
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:02,860
Then your butthole must be feeling pretty sore.

1867
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:06,140
And it must hurt to see these Yggers open up the door.

1868
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:09,400
S-A-D-S, what?

1869
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:23,620
B-W-A-T.

1870
01:55:23,620 --> 01:55:24,080
Wow.

1871
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:29,420
Well, that was a real song.

1872
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:30,940
From Trixie?

1873
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:34,020
From Trixie, yeah from Trixie and Riley.

1874
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:36,940
It's too real.

1875
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:43,940
I suppressed my reaction to all of that because I thought it deserved to just play uninterrupted.

1876
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:54,940
Okay, here's what I think. I think people should go and follow...

1877
01:55:54,940 --> 01:56:00,940
I think people should go and follow Drixie the Golden Bitch at Doidgazer on Twitter.

1878
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:07,940
I like this stuff. I feel privileged. I feel blessed.

1879
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:13,940
I feel blessed to live in a world where this content exists.

1880
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:20,940
Go men. Go men for the track. I like that a lot.

1881
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:26,940
Yeah, give a... Go check out Doidgazer on Twitter. Give them a follow.

1882
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:30,940
I think they... I think they more than deserve it.

1883
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:34,940
Yeah. Fuckin' yeah.

1884
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:39,940
Alright, next voicemail is...

1885
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:43,940
Fried Vocalist. 3, 2, 1, go.

1886
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:55,940
Yeah, man. Hell yeah.

1887
01:56:55,940 --> 01:57:00,940
Alright, next one is called... Oh god, it's a minute 30.

1888
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:05,940
It's called At Transphobes. 3, 2, 1, go.

1889
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:10,940
Hey, Ben and Gibb. So, spurred on by the latest episode of the PCP,

1890
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:17,940
I got inspired to articulate in a short form a basic argument against people who think that you can disrespect

1891
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:21,940
trans people's gender right entity just because they are bad people.

1892
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:23,940
I already know. We already explained it.

1893
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:29,940
From the perspective of Emmanuel Kant, he explains that every human being has what he calls a dignity.

1894
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:35,940
Their ability to make recent choices and direct their lives as they see fit is something inherently demanding of respect.

1895
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:42,940
And he then distinguishes this sense of respect from what people nowadays may conflate with respect, namely admiration.

1896
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:49,940
People must earn our admiration, but all human beings basically demand our respect.

1897
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:53,940
And respect entails at least a respect of their autonomy, their self-direction.

1898
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:58,940
And as I see it, this is exactly why you cannot disregard any trans person's gender identity,

1899
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:02,940
because respecting that is not respecting the sense of admiration.

1900
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:08,940
It's respecting the more basic sense of not unnecessarily interfering with another's autonomy.

1901
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:17,940
And I would argue that if you disregard what someone reasonably assigns themselves in terms of gender,

1902
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:22,940
that constitutes a disrespect of their autonomy.

1903
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:27,940
And it constitutes sort of a basic, inhumane disrespect of people.

1904
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:35,940
And I don't think that people generally ought to be able to justify that, even if that person is a bad person.

1905
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:40,940
Like, okay, a Kantian analysis. That's kind of interesting.

1906
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:43,940
Yeah, I mean, obviously I agree with the point.

1907
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:46,940
Sure. Yeah, okay.

1908
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:48,940
Alright, thanks for the smell.

1909
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:59,940
But have they considered that stupid people would not understand that, and therefore it's not true, actually?

1910
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:04,940
Yeah, they're just asking for too much.

1911
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:10,940
Like, obviously I'm down with the struggle. Obviously I support rights.

1912
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:14,940
But have they considered that maybe they're asking for too many, and the world's just not ready?

1913
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:15,940
Yes.

1914
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:19,940
This was, um, oh god, what was that?

1915
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:22,940
Was it like, ah fuck, I'm gonna get the details wrong.

1916
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:27,940
But it was some fucking state, some shitty state like Mississippi or something,

1917
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:36,940
that like banned Sesame Street when it was new, because it portrayed like, you know, black people.

1918
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:40,940
And it was like, because there were like black people and white people on the show.

1919
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:41,940
Oh my, okay.

1920
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:45,940
Yeah, yeah, they like, I don't know if it was Mississippi, but it was some southern state.

1921
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:51,940
They banned, they briefly banned Sesame Street when it was new, and like, it's so pathetic.

1922
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:57,940
It's so pathetic, like the reason they banned it, they didn't say, it's like we don't want to show like,

1923
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:01,940
integration and like black people and stuff.

1924
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:05,940
They said that the reason they banned it was because like, we're not ready.

1925
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:07,940
Like, society's not ready for that.

1926
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:13,940
Like, obviously I support, obviously I'm not a racist, but like, you know, people,

1927
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:16,940
but people just aren't ready to see things that aren't racist.

1928
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:21,940
People just aren't ready to see, so I don't support showing this non-racist stuff.

1929
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:26,940
Only racism please for now, you know, until people are ready for it.

1930
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:29,940
Yeah, you just gotta use them into it by just not doing anything.

1931
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:30,940
Exactly, exactly.

1932
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:32,940
Gib, you're a genius.

1933
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:33,940
Gib, I could, thank you.

1934
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:37,940
You're, you know, I would, I would go so far, you know, with rhetoric like that,

1935
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:40,940
I would go so far as to say that you're one of the good ones.

1936
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:48,940
Thanks for being, not one of these cringe ones that wants like, positive change or rights or anything.

1937
02:00:48,940 --> 02:00:49,940
Thank you.

1938
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:52,940
You're making me very, thanks for looking out for my comfort.

1939
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:55,940
Okay, enough.

1940
02:00:55,940 --> 02:01:02,940
Another, next one is Prince Annihilation, The Miracle Before Christmas.

1941
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:04,940
Another minute 30.

1942
02:01:04,940 --> 02:01:06,940
Let's see if it justifies itself.

1943
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,940
Three, two, one, go.

1944
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:14,940
Based on a true story, it all happened about a week ago.

1945
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:19,940
Finally, there it was on my doorstep, road to Radcon,

1946
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:24,940
sent straight from the car trunk of internet pseudo celebrity Ben St.

1947
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:30,940
I opened it up and saw the beautiful cover art, smelled the not so freshly printed paper.

1948
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:34,940
Still good.

1949
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:39,940
The next day I went out to my internship and dreamed of reading the great literary work on my free time.

1950
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:45,940
But upon returning home, I was hit with intense fatigue, body aches and headaches,

1951
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:49,940
and I collapsed on the bed for several hours and I was unable to get up.

1952
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:55,940
The entire night I struggled to move, walk or even eat and mostly just slept.

1953
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:59,940
Could it be, I thought, could my internet hero Ben St.

1954
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:04,940
have sent me USA grade COVID from inside the pages of his Magnum Opus?

1955
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:09,940
At first thought shocked me, but then I realized that this reality would afford me new opportunities.

1956
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:13,940
I could e-bag Ben St. for a free I have COVID t-shirt.

1957
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:14,940
False.

1958
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:18,940
Or I could just violently myself and wrap that PCP merch for epic meme points.

1959
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:19,940
There you go.

1960
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,940
The next day I tested myself.

1961
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:22,940
Negative.

1962
02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:25,940
I was relieved but also kind of sad.

1963
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:27,940
In the next two days I recovered.

1964
02:02:27,940 --> 02:02:33,940
But then catching up on work made me so busy that I haven't actually read Road to Radcon to this day.

1965
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:36,940
So if you take anything from this story, I would hope it is this.

1966
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:38,940
Remember love.

1967
02:02:38,940 --> 02:02:41,940
Also it's totally Tricky's fault I got m-

1968
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:46,940
Agree. Agree.

1969
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:47,940
If you-

1970
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:48,940
Yes.

1971
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:54,940
If you had read, if you had read Road to Radcon,

1972
02:02:54,940 --> 02:03:02,940
you would know that Road to Radcon contains the true account of the origin of the coronavirus.

1973
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:03,940
Actually.

1974
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:04,940
Yes.

1975
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:07,940
As you remember we did Radcon at the beginning of the pandemic.

1976
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:08,940
Well guess what?

1977
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:10,940
We were there at ground zero.

1978
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,940
Chinese wet markets,

1979
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:14,940
eaten bat meat.

1980
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:15,940
All lies.

1981
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:16,940
All a-

1982
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:17,940
All a-

1983
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:18,940
All an op.

1984
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:20,940
All an op, a misdirected red herring.

1985
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:26,940
We have the real story and it is contained within the pages of Road to Radcon.

1986
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,940
DM me on Twitter.

1987
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:30,940
Please buy more copies.

1988
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:33,940
After all, we are the reason people are dying.

1989
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:34,940
We are.

1990
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:36,940
We always were.

1991
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:40,940
But now more than ever, we are the reason people are dying.

1992
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:41,940
Sorry.

1993
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:45,940
Sorry about the pandemic everybody.

1994
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:48,940
I hope our Patreon doesn't suffer for this.

1995
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:55,940
I sure hope our Patreon doesn't suffer because we did COVID.

1996
02:03:55,940 --> 02:04:00,940
But I guess we'll see.

1997
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:05,940
Next one is called Thank You Technology.

1998
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:09,940
Wait, I just want to say,

1999
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:14,940
I actually am pretty proud and amused.

2000
02:04:14,940 --> 02:04:17,940
Because it's all in the last chapter, it was all me.

2001
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:18,940
I guess we workshopped it.

2002
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:19,940
So it's not all me.

2003
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:22,940
You and me kind of came up with the idea together.

2004
02:04:22,940 --> 02:04:25,940
We came up with the ideas and then you did the actual prose.

2005
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:26,940
Yeah.

2006
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:33,940
But the, yeah, that part of it is really funny.

2007
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:37,940
And I think it's very serendipitous.

2008
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:43,940
And it just worked out in a way that makes sense and is satisfying and also is really funny.

2009
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:44,940
Yeah.

2010
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:46,940
And I just love that part.

2011
02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:50,940
That's one of my favorite things about it.

2012
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:52,940
There's other good shit.

2013
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:53,940
There's actually a lot.

2014
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:59,940
There's actually quite a bit of lore in, especially in the final chapter because I did it on purpose.

2015
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:07,940
There's quite a bit of funny lore in the final chapter of Road to Radcon.

2016
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:17,940
We did that stream where we workshopped what should go in there and it all went in, baby.

2017
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:20,940
It's a good read by a copy.

2018
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:21,940
Okay.

2019
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:25,940
Next one is called Thank You Technology.

2020
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:28,940
Three, two, one, go.

2021
02:05:28,940 --> 02:05:31,940
So I graduated high school this year.

2022
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:32,940
Congratulations.

2023
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:36,940
To make it more clear, this was back again in June.

2024
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:42,940
And they made us login into this app to receive our diploma.

2025
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:44,940
So, okay, it was weird.

2026
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:46,940
It was really weird.

2027
02:05:46,940 --> 02:05:49,940
And then something passed.

2028
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:55,940
And then, well, this thing about NFTs started showing up.

2029
02:05:55,940 --> 02:06:00,940
And you know, NFTs, all the drama, all the stuff.

2030
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:04,940
And then something came back into my mind.

2031
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:06,940
Something scary.

2032
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:11,940
And I went back to check my high school diploma.

2033
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:16,940
And I remember this specific thing they told us.

2034
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:17,940
It's not a blockchain.

2035
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:20,940
Something about our diplomas using the blockchain.

2036
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:23,940
No, what the fuck?

2037
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:24,940
Oh my God.

2038
02:06:24,940 --> 02:06:28,940
And then, then I wanted my phone.

2039
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:30,940
And then I went to the app.

2040
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:33,940
And then I saw my diploma.

2041
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:35,940
And then I clicked Validate.

2042
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:37,940
And there it was.

2043
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:42,940
This credential is a valid Ethereum credential.

2044
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:46,940
My fucking high school diploma is an NFT.

2045
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:49,940
And now I have to depend on it.

2046
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:53,940
I have to depend on NFTs to keep my high school diploma safe.

2047
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:55,940
That's horrible.

2048
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:58,940
How could they just do that?

2049
02:06:58,940 --> 02:07:00,940
Okay, wait a minute.

2050
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:05,940
Surely, when it comes to what diplomas do you have,

2051
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:10,940
you'd be able to say, even if you don't have the password to the NFT,

2052
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:13,940
surely that would say.

2053
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:21,940
Okay, diplomas have existed and functioned without the blockchain.

2054
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:27,940
What does putting it on the blockchain, what's the fucking point?

2055
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:29,940
What's the fucking point?

2056
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:34,940
It's a stupid idiot in charge of it convinced the teachers to be like,

2057
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:36,940
oh, what if we did this?

2058
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,940
I would hope.

2059
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:38,940
This is the future.

2060
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:39,940
And they're like, okay.

2061
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:40,940
And then they just did it.

2062
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:44,940
I would hope that you could just fucking print like,

2063
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:47,940
okay, I guess thanks for the JPEG.

2064
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:50,940
I would hope that you can just print the JPEG.

2065
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:53,940
And that would function as a diploma.

2066
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:57,940
I would hope that, I guess I would hope.

2067
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:01,940
And I would expect and hope that you don't actually need to like interact

2068
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:06,940
with the fucking Ethereum blockchain just to like confirm your

2069
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:10,940
graduated status with like a potential college or something.

2070
02:08:10,940 --> 02:08:18,940
I think that if that happens, like if it's like you need the NFT code

2071
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:24,940
to prove to like other schools and stuff you have the credentials you have,

2072
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:27,940
then a site is ruined.

2073
02:08:27,940 --> 02:08:35,940
I feel like there must be that there would have to be a like a way around

2074
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:38,940
like, oh, if you if you lose the password or whatever,

2075
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:42,940
you could just if you have a picture of it and it's got your name on it,

2076
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:44,940
then that's enough.

2077
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:47,940
So I'm sure it's not going to be exclusively that.

2078
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:51,940
Yeah, but it sucks that it's happening at all.

2079
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:52,940
That's terrible.

2080
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:53,940
It's so stupid.

2081
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:55,940
I've been I've been seeing.

2082
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:56,940
Yeah, some.

2083
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:58,940
Yeah, some idiots in charge, I guess.

2084
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:01,940
I've been seeing Dan Olson's tweets about NFTs lately,

2085
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:04,940
and he's been doing a lot of research into them.

2086
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:05,940
And it's very good.

2087
02:09:05,940 --> 02:09:07,940
I like what he has to say about them.

2088
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:11,940
And the other day he posted one that's like, I had not even considered this,

2089
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:18,940
but like there's a thing where you can take a thing or whatever,

2090
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:22,940
and you can mint it on the blockchain, you know, whatever that means.

2091
02:09:22,940 --> 02:09:23,940
And that's like fine.

2092
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:24,940
That's cool.

2093
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:29,940
But like consider that there are many blockchains and there are many networks

2094
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:35,940
and you can and people do just take something that someone take a JPEG

2095
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:39,940
that someone minted on the blockchain, take the same JPEG

2096
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:43,940
and just go to another blockchain or every other blockchain

2097
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:45,940
and just mint it on those ones too.

2098
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:49,940
You can just steal from one blockchain, put it on another blockchain,

2099
02:09:49,940 --> 02:09:51,940
same shit, different blockchain.

2100
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:53,940
You can just do that.

2101
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:58,940
And it's like, oh, well now it's official on my blockchain too, I guess.

2102
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:00,940
It's like, oh, okay.

2103
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:04,940
Which blockchain is the real one though?

2104
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:07,940
Which one do I shoot?

2105
02:10:07,940 --> 02:10:11,940
Do they have like a date for when it was minted?

2106
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:16,940
I guess that would be the only thing you like have the earliest dated thing.

2107
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:18,940
Yeah, I guess.

2108
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:21,940
Yeah, I guess you could just look at the date.

2109
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:25,940
But then it's like, okay, but then what, right?

2110
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:26,940
Then what?

2111
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:28,940
You look at the date and you're like, oh, okay.

2112
02:10:28,940 --> 02:10:32,940
I see that it's minted on this blockchain, on this date.

2113
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:38,940
So, okay, that other blockchain, like yeah, even though it says it was minted there

2114
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:43,940
and the blockchain is, you know, an inarguable registry of truth.

2115
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:47,940
You know, everything on the blockchain is permanent and immutable and it's true.

2116
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:49,940
But just ignore that it says it over there.

2117
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:51,940
Just pretend it doesn't say that.

2118
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:53,940
That one doesn't count.

2119
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:57,940
That part of that block on the chain is, it's just not real.

2120
02:10:57,940 --> 02:10:59,940
All the other ones are real though.

2121
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:01,940
The original blockchain is totally real.

2122
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:02,940
That one's immutable.

2123
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:07,940
Unless there's another even older blockchain, in which case that one's the real one.

2124
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:09,940
But who knows?

2125
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:12,940
Blockchain's just like so smart.

2126
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:14,940
It's so fucking smart.

2127
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:18,940
Babies playing with blocks and their chain together.

2128
02:11:18,940 --> 02:11:20,940
It's about the same.

2129
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:23,940
The babies have grown to love their chains.

2130
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:25,940
The greater babies.

2131
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:28,940
The block chains, that is.

2132
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:33,940
Next voicemail is called, Ben is not allowed to listen to this one.

2133
02:11:33,940 --> 02:11:37,940
From takeoffyourredphoneshatnoseriously.fuck.

2134
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:40,940
What are you going to do, Ben?

2135
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:47,940
I guess I'll abide by its rules.

2136
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:49,940
Let's start the voicemail.

2137
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:51,940
I'll listen to it.

2138
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:53,940
3, 2, 1, I can go.

2139
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:55,940
I'll count it in.

2140
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:57,940
Hey, Ben!

2141
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:58,940
Just don't listen to this one.

2142
02:11:58,940 --> 02:11:59,940
Don't worry about it.

2143
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:00,940
It doesn't concern you.

2144
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:01,940
It doesn't matter.

2145
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:02,940
It's alright. It doesn't matter.

2146
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:03,940
Just take your headphones off.

2147
02:12:03,940 --> 02:12:04,940
Take the batteries out.

2148
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:05,940
Uncharge them.

2149
02:12:05,940 --> 02:12:06,940
Unplug it.

2150
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:07,940
Make sure you can't hear me.

2151
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:08,940
Now he's gone.

2152
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:09,940
You guys want to hear a big secret?

2153
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:10,940
You can't tell him, though.

2154
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:11,940
I promise you won't tell him.

2155
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:12,940
Yeah.

2156
02:12:12,940 --> 02:12:16,940
So you know how he gives you $2 for every dollar that you want patron from Trixie?

2157
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:18,940
Well, here's what you do.

2158
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:22,940
Give Trixie a dollar and on patron, Ben gives you $2.

2159
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:27,940
Give Trixie $2 on patron, Ben gives you $4.

2160
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:28,940
It's infinite money.

2161
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:32,940
It's exponential growth.

2162
02:12:32,940 --> 02:12:33,940
You can't tell him, though.

2163
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:34,940
Promise you won't tell him.

2164
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:35,940
Because if you tell him, he'll patch it.

2165
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:36,940
It's going to be our little secret.

2166
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:37,940
I won't.

2167
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:38,940
Okay.

2168
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:39,940
You can ask what we were talking about.

2169
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:42,940
Just say we're talking about how gay he is.

2170
02:12:42,940 --> 02:12:44,940
Ben, you can come back in now.

2171
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:50,940
I promise we were only talking about how gay you are.

2172
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:51,940
I lied.

2173
02:12:51,940 --> 02:12:52,940
I fucking lied.

2174
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:53,940
Oh, no.

2175
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:54,940
I lied.

2176
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:57,940
I listened to the voicemail.

2177
02:12:57,940 --> 02:12:58,940
I'm patching it.

2178
02:12:58,940 --> 02:12:59,940
I'm patching it.

2179
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:00,940
A patchy.

2180
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:01,940
The...

2181
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:02,940
No, I look.

2182
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:03,940
I look.

2183
02:13:03,940 --> 02:13:05,940
Not that anyone has...

2184
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:10,940
Sadly, no one has taken me up on the offer for a while, but when they did, I look at

2185
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:14,940
the record and I see, like, did someone just pledge...

2186
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:20,940
I would probably be able to tell if someone were trying to scam me like that.

2187
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:22,940
Scam me out of a whole dollar.

2188
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:24,940
Because I can see the number.

2189
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:27,940
I can see number go up.

2190
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:29,940
I can see patron number go up.

2191
02:13:30,940 --> 02:13:33,940
I can see patron number go up.

2192
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:35,940
The record is there on GraphTreeOn.

2193
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:37,940
I can just refer to it.

2194
02:13:37,940 --> 02:13:42,940
If the number were to go up by five dollars and you were like, I'm a five dollar patron,

2195
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:47,940
I would be like, well, I think you're scamming me, buddy.

2196
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:53,940
Yeah, I got pretty early in the morning to pull one over on this guy.

2197
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,940
Next one is not a voicemail.

2198
02:13:55,940 --> 02:13:56,940
It's just a question.

2199
02:13:56,940 --> 02:13:59,940
I can see the Tara Strong NFT film project.

2200
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:03,940
I saw the Tara Strong was doing NFT stuff.

2201
02:14:03,940 --> 02:14:06,940
I didn't really look into it any further.

2202
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:11,940
I also saw that she's like an anti-vaxxer, which is very funny.

2203
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:13,940
Twilight wouldn't be an anti-vaxxer.

2204
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:15,940
I don't think so.

2205
02:14:15,940 --> 02:14:19,940
I think Twilight would be a Democrat.

2206
02:14:19,940 --> 02:14:22,940
I think Twilight would love Kamala Harris.

2207
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:23,940
Kamala Harris.

2208
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:26,940
I forget which is the right way to say it.

2209
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,940
I think it's Kamala.

2210
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:34,940
Twilight Sparkle would stan Kamala Harris and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

2211
02:14:37,940 --> 02:14:38,940
That's it.

2212
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:39,940
That's all I have to say.

2213
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:43,940
Obviously she'd be vaccinated, but she would love NFTs.

2214
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:45,940
She loves the blockchain.

2215
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:47,940
She's like, oh my God, it opens up.

2216
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:49,940
Oh my God, we can open up so many opportunities.

2217
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:51,940
Oh my God, smart contracts.

2218
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:54,940
Bro, it's revolutionary.

2219
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:57,940
I don't even want to know what a smart contract is.

2220
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:02,940
Tom seemed to think that a smart contract was like one of the good things that a blockchain can do.

2221
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:05,940
I didn't understand his explanation of it.

2222
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:06,940
I don't believe it.

2223
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:09,940
I still don't believe that it's real or that it matters.

2224
02:15:09,940 --> 02:15:15,940
Is a smart contract like a contract that you can't edit afterwards?

2225
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:17,940
Is it like a tweet?

2226
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:20,940
I don't know.

2227
02:15:21,940 --> 02:15:28,940
I mean, whatever it is, whatever it is, it would still have to be drafted by humans.

2228
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:32,940
The terms of it would still have to be agreed upon by a human.

2229
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:36,940
Maybe it makes it...

2230
02:15:38,940 --> 02:15:44,940
Maybe the confirmation of receipt is on the blockchain, I guess.

2231
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:48,940
Maybe it happens automatically, but it would still have to happen in response.

2232
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:56,940
Maybe fulfillment happens automatically, but it would still have to happen in response to a human telling it like contract fulfilled.

2233
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:58,940
There has to be some...

2234
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:03,940
Whatever it is, I'm sure it's still gameable.

2235
02:16:03,940 --> 02:16:08,940
I have yet to see any problem that the blockchain solves.

2236
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:13,940
Okay, so next one is,

2237
02:16:13,940 --> 02:16:16,940
Worst holiday gift you ever got or weirdest gift you ever got?

2238
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:21,940
Man, I don't know.

2239
02:16:23,940 --> 02:16:27,940
No bad gifts spring to mind.

2240
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:31,940
Or weird gifts, I guess.

2241
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:37,940
Gifts are nice, usually.

2242
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:43,940
I'm sorry, a disappointing answer, I can't think of any...

2243
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:48,940
This one time I got a really fucked up gift, I don't think I have any...

2244
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,940
Like that, sorry, I wish I did.

2245
02:16:50,940 --> 02:16:56,940
This one time Santa took a dump down the chimney, he didn't even leave any presents.

2246
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:58,940
That's weird.

2247
02:16:58,940 --> 02:17:04,940
One time I did give a fucked up gift, and that one time to prank my family.

2248
02:17:04,940 --> 02:17:10,940
When I was a kid, I replaced everything in the stockings with coal.

2249
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:19,940
I bought a bunch of coal from Building 19, and then I put coal in everyone's stocking before everyone woke up as a prank.

2250
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:24,940
I thought it was really funny, but it didn't go over well.

2251
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:27,940
Nobody laughed or liked it, or was like, wow, what the heck?

2252
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:31,940
We were little kids, and Nate was even littler than me.

2253
02:17:31,940 --> 02:17:37,940
I remember Nate just seemed confused and upset, and I was like, ah, jeez.

2254
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:40,940
Ah, fuck. I thought it was funny.

2255
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:42,940
Oh, well.

2256
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:44,940
It's the punchline without a setup.

2257
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:46,940
They're just like, what is this?

2258
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:50,940
Yeah, I don't know, whatever.

2259
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:54,940
Oops, not in the mood, I guess.

2260
02:17:55,940 --> 02:18:00,940
Next one is Nate's real nobody name.

2261
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:03,940
3, 2, 1, go.

2262
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:05,940
You scrimble McBrimblows.

2263
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:09,940
Nate's nobody name would obviously be Zontay.

2264
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:12,940
That's X-A-N-T-E.

2265
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,940
That's pretty good.

2266
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:16,940
Zontay.

2267
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:20,940
That's a good name.

2268
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:26,940
Some stay dry, but there's nobody who had enough.

2269
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:31,940
Chocolate Rain wrote a song about black history.

2270
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:33,940
Chocolate Rain.

2271
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:37,940
Now I'm paid a hefty, hefty fee.

2272
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:43,940
That was for some commercial.

2273
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:45,940
He sang that version of the song.

2274
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:47,940
It's not really about black history.

2275
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:50,940
But it's about black...

2276
02:18:50,940 --> 02:18:53,940
It's as much about the present as it is about history.

2277
02:18:53,940 --> 02:18:55,940
They made him say black history.

2278
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:58,940
No, no, it's about a thing that used to happen.

2279
02:18:58,940 --> 02:19:01,940
Don't say it's about systemic racism in the modern era.

2280
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:02,940
You can't say that.

2281
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:04,940
That should have been the line.

2282
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:06,940
That would have rhymed really well if he had said,

2283
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:09,940
wrote a song about systemic racism in the modern era.

2284
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:13,940
That would have been really good.

2285
02:19:13,940 --> 02:19:16,940
Next voicemail is called,

2286
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:20,940
Sorry Uwu, 3, 2, 1, go.

2287
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:22,940
Ben, I hope you've missed me.

2288
02:19:22,940 --> 02:19:25,940
I'm sorry I haven't left a voicemail in a couple weeks.

2289
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:27,940
I've been too busy having sex.

2290
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:29,940
It's been really sad without you, man.

2291
02:19:29,940 --> 02:19:30,940
But I get it.

2292
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:31,940
I get it.

2293
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:33,940
You gotta fuck.

2294
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:35,940
You gotta fuck when you gotta fuck.

2295
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:37,940
Sometimes you gotta fuck.

2296
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:42,940
Who am I to stand in the way of progress?

2297
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:46,940
Next one is hashtag drew dump December.

2298
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:50,940
I think it's probably supposed to be hashtag dry dump December.

2299
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:53,940
If you remember reference to our two weeks ago,

2300
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:58,940
our discussion with to snaker about our new,

2301
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:00,940
our cool new thing.

2302
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:02,940
Next one is three.

2303
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:05,940
Okay, drew it drew dump December 3, 2, 1, go.

2304
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:08,940
Hey PCP, you deserve another W.

2305
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:13,940
Because I am now three weeks into dry dump December.

2306
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:15,940
And I feel fucking ascended.

2307
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:17,940
It's not even three weeks.

2308
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:21,940
This is the state of mind humans were always supposed to be in.

2309
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:25,940
All the moisture that was supposed to go into my shit

2310
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:27,940
is now hydrating my entire body,

2311
02:20:27,940 --> 02:20:33,940
making me basically an ubermensch in this fucking society of low people.

2312
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:35,940
Low people who like don't fap.

2313
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:37,940
What the fuck is that all about?

2314
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:40,940
No fact November, dry dump December all the way.

2315
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:42,940
I'm so fucking hydrated.

2316
02:20:42,940 --> 02:20:46,940
I'm running marathons and I don't even feel it.

2317
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:50,940
Even if I sweat profusely, I still got that moisture.

2318
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:54,940
That's how hydrated I am from not even taking a fucking dump.

2319
02:20:54,940 --> 02:21:01,940
So, well, I mean, I guess my ass does hurt quite a bit.

2320
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:04,940
And I do feel like I'm gonna burst any second now.

2321
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:05,940
That's okay.

2322
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:06,940
I might spray out my mouth.

2323
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:08,940
You just gotta work through that.

2324
02:21:08,940 --> 02:21:13,940
But this is literally the best I've felt my entire life.

2325
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:17,940
So, I highly recommend dry dump December.

2326
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:18,940
You know.

2327
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:19,940
Okay.

2328
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:24,940
I don't think, did I leave before you started talking about this on that episode?

2329
02:21:24,940 --> 02:21:25,940
Did you?

2330
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:26,940
Maybe.

2331
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:27,940
Because I don't recall.

2332
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:28,940
Maybe you did.

2333
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:29,940
Dry dump December.

2334
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:34,940
Dry dump December is, yeah, because I was talking about how when you hold in a shit,

2335
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:39,940
like the longer a shit has been in your body before you excrete it,

2336
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:48,940
the drier it is because moisture from it absorbs from your bowel, your intestine.

2337
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:52,940
So, it's like, well, you don't want to lose that moisture.

2338
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:57,940
So, after no fact November, a better thing is dry dump December where you don't shit.

2339
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:00,940
You hold the shit, you hold it in and you get all the moisture.

2340
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:01,940
You keep all your moisture.

2341
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:05,940
And the thing is that nobody understands is that dump moisture is actually the best

2342
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:06,940
moisture there is.

2343
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:10,940
You're losing precious moisture if you release the dump too early.

2344
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:12,940
So, hold it in all month.

2345
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:14,940
Don't let it go.

2346
02:22:14,940 --> 02:22:16,940
Don't release.

2347
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:23,940
What if you hold it in for so long that it becomes like a fine mist, like a dust?

2348
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:25,940
Well, that's how you know you did it.

2349
02:22:25,940 --> 02:22:29,940
What do you think the whole point of dry dump December is?

2350
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:38,940
On January 1st, you go out and you release the sand, basically.

2351
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:44,940
You just let it tumble out like sand from an hourglass.

2352
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:47,940
And that's how you know you did it right.

2353
02:22:47,940 --> 02:22:50,940
Think of all the moisture you saved.

2354
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:51,940
Gallons.

2355
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:52,940
You just drink gallons.

2356
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:53,940
Gallons, Gib.

2357
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:54,940
Gallons.

2358
02:22:55,940 --> 02:23:00,940
That is too much.

2359
02:23:00,940 --> 02:23:02,940
That's too much for me.

2360
02:23:02,940 --> 02:23:04,940
No, it's enough.

2361
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:06,940
I'd say it's finally enough.

2362
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:10,940
Next voicemail is called New PCP Theme Song.

2363
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:12,940
Three, two, one, go.

2364
02:23:12,940 --> 02:23:17,940
Anyway, here is the new theme song I thought of for the PCP.

2365
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:20,940
It goes a little something like this.

2366
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:24,940
I wouldn't fucking shit so bad.

2367
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:26,940
Thank you.

2368
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:28,940
Put it at the beginning of the episode.

2369
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:31,940
Put it at the beginning of the episode, Eleazar.

2370
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:34,940
Please, new theme song.

2371
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:39,940
I want to shit so bad.

2372
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:40,940
All through December, baby.

2373
02:23:40,940 --> 02:23:44,940
All through dry dump December.

2374
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:49,940
Next voicemail is called Fuck Trixie.

2375
02:23:49,940 --> 02:23:52,940
Three, two, one, go.

2376
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:55,940
Hey, Ben.

2377
02:23:55,940 --> 02:23:59,940
So I watched Nate's new video.

2378
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:05,940
And I realized why I don't like Nate's recent content.

2379
02:24:05,940 --> 02:24:09,940
He's never on screen anymore, it feels like.

2380
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:13,940
I like the videos of Nate just like excitedly bouncing around

2381
02:24:13,940 --> 02:24:14,940
the room.

2382
02:24:14,940 --> 02:24:15,940
He's good at that.

2383
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:17,940
Did Nate get fat in COVID?

2384
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:18,940
What happened?

2385
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:19,940
He got fat, didn't he?

2386
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:22,940
Oh, I want to rub that fat little fucking belly.

2387
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:26,940
Last time I saw him, he was not fat.

2388
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:32,940
So I don't know, take with that what you will.

2389
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:33,940
I agree though.

2390
02:24:33,940 --> 02:24:37,940
Nate's on screen appearances are fun.

2391
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:40,940
Well, he never really, well, he would be on screen.

2392
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:44,940
They're more fun than just the voiceover.

2393
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:45,940
Okay.

2394
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:48,940
What was his last video, the Delta Rune one?

2395
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:51,940
No, his last video was the Cowboy Bebop.

2396
02:24:51,940 --> 02:24:53,940
Oh, yeah.

2397
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:54,940
Yeah.

2398
02:24:54,940 --> 02:24:55,940
Right.

2399
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:56,940
Okay.

2400
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:59,940
I mean, that's makes sense.

2401
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:00,940
Understandable.

2402
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:01,940
Okay.

2403
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:02,940
Next one is called Gotem.

2404
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:05,940
Three, two, one, go.

2405
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:07,940
Pee pee poo poo.

2406
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:08,940
You did.

2407
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:09,940
You got him.

2408
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:10,940
Cool.

2409
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:11,940
Cool.

2410
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:13,940
Who are M by the way?

2411
02:25:13,940 --> 02:25:14,940
Can't be us.

2412
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:16,940
There's no way you got us.

2413
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:17,940
No.

2414
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:20,940
So whoever they were though, I pity the fool.

2415
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:22,940
I pity the fool, you might say.

2416
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:23,940
Okay.

2417
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:27,940
Next one is a vocaboo link.

2418
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:31,940
Three, two, one, go.

2419
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:36,940
The PCP makes me go.

2420
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:40,940
Gonna come right now.

2421
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:41,940
Wow.

2422
02:25:41,940 --> 02:25:42,940
Damn.

2423
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:45,940
That's also a good contender for a theme song.

2424
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:48,940
That's actually a better, it's actually way better.

2425
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:49,940
Put the back to back.

2426
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:51,940
At least our back to back.

2427
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:53,940
One after the other.

2428
02:25:53,940 --> 02:25:56,940
They both deserve, they both deserve it.

2429
02:25:56,940 --> 02:25:57,940
Yeah.

2430
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:58,940
Obviously.

2431
02:25:58,940 --> 02:25:59,940
Obviously.

2432
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:01,940
Okay.

2433
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:05,940
Next one is another paste bin question.

2434
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:10,940
So let's see about that, I guess.

2435
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:13,940
What's the appeal of Twitter?

2436
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:18,940
You talk about it all the time, but I can't get into it at all.

2437
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:19,940
Well, you're lucky.

2438
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:21,940
I mean, what's not to understand?

2439
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:27,940
It's just a place where people write stuff and you read what they write.

2440
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:29,940
You write stuff in your slot.

2441
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:35,940
And they get, you get notifications when new people you follow write or post stuff.

2442
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:37,940
I mean, I like using it.

2443
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:41,940
I don't even know how to explain the appeal of Twitter.

2444
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:45,940
There's lots of cool artists who post art that I follow.

2445
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:50,940
My radiator is fucking exploding behind me, by the way, if you can hear that.

2446
02:26:50,940 --> 02:26:52,940
I cannot.

2447
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:54,940
I hope it does not explode.

2448
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:55,940
Okay.

2449
02:26:55,940 --> 02:26:56,940
It's going clang, clang.

2450
02:26:56,940 --> 02:26:59,940
I think it's dying down a little bit.

2451
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:06,940
And I guess the appeal of posting is that sometimes you post a banger tweet and people love it.

2452
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:09,940
And you feel something for once.

2453
02:27:09,940 --> 02:27:12,940
That's really the extent of it.

2454
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:16,940
Yeah, there are people on there that have, that say funny things that make me laugh.

2455
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:20,940
And there are people on there that say good opinions that I agree with.

2456
02:27:20,940 --> 02:27:25,940
And there's people on there who say bad opinions that I don't agree with and I yell at them.

2457
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:26,940
And that's it, man.

2458
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,940
Like, what more is there to say?

2459
02:27:29,940 --> 02:27:33,940
That's how, that's what it, that's what it do.

2460
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:38,940
Next voicemail is a NicoVideo.jp.

2461
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,940
So many links.

2462
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:41,940
Link?

2463
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:43,940
I don't, yeah.

2464
02:27:46,940 --> 02:27:48,940
NicoVideo.

2465
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:52,940
Is this the Japanese YouTube or something?

2466
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:54,940
Yeah, I think so.

2467
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:55,940
Okay.

2468
02:27:55,940 --> 02:27:56,940
Let's try it.

2469
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:57,940
Try it as long.

2470
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:58,940
All right, I'm starting it.

2471
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:07,940
Okay.

2472
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:10,940
So you two poop.

2473
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:11,940
All right.

2474
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:13,940
I think I get it.

2475
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:18,940
Skipping ahead a little bit and yep, it's more of the same.

2476
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:19,940
Okay.

2477
02:28:19,940 --> 02:28:20,940
Okay.

2478
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:21,940
That's fun.

2479
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:22,940
That's pretty fun.

2480
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:23,940
That's pretty fun.

2481
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:24,940
I agree with that.

2482
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:25,940
I agree with that.

2483
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:26,940
Absolutely.

2484
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:27,940
I endorse it.

2485
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:28,940
Yeah.

2486
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,940
Next one is called Dacotes.

2487
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:33,940
Three, two, one, go.

2488
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:34,940
Hey, PCP.

2489
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:39,940
Is it cringe that I like the dick show but also like the procrastinators?

2490
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:44,940
I don't, I don't like Trixie, so that's a plus rate.

2491
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:46,940
I don't like Dick Masterson.

2492
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:50,940
I don't listen to the show, so I don't really have anything to say about whether it's like

2493
02:28:50,940 --> 02:28:52,940
a good show or not.

2494
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:58,940
I used to listen to it and I guess Dick has like a certain charisma.

2495
02:28:58,940 --> 02:29:00,940
It's fun to hear him yell about.

2496
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:01,940
Sure.

2497
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:02,940
Like rant.

2498
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:04,940
I've heard clips of him yelling.

2499
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:07,940
I've heard clips of him yelling that are like pretty funny.

2500
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:08,940
Yeah.

2501
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:10,940
It's fine.

2502
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:11,940
A lot of what he believes is a cringe.

2503
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:12,940
I hate him on Twitter.

2504
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:14,940
A lot of the guests he has are terrible.

2505
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:15,940
I hate him.

2506
02:29:15,940 --> 02:29:16,940
I hate him on Twitter.

2507
02:29:16,940 --> 02:29:17,940
Do you ever see his Twitter?

2508
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:18,940
He sucks so bad on Twitter.

2509
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:19,940
Yeah.

2510
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:20,940
Yeah.

2511
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:21,940
I hate that.

2512
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:25,940
I hate that when someone's funny and then they suck shit and they're a terrible person

2513
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:26,940
and you find out through Twitter.

2514
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:28,940
That's how it was with Cecil McFly.

2515
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:29,940
Fuck Cecil McFly.

2516
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:32,940
Yeah.

2517
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:36,940
So, but maybe, I don't know, whatever.

2518
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:37,940
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

2519
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:38,940
I have no opinion about the show.

2520
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:41,940
Hey man, just do, do what you gotta do.

2521
02:29:42,940 --> 02:29:43,940
Just do what you gotta do.

2522
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:46,940
Just like the song in Leprechaun in the Hood.

2523
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:48,940
Do what you gotta do.

2524
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:51,940
Does that have a goes?

2525
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:52,940
Just like that?

2526
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:53,940
That's shit.

2527
02:29:53,940 --> 02:29:54,940
Yeah, memory bubble.

2528
02:29:54,940 --> 02:29:57,940
Yeah, that's, I think that's their song.

2529
02:29:57,940 --> 02:30:01,940
I don't know if it plays at the beginning or the, do, you got, it's just do what you gotta do.

2530
02:30:01,940 --> 02:30:03,940
You gotta do what you gotta do.

2531
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:04,940
Like that's the chorus.

2532
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:06,940
The Leprechaun in the Hood.

2533
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:11,940
I think it plays at the beginning because I think it's sort of about, because then they

2534
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:16,940
do what they gotta do because they rob, I think it's iced tea.

2535
02:30:16,940 --> 02:30:19,940
I think it's iced tea who plays the rich guy that they rob.

2536
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:24,940
And then they get the Leprechauns gold from, yeah.

2537
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:28,940
Great movie, great movie, Leprechaun in the Hood.

2538
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:30,940
Do what you gotta do.

2539
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:31,940
It's true.

2540
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:32,940
You gotta do what you gotta do.

2541
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:38,940
You know, they were robbing the rich to give to the poor, and the poor was themselves.

2542
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:39,940
But that's fine.

2543
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:43,940
That's, yeah, everybody, you gotta start somewhere, right?

2544
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:47,940
Next voicemail is Applejack.

2545
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:49,940
Three, two, one, go.

2546
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:15,940
She's really opening up.

2547
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:22,940
Is it? No.

2548
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:25,940
No!

2549
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:46,940
Perhaps you have some friends that have lost you and need to be reminded that you were

2550
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:47,940
there.

2551
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:50,940
The holiday season is a great time to make amends.

2552
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:54,940
Grab a drink and resolve your differences, as long as you don't go overboard.

2553
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:57,940
Thanks for speaking, Doctor.

2554
02:31:57,940 --> 02:32:00,940
I'll make sure to bootleg you a copy of Phantom's Revenge.

2555
02:32:00,940 --> 02:32:02,940
It's good to be helping.

2556
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:04,940
It's no way.

2557
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:05,940
How?

2558
02:32:06,940 --> 02:32:09,940
They got a Dr. Wolf voice modulator?

2559
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:12,940
Yeah, how, how can such a thing exist?

2560
02:32:13,940 --> 02:32:19,940
I mean, I guess all you need is, like, input and, like, a computer AI to, like, understand

2561
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:21,940
what is, like, he's got a bunch of videos.

2562
02:32:21,940 --> 02:32:22,940
You put them in.

2563
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:24,940
I don't know how a person does that.

2564
02:32:24,940 --> 02:32:26,940
I don't know what you need, like, to buy a software.

2565
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:29,940
I didn't know that was, like, a thing you could do.

2566
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:33,940
Just, like, feed a voice into an algorithm.

2567
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:35,940
Huh.

2568
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:36,940
Yeah, I guess.

2569
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:37,940
They've done it with Donald Trump and Obama.

2570
02:32:37,940 --> 02:32:38,940
They've done it with...

2571
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:39,940
But Dr. Wolf is not...

2572
02:32:39,940 --> 02:32:40,940
I'm just...

2573
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:41,940
Who would have done that?

2574
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:46,940
I guess someone, someone just was like, I guess I'll just fucking make an algorithmically

2575
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:50,940
generated voice modulator program for Dr. Wolf.

2576
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:55,940
Uh, Applejack, you gotta see other, you gotta see other doctors.

2577
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:59,940
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta get a better therapist.

2578
02:32:59,940 --> 02:33:02,940
Uh, funny, funny story, you know?

2579
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:06,940
That's a really funny image that Applejack is calling in saying I'm depressed and I speak to my therapist.

2580
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:11,940
I was, I didn't, I didn't see it coming until the very last second when she's like,

2581
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:12,940
I'm gonna put him on the line.

2582
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:14,940
I was like, who's it gonna be?

2583
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:15,940
Oh my god, it's Dr. Wolf.

2584
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:18,940
When she was just talking about, like, see your therapist,

2585
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:21,940
like, it didn't, it didn't put it together for me at all.

2586
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:22,940
Uh, Wolf.

2587
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:23,940
Okay.

2588
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:26,940
Uh, I gotta say, this is a bit, this is a little bit of a spoiler,

2589
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:28,940
but I guess I'll just say, cause it's funny,

2590
02:33:28,940 --> 02:33:31,940
Dr. Wolf is in Phantom's Revenge.

2591
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:32,940
Oh no.

2592
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:34,940
He's in there.

2593
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:35,940
He's in there.

2594
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:36,940
So.

2595
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:37,940
No.

2596
02:33:37,940 --> 02:33:38,940
Watch out, Doc.

2597
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:41,940
Uh, your days are fucking numbered.

2598
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:45,940
Oh, now, now with this, this technology, you could have the voice acted lines.

2599
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:48,940
Oh, but just for Dr. Wolf.

2600
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:51,940
Just Dr. Wolf, just him.

2601
02:33:51,940 --> 02:33:53,940
Uh, very good.

2602
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:54,940
Thanks, Applejack.

2603
02:33:54,940 --> 02:33:56,940
Uh, thanks for opening up.

2604
02:33:56,940 --> 02:34:01,940
Uh, doesn't, doesn't, doesn't just because you need a little help from time to time.

2605
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:05,940
So I'm glad you learned the lesson from that one episode.

2606
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:08,940
What's that one episode where she won't ask for help?

2607
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:10,940
Is it AppleBuck season?

2608
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:12,940
Motherfucking season.

2609
02:34:12,940 --> 02:34:14,940
Motherfucking season.

2610
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:16,940
I think it's AppleBuck season.

2611
02:34:16,940 --> 02:34:19,940
The one where she's like, she's got to harvest all the apples herself.

2612
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:22,940
Yeah, that would, that would be the one where she's like,

2613
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:27,940
I just got to do all these things and I just got to do all of them.

2614
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:30,940
Applejack is okay to ask for help.

2615
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:31,940
Oh.

2616
02:34:31,940 --> 02:34:33,940
No, shut up.

2617
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:37,940
Get the fuck out of here, you filthy, you're not, you don't know our,

2618
02:34:37,940 --> 02:34:39,940
you don't know our earth pony ways.

2619
02:34:39,940 --> 02:34:41,940
Go back to where you came from.

2620
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:43,940
We harvest our own apples.

2621
02:34:43,940 --> 02:34:47,940
Askin' others to harvest your apples for you is communism twilight.

2622
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:48,940
What do they teach you?

2623
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:53,940
What do they teach you with that damn unicorn school in Canterlot?

2624
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:55,940
That's what it's like.

2625
02:34:55,940 --> 02:34:58,940
Die, Applejack, and then she kills her.

2626
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:03,940
That's how my version, that's how my version would go.

2627
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:08,940
Teaching, teaching, teaching the, the egg, the egg heads in Canterlot.

2628
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:11,940
Marxist theory, critical race theory.

2629
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:14,940
Fuck you, fuck unicorns.

2630
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:16,940
Okay.

2631
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:22,940
Next voicemail is called Ben Saint of the Third.

2632
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:25,940
Three, two, one, go.

2633
02:35:25,940 --> 02:35:28,940
I had a funny dream last night, you want to hear it?

2634
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:29,940
Absolutely.

2635
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:35,940
So I had a dream for you, Gib, Trixie, and Nate for all together,

2636
02:35:35,940 --> 02:35:38,940
for how to party or something.

2637
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:39,940
And I was there interviewing.

2638
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:40,940
It would never happen.

2639
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:43,940
And Trixie was like, yeah, me and Nate, me and Nate and Gib were all

2640
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:46,940
partying last night when it was the bomb.

2641
02:35:46,940 --> 02:35:49,940
And Ben was invited, fuck him.

2642
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:53,940
And I'm like, how do you feel about Nate and Gib?

2643
02:35:53,940 --> 02:35:57,940
And she's like, I think I'm going to make them a member of Gib Studio.

2644
02:35:57,940 --> 02:35:59,940
I'm like, that's a good idea.

2645
02:35:59,940 --> 02:36:01,940
That's a good idea.

2646
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:03,940
Fuck.

2647
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:08,940
And then the party ended and you were just like, well, fuck this.

2648
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:11,940
I'm going to go hang out with Lupin the third.

2649
02:36:11,940 --> 02:36:16,940
So you got a giant truck and for whatever reason, the police were chasing you

2650
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:18,940
and you're on, we're on the ocean by the way.

2651
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:20,940
Because I was hanging out with Lupin.

2652
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:23,940
Shooting bullets and everything.

2653
02:36:23,940 --> 02:36:26,940
And I was like, yo, pick me up when you just drove by me.

2654
02:36:26,940 --> 02:36:28,940
And then it ended.

2655
02:36:28,940 --> 02:36:29,940
Yeah.

2656
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:31,940
Left you in a war zone.

2657
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:33,940
That's great.

2658
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:35,940
That's great.

2659
02:36:35,940 --> 02:36:37,940
Oh, I can't.

2660
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:38,940
I can't.

2661
02:36:38,940 --> 02:36:40,940
We mean I can't join Yig Studios.

2662
02:36:40,940 --> 02:36:42,940
Oh, geez.

2663
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:43,940
Fine.

2664
02:36:43,940 --> 02:36:45,940
I'm going to hang it with my friend Lupin.

2665
02:36:46,940 --> 02:36:49,940
That was your plan B.

2666
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:52,940
Your plan A was always to be in Yig Studios.

2667
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:54,940
Plan A was Yig Studios.

2668
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:58,940
Plan B is to join Lupin's Band of Thieves.

2669
02:36:58,940 --> 02:37:01,940
Sure.

2670
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:04,940
I enjoyed that a lot.

2671
02:37:04,940 --> 02:37:05,940
All right.

2672
02:37:05,940 --> 02:37:06,940
Next one.

2673
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:08,940
Is this the last one?

2674
02:37:08,940 --> 02:37:09,940
Let me refresh the page.

2675
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:10,940
Yeah.

2676
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:13,940
Last one is called I Love Trixie.

2677
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:16,940
Three, two, one, go.

2678
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:21,940
Oh, my God.

2679
02:37:21,940 --> 02:37:23,940
Lol.

2680
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:25,940
That's farts.

2681
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:26,940
That's good.

2682
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:27,940
That's good.

2683
02:37:27,940 --> 02:37:28,940
That's good.

2684
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:33,940
Well, that sounds, that's an appropriate note to end on.

2685
02:37:33,940 --> 02:37:35,940
I think.

2686
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:36,940
Yes.

2687
02:38:06,940 --> 02:38:13,940
Have a merry Christmas and a happy holiday.

2688
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:15,940
Merry Christmas.

2689
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:17,940
Happy holidays.

2690
02:38:17,940 --> 02:38:19,940
Merry Christmas Eve.

2691
02:38:19,940 --> 02:38:21,940
Hope you have a fucking good time.

2692
02:38:21,940 --> 02:38:24,940
If you don't celebrate Christmas, fuck you.

2693
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:26,940
This is America.

2694
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:28,940
Wherever you live, this is America.

2695
02:38:28,940 --> 02:38:29,940
We do.

2696
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:31,940
We worship God in this house.

2697
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:35,940
It's like Donald Lover's Childish Gambino song.

2698
02:38:35,940 --> 02:38:39,940
This is America, but with like sleigh bells in the background.

2699
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:42,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2700
02:38:42,940 --> 02:38:45,940
And this is America, bitch.

2701
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:47,940
Get under the fucking tree.

2702
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:48,940
Get in my fucking stocking.

2703
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:51,940
Get up my fucking chimney.

It's a nice face.

2729
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:53,940
It's a nice little face.

2730
02:39:53,940 --> 02:39:56,940

There's a couple other mostly it's Phantom that talks in the game, but there's a few

02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:09,940
other characters that talk.

02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:10,940
It's pretty.

That's it.

All right.

2739
02:40:15,940 --> 02:40:16,940
I got to get out of here.

2740
02:40:16,940 --> 02:40:22,940
I got to go give a fucking stupid gift to a guy I barely know.

2741
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:27,940
Uh, well, uh, let's fucking get out of here.

Ching, ching, ching, ching.

Ellies are put in sleigh bells.

02:40:37,940 --> 02:40:38,940
Sleigh bells.

2751
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:39,940
Snow sounds.

2752

Just loads, loads of sleigh bells.

2753
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:42,940
Too many.
