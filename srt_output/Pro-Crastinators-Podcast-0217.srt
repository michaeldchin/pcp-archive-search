00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Hello everyone and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We're the reason people are dying

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,480
and you're the reason that we exist. No, that's not true.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,440
It skits true. No, it's true.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,680
It's sort of true. It's entirely true.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,400
I'll give it to them. They can take credit for everything we've done.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,760
How's everyone's week been? Another week of no fucking videos on the channel.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,960
Thanks, YouTube. Love you.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Thanks, YouTube.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,320
My favorite, the best. I'm so glad we tethered our existence to this hellscape.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,240
They just keep saying, yeah, we'll work on it. And then, I don't know.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,360
Yeah, for the time being, these are all going to be audio only, but when I hope the channel

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,360
is cleansed of stupid shit and we can post things safely again, they'll all come out

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,680
at once. Most people will be like, okay, I'll skip them.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,800
Yeah. Most people who end up hearing this will hear it weeks later. Assuming they come

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,480
out at all. Assuming that the channel doesn't just get obliterated again.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,160
And we just never return to YouTube. We just spur them for life and like, fuck you.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,760
Why don't we just go full paywall? We don't need to go full paywall. We can have it free

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,000
on a website like every other podcast. I know we don't have to go full paywall.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,160
I'm just saying, why not? You know?

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,400
You know, when you say it, I suddenly agree. As long as you say it.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,920
Yeah, I did.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,080
I don't know about paywalls, but I do like the word pay. So I'll sign off on it just

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
for that reason.

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,600
That's my logic as well.

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,320
Okay, cool.

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,520
I want to start off with a follow-up to what I was saying last time about suicide because

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,080
I had more ideas.

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
I've missed the juicy one.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,600
More ideas about how to kill yourself?

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:22,240
No, no, no, no, no. It was about what I said about the idea of guilt, of inconveniencing

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,240
other people being the reason you stay alive is a bad thing. You shouldn't feel guilt.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
That's bad.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,960
What you could interpret from that is that time to, you know, like if you're not worrying

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,120
about inconveniencing yourself, you may as well just go and do it.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,040
No, no, no, no. It's not what I mean. The idea was you're alive and you're really sad,

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,360
so you want to die. But you think about where you're going to die, like jumping off a bridge

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,720
or that ruins loads of people's day. Like your parents are going to be upset. Everyone's

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
going to be sad. It's like, oh, I don't want to feel, I don't want to make people upset.

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
That's not what, you know.

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,000
Sorry, I couldn't hear you for a minute there. Could you recap what you were just saying?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm just recapping what I was saying last time about guilt being a reason you stay alive.

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,360
And I think the reason guilt is a bad thing as a reason to stay alive is because it allows

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,320
you to not do anything. It is like a coward's way out in a strange way, because if you are

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
really sad with your life and everything sucks.

45
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,920
It's the coward's way out of the coward's way out.

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, it is a way for you to say, well, I'm really sad and I want to die, but I can't

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,400
because of this, because I can't make people upset. And it sort of prevents you from forcing

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:57,840
yourself to ask the question of why live. And usually the solution to why live is happiness

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,520
or something like that. But the point I'm getting at is that if you're forced to ask

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:10,440
that question, you are going to be more proactive in making the solution, i.e. improving your

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,840
life to a point where you aren't sad anymore. And if you rely on the whole guilt thing to

52
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,800
keep you tethered to this mortal coil, you'll just be sad and be alive instead of trying

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,680
to improve yourself. That's my big suicide thought for the day.

54
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:39,680
So why live, hippo? Tell me. What's it all for?

55
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Anime. Yeah. That's all I needed to hear.

56
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Fuck. So I just watched Premiere last night. It was pretty cool. It definitely gave me a

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,520
reason to live. Oh yeah? Anime is pretty based, yeah.

58
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,120
That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. I almost watched Isoken, but then I was like,

59
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,520
that sounds boring. No, cool. It's so good.

60
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,520
You stupid shit. That's like the back of man of anime.

61
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Okay. I was just, I was like, that's a back of man of creativity.

62
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,920
I was like, Ben, you know how you read bakuman? You're like, this is so fucking cool. But

63
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,720
at the same time, it's not me like, like this is really cool to see how like my favorite

64
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,920
manga is made. But like, I would never work like this. I would never be in this industry

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,920
because I'm not Japanese and I'm also not a professional. Like I just don't.

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Isoken is like, oh, this is my brain autism. Like this is, this is how I think. It's just

67
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,920
like a random girl who's just like, I have big dreams and I'm going to make them happen.

68
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:51,920
And it's very much like exactly how us kind of people think. A small grassroots idea of

69
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,120
wanting to make something sick and just like being totally lost in their own head and then

70
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,120
like an actual smart, intelligent person with like business acumen, like slapping some sense

71
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,120
into that creative retardedness and being like, okay, we got to aim this in this direction

72
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,120
and make something actually happen. It's genius. It's brilliant. It's perfect.

73
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,120
It's okay from from bakuman who's like always depressed and says, oh, I can't do it. And

74
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,320
he has that one guy, his producer or whatever, who says, do it idiot. It's that.

75
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Oh, he's my favorite. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Okay, that's all fine. Does it take place in high school?

77
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,320
No, it takes place in. It does take place in high school, but it is a like a very cool

78
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,320
like location. It's like made up.

79
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
But are they high schoolers?

80
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,520
They're in school, but like it's it's a silly school. It's like this.

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,520
You're a fucking silly school.

82
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,520
It's like it takes place in school just because they're young.

83
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
It has nothing to do with school at all.

84
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Oh, that's okay. I hate that.

85
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
But all right.

86
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
They're going into the career world. That's part of the whole thing.

87
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,520
They're abusing and utilizing the advantages of being in school to get to kick a career.

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Ben, Ben, the first the first big thing of this show is like how the school system is

89
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
hampering them and is keeping them down and is bad.

90
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Yeah.

91
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Okay, I just hate young people.

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
You know, that's fair.

93
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I just hate them, but like that's just anime.

94
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,720
You know, they don't act like young people, though.

95
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,720
That's that's really the thing is that the characters anyone can relate to from any age.

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
I get it. I get it.

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
I get it.

98
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
This ageism is not very progressive.

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I was I was just like it was I was just like maybe I should watch something and I was like

100
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
what's something people have told me is good.

101
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Oh, I heard Isaac is pretty good.

102
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,920
But am I really willing to commit to watching a show?

103
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
No.

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
And that was my and that was what happened is a bit is a big ask.

105
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
It is a big ask.

106
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I can't do it.

107
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Guys, guys.

108
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
I have flowers to take care of.

109
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
I have a much smaller time commitment.

110
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I haven't played Animal Crossing in like weeks.

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,120
I might I'm sure that I'm sure that Yaki Tori Island has gone to complete shit.

112
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
I hate art, guys.

113
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
I hate it.

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
It's it's bad.

115
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
It's all bad.

116
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
I mean, you're wrong.

117
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
What is the fucking point of it?

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
There is no point.

119
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Yeah, exercise and narcissism.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,120
It's just a fucking it's just a distraction.

121
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
It's just a waste of time.

122
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
It's all bullshit.

123
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
It's all it's all vanity.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,320
You know, then it comes and steam rolls it anyway.

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
So what's the point?

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Yeah.

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I don't like it.

128
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
It's annoying.

129
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,320
It asks things of me when I see content.

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm like, God, the absolute gall, the gall that this person has to expect me to to consume

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
this thing that they made.

132
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Despicable.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm insulted.

134
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,120
See, I have been on a kick of completely the opposite mentality recently.

135
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I guess this is Gibbs being a stupid fucking idiot corner.

136
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
So play that funny thing again.

137
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Hit it.

138
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,120
This is the stupid idiot corner.

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Hi, stupid idiot.

140
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Because of the the manga stuff, the Clarissa, the the struggles, I've been like,

141
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
I don't have anything in my brain.

142
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I don't know how to make anything.

143
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,720
I just I figured out the solution or I was told the solution.

144
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I don't remember whether it was my idea or not.

145
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,920
But I've been binging cool movies that I've been told about and I've been researching

146
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,920
and I've been looking up directors names and what that influenced them and going back in

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
time to like the 1920s.

148
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,120
And I've just been it's just so fun to watch films with the intent of gaining a bit of

149
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,320
knowledge from them as to how to be cool and make my own cool art.

150
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,120
And I've basically been watching a bunch of Westerns.

151
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
I started with the good, the bad and the ugly because that's like the big one that I've

152
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
heard of.

153
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,320
And I've been going from that backwards to Akira Kurosawa with Seven Samurai and all

154
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,920
his like Western inspired samurai films that inspired Sergio Leone.

155
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,920
And then you go back from Akira Kurosawa to John Ford and things like Stagecoach and

156
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,920
and High Noon and all these old shit, black and white, even silent films.

157
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
It's great.

158
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I love art.

159
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,920
I love seeing how things have inspired people and what is like considered a classic master

160
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
piece.

161
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
And I'm like looking at it.

162
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,320
I love art so much.

163
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,920
Anything made like today sucks.

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Anything made like a year ago sucks.

165
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Everything that is not old is bad.

166
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Old good new bad.

167
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Yeah.

168
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Yeah.

169
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Yeah.

170
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Old good.

171
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Like it's old.

172
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
And I've heard of it.

173
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
It's old and good because I've heard of it and it's old.

174
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
That's true.

175
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
Okay.

176
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
I mean, that's pretty persuasive argument, I guess.

177
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,920
So like Akira Kurosawa, the Seven Samurai, heard of that a lot.

178
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Yeah.

179
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
It's really good.

180
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
It's my favorite anime.

181
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
The Kikucho, or whoever you say it, Kikucho, Kikucho.

182
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
They say it real quick in Japanese.

183
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Those guys, they speak real quick.

184
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Okay.

185
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,920
But he is like my favorite character archetype.

186
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Which one?

187
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
The like wandering guy?

188
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,920
The sort of crazy guy with the biggest sword and the scowling and the jumping and the screaming.

189
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Yeah.

190
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Yeah.

191
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I think that's like my favorite.

192
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I think that's the only Kurosawa I've seen.

193
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
I think I've seen any.

194
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
But M.Dot talks about Seven Samurai all the time.

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,920
How is a huge influence on like, maybe I should watch that.

196
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
And it's been like 15 years and I still haven't done it yet.

197
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Yeah.

198
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
You can find it pretty easily.

199
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
I googled things.

200
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,920
I found like a whole free version on a like a criterion collection archive website thing.

201
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Dude, archive.org has like tons of shit.

202
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Like, I've just been like watching all the Godzilla movies again.

203
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,920
You just go on archive.org and they have 1080p uploads of like every Godzilla movie ever.

204
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm like, oh my God.

205
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Why would I ever buy things ever?

206
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
This is so stupid.

207
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Yeah.

208
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
It's all just right.

209
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,920
That's the other cool thing about all of shit is that it's free.

210
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
You can just have it.

211
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Nobody cares.

212
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
It is pretty good.

213
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Yeah.

214
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
All right.

215
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
All right.

216
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
We're coming around.

217
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I was coming.

218
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,920
I was going in these old like Westerns and I was like, oh, inspired by a novel.

219
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
You know what?

220
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,920
The next step for my like research, my artistic smart boy research is like, imagine me in a

221
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
library reading.

222
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,920
So I'm going to read books based on like the inspired these Western films from the 1920s.

223
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
And they're just all free on online.

224
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,920
They're just PDFs, like links upon links of free PDFs of books and e-books.

225
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I just have them.

226
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I just have them now.

227
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
It's so easy.

228
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Too much power.

229
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Too much power.

230
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Why get an audible account?

231
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Why?

232
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Why would you ever pay money for anything when all of this free shit exists?

233
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
That's the whole thing.

234
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
You just get sucked into that.

235
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Oh, it's so easy.

236
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,920
I can just pay Amazon more money and make Jeff Bezos even richer and get access to all these

237
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
books.

238
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
But it's just like, no, it's all here.

239
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
It's all here to be stolen.

240
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
And that's the way it should be.

241
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,920
I guess I was going to, I guess I'm sort of supposed to read debt again for the, for

242
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Munchies book club.

243
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
I said I would do it, but I haven't done it yet.

244
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I keep getting notifications from that.

245
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
And I'm just like, hmm, no, I've got other things to do.

246
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I'm going to stay uncultured and safe.

247
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Yeah.

248
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Stupid.

249
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Stupid ass.

250
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
That's me.

251
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I've been on, I've been, so I hate art now.

252
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,920
This coincides with me actually starting to make some again.

253
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
You know, it's bad.

254
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Like all art is bad.

255
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
But I keep, I keep doing it.

256
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,920
I've, I've actually guys, I've actually made progress on fucking slime and punishment

257
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
finale.

258
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
It's actually getting done again.

259
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Holy shit.

260
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I know.

261
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
I know.

262
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
I will be so fucking relieved.

263
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I'll be so fucking relieved to have that done.

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I'll be relieved when I get my fucking Vapors book.

265
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Vapors book.

266
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Munchie.

267
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Munchie or a Kazi is done with her, her thing.

268
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Oh yeah, I saw.

269
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Munchie is almost, wait, you saw hers?

270
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Where?

271
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I saw her say that she finished.

272
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Oh, okay.

273
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Okay.

274
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Munchie is like getting close to being done and then Jade, I don't know where Jade is.

275
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to pick on her some more.

276
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
That's fair.

277
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Yeah.

278
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
But it's getting there.

279
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
It's getting, it's getting there.

280
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Things, things by, by, by waiting long enough, I made it happen.

281
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Things are looking up.

282
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
You know,

283
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Excellent.

284
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
It only took months of inaction for something to happen.

285
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
That's sometimes that's what it takes.

286
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Yeah.

287
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Yeah.

288
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Yeah.

289
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Speaking of months of inaction, I wanted to announce before I forget that when, when you

290
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,920
have five listeners who ventured away from the YouTube plantation to find us on the outskirts

291
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
of Google podcasts or iTunes or wherever.

292
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,920
So I want to let you know that as of you're listening to this, all of the radcon for rewards

293
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
will be in transit to you.

294
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
No.

295
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
They're shit.

296
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
They are packed.

297
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
They are done.

298
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,920
The only things that are not taken care of yet are those large posters because those have

299
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
to be packed separately.

300
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
They're at Digi's.

301
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,920
She refuses to send them to me.

302
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
I don't know when that will be resolved, but everything else is packed.

303
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Everything in my possession that I had control over directly with my responsible boy powers

304
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,920
has been created, packed, labeled, assembled and shipped.

305
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
It will be in transit.

306
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
People are already getting them.

307
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,920
You can see on Twitter people are already getting their packages.

308
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I saw somebody go to a pin.

309
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Did you also do the calendar?

310
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
I did.

311
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
The calendars are done.

312
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Oh, shit.

313
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
I have extras.

314
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,920
So if you guys want to frame our debauchery all the time, how do they look?

315
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Oh, no, no, no.

316
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
I don't want a calendar.

317
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
They look pretty damn good.

318
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I like that.

319
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
The print quality is better than I was anticipating.

320
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
We got a really good deal on them.

321
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I haggled them down.

322
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
It was pretty good.

323
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Oh, shit.

324
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I just realized one of those calendars coming to my house because my brother pledged.

325
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Yep.

326
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
I packed that up.

327
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I saw that.

328
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Oh, no.

329
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
He's going to have.

330
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Oh, I cut him.

331
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Think about it.

332
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
All of next year, you go into his room.

333
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
It's going to be there mocking you.

334
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Well, only on some of them months, hopefully.

335
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
I want to see.

336
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,920
I want to see post a picture of the calendar for me so I can.

337
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,920
I can go grab one and take a picture of my phone.

338
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
I mean, I guess there's no hurry.

339
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
If you care that much.

340
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
And I said, I don't care that much.

341
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
I'll see you eventually.

342
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Der.

343
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
What?

344
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
What are the rewards were there?

345
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
There was the pin.

346
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
There was the shirt.

347
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
There was the calendar.

348
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
The pin is the pin.

349
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,920
There was the small poster, which and then there's the larger poster, which is signed.

350
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
And I remember if there was anything else.

351
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
That's pretty much it.

352
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,920
It was not a whole lot in terms of physical items.

353
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,920
What about PC pennies?

354
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Meetup only.

355
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Oh, meetup only.

356
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Okay, that's right.

357
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
That's right.

358
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Collect his items.

359
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Do you want to talk about like progress that's been made on the other things that were funded?

360
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Is there much to even talk about yet?

361
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
I feel like we're still kind of.

362
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Well, I was going to.

363
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I didn't ask in the chat earlier, but I was I was going to ask about the the the OVA.

364
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
I mean, like we were doing.

365
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
There was progress there.

366
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
There was progress.

367
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Yeah.

368
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
And I haven't heard anything about it a little while.

369
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Okay.

370
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I need to follow up on that.

371
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,920
It's the, I don't know how much to say, but like the OP is like an animation OP.

372
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
That's that's the thing we're currently working on.

373
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Yeah, I'm talking to people about it.

374
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,920
And it's just because it took a while to get sorted.

375
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,920
The people who we had have like other work.

376
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Oh, no.

377
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,920
So like they're just being slower, but it's it'll happen.

378
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Don't worry about it.

379
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Okay.

380
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,920
I did post some.

381
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I did.

382
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
I did leak a little bit.

383
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,920
I did leak a little bit on my on my on my Patreon.

384
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Just just a little just a little smidge just a little smidgen of my own shit.

385
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
It's fine.

386
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Nobody owns me.

387
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
No one can tell me what to do.

388
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Damn destroyed.

389
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
You're not nobody.

390
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
You're not cops.

391
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Don't be a cop.

392
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
But I'm really stoked about that.

393
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
I was looking.

394
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Well, I you say you say it's like they've got other work and it's slowed down.

395
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
That's that's gay.

396
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
It was looking pretty cool.

397
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Last night.

398
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Yeah.

399
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I don't think we've talked anything about this publicly yet.

400
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I really should.

401
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Should we not?

402
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Should we not?

403
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Should I not have brought it up?

404
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
It's fine.

405
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
It's whatever.

406
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Everybody knows it's coming.

407
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
Like they played.

408
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
We did.

409
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
We did promise it.

410
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah.

411
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Yeah.

412
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
All right.

413
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Well, I'll speak.

414
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
We don't we don't we don't we don't have to go.

415
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,920
We don't have to go into like any specifics about what it is.

416
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
No, no, no.

417
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Yeah.

418
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Yeah.

419
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Because I don't want to make it seem worse than it is at the moment.

420
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,920
We have been getting like character designs like us as anime characters.

421
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Designed based on what we look like in in our silly like OVA designs.

422
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,920
Oh, it's those have been worked on those are looking pretty great and they're basically

423
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
done after that.

424
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:19,920
The next phase is to start the the storyboard and animation and it shouldn't take too long

425
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
once we get started.

426
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,920
It's just that the character designer is the person who has got other work while they

427
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,920
were waiting for us to to like give feedback on the tweaks of like, oh, this character

428
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
needs this more of this and that.

429
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,920
And then we've been there's been a back and forth process.

430
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Yeah.

431
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,920
But once the character designs are finalized, we can go to the animator and then we get

432
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
over what I've done.

433
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,920
That's why I made I made tweaks to mine.

434
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
And that was the last I ever heard of it.

435
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
I never saw them.

436
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,920
I never saw my my my very important changes implemented.

437
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Yes, that's the one I'm weighing on.

438
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,920
I follow up on my guys.

439
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,920
I'll say what my my notes were like a bigger tits have the tits bulging out of the top

440
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,920
please have them fucking sloshing around and fucking jutting out and just exploding out

441
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
of this thing.

442
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Have them be disgustingly big, but not big enough.

443
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
This is an embarrassment.

444
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Fix it right now.

445
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Also make the eyes purple.

446
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Purple's better.

447
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
But the bigger tits mostly.

448
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Thank you very much.

449
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Good night.

450
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I relayed all of I relayed all of your notes.

451
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Good, good.

452
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,920
And it was just like pages of that just typed in a Word document.

453
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I can't wait for the OVA to finally be finished and Ben finally gets it in his inbox.

454
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,920
He's just like, I can't be bothered to watch art and just doesn't look at it.

455
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Yeah, I won't.

456
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I won't fucking watch it.

457
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I can't be fucking bothered, but it's going to be it'll be a waste of my like how long

458
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
is going to be like a minute.

459
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
I can't I can't spare it.

460
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
One whole minute.

461
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
One whole minute.

462
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
No.

463
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,920
I have to spend that minute making.

464
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,920
I have to spend them in doing the Simon punishment finale.

465
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
My dudes, it's coming.

466
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
It's coming.

467
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
It looks really good.

468
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I've got I've gotten I'm getting fancy.

469
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
I'm doing some fancy cinema.

470
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm doing I'm doing cuts.

471
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
I'm doing swipes and fades.

472
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Yeah.

473
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Yeah.

474
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Timing.

475
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Oh man.

476
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Timing.

477
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Timing is really fun timing things to to happen again and just like you change a few frames

478
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
and you're like, oh, it works so much better.

479
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Yeah, I like that.

480
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
I have it all.

482
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
I don't have the music yet.

483
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm just kind of like putting it all together and like it's all like it can all be I'm going

484
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,920
to have to go back and like change the timing on everything.

485
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,920
So like make it fit to like the beat or whatever.

486
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Yeah.

487
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
I don't know about that.

488
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,360
I guess it depends on how much animation you're doing what do you mean when I was doing when I was doing belgap finale

489
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,520
I couldn't imagine animating or storyboarding anything before I knew what the song wasn't how long it was gonna be I

490
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,000
Had I had to have it finished and then I didn't want to wait too long for the song to be finished or like

491
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,240
Be good. Yeah, that's why it sucks

492
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I

493
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,280
Had well, I made the storyboard first and then um cuz um I was talking to I was talking to

494
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,640
Sixon six and was gonna do a little little music for it

495
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,320
And I gave him the the storyboard and I guess he was gonna fuck around with a make a little make a little tune for it or whatever

496
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,120
But so like the beats are already there and it's just a matter of like how long each one lasts

497
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,280
I've sort of been

498
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,520
I've sort of just kind of been putting everything together

499
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,640
With the assumption that like every like major like cut or event happens on every like four seconds or so

500
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,160
So everything is kind of like in a regular pattern

501
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,560
and um

502
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,080
I don't know. I'll just have to like fiddle with it when it's done

503
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,480
uh, or maybe if something needs to go on a little longer, I can just get like a

504
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,920
A

505
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,640
Little piece of the song to like just play a little longer or a little shorter or something or whatever. Yeah

506
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
I'll figure it out. I'm gonna figure it out as I go

507
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,960
Um looks really nice. It looks very it's very homestuck. It's very uh, it's very, um

508
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,920
It's a big kind of sure it's gonna be really cool. Thank you

509
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,360
It's it looks really cool. There's there's there's big it has a really good sense of scale

510
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
I think is what I've tried to capture

511
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
with it and I think I think it

512
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,400
It's got some nice little transition. I don't know. This is all stupid. This is all stupid to talk about this

513
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,160
Uh, if you'd like if you hadn't if you don't know what it looks like

514
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
It doesn't mean anything for me to say. Oh, yeah

515
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,080
Some really nice work. I did on those. Yeah, you know what guys? I'm just so cool. You know that? Yeah

516
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,320
Yeah, when this finally comes out someone will sync up the footage to this part of the podcast

517
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
And it's like we'll finally understand

518
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,640
I'll make sense now. Ben is an idiot. Ben doesn't know what he's talking about. I get it

519
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Uh, hell

520
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,400
I feel like I've been I've been stressing a little bit on on making this uh, Tezuka manga thing

521
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,040
The goodest it could possibly be. I don't want anyone to think I'm bad in any way and I'm constantly improving and

522
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,080
Oh, they couldn't possibly be a dud. It couldn't possibly be like all this effort wasted

523
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,480
No, it has to be the best thing ever. I have to win the contest. In fact, I

524
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,760
I'll kill myself if I don't win. That's what I've been saying every day every night before I go to bed

525
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,240
I say I'm gonna die. That's what I say

526
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,440
Uh, I think that's a healthy outlook. Yeah, that sounds really healthy. Definitely keep doing that. What have you been

527
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
doing to make it

528
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,000
Like what like give me give me a practical example

529
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Of like how you've been handling it

530
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,240
Well, uh, as I as it was saying

531
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,680
um

532
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,480
Watching a lot of films to get inspiration

533
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,240
uh

534
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
So

535
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,480
I'm getting a lot of western have you tried smoking weed?

536
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
No, no, no, no. It's much easier

537
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,880
Uh, then making art. Yes. I'm I'm sure it is watching movies

538
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,560
You can do both at the same time. I guess I guess

539
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,520
Yeah, I don't know where to find weed

540
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,000
I go out into the to the park and I cut like grass bits and roll it up into a thing

541
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,040
The answer is and then I smoke and it was not weed at all

542
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,800
It was I throw it down to in disgust go to the nearest college campus and look for any guy in a tie-dye shirt

543
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,720
And ask him

544
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,160
That's how you do it. Oh wait coronavirus never mind

545
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,440
Whoops, okay

546
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
All right, look for a guy in a tie-dye

547
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,040
Uh face mask

548
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,200
Tell tell tell me more you've been you've been stressing about the tessica thing

549
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,120
I've been stressing about it being good. Yeah, um

550
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,280
and I've been

551
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,680
Uh, first off I I spent a while a few like a week or so just thinking about ideas

552
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,120
scribbling down on bits of paper opening and closing notepad documents and google documents just

553
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,760
Trying to come up with ideas. I came up with some good things some bad things

554
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,520
And then I was like, okay, if I'm gonna be like punctual I need to

555
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,920
like move on

556
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Before I get too bogged down

557
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,360
And so I tried to start sketching it and then I realized I don't know what any of the west looks like

558
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,120
um

559
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,240
and uh

560
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,960
I think something some complication happened in the middle of june

561
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,640
I got depressed and I didn't do anything now. I've been watching films to get like

562
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
understanding of what the west is

563
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,280
Because I I I haven't seen that many western films even though I know that I like it and it's really cool

564
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,200
um

565
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
So I've been like gathering a

566
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
input so that I can output

567
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,800
Things so I can output art. I need to input what art looks like

568
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,880
You know, you can't you can't be a great artist unless you see great art. So

569
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,000
Um, I'm at this. I'm at the stage where I think I've seen enough films and I'm going to

570
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,880
really try

571
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,080
to

572
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,360
Make a a script that is better than the one I made before

573
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
and then sketch

574
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,920
and then

575
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Oh, I hope it's good

576
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Okay

577
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,200
I I don't know whether I answered your question or not. No

578
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
No

579
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,880
Not really not really. I don't know. I feel like june was like a weird month for me as well because like I

580
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,040
Had I started I started june with a contest, right? I had a contest on twitter my character design contest

581
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,080
Uh for an izumi project. I'm working on I got a bunch of people who submitted ideas. They were great

582
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,880
I think I'm actually going to rewrite the part of the script

583
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,440
I was going to have they had these characters in it because the designs were so good

584
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,040
And I want them to have a bigger role because it was a very small role before

585
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,720
uh

586
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,760
but

587
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,120
In the middle of working on this in june, I was like, oh god, I'm like so bad. I'm so bad. Everything sucks. This is bad

588
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,520
My ideas cannot be expressed properly with my baby's tier skills. So I just kind of stopped working on that project

589
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
I'm just been like consuming

590
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,960
Courses I have like my cg cookie subscription. I'm just like I got to learn everything

591
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,760
I got to learn all this stuff and get better and smarter and gooder

592
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,920
And I just kind of like dropped off the face of the planet

593
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,880
And I'm just trying to learn edge flow and topology

594
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,240
And I started learning 3d sculpting and I feel like I've become more powerful but not enough to actually

595
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,840
Coalesce the power into something usable. It's just like a sun exploding in my face

596
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,120
And I don't know how to control it and it's been very frustrating

597
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,000
But also kind of cool at the same time to be exposed all these new ideas and new ways of working that

598
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,560
At some point when I get dope enough will allow me to transcend

599
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,840
Time and space but until then I just stare in awe into the abyss beyond my comprehension that

600
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,480
That's what's been fucking me up is this

601
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,720
This obsession with gathering skill before making anything

602
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,320
Because it's like I feel like I'm going on that at the moment like when I did a few sketches

603
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,200
I had at one scene pretty firmly in my mind and I tried to draw it

604
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
um some of the things like how

605
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,160
It starts I wasn't sure about but I knew one moment in that scene

606
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,000
It's very clearly in my mind and I sketched it out and I drew a really really good panel

607
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,400
Like a really really good sequence of panels. It was like the best panel layout

608
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Individual images and it was a sketch and I just magically did it and I was like damn if I can do that

609
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,320
Everything has to be that good. I can't possibly like live with myself if

610
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,640
Like page one is not as good as this page all the pages have to be this good

611
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,560
And so everything that happens in page one. I have to fine-tune so that is like a perfectly realized

612
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,800
thing and I

613
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,360
I don't have the skills yet to make that work

614
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,240
I need to look at panel layouts and mangas and look at things and films and see like

615
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
How they how they block a scene and

616
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,480
Oh, no, everything. Oh, no

617
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,200
No, everything else just has to like get

618
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:21,000
Everything else just has to get you to the the the important part that you drew the good that you drew good

619
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,080
It's true. It doesn't all have to be good. It can all be bad. I don't know

620
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,160
I like this is not like my preferred work method. It is just what I am noticing

621
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
I'm doing is like obsessing over

622
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
gaining

623
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,640
power before I like make my move even though

624
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,600
It'll never it'll never just run out of time. It'll never be enough. Yeah

625
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,600
Yeah, I mean also that I like spent you can't live you can't live like this

626
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,240
I spent the first week of june like tweaking my zumi model to make it better

627
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,160
And I was like, all right sick

628
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,480
I like re-rigged it and I changed some of the the design and stuff and it looks really good

629
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,760
And then like a week later. It's like, I'm throwing this whole thing out. It sucks

630
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,840
I got to remake it from scratch now that I learned better. So it's just like I'm sure as soon as this is done

631
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,720
I'm gonna learn something else. I'm like, oh, this is garbage. I gotta do it again

632
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,000
It just never ends. It's always a constant

633
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,280
struggle

634
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,800
But like to go back to what you were saying give I think something it's like interesting because I was I noticed this while watching primary yesterday

635
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:26,440
Is that like they have these like ridiculously over-the-top choreographed action sequences that are just like full of like 3d and like camera rotation and dynamic perspective

636
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,240
And all this like ridiculous insane shit and I'm just sitting there like how did they fucking think of this?

637
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,360
but then like the dialogue stuff to get you in between those scenes it's like

638
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
static shots

639
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,440
Just what you need to get the point across and like a lot of the times the characters will animate in like two frames

640
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,360
Just for the sake of efficiency to like get us from point A to point B

641
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,360
And I think like all art does that right like you got to put your time

642
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,640
In the most important part. So if you have like a really cool scene that's like really well choreographed and like like

643
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,440
I've one or two pages of really intense shit

644
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,200
Like there's almost like a sense of flow where if you're firing on all cylinders the entire time

645
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,160
It's gonna loot that scene's gonna lose its impact. So if you have something more simple

646
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
Like adjacent to it

647
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,480
It makes that sudden dynamism hit way harder and that scene actually gets better by the stuff preceding it being

648
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,240
less

649
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,040
I don't want to say creative but like less dynamic almost

650
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,640
So yeah, it's not so much dynamic as in good. It's just sort of

651
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
When I do the sketches

652
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,160
One thing I know is that they need to be

653
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,400
Um

654
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,600
They need to be realized enough so that when I'm doing the line

655
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,160
I don't need to think I can just copy the lines

656
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
You can just draw what is there

657
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,160
and uh

658
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,680
This often happens with backgrounds where I don't care about what's in the background

659
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,520
Um, it's a character moving from one part of something to another part and I need a panel to show that they're doing that

660
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,200
um

661
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,560
And I draw the panel like a sketch like just a cuboid takes this much space out of the page

662
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Sure, then the next panel's here

663
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,520
Um, and when I sketch it, I'm like, I don't know if I can what where to put the character

664
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Here, I guess it's just sort of like

665
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,160
The panel exists and it's not very well

666
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,360
Realized in my mind as to what it should look like

667
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
and I've been

668
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,360
I don't know

669
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,920
It's it's hard to go over panels that I don't care about and try to make them

670
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Have a purpose

671
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Uh, I don't really know how to explain it

672
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,000
I think it's just

673
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,440
There are parts of the story that are just there as transition

674
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,360
As opposed to like you're super invested in because like there's always parts of a story

675
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,600
You're more excited to tell than other parts. There are parts that like kind of have to be there

676
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Then they're like the parts you're really excited about

677
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,760
um

678
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,440
I don't know. I guess I guess I just I dislike in in background specifically having

679
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,320
Oh the cuboid building with the square

680
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,240
Um holes in it that are windows. It is just a cuboid. It has no features is nothing

681
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,760
Um, I look at that and I'm like, oh, I suck. Why why is this building not a real building?

682
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
and so I sort of

683
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,680
Maybe I don't know if I overcompensate or

684
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,160
Slightly overcompensate, but I try to think what what is this building?

685
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
What is its use in this town?

686
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,320
Oh

687
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,120
Why is it in this location? What is next to it? Why is that next to it? How do this town come to be?

688
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,960
Why, you know, where's the water where they get the water from where they get the food from?

689
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,680
Uh, what are the what are the the natural barriers to entry?

690
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:45,720
Is there like a mountain range like I think of all these things and I feel like I can't depict anything until I know everything

691
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,080
I need to like plot out the entire area

692
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,560
And that's such a daunting task. I'm like, I don't want to plot out the entire area

693
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,600
Just so I can know what this building is supposed to look like you just you just got a you just got a

694
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,480
Just make shit up whatever you need there to be a mountain. Oh, yeah, there's a mountain

695
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,400
There's always been a mountain

696
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,800
We just never saw the the landscape from the right angle before but it was I mean one of the I always I I feel like I

697
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,120
need to make it

698
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
make um

699
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:21,480
Consistent sense like if you see a mountain from one window from one side of a building out the window

700
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,840
When you go out the building it should be on that same side of the building

701
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,000
I mean, I think that's that's not a bad thing for like your own mind to like keep the space consistent

702
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,920
But I don't I think a I don't think most people will even notice those kinds of things

703
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Um, which is not to say that it's not important to have spatial awareness of where your setting is

704
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,960
Um, but I just think sweating it too much might be more trouble than it's worth

705
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,080
But also like you're making a manga like a black and white manga

706
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,600
So like

707
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,640
99 of the time the panels won't even have backgrounds

708
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,640
You know because like a good a good question to ask yourself is like is this background serving a purpose, right?

709
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,120
Because like if you have a really detailed background like if you

710
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,440
Go and design your entire location and you know where every building is in every point the character is standing at and you go

711
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,800
And render out those buildings in exquisite detail

712
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
You're almost detracting from the center

713
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,240
Like point of the panel which is probably to show a character doing something

714
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,000
And you're you could risk adding too much visual clutter to the panel

715
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,960
So I think a lot of the times when manga chooses to not have a background and just have it be white

716
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,000
Like not only is that a time saving technique because they have like seven days to turn around like 20 pages

717
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,280
But it also keeps the focus of the reader on the character and any dialogue that might be spoken

718
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,640
And prevents their eyes from wandering around getting lost in extraneous details that might not serve the story

719
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,640
So just just be a vague right like any okay

720
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,800
Anything anything that's relevant to like the immediate story at hand that's happening right now

721
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,280
You should show in the panel

722
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,360
And anything that isn't relevant you like don't have to show so like

723
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:03,400
It doesn't it doesn't matter if like if like later on you decide like oh there was a uh that you had this this this

724
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,760
Place is in a it's in a volcano. This is in this is in a this is in a cave or whatever. I don't know

725
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Uh, you just you just don't

726
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,440
You just don't you don't have to do anything with it

727
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,800
It can it can remain like just just just kind of outside of one's awareness until

728
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,320
They're they're like there'd be no reason to have to include details

729
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,200
Until they become relevant anyway. You know what I mean?

730
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,120
Hmm stupid I did a terrible job

731
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,560
No, I I get it. It's I I guess I just sort of have like a fear or like um

732
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,520
Not a fear but like a the the prospect of like

733
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Crafting a story and then telling the story

734
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,600
Non linearly it's like oh my god. I can't imagine

735
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,280
Can't imagine a story growing as I draw it as I write it

736
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,400
I I need to know everything that happens and then I just need to draw it. That's what that's how you do things

737
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,600
That's not necessarily always the right way to do it. Is that how is that how you always do things?

738
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,440
Um for the load of ghosts. I I made it. I made up what it would be

739
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,760
plot-wise

740
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,320
Entirely before and then I made up

741
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Uh, how it looked as I went

742
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,520
Um for bail jpe. I made up everything as I went and I didn't give a shit

743
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,040
I was gonna say bail jpe was not you didn't have you didn't know how bail jpe was gonna end when you started it, right?

744
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah, I had no idea I would even have like a like anything like I thought it would just be like a tiny little joke

745
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
And instead it's a real big joke

746
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,520
Yeah

747
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,960
By the way, you asked you asked sorry

748
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,440
Sorry to change the subject. I don't mean to but since you mentioned bail jpe

749
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,400
You asked you asked how much like animation there is in uh slime and punishment finale

750
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Like very little there's like

751
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,360
It's almost all just like static objects like moving and trend like trend like scene transitions

752
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
There's like there's one scene

753
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,160
There's like one or two little shots where people will probably have a little like two frames of like

754
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
They like go from one pose to another

755
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,760
And that's like yeah, that's that's that's yeah

756
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:25,000
That's the homestuck thing. Yes, it is that so much of it is like um scale and rotate and

757
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Shake and flash

758
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,760
Yeah, that's efficient. You can get a lot of you can get a lot of mileage you get a lot of mileage out of just

759
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,760
Having like static images move around a screen

760
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
I should have done that why did I

761
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,200
It's too late. I've already spent the time it's cool now. Yeah

762
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Yeah

763
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
No, dude

764
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,880
I won't I I I I'm I'm I'm resisting the urge to talk more about that

765
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,240
I don't want to say anything about what what goes on in it until it's out

766
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:08,280
Yeah, the I I guess this whole bit has been give being a stupid fucking idiot. Yeah, play the jingle again

767
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,600
Play the jingle like every five minutes play the jingle

768
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,680
I don't even know there's a jingle I've missed a lot apparently I well

769
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,760
There's only been the last episode that I coined the term I haven't even listened to the jingle

770
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,040
I just know it exists. I don't is there I don't know if ellie is are actually added a jingle or not

771
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,920
He made one I'm posted there. I just didn't play it. Okay, and I I didn't see what it sounded like before the episode was edited

772
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Yeah

773
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
But I'm sure it's cool

774
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
Yeah, I I need

775
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,560
To I need to stop thinking

776
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
But it's hard

777
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,320
You can't just draw. What are you insane? You put a pen to a paper

778
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,520
You just draw a line and it becomes something that's how it works. That would be really cringe

779
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,160
If your art doesn't be creative on the fly, it's pretty cringe. I watched

780
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,640
I watched another there was a new a new mon ben someone on twitter

781
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,920
Uh outrider sake on twitter added me to let me know ben somebody uploaded a new mon ben

782
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
on daily motion

783
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,320
the one the one where

784
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,320
The one where urisawa nowki

785
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,320
Like talks to manga people and films them working and stuff. Right, uh, it was

786
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,480
When I watch mon ben I get I get a sense like it's cool

787
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
it's cool to see

788
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,200
Artists like working so hard on like making their shit

789
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,280
But I also

790
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,680
Have a strange feeling of like why

791
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:57,720
Are they even bothering like this is cringe like why are they doing like it's stupid. What are they established or something?

792
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,400
Yeah, it's like what what's what's the purpose what purpose does this serve?

793
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,160
And then and then they're gonna eat and then them and nowki will be like, oh, yeah

794
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,520
Uh art really is you know the artist's expression really is like a pure expression of fetishism

795
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,520
You know, it's like, yeah

796
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,480
Uh, uh, it's the the part, you know the kai I've always had a really intense emotional

797
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,720
Experience with like the human clavicle and that and everyone says that like that's why I draw it so good and like, oh, yeah

798
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,360
I like I you know, I want to express my fucking my fucking anxiety through a through a

799
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
Something or other and there was this highfalutin

800
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Shit, and I'm like cringe

801
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,080
Just fucking just just just just quit

802
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,280
If they if they were good at explaining why they do what they do they wouldn't do what they do

803
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,480
They'd be explaining other people things. That's true. It's it's I don't know they always

804
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
Nowki always, um

805
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
He talks a lot about fetishism

806
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,320
But like all he means by it every time he says it he just means like

807
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,560
Liking something it's just like something you're interested in like liking to draw shoulders

808
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,320
Do you think it's just a translation thing? Do you think they're just saying fetishism in the translation when it could be something more literal?

809
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:22,120
I think maybe the word I think they say it in English like they use the English word and I think just maybe it has a different connotation

810
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Oh something that's interesting

811
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,280
I I I'm talking about it like I'm

812
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,560
This probably makes it sound like I hate the show and I don't even like it anymore

813
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,400
But I do I just feel I just feel weird

814
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,640
About art in general art is so cringe because it becomes base and you want to be that cringe so you can be that base

815
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
But you can't bridge the gap yet

816
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,560
Yeah, it's like they'll be like oh so-and-so has been working for like 14 years writing a

817
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
It's a it's a manga about a

818
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,760
A girl from a from a tribe that has to like fight against like an

819
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Ineval empire or something and like free her and I'm like I hear that and I'm like, okay. I get it

820
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Like all right got got it

821
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,400
What's what's the point? I mean, that's just the synopsis

822
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
Nobody goes around reading synopsises

823
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,480
But I feel like I feel like I don't know maybe this is dumb

824
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,840
But I feel like I feel like the synopsis is all I need

825
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,040
And I don't I don't like I don't know

826
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,840
It's very uncharitable and it's probably stupid, but like I'm like, I mean maybe you're just tired of like

827
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
Narratives that get repeated

828
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,080
Right, but all narratives get repeated. That's why all art is bad

829
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,840
Or art can only be good when it's new and there hasn't been any new art ever

830
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,360
So no art can only be good when it's old old good

831
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,680
Well, it was

832
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
It was it was new

833
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,280
It was new when it was old though. That's why it was good because it was it was new at the time

834
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,640
Now everything now everything is old because the old stuff was new

835
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,960
First wait, I think I think you mixed up a word there or two. No, I don't I think I got it exactly right

836
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,400
The idea was fresh new ideas are not fresh because the old ideas were fresh

837
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,480
When they came out

838
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,520
We just got to wait

839
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,360
We just got to wait until we're old and then the things that are coming out today will be good

840
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:31,640
Because they'll be old. No, they won't they won't I promise it'll never happen anything old people are the most based thing

841
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,720
You could be you go, oh, and you're like, I can't walk anymore and you're like, I can't wait until like

842
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:43,240
2050 when there's like fucking like 65 year old men like oh, yeah, I remember back when

843
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:52,200
Movies were good. Remember iron man. Ah, it was a classic. Remember remember the first iron man. Yeah, that was that was that was it

844
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
Everything it's all been downhill from there

845
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,800
We went into that cave and he made an iron man suit out of scrap. How do you do that?

846
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,480
How do you do that? He's so smart

847
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,720
I

848
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Fucking hate movies

849
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,080
It's unbearable

850
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:21,560
Imagine imagine sitting down to watch a sequence of images played at a high frame rate to create the illusion of motion

851
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,440
So embarrassing

852
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Uh, why don't you look in the mirror?

853
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,760
No, and then move around. This is the like the highest frame rate possible

854
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,320
Yeah, I guess so

855
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,200
You go you go down looking at the the the like a body of water and you're like that sure sucks

856
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,400
It does

857
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,840
um

858
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,840
I'm I'm I'm

859
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,080
I'm like

860
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,160
I'm like I'm working on I'm doing the finale

861
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,880
I'm working on the scenes and I'm like, uh, this is cringe, but you know, I gotta do it

862
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,920
You know, I know what it's supposed to be. I know how to make it be that

863
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,800
Do I do I think that this

864
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,600
Or anything else is good or worthwhile? No, but it's no worse than anything else

865
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,560
That anyone else in the has ever done, you know, it's it's it's equally cringe

866
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,720
As everything else that that someone could be paying attention to

867
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,680
Instead so whatever

868
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,640
Just just fucking do it

869
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,960
That's all art is quite useless, but you know, what yeah, what else can I do? It's very true. That's right. That's why we

870
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,240
Do it anyways just because it makes us kind of happy even though it's also makes us sad

871
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,400
Yeah, I guess so

872
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,400
I guess I I guess I would agree my my biggest goal dream in the world

873
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,360
Is to have a character that gets a

874
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,640
Shit ton of porn drawn of it just by random people. Yeah, that's how you know you've made it

875
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,680
I want to be I want to be the toby fox but only in that one way

876
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,680
um

877
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,040
Pretty cool pretty cool. Yeah, pretty hot. Yeah

878
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,760
It's both cool. You know what else is pretty fucking hot my

879
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,960
Fucking hot and on my 3d printer. I bought it's printing something right now

880
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:24,120
Oh my god, really you're you're making 3d models and I haven't done that yet because I haven't I don't have a model that's like

881
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,000
Quality enough to print but I've been doing a bunch of test prints. I'm printing some model

882
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,480
I got offline right now like a little question block cart for mario

883
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:39,240
And it'll it'll hold switch cartridges, which is kind of cool. I just want to do that try and test like a geometric print dude

884
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,840
But uh, it's the fucking best make a

885
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,320
Make that's awesome

886
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Make a fucking a zoomie

887
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:53,480
A mebo and and I'll buy that's the idea. I want to make stuff like that. It's gonna be fucking sick

888
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,400
I just I printed this yesterday to test out like characters

889
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,040
So I printed a bust that I found online

890
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,280
I'm putting in the chat

891
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,760
Of handsome squidward and it came out great

892
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,400
And it's fucking sick

893
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,720
I've been given power. Oh my god. That is too

894
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,000
It's too much. It's too much. I

895
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,440
The possibilities are endless. Uh, that is one of those

896
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,560
That's uh, one of those

897
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,240
Like you can see the the the lines on it still, but you know, it's pretty epic

898
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,960
Do you could would you like sand those you can sand those down?

899
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,760
There's another right now. I'm using a plastic called pla

900
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,080
Because there's different like plastic types you can use for this pla is like the easiest to use

901
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,360
But there's another one I've been reading about called abs and abs. What you can do with that is it prints out like this

902
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,760
but then if you

903
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,320
Do a

904
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,200
Acetone vapor chamber thing with it like the acetone will like smooth it out

905
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,840
So it'll look it'll get rid of those lines

906
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,400
So I'm thinking I might try doing some abs printing to make some sculptures and stuff, but like

907
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,400
It's fucking dope. And it was like it was not expensive at all

908
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:07,000
I got this like pretty decently large printer for like 250 bucks and it prints great and it's dope

909
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,480
Oh

910
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,000
Oh man

911
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Oh, that's so cool. Okay

912
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,480
Uh, hmm

913
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,000
I wonder if I could do something with such a thing. I bet I bet you could

914
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,480
Hmm you could print gummy worms. Oh

915
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:29,400
I wonder I wonder if there's like one you could there's like an edible like an edible

916
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:36,120
Substrate you could use to like print food. I don't know if there's edible. There's flexible so you can make like springy things and stuff

917
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,280
Which I have not tried yet, but it's pretty fucking sick

918
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,320
And between this and learning sculpting. I'm gonna become ultra powerful and

919
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,040
Make all the cool things

920
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,120
It's pretty dope

921
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,960
Okay, dude. I'm impressed. I like how 3d printing has has become

922
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,600
Cheaper and and you can just get a thing. It's like pretty cool because like it's kind of changed the way I think about a lot of stuff

923
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,040
Because like now

924
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,160
Instead of like, oh, I got to go on amazon and buy something stupid

925
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,280
It's like, oh, I want to like get like a dock for my phone on my desk. I'll just print one

926
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,120
I don't have to go buy it. I'll just print it. Whatever. It's fine. You just go on on the internet get like google pixel

927
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,760
Stand and you just print it out and now you have one

928
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,120
You didn't have to do anything and like you've become a better person

929
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,720
How how long do you think before it pays for itself? Um, I mean nothing I'm doing right now really

930
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,440
is

931
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,600
Worth money. I guess like the phone thing probably would have been like 15 20 bucks, but

932
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,800
If I start making like sculptures and art with it and sell those like I'm sure probably within like

933
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,640
One or two prints that probably start like getting close to paying for itself

934
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,400
I don't know

935
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,680
Fascinating

936
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,000
Fascinating. It's pretty fucking dope. Very good

937
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,840
Damn, damn. That's neat as hell. Yeah, man

938
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,040
Trying to think what would I do with one? I feel like

939
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:01,560
Dilda dilda dilda. I could make a gun. Have you considered 3d printing a gun?

940
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,880
Uh, you can do that, you know, you can do that. I'm pretty sure it's illegal

941
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,000
Uh, but yeah, but you can do it anyways

942
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah, you know, just get a real gun and 3d print the bullets. That's not illegal when this when the civil war starts

943
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,560
I'll be ready

944
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Okay, uh

945
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,760
Remember, um

946
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,280
The oh fuck what's that thing mark said something about the right to

947
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:33,080
Arms and ammunition party should not be infringed or whatever. Uh, no wait, that's the second amendment

948
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,600
But mark said the same thing. It's fine marky mark. Yeah

949
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,400
He said he said

950
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:48,200
Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated by force if necessary

951
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,880
So stick stick with it. Stick with it. Yeah

952
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
Uh, cool

953
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,120
Uh, we got to decentralize, uh guns and ammunition. We can make them

954
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,520
They're just you can just free to print yours at home. Amazing

955
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,080
Uh

956
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,080
Do you think

957
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,280
Do you think

958
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,560
That maybe

959
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,560
3d printing

960
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:18,520
Would be something that like just everyone should have do you think the world would be a better place if just like everyone had a 3d printer?

961
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,680
um

962
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,880
I think I mean it I'm trying to think of like the the uses of a 3d printer

963
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,600
aside from

964
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,360
like, um

965
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,360
I mean obviously you can get like very intricate

966
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,680
specific plastic parts for moving machines or whatever like if you're building something but like

967
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,760
Uh, I mean you can't 3d print fabric. You can't 3d print

968
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,160
like

969
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,480
Certain that you can't 3d print food

970
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,600
Seems like it's it's it's like decorative almost it's mostly useful mostly useful for useless knickknacks

971
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:02,440
Which is fine. I like useless knickknacks. It depends. I mean there are people who make like functional parts and stuff

972
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,880
um, I think a 3d printer would be useful in a utilitarian sense if you

973
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,080
Also learn how to make your own stuff

974
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,520
Because like you can get like fusion 360 and like model like basic

975
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,760
Uh

976
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,800
Parts and things like that like for example, like I was thinking of maybe using fusion 360 to model something to

977
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,240
better adhere

978
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,360
The uh stand to my desk that holds my second monitor

979
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,520
Uh, because right now it's kind of wobbly and like that's something that like I could buy

980
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,080
Or I could just make it and print it and like it'd be cheaper and probably quicker

981
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,120
Because it'll take like x amount of days to ship where I could probably do it in less than a day myself

982
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,200
But that requires like knowledge. So like if you're like not lazy

983
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Yeah, you'd probably benefit from a 3d printer because like it'll also it also incentivizes you to like

984
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,400
solve problems that

985
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,800
You can do by yourself that maybe a

986
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,160
You would be able to buy a solution to like something very like specific that you need

987
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,760
Um, so I don't know it really depends on the person

988
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,720
I don't think everybody should have one. I think most people are lazy and dumb

989
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
But like if you're interested

990
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,800
I think you can find uses for it

991
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,120
Yeah, 250 bucks is just it's not that much. It's not a very high barrier to entry

992
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,800
You can get one for like 180. It's even cheaper. It's just a lot smaller

993
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,360
Jesus Jesus

994
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,600
Okay, cool

995
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,080
I feel because I'm I'm like

996
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,200
Slightly knowledgeable about 3d modeling. I've done it before

997
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,160
I've also forgotten everything and I tried again and I forgot it all again

998
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,080
um

999
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,200
So I don't I don't think I would ever like model my own things

1000
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,760
I wouldn't like if I needed like a

1001
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Some like I don't know

1002
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,400
System like some some small objects to help around

1003
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:59,560
With my stuff like a a weird shaped thing that needs to wedge in somewhere

1004
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,200
I would probably more

1005
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:08,840
Go down the the the route of learning how to do carpentry and building things with wood and nails and stuff

1006
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,680
Because I'm already

1007
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:16,920
A little more knowledgeable in that department and I just find it cool to hold wood and to smash it with a hammer

1008
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,720
Oh

1009
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,160
Oh, did I did I ever mention

1010
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
uh, my brother

1011
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,720
Uh

1012
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,480
Yeah, I did I last time I was saying I was gonna help my brother with stuff

1013
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,240
Um, yeah, his legs been fucked up. Yeah, I have

1014
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,000
Uh, since that podcast came out I went to him. I asked him if he needed help and

1015
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,040
we got together because

1016
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Henry Henry's been um

1017
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,720
Getting into upholstery

1018
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,720
as like a skill

1019
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,360
He went for like making couches

1020
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,480
like making chairs and like traditional sort of upholstery so using like

1021
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,240
proper

1022
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
old-fashioned real materials like

1023
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,680
Stuff and things and horse hair like padding. Okay. Um

1024
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,560
And uh, he's had these two chairs

1025
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,240
It was he's had like three or four chairs that he's been like half finished

1026
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,400
But because of his leg he hasn't been able to work on them. I came in I helped him

1027
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,480
and

1028
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,280
it is it's got to a point where we are

1029
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,760
We are building chairs and my presence in

1030
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,720
In his room helping with like one of the chairs while he works on another chair

1031
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,640
has got him

1032
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,560
Motivated and made him feel better and it's bass as fuck

1033
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,160
But also it's bass as fuck for me because I'm building a chair like a real chair would like

1034
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,000
with

1035
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,200
Layers to it. I don't know any of the terms, but there's this

1036
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,080
That there's a thing called a harpoon needle

1037
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:58,360
um that used to to to sew like threads all the way through the top and bottom of the chair

1038
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,480
um, and then there's like these curves needles to

1039
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,960
like the

1040
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,320
uh

1041
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:11,000
Really curve like if you get a mug and a needle goes all the way around the mug like a semicircle

1042
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,080
that's sort of

1043
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,440
A video game

1044
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,360
Where you play there are games like this, but a video game where you play as a mouse

1045
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,640
But you're like a warrior mouse and you have you have an rpg of swords

1046
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,720
But they're all little needles

1047
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,760
And like you you you get like different kinds of needles, right?

1048
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,360
Like you buy oh like like I found a harpoon needle like this one's like god gives me gives me more strength

1049
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:40,600
The smaller defense or something. Okay. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Yeah, mouse guard everybody. It's fucking sick

1050
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,040
Mouse guard. Yeah, that's like literally what you're talking about

1051
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,080
I feel like I'm I mean there's I have seen games where that might literally be

1052
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,080
Exactly game that I follow that's doing that you might have I've retweeted

1053
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,920
It's like a it's like a pixel art one. It's like behind

1054
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,280
Yeah, it's like a sort of like a big like switch blade kind of thing

1055
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's it. That's the one

1056
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,560
Yeah, it's not a needle though. Not a needle, but that's fine. They use needles in mouse guard though, which is why I said that

1057
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:16,760
Okay, but I think what's really cool about that give what you're talking about is like when when something that seems kind of like

1058
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Almost magical gets disambiguated and you understand how it's made, you know, like a chair

1059
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,760
It's something that just kind of appears like you go to a store and it's there and you bring it home

1060
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,000
But then like oh, this is how it's made like it's not like a magical thing

1061
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,720
Like there are steps there's a process and now I know with the process

1062
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,400
So when I look at chairs

1063
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,480
This thing that kind of like had no context now

1064
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,840
It has context and it like kind of makes you think about like everything around you

1065
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,120
It's like there's a process behind all of this and like things that I don't know

1066
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,480
It's like really fucking cool to like be in on the secret almost

1067
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,640
It's it's really interesting because it's it's specifically old fashioned chair making techniques

1068
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,360
The sort of chairs that last for hundreds of years before they break down as opposed to modern chairs

1069
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,360
Which is just like a lump of foam and it breaks down after like two years

1070
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:06,920
Like modern things in general just don't aren't built to last right so like building a chair in with this method

1071
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,800
With like there's this layer of like

1072
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,480
coarse

1073
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,480
Like black coconut hair

1074
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,280
That you're you're supposed to like scrunch like from an actual coconut

1075
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Yes gross I think

1076
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,840
And it's like you you scrunch it around and you use like special like a

1077
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,240
Um, I forget the name of it

1078
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,360
It's like a a neat a thing you stab into the chair to push

1079
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,560
The the the stuff around to like smooth it out and then there's like specific stitches to like hold parts in place

1080
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,640
um

1081
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,640
So that when you sit on the chair

1082
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,320
It's like the stuffing doesn't

1083
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,960
It it can't move from one side of the chair to the other like over time

1084
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,840
So it's all it's in its individual little

1085
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,840
Part compartments and then on top of that there's a horsehair thing and then there's a calico layer

1086
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,960
And you you do half you get these little tacks these little black nails

1087
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,680
And you half tack it all the way around and then you pull it really tight

1088
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:17,400
And and then you're supposed to like while holding pulling the calico or pulling the the fabric with one hand

1089
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:23,800
You get this special hammer that has a magnet on one side and you're supposed to like put the nail the tack on the hammer

1090
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:30,040
Hold the the the material really tight and then like whack the nail into the fabric into the wood

1091
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,880
and then uh

1092
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,880
Then it holds it because it's really sharp

1093
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:40,280
And it's like all these little processes to go to make a chair that just uh, you see and you're like, oh, it's a chair

1094
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,360
It's got a it's got padding

1095
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,280
You see like all these things that go on in these old chairs is really interesting

1096
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,560
uh

1097
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:54,120
Learn making making gummies has has not demestified demystified it at all. It has remystified it

1098
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,280
I am continually surprised and terrified

1099
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,280
by how

1100
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,960
they come out

1101
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:08,120
So different every time like I made some the other day and they came out. They were completely solid

1102
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,160
They were they just came out as completely solid like hard

1103
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,080
Hard candy, which is not what I wanted. It was inedible

1104
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,240
Uh, uh, it sucked and and then I used the same recipe the next day and they didn't

1105
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:27,880
Uh, I think the difference is that I just I cooked the first one longer like I cooked more of the water out of it or something

1106
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,640
um

1107
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,640
It's like yeah, there's so many fucking variables and I can't

1108
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:39,160
Cooking I've been trying I've been introducing new ingredients like I've I've I've switched from using

1109
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,560
I pretty much figured out how to do it with beef gelatin, but I don't want to use that anymore

1110
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:48,440
I want to try using pectin and agar agar and uh and carrageenan

1111
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:57,400
Um and rice flour, but I keep I don't know. I'll fucking throw these things all together and it'll it'll it always comes out weird

1112
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,800
But a different kind of weird

1113
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,280
It's always wrong, but in like it's it's wrong in new and novel ways every time

1114
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,560
Baking is a mystery

1115
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,960
It's it's neat I guess

1116
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:19,400
Uh, I like the ones that are passion fruit flavor passion fruit's the best flavor. I make them blue usually

1117
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,640
uh

1118
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,640
That's a fact jack

1119
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:28,440
I've tried making keto brownies three times now and each time they've come out completely different despite me doing

1120
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,520
The exact same thing and I don't understand

1121
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:36,680
Is very damn it's are you doing keto tom? Um, yeah, I usually have one off day a week

1122
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,320
Uh, yeah, most part i'm sticking to it

1123
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,040
And uh, yeah, I found this like keto brownie recipe. That's just like

1124
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,280
almond flour

1125
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,160
uh

1126
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:55,240
Sweetener cocoa and protein powder and then like a can of diet coke and it makes brownies really. Yeah, it's it's like diet coke

1127
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,520
That's very weird. It's very strange, but it works

1128
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,200
I just can't get it to be consistent despite doing the exact same thing. Uh, that's baking for you

1129
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,240
Yeah, that's that's yeah some things

1130
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:15,480
I mean, that's why the factories have like such uh rigorously controlled environments if the humidity or the temperature is different

1131
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,240
Everything could change

1132
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,240
With some with certain recipes

1133
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,120
So like they keep it exactly the same and then they just production line makes the same thing every time

1134
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:32,840
You should need a factory bench need to buy a factory. I I would love I would love to I would love to do that. Um

1135
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,240
I've been thinking they'd be really funny if you know

1136
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:43,640
When uh when covet is gone lamal and we do another uh rowdy fuckers con killers

1137
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,640
if um

1138
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,440
If I just made a big like bucket of keto slime

1139
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,720
And I was like hey and like we just could just like ladle it out to people. It's like put it on a plate

1140
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
I could do it. It'd be easy

1141
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,360
Uh, just be it would just make like a make a big a big bowl of what I would turn into gummy worms

1142
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,440
But then just not put it in the molds

1143
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,800
and uh

1144
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,520
That could just be what everyone eats the whole time. You're not allowed to eat anything else actually

1145
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,360
Uh forced keto. Yes. Yes

1146
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:21,800
Uh, I just think that would be funny and it would taste good. I would make it I would make it like mango flavor or something

1147
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,000
Sour apple flavor

1148
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,680
You know, I have an apple. I have an apple flavoring and I don't like it

1149
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:34,200
I don't like the apple and I don't like the pear which is weird because usually I really like both of those

1150
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,360
But this brand or whatever

1151
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,960
This company that I guess I've been buying my flavorings from they just don't do it good. They don't have

1152
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,160
Good apple pear. They suck. They're bad

1153
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,600
But their mango and passion fruit is very good. Mwah

1154
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,600
Delightful. I made uh, I made some orange

1155
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,880
I tried to make some orange yesterday and I used the pectin

1156
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:02,440
And I used carrageenan and I used rice flour and it came out so stiff that I could not put it into molds

1157
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,680
So I just spread it on a piece of like

1158
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,840
aluminum foil

1159
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,920
Uh and put it in the aluminum foil in the fridge and now I just have like sort of a brick

1160
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,280
Of this orange paste that is now completely hardened. It sort of has a consistency like fruit leather

1161
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,040
um

1162
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:24,760
And next to that is a little jar full of it's actually the same gummies that I I posted a picture of them on twitter

1163
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,760
And I guess it started a little bit of an insurrection in rfck. I guess the killers are revolting against me now

1164
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,800
Uh, there's some, you know, there's some there's some some pretty uh, uh, what's the word?

1165
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:41,800
There's some propaganda going around. There's a little bit of a revolutionary overtones. That's fine

1166
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,680
Uh, but I still have those but they're in a jar, but like they've hardened

1167
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,240
So much they're like candles. They're like they're like they're like wax now

1168
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,960
um, and and I

1169
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,160
They weren't like that before but I guess you should use them like candles

1170
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,400
I wonder

1171
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,000
I wonder

1172
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,480
Addable addable candles. That's that's where this is going. That's where this journey ends

1173
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:11,320
Edible slime candles slime candles that have a green flame at the end

1174
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,680
Those ones didn't even come out that good. Those were apple flavored

1175
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,080
I tried to make them green apple, but they didn't flavor them enough and the apple's not very good anyway

1176
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,840
and uh

1177
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:26,120
They're they're they're really hard and waxy and I don't know. I don't know man. I don't know

1178
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,080
That's it's uh, it's a mystery

1179
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,720
It's complete complete chaos

1180
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,520
In the ben saint kitchen these days

1181
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,040
Uh, yeah

1182
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,960
So I got to say about that we're at an hour, uh, if you guys are

1183
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,600
One we could go on to voicemails unless there's anything else you want to talk about

1184
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:56,280
I got one last thing. Yeah, um, wouldn't be very long. I just want to ask you two because you're old than me whether this happened to you

1185
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,680
um

1186
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,280
It's my birthday in two days as of the recording of this

1187
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,080
Yeah, and uh, I

1188
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:11,800
I don't remember if I'm already 27 or if I'm gonna be 28 or 29

1189
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,440
I don't I don't remember

1190
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,080
I thought you were like I thought you were like 25

1191
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:23,880
No, no, no, I'm at least 26, but I don't remember further than that. I I've completely lost track

1192
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,600
I could easily add up the numbers, but it's like yeah, like late 20s

1193
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,360
I stopped caring, but when I when I was about to hit 30

1194
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:39,240
I was deathly aware and I felt very terrible and now every year past 30. I've just like

1195
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,840
Oh god, I'm not even I don't even like why even be alive anymore. It doesn't even matter. Nothing I do

1196
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,800
Is is worth anything?

1197
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,480
No, I I'm with you because I'm actually I think I'm 32

1198
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,360
But I might be 31

1199
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,160
Uh

1200
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:05,320
Wait, no, hold wait, you'll be turning 32 right because you're only a couple months older me. I'll be 32 in november. So

1201
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,920
You're wait, you're turning 32 in november correct then I would have then I would have turned wait no

1202
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:18,280
I was born in 90. I was born in 88 and it's 2020 now

1203
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:25,480
So so like I was I turned zero in in in 88 and I turned two

1204
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,080
When's your birthday? When's your birthday? I turned. Oh, no, no, no, it's a april april seventh

1205
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,720
Okay, been your 30. So no, I am I am 32. Okay

1206
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,520
Right, it's right because april because I turned two because I turned two I turned two in 1990

1207
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,240
So I'll be I'll be 32 in 2020. Yeah, okay

1208
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:51,160
It's just like funny because I'd like up to this point. I had pretty be like, yeah, I know what age I am

1209
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,480
I don't know what age I am anymore

1210
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:59,640
Uh, I am with you. Yes. Yes. Yes. It happened changed. Yeah, I mean it means less and less

1211
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
What's what's even the difference?

1212
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,560
What's even the difference between like 25 and like 40?

1213
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,520
15 years

1214
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,600
Anyway, I gotta go to the hospital now

1215
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,720
Yeah, what is old age?

1216
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,880
Ah man, oh man

1217
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:32,200
I we could go to questions. I guess, you know, we got nothing else. It's a little bit of it's a little bit of a relief

1218
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:38,280
Honestly, it was a little bit of a relief to have quarantine happening when I had my birthday this year

1219
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,680
Because it meant we didn't have to do anything

1220
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,240
which is just kind of like

1221
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,440
cool

1222
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,960
like, yeah, I don't

1223
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,240
Don't care that much. I don't care about celebrating my birthday too much

1224
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,400
I think I think we did like all hang out or what are like some people in my house all did a thing

1225
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,680
but we didn't like

1226
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,760
You know ordinarily, maybe I would have like

1227
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,440
Had people over or something and I didn't have to do any of that

1228
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,440
You know, like I like doing stuff, but I don't like doing

1229
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,680
birthday stuff

1230
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,200
It's annoying

1231
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,200
Happy birthday to you

1232
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,360
Me to you

1233
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:17,800
Wow, this video is copyright claim. Oh wait, it's not even on youtube lamau. We don't have to worry about that anymore

1234
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,760
I love dude. I can say sponge bob square pants now. I can say that

1235
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,960
No character

1236
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,960
Let me you know, let me complain. Let me complain about something

1237
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,600
Uh

1238
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,600
What do you guys think? I think

1239
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,960
That jenna marbles was not cancelled and anyone that thinks she's been cancelled is fucking stupid

1240
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,840
I know nothing about this

1241
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,440
All right, well, I know that on twitter cancel culture

1242
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:57,480
Is is is all the rage these days everyone's complaining about it and I guess it's it's almost entirely on twitter only

1243
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,040
I don't know if it has any effect

1244
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,280
Okay. Well, jenna. Well, well jenna marbles got quote unquote cancelled

1245
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:11,960
Which basically just means that somebody was like, hey guys jenna marbles did blackface once jenna marbles was like, oh

1246
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,720
It's true. I did I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry

1247
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:22,760
Everyone was like, wow, what a gracious apology. You know, she's really handling this the way more people we more people should

1248
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,840
And then jenna was like, hey guys, I have decided of my own volition

1249
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,600
to not

1250
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,920
Uh upload more videos to youtube and everyone said, oh my god

1251
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,440
jenna marbles was cancelled the cancel mob got her

1252
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,360
And like they fucking didn't I don't know it makes me really mad

1253
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,240
It makes me really mad that someone could see that and be like, oh

1254
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:51,400
How could that how could this have happened? She's such she's been victimized by uh by an irrational mob mentality

1255
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,600
That is just cancelling people left and right. She's the latest victim

1256
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,720
Like no, she had a pr kerfuffle

1257
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,320
And then this is how she chose to handle it. Like that's

1258
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,120
Like what what what do you want? Like what what else what should have happened?

1259
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,120
That's what I don't understand. I don't understand the mentality here

1260
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:17,560
She should have doubled down and just done more blackface. I mean that's the obvious she should have said it was representation

1261
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,880
Yeah, obviously

1262
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,200
She should have become completely blackface from then on

1263
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,080
Ah

1264
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,080
Let's talk about

1265
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:35,880
net netflix pulls netflix pulls the episode of community where the chinese guy

1266
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,880
Uh, uh

Uh stupid uh brand stupid

1269
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:51,480
Uh, uh, uh simpsons is like we're not gonna have white people play black people anymore. Uh, whatever nobody cares

1270
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,280
Uh, I hate I hate everything

1271
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,680
Uh, I hate

1272
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:02,760
I hate culture. I hate society. I hate living in a society. I have become joker-fied

1273
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,160
um

1274
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,160
I don't know that's that's my june

1275
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,160
There you go

1276
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,440
Yeah

1277
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,240
Well, yeah, I I've I've been I've been

1278
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:19,160
Not paying attention to twitter because I blocked it on based in the same way. I block youtube

1279
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,560
I may have mentioned that already uh last time but

1280
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,640
um

1281
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,400
Blocking it in the same way that I can only look at it during the weekend

1282
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,600
Which is right now, but I also haven't felt the need to because like

1283
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,520
Like I check twitter every day. I used to check twitter every day

1284
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:41,480
I check what people I'm following and then I check a bunch of people that I like assume would have something they're talking about

1285
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:42,760
um

1286
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,760
Like just by searching their name

1287
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:49,320
And I look at what they're saying and I'm like I go on twitter and I feel worse than I was when I first got on there

1288
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,440
Yeah

1289
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,640
And it's like just it's it's like it's the same thing every time

1290
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,120
um, but by reducing the amount of times I do it

1291
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,360
I just care less I'm like like if I do it every day or every five minutes

1292
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,200
I'm gonna care a lot, but if I do it once a week. I I don't know

1293
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,680
I've been seriously considering just like

1294
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,240
Becoming a new person online and just scrubbing everything

1295
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:18,440
Just why don't it's it's I I like the idea, but I also

1296
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,520
Feel like it's so

1297
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:25,560
Impossible what what what would be the point? I don't I don't really even know what the point would be

1298
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,960
It's just it's just a temptation that

1299
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:34,520
Lacks any sort of like cohesive reasoning. I just feel like I want to go away sometimes

1300
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:35,880
uh

1301
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,880
Yeah, sometimes I feel like

1302
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,040
By by having

1303
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,200
Information out there at any point

1304
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:49,560
Um, I'm now like damaged goods and I can't now exist as a new mysterious person anywhere

1305
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,280
Unless I hide my

1306
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,280
voice or face

1307
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:01,880
Like eventually people will connect the dogs and find everything that I've ever said and it's like well, I'm whatever

1308
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,520
Can't do anything about it. I guess

1309
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,680
yeah

1310
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:13,480
If you went away for like years and then you came back and did something like completely unrelated to what you're doing now

1311
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:20,120
Even if people discover like oh, this guy used to be on a podcast or whatever this guy used to have another youtube channel

1312
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,680
uh, uh, uh, I feel like

1313
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,160
I feel like it is possible to create like

1314
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:30,200
enough distance between like your current self and your past self and it's like oh, well, that's like

1315
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,480
Sure, that's like technically the same person, but like it's not like you know part of the same

1316
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,960
like like, um

1317
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,480
I don't know

1318
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,640
It's funny. I just remembered that there have been people who

1319
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:52,680
Like watched t-bap and both yours and Nate's content and had no idea you two were those guys

1320
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
That's so funny

1321
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,200
Like who like didn't even know like, uh

1322
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,160
Uh, if I can jesse

1323
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:07,720
Uh, endless jess was also my japanese anime. They thought it was they were two different people. I was like how

1324
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,520
That's so that's so wild

1325
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,040
Yeah, I always just assume that anyone who's seen

1326
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,680
My stuff like found it through

1327
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,080
My other stuff

1328
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,040
right

1329
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,040
I don't I don't imagine like

1330
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,400
A new

1331
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,400
Like I don't imagine the stuff that I put online like reaching a new audience

1332
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,960
I kind of just always assume that it's just going to be seen by all the same people who've seen everything else

1333
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,720
I've ever put there

1334
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,720
Uh, Lamal

1335
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,520
I guess it's not always true. Sometimes it leaks out into the wider world a little bit

1336
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,240
Everybody everybody finds you

1337
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,640
Through a different thing

1338
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,280
Hmm. Hmm. Very wise very wise

1339
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Uh

1340
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,200
I don't know

1341
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,440
Very is really funny that uh

1342
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,480
I'm imagine imagine having watched tbap and then watching like stumbling across the pcp

1343
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,480
And not knowing that it's the same guy. That's so wild

1344
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,440
I don't know

1345
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:16,360
You guys there or what? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Nothing to say about it. Well. Yeah, please. You're leaving me hanging

1346
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:23,480
I'm dying here. I mean, yeah, you know, I agree. I agree. Let's go to voicemails. Let's go to fucking voicemails. Yeah, no more of this

1347
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,280
Okay, so

1348
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,800
voice

1349
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,080
males

1350
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,040
Where?

1351
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,520
Okay. Okay. So first one is from

1352
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,240
Keyblade spirit. This is Keyblade spirits pride month special

1353
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,040
three two one go

1354
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:48,840
This is an open letter to the lgbt q i a plus community

1355
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,800
Please

1356
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,880
Please

1357
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,400
I'm begging all of you. Please

1358
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,440
Iron you goddamn pride flags

1359
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:10,120
Well, what do we think gentlemen, uh, is he right or is he right?

1360
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,040
I don't know. I haven't seen a flag in my life

1361
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,560
Uh, I've never seen one flag

1362
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,800
Uh

1363
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:26,520
I feel like that's solid advice regardless of the context keep your flags presentable if you want to raise them high and let them be seen

1364
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,880
Have some pride in your pride flag

1365
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:37,240
Listen, listen, I'm I'm not a cop. I'm not gonna tell you that you can't wave around

1366
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:44,280
That you that you can't wave around a dirty ragged, you know crumpled up pride flag if if you want to

1367
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,520
But you know

1368
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:53,480
Can consider consider how best to spread your intended message. It's not illegal, but it's not really ethical either

1369
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,960
Is it not ethical to I think it's it's it's the better choice to

1370
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,880
Have it be presentable. You can do it just because you can doesn't mean you should

1371
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:09,080
The I mean, you know when when a flag touches the ground, you're supposed to burn it

1372
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,120
So I so I propose gentlemen

1373
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:19,720
That in a display of solidarity to our lgbt qia plus allies, we all take to the streets and burn pride flags

1374
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:27,320
In a demonstration to show just how seriously we take I feel I feel as if you might have missed the mark a bit on that one

1375
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,040
No, no, no, no. No, this is good. It's good. That's called patriotism

1376
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:36,920
We are the true patriots. You're more educated on this than me. So I'll defer to your expertise. That's right

1377
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,120
That's correct. This is not a pride flags. This is flag pride

1378
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,040
Uh, wait, did you say fag?

1379
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,040
That's what I heard. That's what I heard. I'm sorry

1380
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,800
I heard it. I heard it. You know what you want to hear. I think

1381
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:02,360
No, no, no, no. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Um, all right. Let's move on to the next one. Let's move on

1382
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,560
No, no more of this. Okay. This is from

1383
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:10,120
Trapped in my room and there is a youtube link attached

1384
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,520
three two one go

1385
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:19,720
I missed the old rad con the comic gold rad con the bread stole rad con and now there's no rad con

1386
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:25,720
I hate the new rad con since Nate's screwed with rad con his channel's got hacked and now he's ruined rad con

1387
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:31,720
I missed the fans rad con the 30 grand rad con people might even say i'm better than rad con

1388
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:37,560
So you had to grow with rad con. I made my own rad con since impossible now to even be shown rad con

1389
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:42,040
I used to love rad con. I used to love rad con. I even made my own lecture

1390
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,280
I thought I was rad con what if a fan who once was a slave to rad con

1391
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:50,840
Stole a Kanye song just to promote his own channel so he can save rad con

1392
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:56,840
That's all it was rad con. We still love rad con. They stole you like brad stole brad con

1393
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Uh

1394
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,320
Cool, so this good good good flow good beats

1395
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,320
um

1396
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,000
This guy so this this link that he he has here goes to

1397
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,280
a a lecture

1398
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:21,000
Kanye it's called Kanye name one genius that ain't crazy a pcp inspired lecture

1399
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,760
I

1400
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,360
I feel like maybe

1401
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:29,000
Okay, I think recently someone added the pcp on twitter

1402
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,760
With a lecture and I think maybe this was the same one

1403
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:37,960
Uh, so this is another we've got I guess this is only like the second

1404
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:45,880
Like like pcp style lecture i've seen i've seen tectonic improv's one about linkara and I guess this one now which is about Kanye

1405
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,720
Uh, I don't know. I'll I'll give it a watch

1406
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,520
Lincoln Lincoln the doobly-doo

1407
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Uh, let's go check out, uh

1408
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:00,840
Yeah, he's trapped in my room on on youtube. He's got a fucking it's two hours two and a half hours

1409
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:06,840
Every time someone says doobly-doo. I get a little bit closer to going on a mass shooting. Sorry, dude

1410
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:13,000
I say it ironically. I promise. Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't I promise no, no, no, no, no, no

1411
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,520
You say it ironically one more time it will become unironic

1412
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,640
Oh, I've only got one left

1413
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah, and I better make I better make a count every time

1414
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,640
Oliver on philosophy tubes says doobly-doo. I'm like, please never do that again

1415
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:36,440
Philosophy tube. Yeah, does he say that? He does. I think it's uh, I think it's a uh, uh, a vlogbrothers thing

1416
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,560
It did originate from vlogbrothers. Yeah, it was like I've started

1417
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,880
I was he started he was saying it on his older videos

1418
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:46,120
I'm like, oh, this is like his older videos before like he realized it was a retarded thing to say

1419
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,200
But some of his newer videos he still says it. I'm like

1420
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:55,240
Oh, you know brand recognition old habits old habits diehard. I guess I just it just

1421
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,520
What if you copyrighted hey guys

1422
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,040
Oh

1423
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:06,760
No, there's an idea. There's an idea. You know, we got a copyright. Sorry. We got a copyright. Sorry. I haven't made a video in a while

1424
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:12,280
That's where the real money is can we do we do we sell a shirt that says that we don't we should

1425
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Yeah, we absolutely

1426
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:20,440
Wait, it's in the the front. No the front of the shirt should say hey guys and the back should say sorry

1427
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,760
I haven't made a video in a while. Yeah. Yeah, I don't I don't see why not

1428
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,600
Uh, okay. Well, that's that's next

1429
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,960
On the pipeline. Uh, next one next voicemail

1430
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:37,640
Uh persona this one is called persona five is too difficult on normal

1431
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,680
By the way, I have not curated any of these

1432
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:49,320
So we're just we're just going in completely raw. So this one's two two voicemails along so three two one go

1433
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:57,400
Finally fucking did the persona. I beat the the the the thing that I was talking about and I killed the penis head monster

1434
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,880
Uh, the game is finally good again

1435
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,280
yippie

1436
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,280
Have you guys played persona?

1437
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,240
Never

1438
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:08,200
No, okay neither of us not even I don't even care

1439
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,040
Yeah, you're right. Actually, uh, the next one is called persona five. I did it. Uh

1440
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:20,120
Maybe he did it. Okay. I guess he did it. Congratulations, sir

1441
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:27,240
Uh, great. Uh, all right the next one. Uh, the next voicemail is titled your white

1442
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,400
And not you are why you are your why you are white

1443
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,000
So, uh, let's fucking get it

1444
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,680
gentlemen

1445
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,080
All right, three two one go

1446
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,360
Hello, Nate. This is, uh

1447
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240
Well, you already know who this is

1448
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:51,080
Um, I've heard I listened to the last podcast episode and I did not read or

1449
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,040
Played

1450
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:59,720
Still want to hear my voicemail to be played. Um, Nate. What's your opinion about the BLM?

1451
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,040
BLM movement

1452
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:07,320
And I want to actually if you don't mind be on the show discuss why

1453
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:15,720
Dispree with a lot of your opinions and how it's contradictory that you want a star trek future, but you do not advocate for the

1454
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,480
Uplifting of any other ethnic community

1455
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,120
Um, so that's kind of weird

1456
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:27,080
So and your alter in your belief system of doing the most good

1457
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:32,200
Is contradictory of your actions. So again, just just want to know

1458
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:39,400
Nate like if I want to see if you actually uphold the standards or you're just putting on errors, dude

1459
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,360
All right, so all right

1460
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,240
Yeah, again, this is

1461
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:51,480
Oh, this is uh, you're white. That's that's why I put in the last title or whatever. So again

1462
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:58,120
I want to hear your opinion and thoughts about it. Okay. Bye. I don't remember this guy's previous voicemail

1463
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:04,440
Do you guys remember I didn't I remember I think you were by yourself when you did that

1464
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:08,200
Uh, I don't or maybe not. I don't know

1465
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:18,200
Did I not I don't know okay doesn't ring a bell whatever I don't know Nate's not even here

1466
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:23,960
Uh, I agree the Nate is cringe. I don't know any of Nate's opinions on this and I don't want to

1467
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:30,680
Uh, Nate just doesn't talk about it, which is cringe. Very cringe. I see. I see. He doesn't want to talk politics

1468
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:38,120
I don't want to talk politics. Uh, you gotta be gotta be neutral on everything. That's how that's how you do the most good

1469
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,920
In with stuff. Okay, whatever

1470
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,320
Uh, thanks for your call your white. Mr. Mr. White

1471
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,560
um

1472
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,560
Shall we next one is from

1473
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,120
PAP endorses mining at night

1474
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,280
Uh

1475
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,280
Three two one go

1476
01:28:57,160 --> 01:29:03,960
Hey, pcp. I have a very spicy one for you guys. So the procrastinator's anonymous

1477
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:11,560
Fully endorses mining at night. Now. I know what you're thinking. It's a very controversial take, but

1478
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,040
It's actually better

1479
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:22,600
I mean, hey, you want the least amount of mobs to spawn as possible to interrupt your mining. Am I not correct?

1480
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:29,000
Thus you do need to mine at night because more mobs will spawn on the surface

1481
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,600
And less will spawn in the caves where you will do your mining

1482
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,840
I don't know whether that's true

1483
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:42,760
I guess it depends on if you're close enough to the surface that they can spawn up there or if you're on a multiplayer server

1484
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:49,400
He's okay. So he's saying that because mob spawn in the darkness and there's a limited number of mob spawns

1485
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:55,320
If you're mining at night, they'll be spawning on the surface and that'll reduce the spawns you

1486
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,200
Yeah, okay

1487
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:59,800
It makes sense

1488
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,800
It might be true. I don't know

1489
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,560
I don't play minecraft. Well, to see the thing is

1490
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:11,560
Uh, it's it's not don't mine at night because it's better to not mine night

1491
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:16,200
It's we're just telling you to do that. You have to do it if you don't if you disobey you will be

1492
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,880
um

1493
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:22,280
Scoot, yeah, it's it's not. Yeah, it's not it's not worse because anything in the game

1494
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:27,480
It's worse because we'll kill you we'll destroy you you dare. Yeah. Yeah, how you dare

1495
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:35,720
He does the the the the the pro the procrastinating the the pro and on cast

1496
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,440
Is that what they're called? What are they called the procrastinator's anonymous cat pro and on?

1497
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:45,400
Yeah, one of those pro and on they they all right they endorse this dangerous ideology

1498
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,040
It's cringe. Uh, uh, it does not it does not reduce harm

1499
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,760
Uh, it is it is uh, it needs to be canceled get on twitter

1500
01:30:55,480 --> 01:31:00,280
A hashtag cancel the path. Uh, that's that's that's that's what's up

1501
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,920
All right, third next one

1502
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,200
Next one

1503
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:09,880
Is titled with a a bitly link and the link is to his discord screenshot of michelle

1504
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,120
Saying oh wait, shan. Are you the voicemail god?

1505
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,760
uh, okay

1506
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,760
But here we go. Well three two one now

1507
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:25,880
Ellie is our please link this in the show notes. This is that feel when you're late to the joke

1508
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,600
Okay, terrible

1509
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,800
Voice jail

1510
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:37,640
We didn't we didn't successfully abolish voice jail. No, we still have an iron grip on a few people

1511
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:42,840
Fuck yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's still there. You know the terror the terror continues

1512
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:49,480
So, uh, you know watch yourself. All right next one is from vox populi

1513
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,200
Uh three two one go

1514
01:31:52,920 --> 01:32:01,080
Since this is apparently some sort of art help podcast. How the fuck do I finish long projects short project get inspired do thing

1515
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:09,800
Finish thing long project get inspired do thing have issue no inspiration to get over issue never finish thing

1516
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,200
What the fuck can you even do?

1517
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:24,600
Uh, yeah, long project is just small project, but uh, but many of them in a long in a long line

1518
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:26,920
Yeah

1519
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:32,120
Yeah, break it break it down. You just gotta into manageable chunks. You gotta not rely on the inspiration

1520
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,120
You have to discipline yourself and not be a bitch

1521
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:41,480
Uh, I had that's also true. I had a fucking twitter post where I I made this really long image of

1522
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,480
me explaining

1523
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,800
The two methods of of creation

1524
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,320
Uh, I don't want to get into it because it's really long-winded, but

1525
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,480
I could link that because that it was like it was good. I remember that

1526
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,720
yeah the thing with

1527
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,720
Doing things and then creating things

1528
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:02,280
Two sides of the brain two different methods if you're if you're liking inspiration

1529
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:10,680
Um, it's because you don't have a plan of what to do and for that I would say so the solution is just to experience things you like

1530
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:15,960
That's what I'm doing. It's working. I'm what if you don't but what if you don't like anything?

1531
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,520
Then look at things people say is good and just be optimistic about it

1532
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,920
Ugh

1533
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,200
No, just like assume that you are correctly stupid and you don't know anything is like go to people say

1534
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,080
What do I do? What do I what's good?

1535
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:36,520
And they say a big big list because they always have a big list everyone has a big list of things that you should watch read and

1536
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:42,280
Listen to and you're like, okay. I'll do that. I'll do that. You put one into your vhs

1537
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,840
And you watch it

1538
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:48,680
And you're like, okay. I don't know if I gained anything but I I did it

1539
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:53,800
And you do that over and over again, eventually you'll become smart like me

1540
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:59,800
This is like kind of sad almost but something that like does inspire me is like watching bad things

1541
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,920
Uh, because a lot of the times I'll get down on myself back. Oh my god

1542
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,760
This is the worst thing ever made by human and then I'll watch like an episode of best of the worst

1543
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:12,040
I'll be like, oh my god. I'm fine. I'm totally fine. Oh, definitely. It could be it could be so much worse

1544
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:18,760
Oh, I'm I'm a fucking genius. I'm and then I feel better have I mentioned the Tezuka awards

1545
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:24,040
Submission page has like a thing where you can look at all of the submissions

1546
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:28,680
And there are so many of them already and they are awful. I mean

1547
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:34,680
These are the ones that I'm I'm talking about. I were posted like days after the contest was announced

1548
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,160
So they could not have been a lot of effort put in

1549
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,840
um

1550
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,400
They are the worst things I've ever seen. They are extremely cringe. I look at them and I'm like, wow

1551
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,240
I'll be fine. Wait

1552
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,200
These are like other entries other entries into the contest. Yes

1553
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:52,440
Where can I find them? I want to see um, I'll get a link

1554
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,240
In a yeah

1555
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,240
I want to see the cringe. Are they all

1556
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:02,520
How many of the entries are from japanese people? I don't know

1557
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,480
Hmm

1558
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,080
There's a there's a there's a place to see it

1559
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,480
Uh

1560
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,480
Guys, I just got a message

1561
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,560
from munchy

1562
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:26,040
Jay trump telling me that the vaporette is done. Oh, that's good. Five. That's five unless he's lying unless this is a prank

1563
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,520
That's five out of six

1564
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,880
So there we go. Oh, this is happening live. This is happening live on the air

1565
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,640
unscripted

1566
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:40,760
So we all have to bully jade morrow now. Is that what you're saying? We all have to bully jade morrow. That's right

1567
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,560
jade

1568
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:48,600
I think she might I think she might be on like a trip or something

1569
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,120
I think she she said she was going somewhere and I'm not sure if she's back yet

1570
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,920
That's still her fault for going on a trip

1571
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:01,960
That's true. No, it's true. She was getting off the bus and I held my leg out and says have a nice trip when she fell

1572
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:06,040
And she's still falling. She's been falling for ages

1573
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,160
Take a picture of the last longer

1574
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,680
Cool

1575
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,880
Um

01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:20,520
Can you show me these man show me the manga. I posted the link. Show me the manga

1577
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:27,000
Where is the manga? There's definitely some some more good ones that have been submitted since I last looked

1578
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,960
But there's there's definitely the

1579
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,160
There's definitely the ones I mean

1580
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:37,640
There was one that was like popular for a while called two piece, which was just

1581
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,760
Like a terribly drunk number two piece

1582
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,920
Yeah, that's

1583
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,440
And uh, oh, yeah, some of these are like real bad

1584
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:51,240
Yeah, I mean, no, it's it's a it's a very exciting process. Yeah, I do

1585
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,840
Tails gets trolled is on here. Wait, no

1586
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,960
No, it's on page two

1587
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,120
What there are pages at the bottom

1588
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,200
Oh, okay

1589
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,320
Tails gets trolled by chris pool. Is that his name?

1590
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,600
What the fuck it could be his name

1591
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,600
No, it can't be

1592
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:18,360
This can't be this has to be some kind of like troll entry

1593
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,560
It has to be right

1594
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:25,080
I mean, I hope it's the real deal if if he thinks he could he could like submit tails gets trolled as a comic

1595
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:29,080
To the is a troll. It would be a troll move to submit tails gets trolled

1596
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,760
Yeah, it would

1597
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:38,360
Oh, these are like not even very long. This one's only this one's only 10 pages. There's two piece

1598
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,120
This one is

1599
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:46,760
Oh, no, it's not it's not by lezabot. It just says please go support lezabot. Fuck you, dude

1600
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,920
Post this on his behalf. You're probably

1601
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,520
That sucks. What if it wins, huh? What are you gonna do then?

1602
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,520
um

1603
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,360
what about

1604
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:59,080
How wait, how oh, okay, this one's 54 pages

1605
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:07,000
I was gonna say like these all seem really short, but some of them are long some of them. Um, it's

1606
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:13,320
What one of these days? How long is yours gonna be? No idea. I'm thinking between 30 and 50 pages

1607
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,120
It's respectable

1608
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,120
healthy

1609
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,960
Because like, um

1610
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:22,760
The wanted by it sure odor was 30 pages

1611
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:26,200
I was looking at some other ones the the won the tesaka awards

1612
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,840
They're more closer to 50 55 pages and the limit is 55

1613
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:35,560
So I'm thinking somewhere in that ballpark is like the the the right amount for it to be

1614
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,560
concise

1615
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,200
Yet contain a lot of stuff and have it

1616
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,920
And I'll have it all work

1617
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,440
so

1618
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,840
Are these all the submissions? I

1619
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,640
Oh, you can change by language. Let's there's not actually that many

1620
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,920
These are the english ones if the at the top

1621
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:00,120
Right, so you can I guess you can't see the japanese ones. You can see the korean ones

1622
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,280
There's only a few of those

1623
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:06,040
Spanish why can't I why can't I see the japanese ones because those are the best ones

1624
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,360
Those are the ones that are actually going to win

1625
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,080
There's a lot of spanish ones

1626
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,320
and they they seem to be

1627
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:19,160
Generally better overall like i'm seeing a pretty few actually good-looking ones

1628
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,880
But then also, yeah

1629
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:25,080
There are exactly five there are five korean ones

1630
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,600
It is funny till I mean we still got two whole months before the deadline

1631
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:32,600
I'm sure there's going to be a huge spike near the end if you had two more months to work on this

1632
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:38,200
Why would you submit it like I would be like busting my ass like it's it's cuz people

1633
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,680
I mean these ones they don't look

1634
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:44,040
Either they were already drawn or they're very fast at drawing or

1635
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,280
Like the the ones that look bad. They don't realize that

1636
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:51,640
You need to spend more time on a drawing to make it good

1637
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,400
And they just wanted it to be done like I I got school

1638
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,720
I should I should I got like a few minutes after school. Maybe this is like an advertising thing

1639
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,160
They're not trying to win the contest

1640
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,360
They just know that they're going to be on the front page of something a lot of people are going on

1641
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,360
And they're hoping to pick up traffic that way

1642
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,280
I mean there is like a voting system people can like things and view things

1643
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,520
So it's true

1644
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:16,520
Some of these things that look not so good have got a couple thousand looks

1645
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:24,760
Do you think do you think do you think jump regrets their decision yet of opening this up to everybody?

1646
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,000
I I

1647
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,440
I don't know

1648
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,440
I don't think so because

1649
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,160
There's got to be lots of of young japanese kids who are like

1650
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,240
Generally japanese people seem to be better at drawing

1651
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:44,280
That's not that's that cannot be like all people in japan are better at drawing

1652
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:49,960
There's got to be a few that just don't get it don't know how to do it don't unskilled don't want to work

1653
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:54,760
But they want to win anyway, so they're gonna submit so I don't think this is like unusual

1654
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,400
That's fair

1655
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:03,160
What if I like went and just like submitted the champion to this like even though it's old

1656
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,040
You could do that. Yeah

1657
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:11,720
You couldn't put the you couldn't put the game in there, but uh, how am I how many pages is the first chapter?

1658
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,920
Uh

1659
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,560
I I forget hold on let me find out

1660
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:23,960
Uh maximum page limit is 55. I I guess for it to be like a good entry

1661
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:27,080
It would need to be a contained story that has a beginning and an end

1662
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:32,520
It's 60. It's 67 pages. Ah fail lull. It's there's an epic fail

1663
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:40,280
Lot of ghosts is nearly 100 pages, so I couldn't submit that I'll just cut out like I'll just cut out like some some bad ones

1664
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,880
Cut out the the first page second page

1665
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,320
Who needs them?

1666
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,320
Uh

1667
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,120
Oh, yeah, I can cut out the well if I cut out the cover

1668
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:58,280
Maybe yeah, I don't know whatever who cares

1669
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:05,800
Uh, all right, what were we talking about? We were talking about laughing at people who are not good in order to feel better about ourselves, which I do

1670
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,520
um

1671
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:11,640
It's not for me. It's not so even so much laughing. It's just like

1672
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,200
Because like so much of the time you look at it's a relief and you see great artists and you're like, oh god

1673
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:24,120
I'm nowhere near that but then you like it's the other side of the spectrum be like, okay. It's not it's not as bad

1674
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:29,720
It's there are no there are no great artists every time I see art. I think man. This this is shit

1675
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,440
This is embarrassing. That's not me at all

1676
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:37,240
But I guess that means I shouldn't be embarrassed because even the good stuff sucks

1677
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:43,400
Like the the thing yeah, it's not laughter. I don't I'm not laughing at these people. It's it's more of a

1678
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,280
a relief and like a

1679
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,480
That that people who have nowhere near the level of skill even I have

1680
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,920
Are confident enough in themselves to submit

1681
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:00,200
Their work and I'm like wow. Why am I being a coward when these people

1682
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:04,680
Are able to step up to the plate and present something to the world

1683
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:08,120
So it's like it's it's a relief that I don't have to worry so much

1684
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,440
Yeah

1685
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,720
Yeah, I feel you I feel you on that being an artist is embarrassing

1686
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,080
Being an artist is just like embarrassing yourself

1687
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:22,680
For money. It's it's cringe and based at the same time. It's one of those. Yeah. Yeah, pretty much

1688
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,720
I guess I guess so

1689
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,040
Uh, do you want to do the last voicemail?

1690
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,720
Yeah

1691
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,720
Okay, this last one is from

1692
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:38,200
We got one from this person last time. This is from margar. So three two one go

1693
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,920
Hey, the pcp

1694
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:47,880
I've just been listening to the latest episode and I can't help but wonder why there are so few you

1695
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:51,240
Showing up. It seems like lately. It's really just been ben

1696
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,640
uh, hippo and

1697
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,400
Nate but

1698
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:59,400
Isn't there a financial incentive for more people to show up?

1699
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,360
I mean, it just doesn't really make sense to me like

1700
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,160
What else could you guys all be doing that more people can't show up for the episodes?

1701
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:11,480
I'll listen to them either way. I think this just seems a little weird to me

1702
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:17,240
I said the same thing. I also don't understand it. There is

1703
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:22,840
There is an incentive. Yeah. I mean, that's how you get paid is if you show up to episodes

1704
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:25,160
Well, I can explain why I haven't been here

1705
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:29,240
Yeah, I mean I've been busy with like studying and stuff

1706
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:33,640
But the the real reason is that I have the covet unemployment thing

1707
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,720
and yeah, uh

1708
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,720
If I am on all four

1709
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,760
Episodes a month and then I get paid from Nate

1710
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:45,240
I am not qualified to collect unemployment and I make double the amount of money

1711
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,640
For unemployment than I do being on the podcast

1712
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:53,240
So it is actually my financial incentive now is to not be on the show because I make 500 extra dollars

1713
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:59,800
Can't you just thanks covet? Thanks covet. Can't you just like split up the amount like

1714
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:05,640
Between weeks and then you're still under the limit. I'm splitting up my patreon right now

1715
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,160
Between the weeks

1716
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:11,720
But I don't know because like if you if I go over 267 dollars in one of those weeks

1717
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,360
You get kicked and I don't get anything

1718
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:20,760
So I I'd have to crunch the numbers and like figure it out because even if you make like 250 something dollars

1719
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:26,040
You still get like 20 percent docked from the mouth. So yeah, it's yeah

1720
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:29,640
It's a it's a financial juggling. It's a lot of math. I don't like math

1721
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:35,240
So the easiest way is like I can spend that three hours doing more studying which I want to do anyways

1722
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:41,320
And I know I make more money. So I I also I do I do get money docked off my

1723
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:46,760
My unemployment for for like making income at all, which is funny

1724
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:49,080
uh, but

1725
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,080
But people got to be on the podcast

1726
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:56,200
Yeah, somebody's got to be on the after you guys a bone this week. I was like, I fuck it. I'm right here

1727
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,920
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure

1728
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:00,360
um

1729
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:01,640
I mean

1730
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:05,240
You can always just ask Nate to like hold off on paying you, right? I suppose

1731
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:13,720
Yeah, um, I mean it ends like in like three or four weeks. Anyways, so it won't be an issue after that

1732
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:19,480
It uh, they might extend it but like less like it might go from like the like 600

1733
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:25,320
Bonus to like they might like cut it a half down to like a 300 bonus or something. Well, I'm okay. It's not

1734
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:28,120
It's not it's not clear what they're gonna what's gonna happen

1735
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:33,320
I'm gaining back all the savings I lost when I was fucking pre-surgery. So I'm about it

1736
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:36,920
The state is uh, helping me out right now and I'm I'm all I'm all for it

1737
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,440
Yeah, that's good to hear

1738
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:45,000
Yeah, the thing is get some of that that sweet money back from those those all that tax

1739
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:49,800
They take for me every year for being self-employed and they double tax me. I'm finally getting a little bit of it back

1740
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:54,040
Are you ready to get taxed on your unemployment money though? No, I'm not

1741
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,720
Well

1742
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,000
Get ready

1743
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,360
That's coming

1744
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:02,680
Um, it's only it's only the base though like the covet part is not taxable from what I understand

1745
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,600
It's only the base $267 of unemployment that will be taxed wait

1746
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,640
Really? I'm pretty sure the 600

1747
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:12,040
Is is not taxable income

1748
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:17,080
Oh boy. Oh, I should look into that. I'm pretty sure don't quote me on it

1749
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:24,520
But I was watching some videos on the unemployment stuff and I'm pretty sure part of the decision was that that $600 is not taxable income

1750
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,800
I know that the trump bucks are not taxable income

1751
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:34,680
But unemployment is but like the 600 dollar like cares act bonus is a separate thing

1752
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:41,480
So I could believe that maybe that doesn't count. I'll look fascinating. That's great. That's that's very I hope that's true

1753
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
Uh, okay, cool. Cool. Cool. Cool

1754
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:45,480
Uh

1755
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,600
Dur

1756
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,600
A dur

1757
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,560
Uh, well

1758
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,600
As to as to where everyone else is uh, I don't know

1759
01:47:55,400 --> 01:48:01,080
Yeah, I don't I I don't know why Nate's not around. I don't know. I guess I guess digi is

1760
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:07,320
Doing other stuff. I don't fuck well digi digi is um extremely busy with

1761
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:16,440
Like backed up projects and also gender well stuff and I can I can I can understand digi

1762
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,240
Digi's digi's very busy with her gender right now

1763
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:27,880
Yeah, loma. I guess I guess. Um, I'm backed up projects. I've got fucking. I've got backed up projects out the wazoo

1764
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:31,640
Well, they're they're backed up projects like patreon reward things

1765
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:36,680
That's that's what I've heard like I can understand that taking president

1766
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:43,160
It is still only like a couple hours a week. It's it's like two hours. It's like two hours a week

1767
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:49,720
That's like, uh, I don't know. I don't blame anybody for not feeling like coming on because sometimes no

1768
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:55,480
It's it's it's a two hour podcast, but like you don't always want a podcast. You don't always have anything to say

1769
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,560
you don't always

1770
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,680
Feel like

1771
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:02,360
Spilling your soul out to a bunch of people who will go lol fail

1772
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:06,680
It is very strange to have Nate not showing up because like

1773
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:11,160
Nate is Nate's on like every I'm on like almost every episode

1774
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,760
I think Nate's the only one who's been on more episodes than I have

1775
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,320
So he's always here

1776
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:18,920
but now

1777
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:25,320
It's all gone. It's all come tumbling down. No, no, it's fine. It's fine and it's good

1778
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,280
Sure

1779
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,280
Sure it is

1780
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:35,080
I say this so that the patreons don't leave and then I can get all the money when I'm the only one left

1781
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:39,480
The patreon the patrons will be like they'll hear this and they'll say oh no

1782
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:44,680
We're on a sinking ship. They're gonna take me down with them. You gotta bail right now

1783
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:51,960
If you're if you're on if you are a patron when the pcp crashes and burns when we all get cancelled

1784
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,600
You are all liable for our crimes

1785
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,560
I want you to know. Yeah, so uh, you

1786
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:00,360

Uh, if we fail you you go down as well

1788
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,720

1806
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,960

1807
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,720

Yeah, the procrastinators podcast dot-com

1809
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:40,120
All our episodes are there all our shit is there. I guess that's our I guess that's our hub

1810
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:46,600
Uh or whatever as it should have been the whole time. It really should have been the whole time. Yeah everything every

1811
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,840
Damn, oh damn. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be fun

1812
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,480
Uh, we will probably

1813
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,960
I'm I'm

1814
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,800
I feel like

1815
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,800
We are probably gonna get the videos back

1816
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:02,760
And then we will

1817
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:06,280
I would if you if you made me guess right now, I would say probably yes

1818
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,880
Probably they will eventually come back and then we got to fucking back them up

1819
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:16,680
Maybe on the website or with that library thing you were talking about tom. I will as soon as they come back. I will be doing that

1820
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:20,440
I personally went through and saved

1821
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:25,800
Everything that was not a bonus in a pcp a pcp episode

1822
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:30,680
I saved it to my personal hard drive of the stuff that is currently there and has not been

1823
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:36,280
Deleted as of right now just because I was just because I was afraid they're like, oh, what if they terminate us again?

1824
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,040
Like what if what if they just

1825
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:43,560
What if they're reviewing the content and they're like, no never mind cancelled again out of here? Yeah

1826
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:49,800
Uh, okay. All right. We're out almost two hours. We did it guys. We recorded a full podcast

1827
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:55,400
We made we fulfilled our obligations to the audience and fulfill your obligation and give us money

1828
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,280
