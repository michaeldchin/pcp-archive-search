Click and click down the track. Welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast, everybody. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast, where we decide that The Pro Crastinators Podcast will be slaughtered or salvaged.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Don't you guys just hate it when you're crying while masturbating with your fucking claw hand that you've accumulated from just jacking off three times plus a day?

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thinking about your various classmates because they've worn a nerd girl t-shirt once? I do that all the time and it just sucks.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Come on, hand. Can't you keep up the heat? Get out of the kitchen. Cyborg hands for jack off two. Classmates go now, too.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know, I read this book by Jordan Peterson. I don't like the Jews either.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who are you quoting?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is not PewDiePie. That's obviously PewDiePie.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're a master of speech.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's all I'll say is that you're a master of linguists and you're a master of impersonation.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, how you say it, this is me, PewDiePie, haha, Brofius.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is a Swedish accent. He's Swedish, right?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, but he's not like...

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So he sounds exactly like the Swiss shit.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, it wasn't. I was doing the Swiss chef accent.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, okay, as you can see, everybody, we got everybody here. We got PewDiePie here.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
God, intros are so better. Intros are so better. I hate the cold intros. I love these valuable, like, productive intros we have.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I mean, I agree. I agree. But just for the sake of information, me, Bestie Boy is here, Hippocrite, Mage, Munchie, Ben.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There you go. That's who's here. Alright, moving along.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's up, guys? You like Caramel Donson or what? Are we gonna Caramel Donson or what?

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I like Caramel Donson constantly. Honestly, but listen to it constantly.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was just saying to Munchie before we started that Munchie is a...

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He literally embodies the soul, the departed spirit of the 2006 anime congoer.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Niceest thing.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ben and I would both know. We were there.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It was a special time in a boy's life.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You were around zero.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Imagine me in my Disgaea cosplay at Anime Boston 2000...

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Was that guy's name? Serif, something?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He was the Serif.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's the angel leader guy. I can't remember his name.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That might have just been his title was the Serif. His name was Master Something.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He had kind of like an English or a Swedish sounding name or something.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm gonna find this right now.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Master Something Son.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Lammington? Lammington.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Master Lammington, that's it. Yes, that's it.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, got it. Flansboss.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Imagine me in my Master Lammington Disgaea cosplay at Anime Boston 2006 at a FreezePop concert.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Glomping hard to FreezePop on the dance floor.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I still have a special place in my heart for FreezePop.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Boston-based band, as it so happens, didn't even know that at the time, but it's true.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You have a connection to one of the PC Pimmers with a blankets concert at Anime Boston, right?

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Question mark?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're talking about the pillows, my dude. You're talking about the pillow.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, the blanket.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sorry, I don't know.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Unload a fucking blanket in your skull.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait, that won't be a problem.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It'll be a real wet blanket if you were to do that.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hey, Munchy, recently I saw you did a little animation of a lateralist of RowdyFuckers Copkiller's fame

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
doing a funny dance that was similar to the Caramel Dancing.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I just wanted to ask you, why? What'd you do? Why do you think of that?

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, the reason I did that is twofold.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Number one, I'm animating on the side now.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now, guys, exclamation point, stop.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Also, I'm doing another thing that features Lateralist Heavy that I'm not going to speak about.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't get your hopes up, question mark.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you talking about Lateralist Heavy like TF2 Heavy, like big donut sandwich?

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's the thing going on?

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, believe me.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Lateralist Heavy, a frame scout, a six-ton pyrogue, the list goes on.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's a terrible lineup.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Wait, what's his face would be spilling?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I already have the lineup.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Camman is tracing.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Camman's spy, right?

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, okay, here's the thing. Crocs is Heavy.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know the rest.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There you go.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not that easy, is it?

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's all there is to say.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why do you ask? Just want to know what's going on?

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, I just thought it was a really nice little gif.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, if you're doing animation on the side, it's like...

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Link it in the show notes. Let me see. I haven't seen it.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, do that. It's in RFCK, but also...

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Speaking of nice little animations, there's on the Gibb and Take channel, there was those

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
two combined little snippets of animation from the upcoming...

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What is it? Reanimating project of...

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, it's called Hashtag Rise Up.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is that the name of the show?

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think that's what it was, right?

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hashtag, dude.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hashtag stand again.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Nate, are you looking at YouTube?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you looking at Ben Sainz's leftist Twitter feed?

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, I might have confused the two.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sorry, Gibb, please extrapolate.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's like a little animation thing of...

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh my god, 43 notifications.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Of from the Homestuck-esque, collide reanimation product.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My favorite flash, our favorite cliff flash.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, you know, I'm not like that big a fan of the flash for story reasons,

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
but parts of it are really cool and the music is pretty good.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And there's numerous reasons to do it outside of the flash itself.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm happy to be involved in a big collaborative project.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And more so than ever, you've made Arm Retrieval Canon 2 Homestuck.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, that was my big goal, is to do one of the first scenes.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't think you needed help with that.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wait, is this an official What Pumpkin project?

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, it's just like a fan who said,

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
hey guys, let's reanimate collide for the 10th anniversary of Homestuck.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But I mean, Hussie gave up all rights to artistic control over Homestuck a long time ago.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When I disagreed with the direction he took the series in.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's exactly correct, that's exactly correct.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now the, what is it, the lunatics are running the asylum as it were.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, hey, yeah, go on, who's got something?

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I got things, but go on.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, okay, well I want to continue on what we were just talking about.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So, you started this animation kick hippo.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know that you've also been animating other things.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know if you've said them on the show question mark, but I don't want to dox you, you see.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, no, no, I've mentioned that I'm working on the finale of Bail Jape.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That is the animation I'm doing.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, you've been in a real fever, you've been in a real fever pitch for animating.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm dreaming of in-betweens at this point.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm just thinking, ah, yes, smooth and jumping and key frame cool mode.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ah, I love it.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In-betweens, the trans people of animation, my favorite.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, yeah, literally transitioning from one key frame to the other.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Indeed.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I, again, myself have been doing stuff on the side for personal reasons.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And I just want to say that I kind of suspected this was the case.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But, like, I feel like animation is, like, speaks to me on a more fundamental level than any art that I do.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It really is something that I, like, appeals to me.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Like, just the busy work of doing in-between frames and, you know, just animating.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That is just an inherently fun process to me, to watch something come together

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and just to be able to kind of almost zone out in a way.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Once you have your key frames and you've done all the thinking hard work,

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
then you can just fill it in, that's really, really hot.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You know what, you know what I think about that.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is something, okay, because we recently finished all those big video projects

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and I've gotten back to drawing more, I have been facing this prospect more

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and remembering the weird contradiction.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I feel the same way about starting to draw.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Because, like, once you start drawing, it's fine.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I feel the same way about doing that as I feel about sleeping and that it terrifies me.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because, like, yes, because I'm afraid...

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know exactly what you mean.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm afraid to let my, to turn my brain off.

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm like...

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh!

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, that's a very different way.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Really? Okay.

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is this the whole, like, you don't know if you're the same person when you wake up, sort of thing?

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, not exactly. It's not rational like that.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's just, I don't want to do it.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I know when I start, like, why don't you,

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and Hippo and Mage, do you feel this way when you're thinking about maybe starting drawing

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and you're like, oh, but I don't want to start that, though,

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
because then I'll, like, I don't know.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't even know what it is.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You know, I think I might know where you're coming from.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's like the prospect of, like, I think about this sometimes of, like,

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
getting started with something means I know that if I get going,

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I will be doing it for a certain amount of time.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I won't...

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mage, don't just jump in and interrupt the middle of a sentence.

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Like the... fuck.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, where are you saying?

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know. I can't remember.

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A way to go, Mage.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm trying. It's one of those things where, like, I can't fucking think of the word.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You know that thing where, like, you think of the word?

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Guys, what was he saying? We were all listening.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was too busy yelling at Mage. I can't remember.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Dude, this is a great podcast.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, okay.

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What was the question?

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ben, you feel like you don't want to start drawing.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I do that because you know that once you're in there,

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
anything that comes along that could potentially interrupt you

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
will piss you off more than it would otherwise would.

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And you don't know whether your future is going to be completely, you know,

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
devoid of interruptions.

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And you're like, I need to wait for the perfect time to start doing this thing

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
that will take hours.

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, that's part of it.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's like, oh, maybe I shouldn't do it now.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's not so much that I'm worried about being upset, about being interrupted.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's just like, does this feel like the ideal moment to start on this?

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Am I in the perfect headspace to do this now?

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Maybe I should just wait. Maybe I should just wait in a better time.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A better opportunity will come along, which is ridiculous.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm going to level with you. You've got a pebble in your brain,

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and you've got to drink something to get rid of.

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's got a pebble for a brain, if anything.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You've got to drink some carbonated soda to wash that down,

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
some bang to wash that down, because that's an extremely terrible mindset to have.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And I have that too sometimes.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm not saying this is right. I'm just saying this is my problem.

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I feel that way too sometimes.

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I know that the way to fix it is to push through it more often.

199
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But because I wasn't drawing much for a while, now I've started doing it again.

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I've been facing this.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And I know that the way to bust it is to keep doing it and keep resisting it.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And I'm still working through that for the time being.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But it's getting better.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
For a while.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
For me, it's not that I feel like I should wait for a better time,

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
or something's wrong and I should wait.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's really just that I don't want to do it because I'm lazy.

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's partially that.

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The things I usually do to get over that initial thing is have a small ritual.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If I'm slightly hungry or tired, I will go downstairs, get a cup of tea or a small snack,

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
eat that, drink that while listening to something or reading Twitter or Discord.

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And once I'm done with the eating, then I start the work and I drink the tea.

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Music makes me more productive.

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It definitely does, and yet I never listen to it.

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's just not something I do.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
When I do, the results are always good.

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Lads, we've got to talk over each other a little bit less here.

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We're getting all tangled up.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is particularly...

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, that wasn't even directed at you, Meiji.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think Meiji needs to learn to interrupt better.

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Not more, but better.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I was trying to make a point because there are a lot of people that say,

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Everyone, guys, I have something to say.

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Make sure you just go in and interrupt.

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I tried two times and you guys...

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There's an arc to this.

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You said it while we were talking.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Here's my strategy.

230
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's compare strategies on how to talk over each other.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You guys don't pause. Where am I supposed to start talking?

232
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You look at strategic gaps in the armor.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Right there, I found one.

234
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You wait for a strategic moment.

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can do that.

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The way that I create a strategic moment.

237
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's about creating opportunities.

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's about visualizing the future you want to see,

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and then the universe will bring it to you.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Here's the thing.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I feel like I interrupt properly.

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
When I say, guys, I have something to say.

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I usually try and find a moment.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't think you're just better served by saying...

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Instead of saying those words, being like...

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And then they will make space for you.

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And then you just launch into it.

248
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
My strategy is that if I'm trying to say something

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and someone else is talking and I want them to stop,

250
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I will begin the first word.

251
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll say the first syllable.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
People feel the anticipation there.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I'll just...

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And I'll keep doing that until the person speaking notices

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and it disrupts them.

256
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And then eventually they will...

257
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's a psychological battle of wills.

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why do they do this? There's no time limit here.

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It just lets the person speaking know

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
that something is going to interrupt them

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and they better just accept that possible.

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll tell you why.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
On one hand, it's like...

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If people are interrupting each other,

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that means they have things to say.

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
All the other boys have a lot of things to say about this

267
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and it's an interesting topic.

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
However, it would be more easy to follow

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and more interesting if instead of just

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
spitting out...

271
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We actually thought

272
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
for even narrate a millisecond

273
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
to construct our point more.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll tell you my reason.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There's an elaborate series of reasons as to why that's done.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll tell you the biggest one.

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
One is that the conversation,

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
if you don't seize the moment when you have something to say,

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
could just move on

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and then your thought will no longer be appropriate.

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And the other real thought I have

282
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
is I will literally just forget

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
what I was going to say.

284
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Actually, right now, for the last five minutes,

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I have had a thought on my frontal cortex

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
waiting to be ejaculated

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
into the conversation

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and I'm waiting for a lull to go back

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to a thing to say it. And I could lose it at any moment.

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's precarious balance

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and my psyche could be disrupted.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But then you get the...

293
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Is this good for you, Buntie?

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is this what you want?

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hey, can you hear this?

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey, can you hear this gun shooting your head?

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That thought not.

298
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Thought not.

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Got a silencer on it.

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
A pen and pencil might actually be the solution.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Or like a pen and paper.

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, wow.

303
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Munchie solves world hunger yet again.

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Just a snatch in a way.

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
A pen and paper, tabletop, RPG,

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
dungeon crawl with the PCP.

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Bonus episode.

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What a race is all I'm trying to say.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We can all say everything we want.

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And this isn't me an anti-conversationalist.

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're not accepting the full reality

312
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
of the battleground

313
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that any given conversation truly is.

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No other podcast is like this.

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
By saying that there's no time limit,

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
that's ignoring the fact that conversations

317
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
can simply shift

318
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and then you just don't have the chance to say your thought

319
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
on what the conversation was.

320
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Conversations only shift when people want to change the conversation.

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
No, that's not true.

322
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It just evolves organically, dude.

323
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Unless the Russians collude

324
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and force a change in the conversation.

325
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There's definitely something to be said

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
with regards to letting people

327
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
speak

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
when they

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
need to get something out

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
of their chest.

331
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But I totally see what Nate is saying

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
because a lot of the times

333
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have a thing

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
that I didn't anticipate the conversation

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
going this way, but now I have something

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
to talk about this thing.

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I haven't written it down.

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And I don't know how to use a pencil,

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
so I'm just gonna forget about it.

340
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I was surprised.

341
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Not everyone agreed with me in the comments last episode,

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
but there were quite a few people

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
who were like, I like that

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
being a little bit of a clusterfuck.

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I like a little bit of people interrupting each other.

346
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let the pod just let it be what it is.

347
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And I was like, I'm glad I'm not the only one

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that sees it that way.

349
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And let me defend myself.

350
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I am the first person to admit that I like

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
how frantic the PCP is sometimes.

352
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm not saying it has to be another

353
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
boilerplate podcast.

354
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Everyone just waits their turn

355
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and just speaks only when they are

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
called upon or highlighted.

357
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why did I think that the phrase you were about to use

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
was boilerplate apocalypse?

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't know.

360
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
However, I think

361
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
there's a balance here.

362
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Moderation and all things.

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I think there's a time and a place for clusterfucks

364
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
which could be even often.

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And the time is now.

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay, let's do it.

367
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hey guys, it's me on the podcast.

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't interrupt me, please.

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Wow, that was a great joke

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and I'm glad everyone committed to it.

371
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't have anything to say.

372
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That was awful.

373
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What were you saying?

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Art is shit and I'm glad

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm not doing it anymore.

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Hey guys, I just want to let you know

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
that I'm retiring from the podcast.

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I made enough money. I can live for the rest of my life.

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's fair. We all can.

380
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But we are greedy.

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We want to steal the money from the poor

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
by continuing to make the podcast.

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, it can't happen. We were having a great conversation

384
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and now it's back to the shit.

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Guys, dammit.

386
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Please support my empire at patreon.com.

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'd really appreciate that if you just keep sucking up

388
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
by vacuum on the poor.

389
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Just giving it straight to my bank account.

390
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
My personal goal is to

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
make a living in a way as opposite

392
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
to my personal and political beliefs

393
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
as possible.

394
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I thought you were going to say

395
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
as opposite to Nate as possible.

396
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I just want to let you know

397
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
that I'm extremely suspicious of you right now

398
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
because you said something

399
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
which hurt me

400
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
deep in my arteries.

401
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You said you check Twitter

402
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
when you get your T.

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
On what device are you checking Twitter?

404
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What do you mean?

405
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
On my computer?

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think that's a pretty straightforward question.

407
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Stop dodging the question.

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Wrong answer, dude.

409
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't understand.

410
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He's showing weakness. Get him.

411
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Everyone talk plow.

412
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
In my head, I envisioned you

413
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
walking downstairs and drinking tea.

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But I guess the next sense,

415
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
if you were on your phone using Twitter,

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I would have said tisk tisk, not strongly.

417
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, no, no. That's not on my phone.

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay, I'm glad.

419
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I have also...

420
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You see, I'm following your footsteps.

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're a big daddy to me,

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and I would appreciate if your cock could come out soon

423
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
rather than later.

424
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Because my phone is basically

425
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
not connected to the internet whatsoever anymore.

426
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No social media, no YouTube.

427
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No fucking web browser.

428
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Literally no web browser.

429
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's gone.

430
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I have not...

431
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't even look at my phone anymore.

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Just because it's a piece of shit.

433
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Well, I mean, it's not

434
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
aspirational. It's because

435
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
the thing is just really old and stuff.

436
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ben's truly stumbled ass backwards

437
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
into the perfect lifestyle.

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's not, because anything that I would

439
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
be wasting time on looking at my phone,

440
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I just look at it on my desktop instead.

441
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No, I'm not aspirational

442
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
in this regard.

443
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Or any regard.

444
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll fucking kill you, dude.

445
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
A couple of days ago,

446
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I wanted to get really serious

447
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
about my phone

448
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
chewing up time, because I have had

449
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the social media stuff off my phone

450
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
for a while now.

451
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
When I delete Twitter from my phone,

452
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I just basically stopped using Twitter

453
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
altogether. I don't even know

454
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the last time I looked at my Twitter.

455
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I have no fucking clue.

456
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Other social media stuff also falling off the map

457
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
as well as Discord. I have a mobile account now.

458
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's been for a while now,

459
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
but I finally took a big plunge

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and just basically deleted everything

461
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
off my phone that was not

462
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
inherently work or

463
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
communications related.

464
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's fine.

465
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I only have one screen on my phone

466
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and it's all just like writing apps.

467
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll just write apps or

468
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
my default music player

469
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and that's basically it.

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's just a brick.

471
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's a brick of

472
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
pure writing and it feels

473
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
so good to be liberated from the

474
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
distractions that come with your phone.

475
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Not only that,

476
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've turned it into a pure

477
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
work beast.

478
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Finally, for the first time in my fucking life

479
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
gotten

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
a to-do app,

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
a task app

482
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and a schedule for myself.

483
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I finally have

484
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
a bedtime

485
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
where I'm going to bed at a single time

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
and I'm waking up at a single time

487
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
every single day.

488
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Don't embrace this meme of this Digi Bro lifestyle

489
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
which I'm sure he would agree with as well.

490
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Having a set time to go to bed and wake up

491
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
is just good for you.

492
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm pretty sure

493
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
because you have an internal clock.

494
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
When you wake up

495
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
you don't feel like you want to die for two hours.

496
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Imagine that.

497
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So I'm

498
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
trying to go to bed at the same time every day.

499
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh and big thing,

500
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I have a journal now.

501
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I had a journal before but I was not sticking to it.

502
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Now I have a convenient app

503
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
called

504
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Day Leo

505
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and it is just a small

506
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
app that reminds you

507
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
every day at a certain time

508
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to write about your day

509
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
which is what I've been doing every single day for a while now

510
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and it's extremely helpful for my memory.

511
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's cool.

512
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's really nice so I've locked down my phone

513
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and it's really great.

514
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm really happy about it.

515
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Is it something that you like?

516
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I mean

517
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I had my journal

518
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
that I would bring on holidays and stuff

519
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
to record events.

520
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sometimes

521
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the day was so full of stuff

522
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and by the time I remembered that I should write my journal

523
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I was so tired I was just like

524
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't know what to say.

525
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I want it to be like a thing I can come back to

526
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
so I don't want to just write nothing.

527
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Ironically

528
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
those are the days you need it most, right?

529
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I've had that all the time.

530
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I had a physical journal

531
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and I use it.

532
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But I have a physical journal

533
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that I would have that exact same

534
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
scenario.

535
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I would try and write every day

536
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
even when I was not on trips

537
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and it just would fall through.

538
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I just couldn't keep it up.

539
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I would do it for the first couple days of a trip

540
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and then it would be like I did so much today

541
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm just fucking tired. I don't want to do this.

542
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I hate writing by hand.

543
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's just a fucking nightmare.

544
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
However, with this

545
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
app, it's specifically incentivized

546
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
for you to write short sentences.

547
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
For instance,

548
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
yesterday...

549
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's like Twitter but only you can read it.

550
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Literally yes.

551
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Literally yes. It's like for that

552
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
basically.

553
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
There was a...

554
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So you just at least have a record of what you did

555
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
the previous day.

556
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And when I have something more interesting to say

557
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
that's when I break out the journal.

558
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So I have a system here. It's every single day

559
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and then when I have something more interesting

560
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
to write about and I have the free time

561
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to do so, I'll break out my journal.

562
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And that means it's not like a commitment

563
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
that I feel bad about breaking

564
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that is writing in the physical journal.

565
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's just like a...

566
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Whatever I break out the journal, it's just non-stop

567
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
good interesting things that I've chosen

568
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
to write about and therefore it feels more

569
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
important and better.

570
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The Penny Arcade guys had a little inside joke

571
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
running for a while

572
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
about an app called Twonter

573
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
which is just Twitter, but instead

574
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
of posting your tweet, it just doesn't go

575
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
anywhere and nobody sees it.

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's like you get the satisfaction

577
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
of making an angry tweet with none

578
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
of the fallout or problems that come from it.

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It would be a good system.

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Everyone should get that and send

581
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
everything they want to send on Twitter on

582
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Twonter first, see how they feel

583
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
about it and then decide if they want to

584
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
re-send it. Yeah, come back the next day.

585
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah. Do I want to tweet my...

586
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No, the answer is always

587
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
the answer is always no.

588
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Sometimes I go on Twitter

589
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and I'm like, well

590
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
let's try and think of something

591
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
to say. Let's try and think of something funny.

592
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Usually it just results

593
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
in me saying something stupid, but you know

594
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
whatever, but I shouldn't

595
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
feel the need to post anything

596
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
if I don't feel like there's

597
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
anything to say and yet there I go

598
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
trying to...

599
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The most recent one was like Jimmy

600
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Neutron meets Jimmy Page.

601
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I was like, I mean it's kind of funny

602
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
but like I only did that because

603
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I was on Twitter and I was like, I should probably

604
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
tweet something. It's been a while, it's been

605
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
a few days.

606
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's kind of stupid.

607
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's just so boring, honestly.

608
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
After a while it just becomes like

609
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
do I really want to know

610
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
what everyone else is saying?

611
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Not in the sense that I'm antisocial, but like

612
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I've known everyone I'm following

613
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
for so long, like I know

614
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
what they're going to say, it's just going to be more

615
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
bullshit.

616
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Nothing's new there.

617
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm not getting any new stimuli.

618
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's just keeping up with people

619
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
it's keeping up with you guys

620
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
exclusively. I've been getting

621
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
new stimuli from Twitter.

622
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I've been having a great time

623
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
tweeting about what a lefty

624
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I am and getting

625
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
people mad.

626
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
People aren't fucking argue with me.

627
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
On that subject Ben, I just want to let you know this is no disrespect

628
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
but I find that so

629
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
tasteful that I just have muted you

630
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and have no interest. You've muted me?

631
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I had no choice Ben. You've muted me because

632
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I made like six tweets in the past week

633
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
are you kidding me?

634
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Ben, okay here's the thing, maybe you should blame Twitter

635
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
because for some reason at the top

636
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
of my feed out of chronological order

637
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
it just kept showing

638
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
like one of your particularly

639
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
political tweets and I was like well I don't want

640
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
to deal with this, what are my options here?

641
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I make one every like two days

642
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
one every two days for the last week

643
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
or so. That's a completely valid

644
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
move Nate. I haven't done it to Ben just because

645
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I haven't done it to Twitter. I do not apologize

646
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
at all. I'll mute whoever the fuck I want

647
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
anytime. Twitter is for my fun and

648
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
enjoyment so I make no apologies

649
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
but that's the thing. But Twitter is not fun

650
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I agree with my sheet

651
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
but it's not a good time. I disagree Ben.

652
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I go there to have a bad time and make sure everyone else

653
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is having a bad time too.

654
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
For me, who I follow on Twitter

655
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
is a bunch of people I generally like

656
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
not everybody 100% like people like

657
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
all of you who I like basically everything

658
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you do and I retweet a lot of it because it's fun

659
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and good and I like people to see it

660
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and then also like anime cat girl bots

661
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
these are the things I follow

662
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
and they bring me such joy

663
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and so Twitter for the me is mostly just a great

664
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
time and you know what

665
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
maybe I'm just not the right audience

666
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm just saying this is a consequence

667
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
of the you know

668
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
of the political spin here. The main thing

669
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I think of when I'm like should I delete

670
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Twitter? Probably not

671
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
is that I follow a few artists

672
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and I like when I see good art

673
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and I want to share it with the people who follow me

674
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and

675
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
it's like you know it's a nice feeling

676
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
to share someone's art when it's good

677
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and to just see

678
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
oh there's a new Jade Maraud tweet

679
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I like her stuff every time

680
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
but I don't see it posted anywhere else

681
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and I don't really follow her in other places

682
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
so I'm like

683
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I don't know

684
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
it's convenient enough

685
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to keep around

686
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I think I maybe should just unfollow

687
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
everyone who says words

688
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I mean kind of

689
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and I know that I too do this

690
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
so I would not blame people

691
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
if people just don't want to hear me say any thoughts

692
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I totally get it and I would say then yeah

693
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
absolutely unfollow

694
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
whatever it's not a pure just fun

695
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
time all the time

696
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Honestly I think a lot of my

697
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
disfun comes from

698
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
very structural foundation

699
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
things about Twitter

700
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm thinking right now what if I had a Twitter

701
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
that was just

702
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
literally all images

703
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and they were all drawing some artists that I liked

704
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and I'm imagining on that white

705
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Twitter page just scrolling down

706
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and I just can't help but think

707
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I would still feel terrible

708
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
using the light theme

709
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
what is the light motif

710
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
yeah something like that

711
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I think I switched to dark but whatever it doesn't even matter

712
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I would still feel bad

713
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
because I just don't want to just

714
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
it just feels unproductive

715
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
it feels like even

716
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
more terrible than like watching

717
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
something

718
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
it feels like

719
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
you're doing cookie clicker

720
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
but if you get more cookies

721
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
you get internet cookies

722
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I mean at this point

723
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
watching an anime

724
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
for example for me feels like

725
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
homework

726
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
for me I'd just rather read a manga

727
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
because it goes way faster and feels like less of an obligation

728
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I feel like Twitter is like a similar

729
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
sort of thing that it's just like

730
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
it's one level easier

731
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
than like now we have all the media we can consume

732
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
infinitely at our fingertips

733
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but like Twitter's faster, Twitter's like easier

734
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
let's just go there, that'll be like more

735
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
you know fast results

736
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to my brain stimulus

737
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I just hate scrolling down, not in like a physical way

738
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
like I just don't want to scroll

739
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
but it just makes me feel like

740
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm a fucking soulless automaton

741
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
well look, I hear you

742
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I still think there are good things

743
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
for example, shout out to

744
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Ukrainiansagok at black

745
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
s-e-a-a-m-s

746
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
something like that, I just posted a link

747
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
to a thing, Ukrainian, yeah

748
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
look at the disgusting gross audio links

749
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
just look at this one tweet, just says enormous

750
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and it's an old school anime

751
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
robot guy just oozing power

752
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
this is what I like to see

753
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
this falls into my anime cat robot group

754
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
it's just lovely old anime

755
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
images that he posts screencaps of all the time

756
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and it just brings me a little bit of joy to see

757
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
this is what I like Twitter for

758
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
to see shit like this

759
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
he posts stuff like that

760
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
in the discords that

761
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm in, that he's in

762
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
so like

763
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I don't know, I mean it's good for me

764
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
it means I don't need to follow him on Twitter

765
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I can ask him, like hey

766
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
send me some funny things and he'll do it

767
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I just, I just

768
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm just over here saying

769
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I started first, I'm just over here

770
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I want to quickly say I'm just over here

771
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm going, I'm going

772
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
yeah I have to, I have to, I'm sorry

773
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I need to go, it's okay though

774
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
just sorry for

775
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
pay docked, you gotta pay

776
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
understood, say why

777
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
why you gotta go, what the fuck

778
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I gotta go, I did say in it

779
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I don't mind not getting paid, it's fine

780
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
it's okay, have fun guys

781
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
later

782
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
is it private, you can just go, okay

783
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
alright

784
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
do we bully her too much, I'm so sorry

785
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I don't think so, I hope not

786
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I hope not

787
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
well whatever

788
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
triggered by Twitter

789
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
well I guess, you know

790
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Twitter is lame, art is lame

791
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I hate images, I hate going on Twitter

792
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and seeing images that I like

793
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I am having a great time

794
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm having a great time

795
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
going on there

796
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
saying an opinion

797
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and having people be

798
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and having an outpouring of yes

799
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I agree with this and I hate you

800
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
you're an idiot for thinking this

801
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
that is stimulating to me

802
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
maybe I'm just weak, but I don't get much joy out of that

803
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I don't know

804
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I don't think it's like a strength to enjoy

805
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
indulging in stupid

806
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
shit

807
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
it's not stupid shit, it's about

808
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
saving the world

809
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
one tweet at a time

810
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
just manipulate people with your comics

811
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
that's the best way to do it

812
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I do think that's the best way to do it

813
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
to package an ideology in some

814
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
consumable media, I think is pretty effective

815
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
alright, that's fair

816
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm scrolling down and it's literally all in Japanese

817
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and all the images that I like and I'm still unhappy

818
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
well that's why I'm bummed

819
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that's why I'm bummed that you've muted me

820
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
because now that I am drawing comic pages again

821
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and every time I finish a page

822
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I tweet like, hey it's on the Patreon

823
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
new page up early

824
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
for patrons at patreon.com

825
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that's true

826
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I don't know, I'm sure I'll get you back

827
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
frankly you're one of my favorite people to follow

828
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
historically, but I don't know

829
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I pretty much like all your shit

830
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
as has been, I've been pretty vocal on

831
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
but whatever, I mean you're not like some of these other people

832
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
who have just always been annoying

833
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
shout out to my boy

834
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
what's his name? Econ

835
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
an eternal mute

836
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
if there ever was one

837
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
but uh

838
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I like

839
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I know, but I have muted him historically

840
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
a couple times because he will go on some

841
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
tears, he will go on some

842
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
tweets, he will go on some tweet rampages

843
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
indeed, from time to time

844
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
what, Munchy?

845
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
number one

846
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
what do I call myself as a

847
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
binhead patreon bin saint fan?

848
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I think a saint head

849
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I think bin head rolls off the tongue better

850
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I think saint head

851
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I like the sound of it better

852
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
personally

853
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm a clergy member, that's more thematic and funny

854
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
as opposed to saint head

855
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
what about a victim of

856
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
pre-sexual molestation

857
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I don't know

858
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
also totally unsubstantiated

859
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
also, by the way

860
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
so

861
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
as a saint head

862
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I always see

863
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
vapor's pages

864
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
posted and emailed to me

865
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I could update from patreon and be like

866
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
hey, here's a new page and I always check them out

867
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
but I have to wonder

868
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
why aren't you putting them on your website

869
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
so normal people can see them

870
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and you get bigger

871
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
let me speak

872
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
for the voices of the non-patrons

873
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I've never patroned anyone in my life, I speak for the normos here

874
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and

875
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
it's true, but I see you post

876
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
all the time, or maybe more in the past

877
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
but whatever, I see you post like, hey, new page on my patreon

878
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
become a patron

879
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
totally understandable but

880
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
that does nothing for me as a non-patron

881
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I think you're possibly

882
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
somewhat handicapping your reach

883
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
by giving some preview

884
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
to people in some way

885
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I don't know exactly what would be the best way to do it

886
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
the way you do it, that's what

887
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it's like, you post a page on patreon

888
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
then maybe like a week later you post it publicly

889
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
so like, if you're a patron

890
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
you still get that bonus of it being like

891
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
oh, I got this on the inside, like I'm up to date with the bin saint lore

892
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I know what's going on

893
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that's reasonable, I suppose

894
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
you got your eternal stingy fucks like me

895
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
who just will never pony up the dollar

896
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that's why you make it public

897
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
so that you can still have benefit

898
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
no one can market to you then

899
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
well, you'll never get my money

900
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
but you will get my

901
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
support and my spreading of the content

902
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
so that's something that you can leverage

903
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
you can get, I'm not a patron to Ben

904
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but I did buy

905
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
the vapor's kickstarter book

906
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
that's the sort of thing

907
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll put money down for

908
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
rather than a recurring payment

909
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
buy a cool thing

910
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
so if people know about

911
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and like your comic and more people are fans

912
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
that's just better

913
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
the biggest currency

914
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
someone in your position has to trade in Ben

915
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
is awareness

916
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
yeah, attention, exactly

917
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
so putting that first

918
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
my rationale

919
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
maybe it's good, maybe it's bad

920
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
but I like

921
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and I want the

922
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
well, like

923
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
you know

924
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
when I work for a long time

925
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and I release a full comic

926
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
like Vapors 3, done

927
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
one of these days I'm gonna say

928
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
guys, this Friday

929
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Vapors 3, it's coming out this Friday

930
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and then on Friday, bam, Vapors 3, it's out

931
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
it's sort of an event

932
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
and I've looked at my

933
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
website analytics or whatever

934
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and on those days

935
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I get a big spike

936
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and sometimes

937
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
my viewership stays

938
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
a little elevated after that spike

939
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and I don't know

940
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm sure there's an argument to me

941
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that maybe if I spread that out

942
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
there'd be a lot of smaller spikes

943
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and maybe viewership would grow

944
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
over the long term, I don't know

945
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
good or bad in terms of that business model

946
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I know I would do something similarly

947
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
because I feel so

948
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I want my videos

949
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and my artistic creations or whatever

950
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
to be released in the way that I want them

951
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
to appreciate in that way

952
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
so with patrons, that's one thing

953
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
but I sympathize

954
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
when I first started doing the whole

955
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
comics thing, I thought

956
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I don't really like reading

957
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
one page at a time

958
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you've championed that

959
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I like reading something in one big chunk

960
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
the whole story is one story

961
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I want to consume the whole thing in one

962
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
blast because that's really how it's meant to be consumed

963
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
not one page every week

964
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
here's a thought

965
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and I was just going to say on top of that

966
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
also, releasing

967
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
an early two patrons

968
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
is something that I do for my patrons

969
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I would think it's good to offer

970
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
something

971
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and then that's one of the things

972
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
just to confirm

973
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
none of Vapor Chapter 3

974
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
is on your website, none of it, correct?

975
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that's right and there is

976
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
not an unsubstantial amount

977
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of pages that you've released to patrons

978
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
so imagine you're a Ben St. fan

979
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
who likes your comics, likes the Vapers

980
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
but maybe you aren't as initiated

981
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
as

982
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
maybe some other St. Heads

983
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
or maybe you just don't want to patron someone

984
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
from their perspective, Ben St.

985
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
has not released a comic page

986
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
since the champion

987
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
since the champion ended

988
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
well, I mean

989
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
there was nuts the beginning

990
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
if you want to count that

991
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
okay, sure

992
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
then yeah, you're right

993
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
so I think

994
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
again, there's a middle ground here

995
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I think it would be

996
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I don't know if there is a middle ground on this

997
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing

998
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
that it just comes randomly

999
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
at some point because like

1000
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
with animators on YouTube

1001
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
that used to be like they would do nothing

1002
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and then suddenly there was a new video

1003
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and you're like, oh cool

1004
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
it wasn't like a detriment

1005
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
some people would get mad

1006
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that somebody didn't upload

1007
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
like Egoraptor didn't upload enough animations

1008
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
and they left

1009
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and I never understood that mindset

1010
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
but I guess some people are like that

1011
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
where if they don't get a constant feed of information

1012
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
they're just going to be upset

1013
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I mean I don't think people will be too upset

1014
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
at someone like with Ben's release model

1015
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
because I think they're relatively used to

1016
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
like the long delays between stuff

1017
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so it's a different-ish sort of thing

1018
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
but I mean on the subject of

1019
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
something of a compromise

1020
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
here's a thought

1021
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think it is something of a problem

1022
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
even George R.R. Martin

1023
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
has released like sample chapters

1024
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
of Winds of Winter and I think that's

1025
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
helps him

1026
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
here's a thought

1027
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
maybe either like releasing a page as a tease

1028
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
to give some general maybe something like that would work

1029
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
or perhaps

1030
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
when you tweet

1031
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
when I see those tweets that are like hey

1032
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
new page is available to my patrons

1033
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and I have the idea of having like a

1034
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
just like a screen cap not of the whole thing

1035
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
but of like one little highlight

1036
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
of the page to be like a tease almost

1037
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
to be like hey you could see this

1038
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and so much more

1039
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
if you're on board with this shit

1040
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
that I think would do a lot for me because I have not seen

1041
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
new Ben comic

1042
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
for I don't know what a year or something

1043
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
now and I would love to

1044
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm very excited to see more

1045
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
so something like that might both drum up

1046
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I mean it could persuade me I mean potentially

1047
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
think about it like this

1048
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
or just to pay more attention

1049
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I would wager to say

1050
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
that blank

1051
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
that blank Patreon link is not very appealing

1052
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
indeed

1053
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I would wager to say that a lot of people

1054
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
do not think of you

1055
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
as primarily a comics

1056
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
artist in a lot of ways

1057
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
that's true and it's partially my fault

1058
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
because your other work is

1059
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
so much more visible

1060
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
and so

1061
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
much more frequent

1062
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Ben St. is far more

1063
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
of a streamer or a

1064
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
video essayist than he is

1065
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
comics and I don't even think that's

1066
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
because it's wildly that you produce

1067
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
these things more though you do obviously

1068
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
but just that they're so much

1069
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
easier to get to people

1070
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
than your comics because they're just

1071
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
behind the Patreon wall

1072
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and not as many people

1073
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
see it as

1074
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
probably want to see it

1075
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I mean some of this is inevitable

1076
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I mean a lot of people would want to see it more

1077
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
than just our Patreon too

1078
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I mean it's a platform

1079
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
problem right

1080
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
my Twitch streams

1081
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
are on Twitch

1082
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
and you know people are on Twitch

1083
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I got like a thousand and some change

1084
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
followers on Twitch there they get notifications

1085
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
my Youtube videos

1086
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
are on Youtube

1087
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
that's where people are

1088
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
it's definitely part of that

1089
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
are on my website which does not have a subscribe feature I think it's definitely

1090
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,880
something to be said that if you release more on there there will be more

1091
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,840
traction I haven't I haven't released I've been releasing my old pages on

1092
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,400
line webtoon I'm trying to get online webtoon and when I start releasing

1093
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,320
Vapors 3 I'm gonna be releasing them on Topastic again which I do I always

1094
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,040
forget I have like I have like six thousand five or six thousand followers

1095
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,560
on Topastic that I just forget about yeah it's not bad I don't even think about

1096
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:12,000
their existence ever I was thinking about like in terms of like websites and

1097
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,560
retention and people going to your website I was I was thinking about like I

1098
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,480
want forums back I want I want to bring a forum I want to make a forum on APS

1099
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,880
adventures dot site where I like I do like most of my notifications and

1100
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,280
stuff and maybe even I mean like I have a community on Discord but they are

1101
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,840
mostly just chat about nothing like if I had them to like if there was a

1102
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,680
reason for people to go to my site just for no reason just to hang out then it

1103
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:53,200
would be better for me in every way when I made my website peep like like like

1104
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,200
webs like how-to sites on the internet as well as like individual people that I

1105
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,720
talked to about it like I heard a lot like you got to have a comment section

1106
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,520
like you got to put a comment section under your pages so you can see so people

1107
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:15,120
can discuss and shit and I thought about that and you know I have I wouldn't say

1108
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,880
I have a huge readership even right now and you know back then it was much

1109
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,160
smaller and I just I just thought about well two things one I thought about all

1110
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,840
the all the shit that we say about like the comment section under a YouTube

1111
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,000
video being a part of the experience it's a part it becomes a part of the art

1112
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
if you put it there right and apart and it's a part that I don't have control

1113
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,480
over and no I don't want that I want your site is very clean and well I I totally

1114
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,000
value you know the utility of comments I it is it would you know it would mess

1115
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,840
with the aesthetic of the site which I would mess with the aesthetic of the

1116
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:53,120
site of the site of the site it would affect the message of what I'm trying

1117
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,960
to put there would affect the experience I'm trying to give the reader or

1118
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,280
whatever and I don't like that furthermore I just thought back to all of the

1119
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,640
like modestly known web comics that I've ever seen and unless you're huge you go

1120
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,520
to a website for a comic and you look at down at the comments and it's like zero

1121
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,920
comments on bait if you like if you got one if you got one on every page even if

1122
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
you're a popular web comment you'll have just zero comments and it's just a bad

1123
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,520
look and embarrassing Frank yeah I even though it happens to like everyone it

1124
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,960
looks bad and I don't want to look bad yeah it makes you it makes you feel it

1125
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,560
makes you look like nobody is reading and therefore it's like going into a shop

1126
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,920
where there's nothing on the shelves yeah even if people are reading it's like

1127
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,240
well why would you post a comment on like every page like maybe you'll have a

1128
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,440
bunch of comments on like the last page or the first well Ben clearly you don't

1129
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,560
get over to my and visit my friends on I don't know what it like dojin moe no

1130
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,160
that's not it like an ex hentai.com where you'll see just some some some real

1131
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,400
troopers commenting on every page oh yes I would also like to do this to my

1132
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,160
sexual partner ah yes that that also was the good sex right there.

1133
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,160
If I had one.

1134
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,160
Oh us gamers am I right?

1135
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,480
I completely empathize with like wanting to have things be a big block you just drop

1136
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,720
and it has a huge impact but I just don't think that that's valuable.

1137
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,200
I mean Munchie might just be right that like no matter how you want to do it I

1138
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,440
mean I get that like there's no reason for me to make like big videos that take

1139
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,800
a long time it's just a mistake but I'm going to keep doing it anyway because I

1140
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,360
want to so I mean on YouTube the algorithm specifically rewards frequent

1141
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,760
content I think well I think the algorithm rewards that because that is it

1142
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,560
kind of ties into human nature like people get hype for for regular we

1143
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,760
Aguas yeah that's true and when you know I mean you leave a little trailer for

1144
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,720
the last one that you did the Kingdom Hearts one I think like that was yeah

1145
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,960
like that build-up hype people are waiting for it but it's it's only like

1146
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,560
they were expecting it because you used to post it weekly and that that's in the

1147
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,960
name and it's kind of a joke that it hasn't been weekly but playing the hype

1148
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,160
is a dangerous thing to do because it risks the the the the possibility of the

1149
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,040
bubble bursting that's true you can build a pipe for a while and if you pay it off

1150
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:26,000
well the rewards are sweet but you run the risk of very easily waiting too long

1151
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,360
and then no one cares that's why that's one of the many reasons why you don't

1152
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,640
talk about what you're doing until it's like done yeah like you don't you don't

1153
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,760
promise a thing until it's like beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is going to be

1154
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,600
delivered yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah cuz if you know I should say yeah if you

1155
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,480
if you hype yeah hype you know it's that thing about like investigator like

1156
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:57,360
any day now guys I'm sure just like I'm pretty sure I oh well no that's not yeah

1157
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,160
okay you know when you when you I mean there's the thing it's like when you

1158
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,920
talk about what you're working on you get that emotional release as though you

1159
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,600
had shown it to someone as though it were done which kills your motivation to do

1160
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,560
it and also the fact that yeah if you don't end up doing it so so it makes you

1161
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,600
less likely to finish it and then if you don't finish it it is emotionally it is

1162
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,920
damaging to the people that were hyped and are now disappointed and it's like

1163
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,360
emotionally damaging to you I don't know about you guys I mean I'm sure you

1164
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,680
get this as well but like I love I to a to a what's the word I supposed to a

1165
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,280
problematic degree probably I love keeping my projects completely under wraps

1166
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,600
or as much as possible and then just complete like t-bap resurrection for

1167
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,600
example look took a look like we sure we were not working on it the entire time

1168
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,160
you know steadily but like little bit of time really talk about it we I mean I

1169
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,200
avoided discussing any details basically tension and I'd like to be cryptic and

1170
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,040
not give any like exact dates as to like when we expect I've done that before

1171
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,240
it's a mistake I still do it occasionally I like that too I think that

1172
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:06,080
vapors 3 is going to be I think people really will really like it and I have

1173
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,960
been saying that I'm doing it for a while but I haven't I mean I might have

1174
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,800
spoken a little bit about it on a stream here or there to like that's a pretty

1175
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,840
small chunk of the people that will end up reading it when it comes out so I'm

1176
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,040
yeah I get it it's cool it's cool to be cryptic and I think when people read it

1177
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,120
they'll be surprised and I think there's value in that and yeah so I just look at

1178
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,840
how great t-bap resurrection turned out with all the all the I mean the dope-ass

1179
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,520
intro that we were so hard to make and then like the ending with our multiple

1180
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,360
Mr. X like new characters showing up for the ending with a risky business and

1181
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,040
then our live-action segment at the end it was just a real layer cake of

1182
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,400
deliciousness and to have spoiled any of like that the image of Ben and me

1183
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,360
looking at the camera your two fathers caught you masturbating you know that

1184
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,720
look yeah it's a great it's a great image I see people using it it showed up in

1185
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,600
the dating sim it sure did it instantly became a little bit iconic it

1186
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,240
absolutely did and like I wanted to tweet like like when I was first editing

1187
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,200
like six seven eight months ago I wanted to just do something with that image but

1188
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,640
I mean it was not hard for me to say no no no I must wait I must wait there will

1189
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,000
be a time when this you know pays off I'm I'm glad the conversation has gone in

1190
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,560
this sort of artistic direction because the thing I wanted to talk about today

1191
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:31,960
was some data on on Andrew Hussie and the comics he's written compared to mine I

1192
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:38,080
went and looked at the the dates that his comics were published well pages were

1193
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,960
published and of Homestuck of all of it all of the things I got the numbers

1194
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,080
how to break it down so jailbreak is first little one 134 pages drawn across

1195
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:57,120
two days so that was that 134 pages and no not not hippo Hussie yeah I know but

1196
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:03,680
wait he drew 134 pages well yeah I mean jailbreak is very simple this very much

1197
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,560
stick figures that's pretty impressive that's still that's still a lot yeah it

1198
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:14,080
is yeah it's pretty good problem sleuth 1,700 pages a lot of them in very

1199
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:22,680
impressive gifts drawn in one year exactly mm-hmm 1,700 that's like three

1200
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,040
yeah three days the two yeah something like that and yeah a lot of them are

1201
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,240
huge yeah projects in and of themselves okay that's when he really got into his

1202
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,320
style of like the what we see later of Homestuck where he has his character

1203
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,840
assets and will like move them around and it becomes easier to produce fast I

1204
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,400
mean I just that's good he did that that's yeah yeah cool and then all right

1205
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,160
I've made a little graph for Homestuck because we all know the Homestuck

1206
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:55,080
declined in speed at least indeed the first year was 1,668 pages the second

1207
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:06,480
year 2,048 the third year 1,005 1,014 1417 I can't read numbers for the fourth

1208
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:13,040
year and then it was like yeah 5,600 with year 5 yeah act 6 happened at the big

1209
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,520
like somewhere in year 3 so like the first two are you fucking kidding me

1210
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:25,200
that's when act 6 started oh yeah yeah disaster so like x6 was you know this

1211
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,800
took a long time like what's the word epic exponential growth meme are you

1212
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:35,080
guys laughing yet are you laughing for these last five years yeah I mean it was

1213
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,640
very impressive especially since you know act 5 he adds so much color and it's

1214
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,640
the feature all of the things get so good but that's the year he does most of

1215
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:51,880
his work like the speed is at the highest like cascade is in year 3 so yeah

1216
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,000
imagine we just gotten like two extra not bail james but problem sleuths

1217
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,520
instead of all of act 6 what a great lifetime that would be pretty sick that

1218
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,560
would be the brightest time line and then and then I went over to my to my

1219
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,720
images because I hadn't been like well I'll just say that the numbers first

1220
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,520
a canon story my first thing 141 pages so very similar to jailbreak and that

1221
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,200
took like two hours to draw that in a stream and maybe one day to like write

1222
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:30,040
all the texts so that's pretty good jail bail jpe which is the big one that I've

1223
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,400
been working on is only like 367 pages one of which is a video game so that's

1224
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,640
pretty cool indeed but it was started according to when the first image was

1225
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:47,000
created around the 8th of February 2018 so it's been more than a year almost a

1226
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,880
year it's been yeah that's barely that's barely a page a day you hack I know it's

1227
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,680
well I mean for first part of that it was me trying to juggle that and

1228
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:03,200
hypocrite videos and then also I have other things going on but I really I

1229
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,080
was looking at all these numbers I'm like bail jpe is so small it's such a

1230
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:14,720
tiny little thing I really gotta do bigger faster work but I don't feel too

1231
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,640
bad because unlike a hussey in in bail jpe I I got tired of like copy pasting

1232
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:27,560
the it's strange to say but like copy pasting like images and on layers was

1233
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,760
more of a hassle than just drawing a new layer for each panel so I just drew

1234
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,400
them all in uniquely individually and then I'm finishing it off with kind of

1235
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,360
an overblown animation it's not like beyond my capabilities but it will take

1236
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:50,800
a few few weeks sure sure but yeah art I was so fast he was too fucking fast yeah

1237
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:57,160
I faster his own good I think a lot of this is not being focused like you said

1238
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,240
you for a lot of that you were you know you had hypocritical and even now

1239
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,680
there's something to be said that when you are in the sort of work that we are

1240
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:14,800
and you had the sort of disparate projects that we do it's very easy for

1241
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,800
you to be paralyzed by indecision and for you to have a lot of little things

1242
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,280
that just sort of feel like they're bigger deals than they are for instance

1243
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,480
if you're been you might have been for a while maybe you didn't have necessarily

1244
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,680
anything on your plate they had to do that day but you always had ten paces

1245
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,360
and draw over your head thinking oh maybe I should do that today or maybe I

1246
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,880
should do papers three today there's so many things you were keybabs and whatnot

1247
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,480
or tea or tea bath yeah stuff like that just a ton of things that you could do

1248
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,600
and that makes it so it's hard to do any one of them because you're just thinking

1249
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,240
what am I gonna do well maybe I will watch this YouTube video maybe that's

1250
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,880
what I'm gonna maybe I'll just play enter the gungeon for 12 hours yeah maybe

1251
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,840
we'll just do that it's easy for you if you haven't clearly defined what work

1252
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,680
you're going to do what kind of stuff you're gonna accomplish each day it's

1253
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:16,200
very very easy to just sort of fall into a routine of doing a whole lot of

1254
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,600
nothing but still feeling overwhelmed I felt this a lot even recently yeah where

1255
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:27,000
there wasn't a lot of like stuff that I was even doing but it was so easy to

1256
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,600
feel overwhelmed like there was so much on my plate just because there was so

1257
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,560
much stuff being unfinished because they're all just at the same time stuff

1258
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:39,000
I know I have to do and just I felt that way for a long long time and and now

1259
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
that my you know now that teabab and and ten paces are done I'm really not

1260
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,520
eager to start anything new I really am so relieved I've kind of I kind of quit

1261
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,400
the poo videos I don't know if I'll go back and finish yeah I don't know if I'll

1262
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,880
go back and finish season one I had like maybe two more episodes of that that I

1263
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,000
might make but I kind of don't want to think about it right now I just I'm

1264
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,120
really happy that like the first three is the only thing that I have on my plate

1265
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,080
and but speaking I'm totally with you but actually this circles back to hey

1266
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,280
remember how it was discussion at the beginning of the episode I said I put a

1267
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,240
pin in something that I wanted to say but I had not said it but I did in fact

1268
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,960
write it down and I just want to talk about very briefly just in you know as

1269
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,400
Ben was saying just now that yes when you're trying to come up with a project

1270
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,440
and like when you're trying to schedule and plan what comes next that's the

1271
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,760
hardest thing to do but I feel such a euphoric freedom when I simply have

1272
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,800
intelligently or not committed to the project I'm doing and said I don't care

1273
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,080
a meteor could fall outside my house could be burning around me I don't care

1274
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:46,400
I have my project I am free I just need to work on this one thing nothing else

1275
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,440
matters right now it is kind of my favorite feeling in the world and as soon

1276
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,600
as the project's released that feeling lasts a few minutes and that's like

1277
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:59,640
shit think about my next fucking video now damn it feels good it feels good for

1278
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,240
a moment and that's like oh but it's that's why I'm that's why I like it

1279
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,560
feels so good to be out of the YouTube rat race the the the no more chasing the

1280
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:14,920
algorithm the fact that you have to be consistent to I mean production algorithm

1281
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,600
right of like I mean I just mean as soon as like any projects done it's time to

1282
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,480
move on to the next project just in life right I suppose I mean I'm kind of

1283
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,800
excited about bail jpeg being done so that I can move on to the next thing

1284
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:33,880
rather than you know well I mean it's not like doing the animation is boring or

1285
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:39,360
I hate it I like it it's just also the idea I mean I was reading like looking

1286
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,120
at the the time in between problem sleuth and Homestuck it was just like a

1287
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:48,480
couple days just like you finished you finished the the problem sleuth and he

1288
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,200
did some epilogue pages and introduced the midnight crew in one of them and

1289
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,840
then he was just like yeah I'll just start Homestuck I had this idea for a

1290
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,200
while and they started it and it you know it just kept going like every day

1291
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,920
there'll be like five six images and you know the first year it got all the way

1292
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,200
up to Jack ascend like imagine that right I'd non-stop not a single day was

1293
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,560
messed I checked every day there was at least an image a page that's like hey

1294
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,040
yeah that's I want to do that I would I would yeah I would love to be I would

1295
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,880
love to be like that hey I'm just curious does anyone know was was Hussie

1296
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,480
like able to successfully like live off his work specifically during not bail

1297
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,760
jpeg but but during problem sleuth is he like full time at that point he had an

1298
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,000
audience yeah but I I mean but was it monetized like I like live he had ads

1299
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,640
yeah I assume he was making his money through ads and I mean this was I mean I

1300
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,000
think ads were worth more back then I mean he had enough clout by the end of

1301
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,840
problem sleuth to start making books didn't he's my real question I don't

1302
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,640
think I don't think he made books until Homestuck was well oh well maybe this

1303
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,400
this may or may not be the case what I'm really asking is like was he having to

1304
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,200
like do a day job in addition to doing this I think you must not have he must

1305
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:11,160
not have had a day job if he could have uploaded every no I feel like not I you

1306
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,040
know maybe you're remembering wrong but I remember something about him like living

1307
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:22,160
like kind of low budget like all he needs is a computer and his tablet and

1308
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:29,520
he can just do anything he's just like me he's just like me indeed yeah here's my

1309
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,640
message just to the people on that subject though I mean Hussie had to work

1310
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,040
his way up I haven't followed his career extensively in his early days but I mean

1311
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,200
for me it's very much if you want to be an artist guy I mean we all feel this all

1312
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,040
the time just that we wish we had more time wish you had more hours in the day

1313
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,720
to do stuff I mean I have basically you know whatever I've been doing YouTube

1314
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,720
like part-time essentially for the last four or five years whatever and it's just

1315
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,960
I feel such a desire to just be able to throw all my you know force into it I

1316
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,080
feel like I can just explode and do all these great things once I've made the

1317
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,120
time and I'm just like but that's on me I gotta figure out a way to get there

1318
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,760
that you know will let me continue to live and frankly you know I'm not like

1319
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,080
Ben I don't want like I need a decent amount of money to have a decent ish

1320
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,800
life not that whatever I'm not even joking about bed like I'm just I'm

1321
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,880
simply saying my I want a little more that's fair although more money would

1322
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:33,520
help of course patreon.com spent I feel I sometimes I worry that maybe this meme

1323
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,960
that I am a that there's not even untrue meme that I am that I am like a low rent

1324
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:45,520
like like you know what do you call it scowl ag something like yeah it makes

1325
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,240
makes makes people feel like oh well he doesn't he doesn't need any money so I

1326
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:54,400
don't support not true I do need money of course not a ridiculous amount but

1327
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,960
more than I currently have would be really nice okay that's fair yeah okay

1328
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,440
patron.com is not a joke ladies and gentlemen this is not this isn't your

1329
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,840
dad is in fact deadly serious this is life and death yeah yeah I find extremely

1330
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:17,280
useful and I have just just a few days ago when I was organizing my my schedule

1331
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,840
as I mentioned previously I think it's very helpful to literally write things

1332
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:28,360
down to very absolutely just completely black and white what am I doing what

1333
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:33,360
projects am I currently producing right now and I do that with my whiteboard I

1334
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,600
not to belabor the point not to belabor the point I also want to say that this

1335
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,320
past month my pay is a couple of big patrons reduced pledges and my rent

1336
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:51,640
went up for unrelated reasons fair enough save me help please okay well I'm

1337
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,800
still paying shit room rent because I still have the shit room but one of the

1338
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:02,240
guys who was living here left and we did not find a replacement so I've mentioned

1339
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,080
it to him I don't know if he could afford what we would charge for a room but

1340
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:14,800
he didn't put the he didn't close down the possibility but I mean he doesn't

1341
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,200
need a room right now he don't think he'll need one for a little while so

1342
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,400
that maybe we'll see yeah I don't know fair enough I don't know okay sorry to

1343
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:28,440
interrupt oh god I think it's good to because most of the time when you feel

1344
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,840
overwhelmed and you think oh god there's just so much I have to do in

1345
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,920
actuality there's not and it's not that you're you're stupid it's just that it's

1346
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,700
easy for the human brain to get overwhelmed by uncertainty so in order

1347
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:44,080
to be certain just write down the projects that you are working on and when

1348
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,040
you can remove some of the boats some of the stuff that you don't have to do and

1349
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,760
just kind of focus on those things it becomes so much easier for you to focus

1350
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,480
on oh actually there's nothing I can do if I just allocate time here and there

1351
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,600
oh wow look at that I've accomplished my goals you just have to be certain on

1352
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,280
what you're working on you just have to remove uncertainty you know you can move

1353
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,840
in decisiveness this isn't exactly the same thing but as just so this isn't

1354
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,520
about exactly managing tasks that lie before you but actually what I did the

1355
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,560
other day was just out of the blue I decided to make a list of all my total

1356
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:22,200
life goals and this was spurned on by I watched PewDiePie's video that was it

1357
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,080
was like another googling himself and I'm surprised about how frankly he talks

1358
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:31,240
about like how much money he has and I mean he was just like I mean it's not

1359
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,720
secret or anything it's not really a secret I mean the the figures are like

1360
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,880
wrong but he was like yeah I think my net worth you know like those like what I

1361
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,920
probably like 20 million or something and I was like well shit there you go I

1362
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,400
guess these are the facts yeah and I've actually learned a lot I actually from

1363
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,120
PewDiePie I learned about CPM or whatever like cent per meal or whatever

1364
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,280
it's like a European thing like per meal as in per thousand right yeah that's

1365
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,880
right that's right yeah and actually just incidentally I don't know if this is

1366
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,920
true for everybody but I make the most money from Australian views so for every

1367
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,040
like thousand views from Australians who watch ads on YouTube you make the most

1368
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,720
per capita or you make the most total well I mean per capita not not total

1369
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,120
because like it's I've like 59% of my viewers are from the US and like Australia

1370
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,520
is a I'm just saying if everyone moved to Australia that would increase my income

1371
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:27,800
so I really appreciate that if you would do that for for bin technique PCP HQ

1372
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:32,040
Australia Sydney I know we don't want to move to what we want other people to

1373
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,240
move to Australia because like right we want them to be exchanging their

1374
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:44,040
currency with us at a favorable rate and some and maybe we would get new

1375
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,840
Australian fans you hear about you hear about the Prime Minister did today I

1376
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:58,920
hate them anyway I just I made a list of all my total life goals that the one

1377
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,680
that spurred it on was actually that PewDiePie just said one of his life goals

1378
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:09,560
is to own a house in Japan and I was like me too motherfucker me too so so that

1379
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,560
became generally one of mine and I've just I've got a total of 14 yeah I mean

1380
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,600
what of my what are my goals here I'm honestly shocked that he can't do that

1381
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,960
right now the reason he can't is not money it's due to like like immigration

1382
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,720
and visa issues I think specifically I mean which I'm sure in time he could

1383
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,600
probably I'm sure he doesn't have 20 million dollars available right now well

1384
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,120
you know what he said the issue was actually this was interesting he said

1385
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,760
and yes he'd probably need to liquidate like at something I don't know also I'm

1386
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,440
surprised I'm kind of surprised it's only 20 million I would guess me to me too

1387
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,000
a little more than that but whatever but what he said the the real issue was

1388
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:48,000
was that when it comes to getting a visa like claiming your you like you have to

1389
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,680
state like your job and your intentions when you travel internationally and

1390
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,360
stuff yeah and so like when he puts down his his employment he's a youtuber and

1391
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:59,800
he said that first of all like youtuber isn't a real career in like in the eyes

1392
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,960
of Japan particularly and also the Logan Paul shenanigans have given

1393
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:11,120
youtubers a really bad okay so actually affected immigration issues wow in his

1394
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,560
eyes I mean maybe that's not a hundred percent accurate but that's you know

1395
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:19,280
that's what I mean it doesn't that's not inconceivable that's not I mean I've

1396
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,920
heard of Japan's serious immigration at one point I was thinking maybe I'll move

1397
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,040
to the to the US yeah but it's the same sort of problem like I can't get in

1398
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,080
because I'm a youtuber I don't mean no immigrants my dude we've had enough of

1399
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:37,240
those although you know soon I can now say that I'm a writer instead cuz that's

1400
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,720
true that's true income like I mean couldn't you could call yourself a

1401
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,440
freelancer I mean as long as you report your income wouldn't that be Japan is

1402
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,120
very strict I mean Japan regulates its population pretty strictly when it comes

1403
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,320
to immigration and stuff so like maybe who knows like exactly what their

1404
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,960
process entails they maybe they want like an interview and they want to know

1405
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,880
like what who you are what you do and like significant detail I don't know I

1406
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,160
don't know boy okay I understand that but surely

1407
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,200
Japan must realize who PewDiePie is on some level not as in like the

1408
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,960
immigration officer like watches PewDiePie but surely he's like he's the

1409
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,960
most famous person on he's like famous famous well are you guys aware that not

1410
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,360
only was PewDiePie passed by T-Series recently so he is no longer number one

1411
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:26,600
I saw that he released a video a celebration music video today called

1412
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,760
congratulations to T-Series where he snidely congratulates them in hopes that

1413
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,320
they're decadent you know giant corporation that somehow managed to

1414
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,360
defeat one Swedish boy that they're myriad corruption scandals and me too

1415
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:46,400
if she's happening to not tragically wouldn't that just be so sad pretty

1416
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,680
funny I got I got me too by T-Series

1417
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:56,640
I got me too the other day what a fucking what a nightmare what a life

1418
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,640
yeah indeed indeed but but you know just to back to the point making a list of

1419
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:06,160
life goals was good and helpful it's I'm pretty good at making task lists I do

1420
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:10,600
it not every single day but frequently when I have like 20 things to get done

1421
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,760
in a day and they're not even big the only way I can do it is to make a list

1422
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,080
and then I like if they're fast and easy I will burn through those motherfuckers

1423
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,720
tell me tell me if this is relatable to anyone or am I a freak my if I think if

1424
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,120
I wrote down my list of life goals every single thing on the list would be a

1425
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:33,160
thing I want to make and nothing else mine or more about well I mean I don't

1426
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,600
know like my number one rule my number one life goal is to like be morally

1427
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,240
upright and I put when in doubt adhere to the golden rule so like that's the sort

1428
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,720
of goal I'm keeping in mind just like a way to live in general okay but a lot of

1429
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:53,560
a lot of my like big dream thoughts is to be someone who's like you know

1430
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:58,040
obviously I like doing the art that I do but but in the back of my mind I'm

1431
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,840
like ah if I was a good enough artist I could like be friends with Andrew Hussie

1432
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,520
oh I could I could talk to them and be like cool and like I'll be I'll be one

1433
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,720
of those those you know the mysterious elite artists who talk to each other I

1434
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:19,800
assume yeah you know okay now that you say that that I also aspire to that to

1435
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,760
be to not just be cool and glorious myself but to like but to travel in

1436
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,760
circles you know what I almost tweeted the other day I whatever I was like

1437
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,960
busy and didn't but I was this is my tree I was gonna tweet like for some

1438
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,320
happiness is like I don't know like a walk on the beach whatever blah blah blah

1439
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:41,080
but I say happiness is measured by the number of secret backroom executive

1440
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,920
boardroom meetings you are in over the course of your life relative to the rest

1441
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:50,680
of the population to me that's happiness that's you know that's true okay it

1442
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,040
feels cool to have like a secret meeting that people will not know about

1443
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:59,800
indeed indeed by the way but here's their here's your visual people the visual is

1444
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,880
the the meeting in godfather number one when you know Vito Corleone meets with

1445
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,800
all the heads the five families at the tail end of the film that is what I

1446
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:15,400
aspire to in my life I want to be there oh yeah things things of that nature

1447
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:21,160
like every time I have like a meeting in about like the movie I'm making and

1448
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:25,000
there's like an important person there and like a producer is like oh you know

1449
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,880
this is this is like something's happening right here things are being

1450
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,800
things are being said you talked to somebody pretty big the other day I

1451
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:39,080
forget who maybe you don't want to say was that a Mike Cooper he's a feature

1452
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:45,880

1454
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:57,960

1455
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,960
the script and we we talked about stuff he looked at your script and gave you

1456
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,760
feedback on it that's pretty dope dude and and then we had dinner later and it was

1457
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:12,280
like that was like a business trip I went on a business trip to Scotland that was

1458
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:17,480

1465
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:02,440
on a projectivity mindset today I'm glad we're sure about this I've been thinking

1466
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,160
about constantly I just made this is just a small thing but like I've I really

1467
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,400
have committed I'm a little bit late on my new we Agua but I have after after

1468
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:16,440
what else is new I know after the power creep arc is indeed over it's true like

1469
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,440
I've got a we Agua in the editing bay just needs a you know a day or two left of editing

1470
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:25,560
and it will be out and I've also got the next one already not feeling like ready to go

1471
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:31,720
knowing what I'm doing you gotta commit to we Agua I I'm effectively committing to we Agua

1472
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:38,120
and I'm sure I'll reference that in some way so it is it is what is happening so uh

1473
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:44,520
another logo coming up I say you know tightening my own chains around my own neck

1474
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:54,360
it's a totally new show we Agua's dead long live we Agua totally new original idea I just came

1475
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:59,960
up with I want to go back to when we were talking about Ben's comics I just want to say oh sure let's

1476
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:06,280
do that uh that I was on st comics whenever we're talking about something like PCP I I just look at

1477
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,960
it like pictures of whatever we're talking about on the internet I don't know why I do it

1478
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:17,080
add to the show notes of course and and and I I clicked on the the vapors number one and I had

1479
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:24,120
such like a visceral reaction like an emotional reaction to seeing the like first like title

1480
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:29,640
screen title page cover page of the vapors by Ben saying and right it was almost like

1481
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:38,680
this is so iconic I can't believe I'm talking to the person that made it in a weird way I don't

1482
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:45,720
I don't want to turn this into a dick-sucking thing but like the vapors is like a real thing

1483
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:51,960
that is so I don't even know what I describe it other than like like yeah like iconic it like

1484
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:58,200
influential and like but it's not influencing anyone it just feels like legendary it feels it

1485
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:03,480
feels mythical it feels like a legendary well I think what you're describing is that it feels

1486
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:09,160
like a real big project with all the pop and circumstance that comes with that and yeah yeah

1487
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:15,480
and it look at this page I have this page on my shelf right now like I have the physical version

1488
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:21,160
of this comic thing I still want to copy I don't know the copy of the vapors well I can't believe

1489
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:27,640
that it's it's real well fortunately when chapter three is done the Kickstarter for chapter two

1490
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:34,920
will begin and in the Kickstarter for chapter two you will be able to buy bundles that include

1491
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:40,120
the first book if you missed it the first time oh that does sound good uh yes I gotta start thinking

1492
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,960
about that um I got I got I gotta start uh this is something you know I've been I've been chugging

1493
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,600
along doing new pages and that feels good but in the back of my mind I've got that oh I need to do

1494
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:56,440
some more shit I gotta I gotta think of I gotta write scripts for bonus uh vaporettes I want like

1495
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,080
at least three probably more because chapter chapter two is shorter than chapter one and

1496
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:06,760
I want to make up some of that length uh somehow wait is chapter three shorter than chapter two

1497
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:13,880
or well it's not done I think it might be slightly longer than chapter two but not as long as chapter

1498
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:23,080
one yeah okay I think uh we'll see something like that okay cool cool yeah right yeah yeah well I

1499
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:28,680
think we're all in agreement that we all look forward to it very much uh yes um I feel like I

1500
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:36,440
need to make my site more epic it feels pretty juvenile I my my site is so I'm you know I just

1501
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:42,920
I made that thing with like such a basic understanding of like html and css it is

1502
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:48,520
it's a I went back and revamped some of it it's it's functional and it looks decent

1503
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:55,960
but the editing like like okay I know there are ways where I could have like automated the upload

1504
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:05,880
process but one it is so inconvenient to update because like okay what what I need to do to it

1505
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:12,600
is to make is to like enclose all the elements like the okay like the button bars for a long time

1506
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:17,480
to change a button on the website I had to go through every page of the website and

1507
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:23,240
manually update the button I change that for most things there are still a few things that are like

1508
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:29,880
that I think and I could and I will fix those probably before I start uploading any more okay

1509
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:35,480
I gotta up before chapter three comes out I'm gonna upload the um the um actually I should

1510
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,920
do make these a patron exclusive I should make these like an early patron thing is the the the

1511
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,600
vaporettes from the first book they gotta go on the website and I gotta and I gotta go through

1512
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:49,160
the whole fucking thing and going through page by page and putting in the like when I put up a

1513
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:53,800
new page I have to manually put in for example the numbers you gotta make some sort of database

1514
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,600
indexing system or something that that's easier like put it like is each page has to link to the

1515
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,760
previous page and the next page and the last page of the chapter and the first page of the

1516
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:08,600
chapter and I gotta put those all in one by one and it's oh god it takes like it it's sometimes

1517
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:13,000
it takes a day or two for the big update it'll take like an entire day or two just to put it on

1518
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:20,200
the website um which you know could be improved some some to work on indeed yes indeed on the

1519
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:25,320
subject of character specific interactions hippo I also want to ask you something about your comic

1520
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:36,840
do you intend to always be the dude who makes homestuck like comics

1521
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:46,200
no but I like I like it so I mean bell good place to start I suppose bell jpew is like

1522
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:52,840
supposed to be that obviously with the name as well but I do have other types of comics

1523
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:58,360
that I want to make so you're you're not intending to carve as much space underneath

1524
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:04,280
Andrew hussey shadow as possible is what I'm trying to say no okay look at our boy toby fox

1525
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:09,560
he's he's he's broken out and uh he's he's the role model here I'd say I don't want to underestimate

1526
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:14,680
or underplay how much I love jailbabe and just even the way that it's produced I also want to

1527
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:21,480
empathize the fact that I I too find the homestuck style very appealing and very much something I

1528
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:27,160
would want to emulate for like like just the way that I work I feel it gels with me quite a bit

1529
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:33,400
however I feel like there's something to be said that it just is no matter what it will almost

1530
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:40,760
always feel and teeter on fan art jailbabe is not related to homestuck in any way but you can't

1531
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:45,960
divorce from homestuck no matter what sure can't read it and not think about homestuck no matter

1532
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:51,960
is it on is it on mspfa no okay I think somebody wanted to make a mirror of it

1533
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:57,320
the I don't know what how I feel about that I am like I made a I made nuts the beginning

1534
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:04,440
and I put that on mspfa not because it is particularly homestuck like but just because I

1535
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:11,080
found that a convenient way to do the um the uh like timeline split yeah to have like multiple

1536
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:18,200
endings I think there's like complete valid way in like the structure of homesuck I don't think

1537
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:25,480
it's an inherently a wrong thing to do to have like you know you know not just like have it be a

1538
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:30,520
text command parody but in the sense that you can have multiple pages and split paths and choose

1539
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:35,400
your adventure like elements in there it's just I mean specifically with jailbabe I mean it's

1540
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,240
literally on a website that's supposed to look like homesuck and it's called like APS adventures

1541
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:45,320
or something to that effect it's literally called it's so similar I'm gonna you feel me probably a

1542
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:49,560
good time to say that like I think when vapors three is done I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna go back

1543
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,720
and finish beast capades which is um a much something that oh yes I'm very excited for that

1544
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,920
yeah I was really excited about beast capades too the thing that excites me the most about beast

1545
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:05,880
capades is that I don't think I don't think it was apparent like I don't think that the amount

1546
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,280
of it that I did communicated where the story was going I don't think anyone probably could

1547
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:15,240
guess where the story is going but the thing about beast capades is that it has an ending it has a

1548
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:24,040
specific like ending in mind and I know mostly how it gets there and I am just really excited to

1549
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:29,480
you know is this is this tell a story with a definitive ending and then you finish it and

1550
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:34,280
you're like yes wow that story went places hey is this too much you know what I mean in terms of

1551
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:38,520
like I'm curious I know these things always change but like if you had to guess what percentage of it

1552
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:44,200
would you say like is complete now of beast that's a dangerous question to ask it is a dangerous

1553
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:49,480
question to answer and I'm gonna preface it by saying I'm probably wrong okay like whatever I say

1554
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:57,560
will probably be wrong but I think maybe 25% okay that's good that's good what you know locked and

1555
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:03,880
loaded written down right now I mean it's definitely well it's definitely not halfway done yeah but a

1556
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:09,240
big chunk of it is done so somewhere in that region so I'm just gonna ballpark it at 25% okay

1557
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:15,400
I've been thinking about like the the whole like Homestuck Hussie's Shadow thing because like I kind

1558
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:21,160
of do regret naming my website APS Adventures even though you know I don't really mean I mean hail

1559
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:27,400
MS Paint Adventures is dead it's homestuck.com now so it is dead but the things that are called MSPA

1560
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:33,080
still why did you say hail did I say hail yeah you said hail I think I meant I meant say like

1561
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:38,360
hell I guess I just said I think you meant to say hell but you said hail I apologize to the audience

1562
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:43,960
to the commander I was I was going to say I was going like hail okay sorry hail not yeah okay that

1563
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:48,840
makes sense sorry I really like to be pedantic and point out when people pronounce things wrong

1564
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,760
appreciate it appreciate point of order I'm like I'm like a game of order I'm so smart that I pointed

1565
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:01,320
out that you said less instead of fewer relate to me audience point of order hypocrite I will be

1566
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:06,200
hurt yeah I'm fucking I think I've lost the train of my thought what was I saying oh you're

1567
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:11,560
regretting that you named it APS Adventures a little bit kind of oh yeah yeah I like um

1568
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:19,400
I could you know quite easily just make a new site it would be a hassle and yeah I just call it

1569
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:24,760
something else change the name of it I guess I could just change the name of it big floppy

1570
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:39,240
dongs.com I'll be there I had a completely other point but I just I've lost it oh sorry we fucked up

1571
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:45,640
guys yeah I mean I have the memory of a goldfish I have a cool thought but I can't write the yeah

1572
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:52,200
whatever well let's talk about well let's talk about capitalism and it's many anyway back to the

1573
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:57,720
vapors by me you know I do I do want to just quickly say I want to hurt all your feelings

1574
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:03,160
real quick yeah and just this is we're getting a little hug boxy so I just want to retort with

1575
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:09,480
all your efforts mean nothing if you can't survive off them I mean you can you can play in the sand

1576
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:14,440
you can be a little sandbox baby who you know works like a normal job and then supports your

1577
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:20,360
art on the back of that but until you go and you're you're a real boy a real survivalist

1578
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:25,960
off of your art are you even a real boy are you even a real boy Gibb is because Gibb is a real

1579
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:31,560
artistic job now but yeah for the rest of us we we've we've got some work all right I don't care

1580
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,440
about that I've remembered what it was I agree with that okay atreon.com slash Ben saying to make me

1581
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:44,600
a real boy the whole thing about staying in the house and yeah and stuff when I started it I copied

1582
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,080
like the the arrow going forward and the text commands as if you were the characters just

1583
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:55,000
because that's what he did and I thought it was funny but you know more recently I've been thinking

1584
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,080
that is because he played games that were like that and I didn't do that I am doing that because

1585
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:05,960
I'm ripping off Homestack not because I'm ripping off text-based adventures and it's the same thing

1586
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:11,800
with like Hussie knows a lot of code and if I were to try and make coding jokes I wouldn't know what

1587
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:18,360
I was doing yeah so like it would it would be like wrong so like going forward the things I'm

1588
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,600
gonna base I mean I've already written a few stories that could be like novels rather than

1589
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:29,320
comics anyway they're just like stories that work but the the way I'm going to approach them

1590
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,920
regardless of what I whatever the site's called or like whether it's just one panel per page

1591
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:41,320
because I just like that in general is that I'm going to base things off of things that I

1592
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:49,880
grew up with and know about more so than you know good like um text commands specifically like the

1593
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:56,920
idea of commanding the the person reading the adventure is uh uh commanding the character to

1594
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:03,880
do stuff that's only because um the characters actually were being controlled by the viewers

1595
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:09,880
with uh the prompts that the people were giving and I hadn't I hadn't done that and so it was really

1596
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:16,520
just like very hollow very like um copying for no reason sort of thing so if if I ever copy anything

1597
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:23,240
from Homestuck in the future it'll be because um not you know I will consider the usage or like the

1598
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:29,000
reason Hussie did it in the first place right right including the fact that he made so many pages

1599
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,880
and he had his characters uh you know reuse the assets because the reason he had that in the first

1600
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:41,480
place was not because he can't draw like me it's because he wanted to have the fan interaction be

1601
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:47,880
like a major part of the comic and the faster he can make the images in response to the prompts

1602
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:53,800
the the more intense it would feel and that's why he wanted to to make it like that I feel like

1603
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:59,720
Hussie you know if he makes a new thing he's not going to do the the command the prompts from the

1604
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:04,440
viewers because he's done that to death and his art will be like completely different

1605
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:09,720
from Homestuck which is probably why he's like apprehensive maybe to to do anything because

1606
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:15,400
damn it you need to go go Toby Fox Hussie isn't he still well isn't he still working on um

1607
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:21,560
Hype Swap he well I suppose he is yeah but that's almost sad to me I I feel like that's like

1608
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:28,760
bolderline cancel Hype Swap yeah uh Hype Swap is in like I like it's so

1609
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:35,400
long and so just I I I honestly see it being like a failed kickstart and I don't think it will be

1610
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:40,440
finished it's it's so a dude whatever I think about the first chapter already came out and people

1611
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:45,320
generally liked I mean I haven't played it and I feel honestly guilty about that but but why haven't

1612
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:51,080
you played it Ben could it be because you just don't care anymore well I was kind of over it

1613
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:56,840
and also or two not yeah like the fact that it's only the first chapter I'm like I'd rather

1614
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,320
play the whole thing except the delta rune chapter one was hype as shit and was the

1615
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:07,320
fucking dopest thing in the last several years I I can't help but when I think of Hussie I compare

1616
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:13,160
him on every level to Toby Fox Hussie like did a huge kickstarter got complete he just fucked it up

1617
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:19,320
financially stopped hurting Hussie's feelings I won't Toby Toby made like 50 grand made like the

1618
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:25,800
biggest game of all fucking time as a first-time game developer fucking he went on but he's already

1619
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:30,360
made his sequel thing and he's working on it sure it recycled some assets but it's fresh it's new

1620
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:35,080
it's beautiful I love it I can't wait for more it makes me want to piss so badly yeah I have to

1621
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:42,920
I don't know I don't know I know I'm getting a little bit over the top on Hussie I but it's just

1622
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:48,360
that he hasn't the last thing I heard from Hussie was him making a game that I'm not interested in

1623
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:54,440
and you know like kind of fucking up his legacy a little bit with like getting rid of msp a.com

1624
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:59,320
and change it that's not a huge deal but then he just hasn't made anything new for me so I'm just

1625
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:04,680
here like well I really liked Hussie but what do I got to I mean I imagine he's working in the

1626
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:09,400
I mean he did that like kickstarted thing with drill like he and drill made you know that's true

1627
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:13,880
that's maybe uh the the sweet bro and hello Jeff book which I wanted to buy I just I just didn't

1628
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:19,800
I meant yeah same yeah same I got it I got you got it is a great spoon inside is it cool

1629
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:27,320
um I like it but it the things that you you may have seen from uh like the previews of the art

1630
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:32,600
yeah uh doesn't exactly look like the sweet bro and hello Jeff earliest comics it's more like the

1631
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:37,480
later sweet bro and hello Jeff comics and we all love your comics yeah and and the whole thing is

1632
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:42,920
pretty funny so I you know I feel and I got the fidget spinner you know I feel like it's worth it

1633
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:47,320
did it come with a fidget spinner yeah I got the fidget spinner edition it's got like it's

1634
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:54,120
got like the holographic film and and the angle at the angel of the book itself is like um

1635
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,600
it's not at 90 degrees there's just sort of like on one of the corners it's like

1636
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,960
an acute angle so it just sort of goes off in a weird direction it's hard to fit on the shelf

1637
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:09,960
it's really funny I have I have a fidget spinner actually our our our mutual friend econ gave it

1638
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:15,800
to me uh it's a sweet it's a sweet metal yin yang fidget spinner nice fucking sick and I just want

1639
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:20,440
to let everyone know what a cool guy that was such a legendary piss I'm honestly mad that it

1640
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:24,840
wasn't on the episode I'm honestly I didn't just take the bullet and do it on the it was I did it

1641
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:31,240
for like it was insane it was insane was it just quantity was it the power behind it I mean both

1642
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:37,800
it was it was a total package it was a total package was it one that was just like continuous

1643
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:45,080
force the whole time yes ends abruptly yeah yeah doesn't just travel off trail off yeah yeah cool

1644
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:51,320
all right should we go to voicemails do you think oh yeah no no no before we yeah before we go to

1645
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:58,280
voicemails we should shout out the the pcp dating sim thing that came out yes okay okay thing about

1646
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:03,400
that and I think this is just a me issue I am having trouble getting it to run I got it to run

1647
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:09,640
every time I opened it it opens up this window it's a gray window that just says j s dot n w or

1648
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:15,400
something like that yeah yeah and one time I got it to open and I played it for a while I did a

1649
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:21,400
bunch of branches it was very amusing but then I I think I hit a bug or something or I got to a

1650
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:25,480
something or the text wouldn't load some if the game it I got to a point where I seemed to not be

1651
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:30,760
able to progress anymore so I closed it and then I couldn't open it again and that's and I'm very

1652
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:35,960
upset that's too bad it was pretty cool and funny well let's okay let's start from the top here

1653
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:43,240
people if you're not aware yesterday today's the 31st on the 30th at pcp dating sim that's them

1654
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:49,480

1657
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:04,280
kind of erotically so so uh at pcp dating sim made theirs legendary they beat the other guys

1658
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:10,520
epic joke and uh so it was made by no need bra and lumia stargazer so big shout out to those guys

1659
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:16,200
they were I'm deeply impressed they they actually got this thing out and so I played it too so I

1660
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:20,360
played it a bunch yesterday and I had a great time exploring all the different paths I mean it's

1661
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,880
basically a game where you but we will absolutely put a link in the show notes to where you can get

1662
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:29,560
this so go click on that download it um it's it's fun as fuck and uh uh you basically you

1663
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:33,880
got to avoid the landmine deaths as you go through uh and you can make it all the way to the end

1664
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:39,160
but what I did not discover uh until I was playing it again with Michelle later and we were trying to

1665
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:44,600
do even more options there's actually some choices you can make early in the game that affect what

1666
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:50,600
your ending is way later independently I won't spoil anybody I have a guess I have a guess about

1667
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:54,840
what one of those might be okay but at I mean I only discovered we only discovered one when we

1668
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:00,840
were playing but like at the end we we you discover uh let's just say an arch nemesis of all pcp dome

1669
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:08,200
and uh uh that that encounter can be changed uh depending on uh uh you know what uh what's done

1670
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:14,440
as you go through the game and uh it's super funny and hilarious and don't want to fucking beat it

1671
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:19,480
I really want to play have the full experience shekels for heckles stream it pcb dating sim

1673
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,400
n words in there but you know I think we can survive that okay well we just we won't read them

1677
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:52,040
just such a legendary shitpost and the opening movie that these guys made at the very beginning

1678
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:58,520
the anime intro is that like an incredible Gundam it's I think it's the original Gundam uh I think

1679
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:03,560
or Gundam Z or I don't know I have no idea it seemed I couldn't make out the logo and I'm not a Gundam

1680
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:10,760
boy uh anyway it was hilarious and dope play it every pcp member shows up um good good good and

1681
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,760
it's there it's great yeah some of them are hard to find though so you gotta you gotta put in the

1682
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:21,720
work to find them and uh the ending is truly hilarious um when you discover the greatest

1683
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:27,240
podcast of all time but I'll leave that up to the viewers to discover so I don't spoil it for them

1684
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:33,640
oh boy that's oh man this is there's more mysteries here than I realized yeah yeah I I gotta figure it

1685
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:38,360
out I gotta figure out how to play this fucking game uh the rest of the way one time I don't know

1686
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:42,920
what the fuck I don't know what I did the one time that made it work I yeah I don't know dude

1687
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:49,480
I mean maybe just download it again would be fine maybe maybe have you given uh Munchie have you

1688
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:54,040
guys played through have you done it yet no I I don't know I've seen screenshots though I know about

1689
01:34:54,040 --> 01:35:00,040
it yep I've played through I haven't got like multiple endings uh you die a lot uh there's a lot

1690
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:06,440
of wrong decisions to make yes you do save often people save often uh I definitely encountered

1691
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:10,280
some bugs hey here's a shout out to one bug to those guys it's probably too late to do anything

1692
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:16,280
but when you talk to mage on the staircase uh as you leave Digi's classroom I think uh that's the

1693
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:20,360
one that's that's why I had to restart the game that I just yeah the text just didn't load it just

1694
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:25,560
doesn't load so uh yeah so I guess that's just a dead end probably probably okay well whatever

1695
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,560
anyway the rest of it people go play it's legitimately hilarious and fun uh highly recommended

1696
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:38,360
highly recommended yeah um and shout fucking the next p at pcp dating dropping tomorrow for us in

1697
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:43,400
the past for you let's see maybe it'll be a joke it's April 1st what could that imply I don't know

1698
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:50,040
we'll see I I don't know I talked I talked to it's supposed to be real I talked I talked to

1699
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:55,160
Levent Hart who assures me with all possible sincerity yeah that it is not a joke that's what

1700
01:35:55,160 --> 01:36:02,600
they say and and that the April 1st release date is not meant as a troll and I mean we'll see about

1701
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:08,920
that that's not really in doubt like if it I feel like I'll believe I'll believe it when I see it

1702
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:16,200
I mean I feel like it would be very like stupid to to have a fake game on the April 1st I mean

1703
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,280
yeah something will happen something will happen I think I said last time but I don't know what

1704
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:24,200
something will definitely happen I think but I said last time that like we've talked about previously

1705
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:28,280
in like April Fools I know at a million years ago on a piece of yeah I said we said like

1706
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:33,640
the best April Fools jokes are when it's actually something like expansive and like actually fun

1707
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:38,920
that no one expected and it is surprising and funny and perhaps foolhardy but it just like

1708
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:45,000
is a real project that you can play and enjoy that's a real project not necessarily what you

1709
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,880
expect yeah I mean if it would just turn out to be I don't know I mean fighting game honestly

1710
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,640
if I were betting if I were putting my bets out I mean I think they're just going to release

1711
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:57,640
an actual demo of the actual dating I agree I think that's the most likely that I think yeah

1712
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:01,160
and by the way we have maybe a little bit insider information I mean some people on

1713
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:07,080
I don't actually know who was on the team doing any of this I know only like one or two people

1714
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:13,080
but like in the at the end of the pcp dating sim the the meme one that just came out those guys

1715
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:17,800
go on to like it actually it's actually really sweet spoiler is this a spoiler no it's not really

1716
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,000
a spoiler it's just that at the end they say like like they're like we're excited too for the bigger

1717
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,280
pcp dating sim so like it's like an advertisement almost to hype up the big release of like the

1718
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:32,280
demo or something and it's that that was so sweet that they that they put that in there

1719
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:37,880
and uh I those guys might have insider knowledge I don't know I don't know don't know we'll find

1720
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:42,200
out tomorrow and you people will know yeah all right I'm very I'm very excited I'm very you'll

1721
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:48,680
definitely be able to find we'll retweet anything on the pcp at TP Krasnayers Twitter so go check

1722
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:57,960
that if you're you know if you're looking for updates um okay we don't have to spend a lot of

1723
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:04,920
time on this but I feel the need to respond to all the people calling me a fascist in the comments

1724
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:13,000
last week uh okay for what purpose for what reason uh for because I was supposedly anti-free market

1725
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,200
and more and anti mostly was an anti-free speech people people okay this would piss me off people

1726
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:25,160
in the comments respond they weren't even generally making an argument like Ben what you are saying

1727
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:29,640
is anti-free speech sure they were just sort of taking it as an assumption it's just like

1728
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:34,120
so so Ben's anti-free speech and here's why I'm against that and and like like it's just the

1729
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:40,600
base assumption and I just want to say that I fucking hate all of you because okay what we were

1730
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:45,320
talking about everyone just fucking jumped in logic they made a huge fucking logical leap

1731
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,240
we were talking about tom getting kicked off mastodon yeah we were talking about platforms

1732
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:56,440
mastodon is a privately owned platform that people are in charge of and have the ability to curate

1733
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:04,920
I'm I'm not talking about like making it illegal to be to to say the n-word or whatever but I'm just

1734
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,880
like okay did you made all those rants he made all these videos he's talked so much in the past

1735
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:15,880
about how you know it's his plat his youtube channel is his platform and it is within he

1736
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:21,000
does not have to let you into his house and and give you a platform to say whatever shit if he

1737
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,600
doesn't like it you know and that's true for all of us like if it's your platform you are not obligated

1738
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:31,400
to let some what to let people say whatever they want to say even stuff that you disagree with

1739
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:36,040
stuff you don't want propagated you're not obligated to give people a platform you know

1740
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,880
with the tom example so I hear what you're saying and that's not a crazy point or anything

1741
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:46,040
well let me let me let me just finish so the like the logical and I absolutely agree with that logic

1742
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:51,160
and it's the the logical extension of that is that if someone makes a platform it's their platform

1743
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:55,800
mastodon or twitter or whatever and you might not like it you might not agree with their decision

1744
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:02,840
but they are not obligated to let people say stuff and if they believe that something is you know

1745
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:08,040
a bad ideology to spread I do I think they are not obligated to let you spread it I think they

1746
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:12,840
have every right to be like I don't like what this person is saying I don't like that they're

1747
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:18,280
saying it on my platform get out go say it somewhere else I mean if I'm not mistaken with

1748
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:23,160
that's not a legal thing that's not me talking about criminalizing or censoring like on a legal

1749
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:26,200
bait that would be totally different well I totally fucking different I hear what you're

1750
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:31,000
saying man uh so with the tom thing I think that with mastodon like with tom he was kicked out of

1751
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:38,680
a group made by users and I you know I think those guys probably like it'd be hard pressed to say

1752
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,520
are you not allowed to kick a friend out of your friend group or something I mean that's a little

1753
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:47,400
you know that's not exactly their group so that's not even being kicked off the platform as I mean

1754
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:51,800
maybe I missed something but I think that's it although okay maybe I misunderstood yeah I mean

1755
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:55,960
the point still stands but whatever the thing about I'm fucking mad I hear you but the thing about

1756
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:01,880
getting kicked off Twitter is like I mean so yeah so so Twitter's definitely a private platform and

1757
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:07,000
the the thing people bring up about this is that like okay um it's fine that you know we've got

1758
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,360
private businesses they can do what they want and all that they they don't have to platform users

1759
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:15,640
they don't want to or whatever um but I suppose you have to think about like what the goal is so

1760
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:21,400
like Twitter claims to be just for example a platform where like they want everyone to come

1761
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:26,920
together and speak but and yet at the same time they go beyond that and they enforce policies

1762
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:31,720
that favor some ideological groups you know over others and they say like okay but some

1763
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:37,080
speech simply isn't allowed here so really what they're saying is that they actually aren't truly

1764
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:43,160
going to welcome every type of speech here they actually have an ideological lean and like again

1765
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,920
if you're talking about like a small group like this is like 10 people and they have their little

1766
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:50,520
you know let's just say communist club or whatever and like you got a free market and

1767
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:54,760
arco cap he's like I like this they're like get out you're not one of us like obviously that's

1768
01:41:54,760 --> 01:42:02,120
fine but when it becomes an issue I guess with the like the idea that this is the new open marketplace

1769
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:07,560
and the Twitter claims to be a place for everyone to come and speak well here well here's a problem

1770
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:12,840
and I think this is a problem that arises because capitalism sure and that is the fact that this

1771
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:19,960
platform that is you know supposed to be a free marketplace of ideas or whatever is privately owned

1772
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:26,120
they own it they made it they own it they get to say I don't think this type of speech is good and

1773
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:32,920
I don't want it on my platform yeah I that's a fair point and it seems like the only real

1774
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:37,400
ways around this are like I mean at a certain point you gotta ask like what's best for the

1775
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:41,720
civilization and like this is what a government's for to keep things like getting crazy and out of

1776
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:47,000
control so you know I'm not actually but let me go on let me go one step further and make

1777
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:52,040
the argument that I think people last week thought I was making which I wasn't okay let me just go

1778
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:57,640
right ahead and make it you're not allowed to run into a theater and yell fire we all heard this

1779
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:04,520
example because that is a that's a harmful action that is false and deliberately harmful speech it

1780
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:11,320
causes harm through you know it's it's engineered falsehood to create damage yeah that's true what

1781
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:18,040
about someone going on the internet and spreading like bullshit statistics about like about like

1782
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:23,080
white genocide and the great replacement or whatever and inciting like we need oh we need a

1783
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:28,440
we need a piece we need a peaceful relocation of the jews I think that would probably help with this

1784
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:34,040
issue look okay first of all then is that not is that not false harmful speech okay well you've

1785
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:40,280
got to make a distinction I think it's disingenuous to say that those two claims are exactly equivalent

1786
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:45,640
and I mean you'd probably agree with that I mean they're not the same act but I think they both they

1787
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:51,480
have the same the same descriptors could apply to one versus the other that would qualify them as

1788
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:56,040
you know not protect look legit like if you've got just I mean you know to try to you know

1789
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:00,040
delocalize it from the hot button issues if you've got like let's just say I think this is a

1790
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:03,800
politically incorrect word but whatever you know what I mean like the eskimo population

1791
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:07,560
let's just say that they though like there's a there's an identity I think you're I think

1792
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:11,720
Inuit oh yeah okay let's say you've got whatever I frankly I don't give a shit but whatever I

1793
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:17,560
got you got you got the Inuit population and like among those people they've decided um like we

1794
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:21,560
don't like let's say there was some Scottish people whatever they move they're like we are gonna we

1795
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:26,600
believe that our society should be us and we do not like the Scottish influence that's coming in

1796
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:32,040
and so we are going to enact a peaceful like you know like not again like because there's

1797
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:35,320
there's various discussions about like what white identitarians or white nationalist want

1798
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:40,120
or they want like buyout policies or like relocate like whatever it's just that like you

1799
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:46,840
that the policy and the ideas by themselves like people are going to have these ideas in their

1800
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,560
head and banning them from somewhere doesn't get rid of the idea so I think at a certain point you

1801
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:57,880
need to think about is it actually a good thing to do to ban these people from the platforms is are

1802
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:04,360
we doing any good to deradicalize and is is like them being present doing direct harm in the same

1803
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:08,360
way that yelling fire in a crowded theater is and are you actually doing more harm than good I

1804
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:13,160
I this is it's a tough thing and I think you have to balance all the elements in a conversation like

1805
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:19,080
that and I again I'm no expert I'm a dunce about this shit I'm no policy genius there was a you

1806
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:25,480
know there was a time there was a time when being on the internet yeah and being edgy and making jokes

1807
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:31,240
about gassing the Jews was you know it was funny because of how audacious it was and it's like well

1808
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:36,600
no one's actually going to do it so it's funny to say it yeah how ridiculous and then now here we

1809
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:43,320
are in the year of our lord 2019 and you got you got open fucking rallies you got open white

1810
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:50,760
nationalist rallies you got literal you got literal neo-nazis collecting in public and espousing an

1811
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:57,560
ideology of genocide and I don't know that doesn't feel like it should be protected speech you know

1812
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:02,840
I don't I don't think that's cool I think we are at a slightly different place I think you get to that

1813
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:08,440
point and suddenly you gotta you gotta be like okay but are you allowed to advocate should you be

1814
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:13,960
allowed to advocate for anything really so just to be clear you are in fact coming out to advocate

1815
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:19,080
that some speech needs to be repressed and you're you seem to be making that claim I think I think

1816
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:28,440
when your speech is we should we should do something about these Jews I yeah I don't know if I don't

1817
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:33,960
know if I think that should be protected speech why is it better to force these people to not speak

1818
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:39,960
publicly why is that a better solution they will that will not change their beliefs it will not

1819
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:47,400
change their beliefs but are you saying because it won't spread the ideas yeah that like like

1820
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:53,720
giving these people a platform spreads their ideologies and like they're advocating to like

1821
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,600
hurt people but like that out there saying we should fucking hurt these people are you are you

1822
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:04,680
allowed and listen your pretend what um conspiracy to commit murder is not protected speech why is

1823
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:09,400
advocacy for genocide it's basically the same well okay roundabout way I think that you are

1824
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:14,680
conflating a couple of things like I don't think that genocide look if you like if you're a serious

1825
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:19,240
white nationalist for example and you want a buyout policy to buy out all minorities so

1826
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:24,520
they will leave your country that is not genocide that is a white nationalism that is a different

1827
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:30,360
thing who's talking about a buyout I've heard a Richard Spencer make that case for one okay well

1828
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:34,120
I don't know well that's I mean I don't think that's what most of these people are talking about but

1829
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:39,240
I mean I think that there's a lot of conflation going on and I think that the danger is when people

1830
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:43,080
I and I think that you're a little guilty of this you're you're look yes there's absolutely

1831
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:48,200
violence and you know identity and bad stuff that I am totally opposed but when you just I

1832
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:53,400
feel like there's a grouping together of a lot of ideas here and saying that it all needs to go away

1833
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:58,760
and it's all dangerous to even be allowed on the airwaves I just think that that enacting policies

1834
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:03,960
to suppress that will do more harm than good and maybe I'm wrong and maybe I'm wrong about that

1835
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:11,080
but that is my well you know what maybe maybe there's something to what you're saying can we

1836
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:18,920
okay let's just okay what would you agree with me if what was being advocated for was just open

1837
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:26,200
genocide you know okay that gets way closer to where I'm more likely to agree the only thing is

1838
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:34,920
that like I don't know if it's really a great idea to govern based on specifically like beliefs as

1839
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,560
opposed to action and so that I guess I kind of would like to I don't really know for sure

1840
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:46,440
what I believe on that I can't say for sure I think it's a good idea to always ban it

1841
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:51,800
because I I don't know it seems like that will definitely that still would lead to the same

1842
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,480
problem that I'm talking about but maybe it's kind of worth it in that position I understand where

1843
01:48:55,480 --> 01:49:01,560
you're coming from yeah I understand the idea that like you know you know free marketplace of ideas

1844
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:05,560
these people should be allowed to say what they're saying so purely pragmatically forget the

1845
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:11,880
marketplace so that we can hear it and be like well that's bad but that's sure that's not that's not

1846
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:17,160
always what's happening that's not always what happens I mean you're right but like that's the

1847
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:21,880
thing these are these are like percentage cases right so it's about I think you end up in a game

1848
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:26,680
of like if which choice does the least damage and like does the most good you have to like really

1849
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:32,200
figure out the majority if if the overton window shifts like like if if these ideas get out there

1850
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:37,400
and they get more popular and the overton window shifts more and more to the right and the majority

1851
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:44,120
opinion the centrist opinion ends up being yeah we should get rid of these guys will we then be

1852
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:49,400
saying boy I sure am glad I'm sure I'm glad that we let the marketplace of ideas decide what was

1853
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:55,480
right for us because here we are we've accepted that that X group X ethnic group is bad and we

1854
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:00,360
fucking got rid of them you know but I we fucking ended them I hear your point great I would make

1855
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:06,600
two points one thought is that I think I'm glad we were so egalitarian about this uh okay I hear

1856
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,600
your point and again that does make sense as well it's not unreasonable it's that that on the one

1857
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:16,760
point I would make the case that I think that we are a long way away from something like that

1858
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:21,080
but I understand people think that it's going to increment more and more so I get that yeah I mean

1859
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:25,400
I don't think this is around the corner right yet but it's fair to say that like it's more

1860
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:30,760
tax happened it's too close for comfort okay I mean I think that's you know whatever people

1861
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:35,400
might feel differently about that but fair enough the other thing is I think that a large difference

1862
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:40,360
between sort of more leftist and rightist thinking is about the emphasis being on

1863
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:46,360
targeting a specific goal and then kind of advocating any policy to get there I think that's

1864
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:50,760
kind of more like leftist thinking whereas I think more right thinking is about

1865
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:57,400
implementing a system and again I don't mean to like load this more with moral stuff but like

1866
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:03,000
implementing a principled system with the belief that like it will not you know lead to a bad

1867
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:08,280
outcome and if you see that trying to correct the system when those such things occur and I

1868
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:13,480
definitely sort of lean more towards that model of well let's let's let's let's implement let's

1869
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:21,240
let's not let's just implement a system that will you know engender the jews getting the

1870
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:25,720
fuck out of here you know we won't actually do it but I really think that's a pretty fringe

1871
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:33,240
belief I and I get it it is a fringe it is a fringe belief but it's growing and it's there

1872
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:39,240
it's there in the alt right but we'll it's undeniable it is undeniable will it ever go away

1873
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:44,920
though is my question like will our struggles seem like it was away it seemed like it was gone it

1874
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:50,200
was a joke and it's becoming less and less of a joke due to what I'm scared well look like I got

1875
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:55,880
you Ben I I don't know I think we've we've covered decent ground I think that you and I are kind of

1876
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:01,160
I don't know at the one point I don't love talking politics like this but the thing I think when Ben

1877
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:07,080
and I discuss it hopefully the viewers agree we give each other charity in our arguments and

1878
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:13,240
hopefully people see that and think that it's good uh and see that there's there's decent

1879
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:17,080
points to be made on either side and like maybe I'm wrong but I like to think I'm approaching

1880
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:23,480
good faith um and uh I feel the same about you so I mean I think you're a reasonable guy and I

1881
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:31,960
don't you know yeah I I want to I want to like I want to actually engage yeah with your ideas on

1882
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:37,640
this yeah I don't I don't want to just I don't want to throw anything out uh out of offhand

1883
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:42,600
or whatever you know okay I think I think I've made my point about the people calling me a fascist

1884
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:46,760
in the in the comments yeah isn't isn't May a fucking wanker I can't wait for her to resign

1903
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:42,040
of any kind uh and I've smuggled it here across the border to try to find out did it look like did

1904
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:47,640
it look like in Fullmetal Alchemist when Scar like pulls all the the words off of that page of that

1905
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:52,040
book and holds it in like an orb like an orb of letters like floating around his hand did it look

it's kind of funny how the pcp fans are either like you can't understand them or they're like

1921
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:29,320
american children yeah that's true yeah yeah yeah yeah I like that too uh well that was disappointing

1922
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:36,200
maybe one day we'll we'll get a real contact going uh okay moving on uh actual voicemails okay

1923
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:41,480
here's a lovely call um you know what I'm not even gonna read this name uh it's all in the subject

1924
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:49,800
matter and you're about to hear it let's get to it go a munchie wears killing code huh oh that's it

1925
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:54,680
hey that's the whole okay actually that was a good voice that that that was a good voice I actually

1926
01:56:54,680 --> 01:57:00,040
thought that was munchie for a second I was I thought about this the other day about how I have no

1927
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:07,560
desire to finish that series because first of all Tom's like like dead uh something like that Tom

1928
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,360
like he's doing better everybody he's doing better he's still he's still on it I am games

1929
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:18,920
uh that's true but also why would I continue killing code when I'm coding every day for endless war

1930
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:24,520
the reason why I was doing killing is to motivate myself to do code but why would I need a show for

1931
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:31,080
that when I already do it just in my daily life sure I understand that for you to live vicariously

1932
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:36,600
through me and not actually do your work and to be just be like I like to see progress made I like

1933
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:41,880
my favorite TV characters to have arcs and I want this to be spoon for me I want to feel like I'm

1934
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,040
accomplishing something by watching killing code and not actually doing what I understand this might

1935
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:50,600
be disappointing for you but from my perspective I've accomplished everything that I want to and

1936
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:56,920
I'm living my ideal life right now and I code all the time and it's just well munchie I I want to

1937
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:03,560
say I don't know whether to blame you or the fans for this but like um uh the people people in the

1938
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:08,600
comments being like hashtag where's the podcast killing code and stuff and people like people

1939
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:14,040
commenting on tbapp and 10 pays like where is killing code is that is that accurate there are

1940
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:19,240
some there is some of it and I hate it and I hate them and I hate you why have you done much you

1941
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:23,560
you need to make killing code finale already it needs to yes you need to make the killing you need to

1942
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:29,640
kill you need to like do like the the we have killed the code we have killed the code the video

1943
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:35,000
release you need to do the till that I'm not opposed to continue but I just see no no reason

1944
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,560
for my perspective well hey as long as people no no no don't don't continue it if you don't want to

1945
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:44,200
but please just just slip a dagger into its ribs put it out of its misery that's that's fair that's

1946
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:48,840
fair I mean obviously the reason people say that is because the very first episode it's like we're

1947
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:53,960
going to do this every week and if we don't you must attack us verbally and mentally yeah that's

1948
01:58:53,960 --> 01:59:02,760
true yeah I think that's the same height backlash you were talking about I mean I'm getting roasted

1949
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:06,840
quite a bit for we ag was being late you know totally fair totally fair but it's because I

1950
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:14,120
sent myself embrace we ag a boy okay okay indeed I just want to say yeah the difference between this

1951
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:20,200
and reagawa is even though they're both supposed to be weekly or whatever you know we agawa was you

1952
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:25,080
know like like it's it's good content for your channel you must survive yeah to make videos and

1953
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:32,600
stuff like that killing code had a purpose and the purpose was not to be a show it was not to be

1954
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:38,600
like well much I can't I can't let you off the hook on this surely you would admit it is not the

1955
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:44,040
viewers who are at fault for believing your promise of a weekly show that that's not at all what I'm

1956
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:48,520
saying that's not what all I'm saying I'm not saying that they were wrong to suspect this or

1957
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:53,800
even wrong to want it or continue to want it after I mean you're explaining why you're not

1958
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:57,960
going to do it which is fine which I totally get but exactly yeah that's that's all I'm trying to

1959
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:04,760
say is that there's no like I'm I'm doing everything I wanted to do this was a man killing code was a

1960
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:10,280
massive success in my opinion fair enough all right so so canonically killing code kill is it

1961
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:15,800
killed it's yeah I haven't talked to Tom Tom might want to still do it yeah maybe Tom's Tom's

1962
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:24,360
like hey I'm waiting and then he's too busy he's too busy creating 3d modeling that's doing a

1963
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,040
different show he's making a game though you know what this will be interesting I wonder I wonder

1964
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:33,720
what's Tom's done with with with all this this Cody knowledge these so I wonder he should let us know

1965
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:38,520
we should let us know well that well that killing code finale that's where you get into that start

1966
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:43,480
up killing code season two what did we do with killing code season one no no I think the finale

1967
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:47,800
would just be like Tom and munchie in a call and say so what do you do I'll do endless war what do

1968
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:52,680
you do I do this other thing and it's like all right now the end you know you could embed that

1969
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:58,600
in a piece of the episode that could just be in one yeah I mean it's in this one well but I hear

1970
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:06,920
fortunately I speak for Tom I killed the code Tom what's the deal with 3d models why do they

1971
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:13,160

some crazy dude all right some pink otter uh is calling it let's let's see what they have to say

2010
02:04:55,240 --> 02:05:01,000
dear denizens of the pcp podcast and any potential celebrity guests I've been listening to the

2011
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:06,120
podcast long enough for my brain to rot and to believe that following my passions might actually

2012
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:12,040
be a good idea so a little over half a year ago I began writing in my spare time oh good what I have

2013
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:17,320
now is the first draft of a method I would simultaneously like to edit and release over

2014
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:23,560
some unspecified amount of time however I was left with a conundrum where in the world do I post

2015
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:30,120
this piece of garbage after talking to my stupid friends they suggested Wattpan but I don't particularly

2016
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:36,920
like the idea of being on the same website as Naruto has a sister Sasuke love story

2017
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:43,400
as stupid yet more experienced internet creators yeah I was intrigued about your opinions on the

2018
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:49,480
matter should Wattpan indeed be avoided like the plague or am I just a fucking fan fiction figure

2019
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:55,080
okay first of all what's Wattpan what is he saying I I don't know what what what what pad is a

2020
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:02,440
it's a wait what what's the name of it what is it Wattpad like WATT yeah yeah is it a is it a fan

2021
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:07,640
fiction site or is it just a fiction site that a lot of fan artists post on it's it's it's a fiction

2022
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:13,880
site that oh it's most fan I mean none of us have ever done like long-form prose Tom kind of did

2023
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:18,120
with a certain iteration of sorceress loss I feel like you might know more about I mean did you

2024
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:23,480
wrote like uh his light novel I don't know what he released that on though I think he just made

2025
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:28,920
a google doc yeah oh yeah like the thing with the thing with writing I mean I don't know either

2026
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:36,040
because I don't I usually write for things that I end up drawing right um but uh I suppose

2027
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:43,240
being on a platform doesn't necessarily mean that you are associated with the people on that

2028
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:50,200
platform but people people will like think certain things if they know the you know like if Wattpad

2029
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:55,720
seems like a place that everyone goes when they hear it then maybe not put it there well it's

2030
02:06:55,720 --> 02:07:01,080
it's also like if you're on a platform then people who are also on that platform will see you so

2031
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:06,440
yeah fans might consist of I mean I mean there's nothing there's nothing stopping you from posting

2032
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:10,680
on multiple platforms I was gonna say that's the solution even if it's just a personal thing for

2033
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:14,520
you to make you feel better then you'd be like it's available on all these platforms like oh are

2034
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:18,040
you on that Naruto one no no you don't understand I'm on everything I'm just I'm playing the game

2035
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:22,760
baby I'm going everywhere I'm multi-plat and and I mean people will turn their nose up at any given

2036
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:28,680
platform right like no platform is perfect or completely respectable uh I mean I would suggest

2037
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:33,000
maybe maybe make your own website or maybe even just like a wordpress or something I mean he's just

2038
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,760
trying to get a seat right right so and then just you know make your make your twitter profile

2039
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:41,160
whatever put the description like author of you know whatever the title of your thing is make that

2040
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:46,680
part of your thing you know talk to other talk to other amateur writers and stuff and you know build

2041
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:52,520
a little personal brand around it I guess and while you work while you work on your next one um

2042
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:59,320
I mean I yeah post that that's the answer posted to every every platform yep every don't feel boxed

2043
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:03,800
and even like even if that put it on lulu put it on amazon have it like do like print on demand

2044
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:08,040
sir you can do this you can have it like you can have like print on demand books yeah is it is

2045
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:13,240
it self-publishing is it vanity publishing maybe but it's not completely illegitimate so fucking do

2046
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:17,000
it whatever publications going to be like that anyway so you know and I mean you won't it's your

2047
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:22,360
first book you know it won't first of all it might suck he's gonna keep working on it he said two

2048
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:27,560
it's like he sounds like it's still being okay yeah okay but um let me just say it might suck

2049
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:33,320
that's fine whether it sucks or not it won't sell that's fine this is your this is your base

2050
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:38,600
this is your like this is the thing that I made and like this is what you you're about and you

2051
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:44,120
work on your next one and and it's just you know don't worry about don't worry about the money don't

2052
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:49,320
worry about making sales worry about building a this sounds kind of dirty when I like I see it as

2053
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:53,320
but it's your fear for early shit is like you building your brand yeah right yeah absolutely I

2054
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:58,600
totally agree I mean who out right out of the gate like is super successful very rarely are people

2055
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:02,920
successful immediately like a I don't know like an undertale was his first time making a game

2056
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:07,960
really but he was a modder so I guess even that wasn't his first like you know well I mean yeah

2057
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:13,880
I'd feel like a lot of the success of undertale is down to Toby's uh proficiency with making really

2058
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:19,000
catchy good songs for sure for sure so and he had a lot of practice in that already I didn't I mean

2059
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:23,480
he also had he also had connections like Hussey promoted yeah he had he had lots of lots of help

2060
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:28,920
with that um yeah yeah so I mean so the short answer to your question yeah fucking release it on there

2061
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:33,640
and like don't well what are you gonna let like let the fact there's lots of fanfiction on the site

2062
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:38,680
stop you from spreading your shit and hustling and getting that green my dude I don't think so get

2063
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:43,160
out there post it there and then just be and then yeah like if that makes you feel bad post it everywhere

2064
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:47,400
put it in a google doc that you can just link to people if they just want to read it you know

2065
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:52,920
free of whatever else if you care about that but I say who gives a shit man that's um that's what I

2066
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:57,880
think maybe maybe commission someone to draw you like a like a cover yeah spend the 20 bucks to

2067
02:09:57,880 --> 02:10:03,320
get funny effectively function as a cover art or something yeah hell yeah hell yeah and don't

2068
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:07,480
don't do if you can't draw don't do it yourself there's nothing worse than like an embarrassingly

2069
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:12,600
bad uh like piece of art piece of promotional art drawn by someone who obviously you know I always

2070
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:16,040
thought I you know I enjoyed mumke's uh the triflers and all that but I always thought he

2071
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:20,120
should have gotten a cover made I just know I never finished it I got like halfway through it

2072
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:24,280
and then I forgot to finish I mean we had our podcast big fan loved it a lot really enjoyed it

2073
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:29,640
maybe super pissed but I mean that's because it's supposed to so there you go right all right well

2074
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:34,040
there you go there's your answer moving on he would he would know ask him he's I mean that

2075
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:38,120
that sounds like a higher level though that was like actual releasing it for sale which I don't

2076
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:42,040
think this dude's going for yet but I mean you can always ask him he might have well I'm saying

2077
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:48,440
yeah I mean you can buy the triflers on like it's on Lulu and stuff yeah yeah Amazon books may I

2078
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:53,400
don't know but like there's nothing stopping you amateur author from doing oh I mean that's

2079
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:57,160
totally true yeah like why limit yourself if you don't have to you might as well just make

2080
02:10:57,160 --> 02:11:03,160
it available you might as well you might as well yeah so go for it dude yeah okay anyway okay next

2092
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:29,320
coming it's coming you know it's coming uh but before that we've got uh so we've actually got

2093
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:37,880
some robots calling in um so first we've got the pcp generator 0.0 0.3 gang gang 2020 yeah that's

2094
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:41,560
fair we have to fight against them I got my got my yang shirt fuck the robot but we gotta know our

2095
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:48,920
enemy so let's hear what this version uh of the alpha generator has to say okay uh go welcome to

2096
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:56,200
the pcp version 153.6 edition four beta got the right lesson this program was carefully crafted by

2097
02:12:56,200 --> 02:13:01,560
the best scientists the world had to offer for your listening pleasure Ben sainte is here

2098
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:08,280
so his best guy ever also made jopen brackets who does not talk close brackets laugh she left

2099
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:15,800
what about yang gang best guy ever ah yes the yang gang is quite delightful I agree

2100
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:22,600
Ben but I also hate that the laborers of the world are oppressed by the capitalist overlords

2101
02:13:22,600 --> 02:13:28,840
best guy ever best guy ever but they take money for work which was agreed upon beforehand

2102
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:34,920
you are stupid come on guys I will get mad so I will talk about pokemon and all its derivatives

2103
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:40,040
in length it's okay we're talking about pokemon I will join the conversation now because I know

2104
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:44,760
something about pokemon which is not the case for politics which is why I have abstained from

2105
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:52,200
contributing during that time mage insert nothing of value here thank you for listening to our

2106
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:57,160
professional podcast and please donate your hard-earned money on patreon which contributes to

2107
02:13:57,160 --> 02:14:02,360
the abstract idea of making more of this podcast which we will do anyway and a possible gathering

2108
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:08,200
at a later date yeah fair all good there it is okay you know is that it pretty good yep though

2109
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:13,480
that was it so that was good I appreciate that okay so the good news is okay so first of all

2110
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:18,520
I'm actually getting a little worried we've got another bot calling in uh and it's already evolving

2111
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:23,480
because uh I mean maybe maybe yang was on to something because we podcasters are being

2112
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:29,000
deposed by these robots that are just better in every way did you hear that last call that was

2113
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,800
better than anything we've ever recorded on this podcast over 50% of the american population is

2114
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:38,520
currently working in the podcast sector and every single one of those jobs is automatable god damn

2115
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:44,040
he's right by by 2020 there will be no podcast we cannot compete with that level of quality therefore

2116
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:48,600
we need to ban the technology it's the only fair thing to do okay but I believe in knowing

2117
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:56,920
thy enemy so let's see what uh pcp ai bought version 208-03-30 uh oh wait no that's the date

2118
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:04,200
it's version 208 okay okay here we go uh commence all right let's get into this urban

2119
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:09,160
dictionary's definition for procedillary generated podcast is the procrastinators podcast

2120
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:13,960
i don't think that's right good or can't be made by our machine i kind of agree

2121
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:18,120
we're not at the level with that sort of thing what if there was a machine that let you turn

2122
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:23,240
whatever you were thinking of dream about a god lost i mean everything's every day that's why

2123
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:29,240
capitalism works that is keto it's not fair that people have money pay for leon dot com slash

2124
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:34,120
then say we need to get everyone building themselves up that's how we get the star fleet people real

2125
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:38,920
problem with procedurally regenerated art is that at some point it starts making a mess and

2126
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:43,960
you have to clean it up is that really i don't like it it's not good i don't know why i am just

2127
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:51,560
thinking okay press one one one one one one one one one one one one one that's okay that was those

2128
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:56,920
two real algorithm they have evolved since that first robot it's already advanced this much maybe

2129
02:15:56,920 --> 02:16:02,200
maybe that interrupting each other maybe we should lean into this i mean we have now had yeah two

2130
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:08,680
entire effectively two entire pcp episodes within this pcp that's true because we've had

2131
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:13,720
two basically four it's like the the equivalent of like you know in uh in uh willy wonka they got

2132
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:18,280
the pill that's like the full three course meal like that's what these are these are these are an

2133
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:24,040
entire an entire pcp experience just the pure joy condensed into this few seconds this 45 second

2134
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:30,760
podcast uh that's really all you need i really like that the topic was a podcast made by ai and

2135
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:37,160
they actually discussed that as the thing they evolved so much dude i'm they're getting smarter

2136
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:43,720
uh i'm okay so you know so uh the thing about yang i don't just agree with is that like if i can

2137
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:49,640
be on top if we can be controlling the robots to just do our jobs for us so we do zero work

2138
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:54,600
we reap the benefit while the rest of society stagnates and is destroyed but we can suck the

2139
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:59,080
the wealth and the resources from them while that's happening that sounds great that sounds like

2140
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:03,080
what i want to i mean that's what i mean that's what automation should do that's that's what i

2141
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:07,720
believe in yeah the robot shouldn't lead to people being miserable it should lead to oh the work

2142
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:13,240
is done for us well we can just relax we can chill out we can do some cool although you know i mean

2143
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:16,760
okay that's true and i don't want to get too much into this but like why are we doing this again

2144
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:21,560
look just just okay this one question i just have one it's like no if no question if you were i want

2145
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:27,080
to hear it if you were the roboticist and like you knew that like if you made this robot that

2146
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:31,800
it's just an omni robot it can do everything it'll replace every job on the planet and you know

2147
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:36,600
that like your but you will not earn all the money it's gonna be taken and you're like fuck it

2148
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,080
i'm just not gonna make the robot you know why is everyone else gonna benefit disproportionately

2149
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:46,600
to my work shut up you fuckers uh what's your what's your word to that scientist who feels that

2150
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:51,400
his work isn't going to be fairly rewarded that he should just do it for the benefit of humanity

2151
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:57,320
is that you know uh i mean why wouldn't he be people i mean people are gonna have to buy his

2152
02:17:57,400 --> 02:18:02,600
robots right uh i suppose i suppose maybe the robots will build themselves and then they'll

2153
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:07,640
you know they're smart enough to do that well here's what i would say i would say that okay

2154
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:12,600
maybe it's bad maybe it's a shame that he won't be compensated however by creating this robot he

2155
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:19,160
will create a utopia in which he doesn't need money i suppose he doesn't need rewards because

2156
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:25,560
everything will be solved um yeah yeah so i would still say okay i'm gonna make i'm gonna make

2157
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:29,160
they'll say it'll a partially controversial statement that i think you'll totally disagree with

2158
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:33,480
and lots of people will but it's just that like if you're let's say you're a rich man on the top

2159
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:39,160
of the hierarchy and you have the ability to make like to give everyone infinite wealth like with

2160
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:44,840
these robots or whatever and you choose not to because you like your privileged position at

2161
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:49,640
the top of the hierarchy here at my stance is i think that's you're like well if everyone's if

2162
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:55,160
everyone's equal if everyone's equally provided for then i won't be above exactly i think it is

2163
02:18:55,240 --> 02:19:00,920
your right to make that choice and i i think it is your right to make the choice but you are a

2164
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:07,160
fucking monster that may be a fair case you are a fucking demon who should be swell all right

2165
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:12,440
okay good news people were passed that it's time to check in with riddle my ass batman he's here

02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:51,000
why is that oh i hear your point i i i want to say that because you were elevated before the
