1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,680
PopTrop is one of the holy grail video games that we have to play in RFCK. It's PopTropica,

2
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,880
it's Webkinz, it's Super Smash Bros. Ball, the subspace industry.

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,120
You were insisting on Webkinz for a long time and then...

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,040
Yeah, we'll get to Webkinz. We will get to Webkinz.

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,680
I can't, I can't wait. Hold on.

6
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
We have to deal with this demon first though.

7
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,800
Yeah, so he just got messaged, so he just got messaged by our good friend Econ. He wants

8
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,200
to borrow $20, so I'm going to quickly pay Pal him $20.

9
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
What does he want?

10
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,080
He says that he spent too much on cards and he needs to buy gas.

11
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,600
That sounds like Econ.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Yeah, you know, he spent, legendarily, he spent over $200 on manga when we were driving

13
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,200
up to Boston. We stopped at, oh god, I always forget the name of some manga store called

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,880
Mio Kunio or something? Kino Kunio? I don't know.

15
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,320
No, no, it's probably one location.

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,520
Some big Boston manga location and he spent $200 on manga because it was on sale.

17
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Anyway.

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,120
What's it like being back in Boston? Do you walk around anywhere or just stay in your

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
house?

20
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,640
I was walking around a bit, mostly for Pokemon Go purposes. I haven't been doing that for

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,720
the last like two weeks or so, two or three weeks, but sometimes crack comes over and

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,000
like we'll go out for burgers or stuff. I mostly just hang out with my weirdo roommates

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,520
or housemates. I want to say roommates because it just sounds more natural, but we don't

24
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,680
actually live in the same room or anything. We're not on bunk beds.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,480
Well, why not? I'm sure that would save space.

26
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,960
You don't have any bunk beds.

27
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,840
Oh, I'll tell you what you do. Okay, you bunk bed with someone else and then you can turn

28
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,440
your current room into like an office space for recording vlogs. You can set up like a

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,440
bunch of posters, you can set up some like Watchmen pages in the background.

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,120
I mean, that's pretty much what my room is. It just also has a bed in it.

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,560
Well, okay. I mean, it's almost there. How often do you spend time with Tom and Digi?

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,680
They like live extremely close to you.

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,160
Oh man. Digi told me to come over like two weeks ago. He said, when are you coming over?

34
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,400
Like come over anytime you want. Like come over sometime this week. And I just never

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,400
did. I mean, I'm sure the invitation still stands.

36
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,760
I think you might have taken too much time. It's over now.

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah, it's over now. The moment has passed.

38
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,040
Ever since we made the secret discord group that only me and Digi are in, where we're

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,360
following your demise in the PCP, and we're going to eventually open up to everyone else.

40
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,880
You're going to be kicked that day.

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
Ever since that day, I think that the invitation has been rescinded.

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,200
Here's how I know that I will never... Look, I'm going to jinx it right now and say that

43
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:17,080
my position in the PCP is bulletproof because I can never be kicked from the PCP no matter

44
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,360
what I do because me and Nate form a voting majority and Nate will never vote against

45
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
me.

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Wait, what do you mean a voting majority?

47
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,680
There's two of us and that's more than there are of anyone else.

48
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,240
Oh, well, okay. I mean, I didn't do the math. I just assumed that was wrong if I said anything.

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,600
Yeah, there's two and two is more than one and everyone else is one.

50
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Right.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,040
So everyone else loses. Yeah, no.

52
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,160
You're probably one of the only people that's bulletproof. I think you're bulletproof. I

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,840
mean, Nate probably just because no one has the nerve to.

54
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,040
Me and Nate are both bulletproof.

55
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,720
Everyone else at a moment's notice could be gone.

56
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
Yeah, I think so and probably will be. Watch your back.

57
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Sleep with one eye open.

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,560
It's interesting that you think that Nate would not vote you out.

59
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,360
Nate would never, of course, Nate would never vote me out.

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,440
What makes you think this?

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,880
What could ever compel him to vote me out?

62
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:23,480
Well, that would be like, that would be, I mean, that would be a betrayal.

63
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,560
That would literally be a family betrayal.

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,480
If there's one thing that I know Nate has no qualms about, it's betrayal and slash or

65
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
killing you.

66
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,920
I mean, he'll do it in Endless War.

67
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,240
Like in Endless War, he's explicitly plotting that.

68
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,400
Out of the open and yet you still fund him.

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Yeah, and yet, I don't know.

70
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
Ben, start the game. Start Pop Tropica.

71
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,280
Wait, hold on. I have this off in your long game.

72
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,760
Sorry, I have to send the econ $20 for gas.

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,480
God damn it. We're on Jesus Christ.

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
Econ, we're playing Pop Tropica.

75
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,280
I know and he just, he sent me a message like 15 minutes ago and I haven't responded yet.

76
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,400
Hold on, hold on.

77
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,680
If PayPal didn't have banks as an information, I would say do it on the show.

78
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,080
I mean, probably I could show my screen and nothing that sensitive would be released,

79
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,320
but just to be safe and keeping it off screen.

80
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,560
I still believe that one time where you leaked the RFCK password, we had to spin like 30

81
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,080
minutes tracking down like a new one.

82
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay.

83
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,520
Good times.

84
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,400
I don't understand. I don't understand living so close to the margin, living so close to

85
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,520
the edge of your means that you have to borrow like, to like $20 is not a lot, like that

86
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,560
that would make the difference in whether you can, are going to make it is weird to

87
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,560
me and seems like really terrifying.

88
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,720
Well, why am I wondering about how he spent so much money on Magic the Gathering cards

89
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
that he doesn't have enough money to forget?

90
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,880
Did he like not realize how short he was or did he just make the tactical decision like

91
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,040
knowing that it would screw him over in the future where he just needed those cards in

92
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,200
the temporary?

93
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,720
I think he just lives really close to, and I think not just him, I think lots of people

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,760
just live really close to, you know, the brink of financial ruin.

95
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,080
You know the real, like the chain of command here is that your $10 is going to go $10 to

96
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,760
Econ, $10 to Nino.

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,720
20. I mean, I don't, I don't care.

98
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I don't care what he does with it.

99
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,240
I mean, I'm just saying that, that he's asked you for money and Nino has asked Econ for

100
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,000
money and God knows who's asked Nino for money, so we don't know how far the chain

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
goes.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,080
Supposedly, Econ tells me that Nino has gotten better and is not as much of a mooch anymore.

103
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,360
I don't know if anyone can believe that.

104
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,040
So I mean, alright, alright, so my favorite Shakespeare quote is by Polonius in Hamlet

105
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,920
and he says, I'm going to try and quote it off the top of my head, he says, um, neither

106
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,600
borrower nor lender be for loan off loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,560
the edge of husbandry.

108
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,840
So in general, I don't like to lend money and I don't borrow money, but Econ did do

109
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,600
me a big favor back in the day, you know, a couple months ago when he let me crash at

110
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,000
his place for a while, and he's also good about paying back loans.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,520
He's never, he has yet to, he has yet to shaft me.

112
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,600
If he ever shafts me, that will be the last loan I ever make for him, I ever give him,

113
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,120
but he hasn't, it hasn't happened yet, so it's fine.

114
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
What's your age band?

115
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,280
Well, how's the highest to go?

116
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,280
It goes with the highest 15.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,080
And only as low as six.

118
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Should I just do random?

119
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Wait, no.

120
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,560
How old is RBCK, well, well, it's definitely not six years old yet.

121
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,640
It's maybe two years old.

122
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,120
Um, let's go 12 of them.

123
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
12 it is.

124
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Uh.

125
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,600
We're 12 years, how's it feel to be 12 again?

126
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Ooh.

127
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Oh, neat starfish.

128
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,920
Uh, point and click the mouse to move here.

129
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,280
Can you change the way that you look?

130
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Yes.

131
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh my God, this is the, oh, I fucking remember this so vividly.

132
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Incredible.

133
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Incredible beetle.

134
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Beetle.

135
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,160
Uh, hold on.

136
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,400
How big, this seems like, oh, you know what?

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,800
Let me, let me, let me change my aspect ratio.

138
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,320
I think I can squeeze a little more of this onto the screen here.

139
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,880
Uh, there we go, getting that high res, high res.

140
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,720
See how well you can make, you can make, uh, the cop killer in here, the cop killer himself.

141
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
The cop killer himself.

142
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Oh yeah.

143
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:45,680
Good old, good old cop kill of, um, Pokemon XD, hey, so I made a, I made a twitch, um,

144
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,200
selection for the Pokemon XD episodes.

145
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,760
I called it like Pokemon XD, heaven or hell, Nuzlocke, um, I don't know, I thought, uh,

146
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
you know.

147
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
I'm very proud of you.

148
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Yeah.

149
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Thank you very much.

150
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
I made, I made a thumbnail.

151
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,240
I made a nice thumbnail featuring, uh, dredge, legendary dredge.

152
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I, I, I saw it.

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
It was quite nice.

154
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
It's nice.

155
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,960
It's maybe not very RFCK, but that's okay, because it's a video game.

156
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Yeah.

157
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,240
It's gonna be way more crushed.

158
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Yeah.

159
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Crushed a high hell.

160
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Hmm.

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,760
The, the, the physical, like feet of making that collection must have been incredibly

162
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
strenuous.

163
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
I'm very proud of you.

164
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,960
It was, you know, it tested my moral fiber.

165
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,680
Like, like, like pushing a bold, they're pressing that keyboard, must have been like

166
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,960
a real fucking, like an all day affair.

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,080
Sys, it was a Sisyphean task.

168
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Yeah.

169
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah.

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,120
Uh, I think I'm, I'm so jealous and mad at you in every way, but the most, the most,

171
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,280
you know, front facing way that you're so, you're in fucking Boston.

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
You're squandering.

173
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
You're fucking squandering it.

174
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I guess I am kind of squandering it.

175
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,960
You haven't, you haven't been to Diddy's house once.

176
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
That's not true.

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I've been a couple of times.

178
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Well, whatever.

179
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
You haven't been recent.

180
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
I have not been in a while.

181
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
And ain't good faith.

182
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,040
You have not been there under, under, you know, normal circumstances.

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
You've just been sneaking around.

184
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Uh.

185
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Fucking snake.

186
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Do we have hats?

187
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,360
Uh, you probably won't be able to get the beard either because, you know, you're 12.

188
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Yeah.

189
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
That's true.

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Unfortunately.

191
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,360
But there's no hats.

192
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
There's no hats.

193
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Well, you know, I mean, does that, is that what your hair looks like?

194
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Yeah.

195
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,320
You look like a hat hair.

196
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
There we go.

197
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Yeah.

198
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
That looks just like you.

199
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,280
Hey, how's your, uh, how's your quest to become an SJW going to, to infiltrate the,

200
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
the liberal flank?

201
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,360
Oh, um, there's only two kinds of eyes.

202
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,280
How is my, my quest to become an SJW, it's, uh, it's been pretty successful.

203
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,360
I've seen, you know, it's, it's, it's already paying dividends.

204
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Um, my social capital is skyrocketing.

205
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Uh, it's through the roof.

206
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,400
Um, my, the moral, I gotta tell you, it feels, feels pretty cool up here on the moral high

207
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
ground.

208
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,480
Did you finally have a moral compass to speak of?

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Yeah.

210
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Had had any scruples whatsoever.

211
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,980
Uh, yeah.

212
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,900
You know, I, I, who, who would have thought, who would have thought that me, Ben St, the

213
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,400
cop killer would ever have any scruples.

214
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,480
This, this character looks awful by the way.

215
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Yeah.

216
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,560
She's, she's, he's a real nightmare.

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
There we go.

218
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Jesus Christ.

219
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,400
What's his name?

220
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,000
The quality and discordant solo classical frog.

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Comical fang.

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
All right.

224
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
Really?

225
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,020
Comical fang.

226
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
Stupid.

227
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,520
Look at that roll.

228
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,820
Wait, how do I, how do I make him do that?

229
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,820
What the hell?

230
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Whoa.

231
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Yeah.

232
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,820
It is.

233
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I know controls.

234
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
It's like Mario.

235
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
Wow.

236
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Splendid.

237
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
Oh, he jumped into the little.

238
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Yeah.

239
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Do you want to go?

240
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Are you, are you down?

241
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Are you ready to go to pop tropical?

242
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I don't know.

243
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Does he, does he look ready to you?

244
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
Um, he'll never look ready.

245
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
He looks like an unbaked chicken.

246
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
There we go.

247
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
All right.

248
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,120
That's the exact look I was going for.

249
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
Oh my fucking god.

250
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Get ready.

251
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
You're going to have to pick your, your island.

252
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,940
It might chop you off on an early pop chop guy.

253
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,820
Actually, it might, it might auto pick you the first one.

254
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,080
Do you want to learn how to play pop tropical?

255
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,680
I'm, I gotta say I'm pretty ambivalent about that prospect.

256
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,400
Uh, hold on.

257
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Once again, I have, I have cut off some, besides the window keeps changing.

258
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,880
I'll, I'll figure it out.

259
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,780
We can't, we can't lose a single pixel of this gold.

260
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
No.

261
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
Yeah.

262
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,980
Listen, it took thousands of artists and thousands of programmers to do this.

263
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,180
We got to pay them more respect.

264
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,780
We got to press F to pay them more respects.

265
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,180
This feels so wrong.

266
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,180
I think this is a new, I think it's a new tutorial.

267
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Don't you hate it when they go back and they improve your favorite video games?

268
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,340
Yeah, I really do.

269
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,940
I really sincerely do.

270
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,000
My favorite items were, were shark tooth island.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,320
I liked the one with the, the rap that one was good too.

272
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
Are you here early pop truck is hard.

273
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,800
Are you hearing the music?

274
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,800
No, I can't hear any music.

275
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Is it good?

276
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I can only assume.

277
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,400
I actually like it quite a bit.

278
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,360
I'm glad it's here.

279
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
It makes it feel like a real experience.

280
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,480
Oh, uh, where, where are we?

281
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
We're in the middle of pop tropical.

282
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
It's a race.

283
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Oh, what?

284
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeah, this is definitely new.

285
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,780
This is definitely new and I hate it.

286
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Their eyes move.

287
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,260
Where your, where your cursor moves.

288
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,260
Look at you.

289
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,260
Look at your eyes.

290
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Oh, I'm seeing it.

291
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Let's go.

292
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,740
Is this how you respond if this were happening in real life?

293
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,260
Would you have this cabler attitude?

294
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
Yeah.

295
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,300
And that smile on your face.

296
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,540
You should say, we should save it.

297
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
It might run into a storm up on this rickety old plane.

298
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Yes, please.

299
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,840
I can see you saying that.

300
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,640
Click the save.

301
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,040
I, the music is actually pretty loud.

302
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm going to turn it down a little bit.

303
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,040
I didn't want to click the save button to create a username and password.

304
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,540
We're going to be living on the edge.

305
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,040
Oh, Jesus Christ.

306
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Why does the window size keep changing?

307
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
I don't know.

308
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
It's, hold on.

309
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'm going to, I'm going to take, okay, username.

310
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
You know, you know, the old saying is, you know, absence makes the heart go stronger.

311
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,040
You know, you might think, you know, it's been so many years since I've been able to

312
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,040
take in my, in my old, with my old flame, you know, play this, this classic video game.

313
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,040
And you think yourself, you know, maybe it won't impress me when I go back to it.

314
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,040
My nostalgia goggles may be shattered to a thousand pieces, but I'm happy to see that

315
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
PopTropic is just as how I remember it.

316
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
And it's splendid.

317
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,040
And there's nothing that can taint it in my mind.

318
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Yeah.

319
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,040
And that's, and that's going to be the arc of this video, everyone.

320
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Not having his memory of PopTropic attainted by the green reality.

321
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Some arc, if, if, if I get over it in the first 10 minutes and some arc.

322
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Oh, oh, oh, look, chocolate Frosted Flakes, a banner added on the side.

323
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Well, I'm in the mood for chocolate.

324
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
We got, we got, we got to see that.

325
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
We got to see that.

326
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Check, check that out every, every pony.

327
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Sponsored by Frosted Flakes.

328
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Welcome Races.

329
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
What the fuck is happening right now?

330
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Race to win credits and this medallion.

331
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
This has nothing to do with anything.

332
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,040
This is like fake and weird and I don't understand it.

333
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
This is what PopTropic is.

334
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
No, it's not.

335
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
It's not true.

336
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
They've changed it.

337
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Can I, can I go somewhere else?

338
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Do that.

339
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,040
How do you get, how do you get cool costumes?

340
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
By costumizing.

341
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
I'll show, I'll show you how.

342
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Now.

343
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Ooh.

344
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,040
The more, the more, the more I feel like you've hit the nail on the head here.

345
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Exciting our character.

346
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Click to keep, click on the parts you want to try.

347
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Is the only difference in character sprite that she's got eyelashes?

348
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Yeah.

349
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,040
This is awful.

350
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
No, you got, no.

351
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Yep, I did it.

352
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
I'm just going to be a.

353
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Oh, you ruined it.

354
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,040
You fucking, I was just saying how perfect our character design was.

355
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Well, not anymore.

356
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Can you swap your skin color?

357
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I cannot.

358
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I cannot just click on his skin and get his skin color.

359
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
You know, this is actually horrible.

360
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
What do you mean?

361
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
I miss the old one.

362
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Yeah.

363
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Yeah.

364
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
You can't change it back either.

365
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
You fucked up.

366
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Okay.

367
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Click on all the buttons.

368
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Save up.

369
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Okay.

370
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
That's the closet.

371
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
This would wait.

372
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Hold on.

373
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
There's one more button I haven't tried.

374
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
No.

375
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
No, it's over, Ben.

376
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Man.

377
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
God damn.

378
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
This game is.

379
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
You want to restart?

380
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
This game has a vicious learning curve.

381
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Maybe you can get out of this tutorial too.

382
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
No, I'm sure.

383
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
I'm sure I can fuck around with it later.

384
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
We're ready.

385
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
You're going to do some weird fucking minigame.

386
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
It makes no sense.

387
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
It isn't related to the game at all.

388
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Look, there are the islands down there.

389
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
The whole point of this game is there's like a thousand islands to explore.

390
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
You're on the fucking sky right now.

391
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
What a great start.

392
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Is that you in the back there?

393
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
This is just a cutscene.

394
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
This is just a cutscene.

395
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
What is happening?

396
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
We're setting up a villain.

397
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Sorry to throw our wrench.

398
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Stop trying to say I'm a villain.

399
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
It doesn't have its over.

400
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
What is happening?

401
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Sorry to throw a literal wrench in your literal plans.

402
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Sorry to make you fucking crash into the ocean.

403
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Thank you for showing me this game, Munchie.

404
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm glad.

405
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Oh, maybe I can get that monkey costume.

406
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Oh yeah, maybe.

407
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Clear the map up there.

408
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Click on the map.

409
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Up in the top right.

410
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

411
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Do you mean the menu?

412
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Yeah, the menu.

413
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
I think you want me to follow him.

414
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Okay.

415
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
The controls of this game are so satisfying.

416
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
You know what?

417
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Also, we got to play Super Mario 63.5,

418
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
which is the Newgrounds Flash game.

419
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
That's a 2D rendition of Super Mario 64.

420
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,040
It has the best controls of the new Mario game.

421
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Uh, sick.

422
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Hey, I saw you...

423
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Speaking of...

424
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,040
You ever played that 2D portal game that's on Newgrounds?

425
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
No, I didn't.

426
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Oh, I played Terraria, though.

427
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Crush the crab.

428
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Crush the crab.

429
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Squish.

430
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,040
They don't allow violent violence on this video game.

431
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Well, then what kind of video game...

432
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Isn't that a novelty?

433
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
No violence in a video game.

434
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Terrible.

435
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Waste of my goddamn...

436
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Waste of my goddamn time.

437
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Friends, home, settings, mute, costumeizer...

438
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Holy shit.

439
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
I can't change my outfit.

440
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
What is...

441
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
What? Lego City?

442
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Look at that Lego guy.

443
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
He just is a Lego person.

444
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
He's way taller than you are.

445
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Oh.

446
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Oh, he's awful.

447
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
He's a nightmare.

448
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
I wonder if I can costumeize myself.

449
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Oh my god, please.

450
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
No, I won't let me.

451
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Talk to him.

452
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
What's his deal?

453
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Quick, get in.

454
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Okay, you have to get out of here.

455
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
Find the mammoth.

456
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
Oh, you know what game we got?

457
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Oh, okay.

458
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
I don't know what you're doing right now.

459
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Wait, why am I still on screen?

460
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Why can I still see myself?

461
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Are you controlling the ship as well?

462
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Yeah.

463
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Oh.

464
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
I don't think my character is supposed to be here.

465
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Well, you know, maybe it's like a metaphorical,

466
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
maybe it's not literal.

467
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
I don't know anything.

468
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,040
It's like a metaphorical vision of yourself.

469
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Yeah, alright.

470
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Where's the guns?

471
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Where's the violence?

472
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I need violence in this game.

473
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
As far as I can tell.

474
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
What is a video game without violence?

475
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
As far as I can tell, I have no weapon.

476
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Oh, I did it.

477
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
I got to the mammoth.

478
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Thank God.

479
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Now, buy our product.

480
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Follow.

481
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
You have to get out of here.

482
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
You have to get out of here.

483
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Oh, press space bar to use the power.

484
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Wait, what?

485
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
You have to go.

486
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Oh, shit.

487
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Oh, looks like I'm doing it again.

488
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
We have to stop this.

489
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm sorry, I gotta find the mammoth.

490
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Jesus Christ.

491
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I mean, it's not gonna find itself.

492
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,040
I'm so happy that violence has returned to our video game.

493
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Ever since that white fucking...

494
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Oh, God.

495
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Shit, we forgot.

496
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Yeah, that was the whole point of this video.

497
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Yeah, violence reigns supreme once again in Slime City.

498
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I'm so happy that we've come to our senses

499
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,040
and we've started a whole new gang warfare era.

500
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Yeah.

501
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,040
From our senses and stopped just lazing around the apartment

502
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,040
and we're finally recruiting more children to do our bidding.

503
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,040
The proxy violence has picked up again.

505
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,040
The proxy child-based violence.

506
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
My favorite kind of violence, in fact.

507
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:13,040
In fact, the only kind that I personally engage in.

508
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Do you want a scoop of gang warfare?

509
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Yeah, child-flavored, please.

510
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Okay.

511
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
We finally found it.

512
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Alright, get out of this Lego-based hell, please.

513
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I can't.

514
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I cannot do it.

515
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Holy shit.

516
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,040
This is against all what PopTropica stands for.

517
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Is it so?

518
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,040
This is what PopTropica is and was always meant to be.

519
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
This is a nightmare.

520
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Where's Sharktooth Island?

521
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Where's early PopTropica?

522
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,040
I didn't need this tutorial level.

523
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Oh my god.

524
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Another happy landing.

525
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,040
I don't know why she's British in your mind.

526
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Because that's what the Obi-Wan Kenobi says.

527
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Oh, right.

528
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,040
And this is clearly a Christ allegory.

529
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
It's too high.

530
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
I can't get that high, bro.

531
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Just watch me.

532
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Yeah, so viewer, listen, right now,

533
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,040
right now, as this video exists,

534
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,040
a war is on,

535
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,040
and you can go and click the fucking link in the description

536
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,040
to join the Discord and start killing children

537
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,040
like you always wanted to.

538
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,040
You can also role-play as a child so it will be less heinous.

539
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Yeah, much less heinous.

540
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
I don't know adult killing a child is reprehensible,

541
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,040
but a child killing another child is a-okay.

542
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
It's fair game.

543
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
It's level playing feeling that way.

544
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,040
So, you know, you can live out all your child.

546
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,040
The point is that we're like,

547
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
we're basically Coney.

548
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
We're basically Coney, but there's two of us.

549
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
You know, we got our child soldiers.

550
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Double the Coney.

551
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Double the Coney.

552
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
We should run for president.

553
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Forget about being mayor.

554
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
We should run for president.

555
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,040
We should run for African warlord.

556
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Where can I find a wrench?

557
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
I guess.

558
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
I guess I need one.

559
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Maybe that monkey knows.

560
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Where'd he go?

561
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
All right.

562
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Come on.

563
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
I feel like pop-trop is the natural evolution of endless war.

564
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
I feel like this was more like in 10 years.

565
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
This is what-

566
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
It's full of Lego products.

567
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah.

568
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Oh, we have to do-we have to add a new mini-game.

569
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,040
We have to add the mammoth finding

570
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
at the very end of charcoal park.

571
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
You have to be able to find the mammoth.

572
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
I swear to God, I'm going to kill myself.

573
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Why?

574
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Why would you kill yourself?

575
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
I hate this game.

576
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
I hate what's happening here.

577
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Why?

578
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
No.

579
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Where's Gun Gale Island?

580
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Fucking solve the crab puzzle.

581
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
What crab puzzle?

582
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Right here.

583
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
All right.

584
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Release the crab.

585
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Just-no, Jesus Christ.

586
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Okay, I need to take over control of this game.

587
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Well, guess what?

588
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
It's too late.

589
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
You can't do it.

590
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Oh, wow, I did it.

591
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Look how smug I am about it, too.

592
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
I know.

593
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,040
These are going to look like the entire-the entire playthrough.

594
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,040
I can't-I need to find some better costume pieces.

595
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Yeah, that's really the most important thing.

596
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
I don't like being a pilot.

597
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
No one does.

598
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Not even pilots.

599
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Hey, so my-the only thing worthwhile about me has passed.

600
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Like, my magic is gone in all the desirable aspects.

601
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
You're not a child soldier anymore.

602
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Now you're a filthy adult general.

603
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,040
So all the things that people would be, like, impressed by.

604
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Like, all of my, like, social capital has instantly plummeted.

605
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,040
And now-and now I have no more, you know, interest to my name.

606
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
There's nothing more people latch onto.

607
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Yeah, the one-the one thing about you is it's over.

608
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
It's over now.

609
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
And it's never coming back, so...

610
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
Now, now, now people can't be like,

611
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
oh, you know, like, he's cool for, like, a kid.

612
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Now they just will have to say, oh, you know.

613
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Now you just have to be-he's not cool.

614
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

615
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
There's no more qualifiers.

616
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
No more excuses.

617
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
It's all-it's all downhill from here.

618
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Can-can confirm.

619
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Here we go.

620
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
W-what's-what's-give me some pointers, Ben.

621
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
What's-what's it like?

622
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Um, well, it's kind of like, uh...

623
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Look how ha-look how pleased I am about what just happened.

624
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Um, it's kind of like...

625
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,040
It's kind of like, um...

626
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Getting, like, sucker punched in the gut every morning.

627
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
Mm-hmm.

628
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Um, and just having to live with it.

629
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,040
And not-not being able to take revenge on the person doing it.

630
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Because life itself.

631
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Because life itself is the one inflicting this on you.

632
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Um, yeah.

633
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
So I should kill myself, is what you're saying?

634
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
You should, but you won't.

635
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Because part of the-part of the curse is that you're too much of a coward.

636
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Now that-now that you're an adult, you're too much of a coward to do it.

637
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
You-you aren't brave like you used to.

638
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
If-if it were-if it were any other day,

639
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
then you'd be able to kill yourself willy-nilly, it wouldn't matter.

640
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
But now that you're an adult, you're too coward.

641
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Once...

643
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,040
So-so-so, you know, you're trapped now. You're fucked.

644
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,040
You know, I-that's why-that's why adult suicide is way more admirable than child suicide.

645
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Because when you're a child, it's not that impressive.

646
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,040
You know, you could snap your own neck for, you know, at a moment's notice.

647
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
When you're an adult, you have to really consider it.

648
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Yeah.

649
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
And that makes it way more respectable.

650
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
You have to, like, work out.

651
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
You have to, like, work out to do it.

652
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
You have to, like, work out to do it.

653
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Imagine an adult.

654
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
It reminds me of when I was a young adventurer.

656
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I was a young man preparing to live my dream.

657
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,040
She's-she's calling him out for talking too much after, like, two lines of dialogue.

658
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Um, yeah, sure.

659
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
W-what's-so what's the story so far in this?

660
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Well, we crash landed on an island.

661
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
And that's it.

662
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
We gotta fix our plans.

663
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
We meet some indigenous tribes.

664
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
I think they're all tourists like us.

665
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
I think we're all just pretending.

666
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,040
The-the indigenous population has been wiped out by syphilis for generations.

667
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
The syphilis?

668
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Which we brought.

669
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
We brought in springs.

670
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Me and-me and Orange here just gave each other syphilis on the ride over.

671
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,040
And now we're spreading it.

672
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Well, you know what they say, syphilis hurts, but once you get over it, you get over it.

673
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Um, it's like chicken pox.

675
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Yeah.

676
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Juice machine.

677
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Come on.

678
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Uh-oh.

679
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Whoa, that angry monkey's got all the fruit.

680
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
What's he hogging it for?

681
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Pretty soon there's gonna be syphilis shots.

682
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
It's gonna-it's gonna end it all, basically.

683
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
We-we can't let him have them on this island now.

684
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
How do I get this fruit to them?

685
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
I-I was walking down the street yesterday.

686
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,040
I was walking back from Chipotle and there was this homeless guy, you know, just hobbling along with, you know, dirt in his skin and stuff like that.

687
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,040
And my instantly, he didn't even, like, look, man, I don't even know if he registered me the entire time, but he just, you know, was walking behind me.

688
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,040
My instant first thought was, if we get into a fight, I can't let his blood touch mine.

689
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,040
I have to be able to cover myself in such a way that he will never bleed onto me.

690
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Yeah.

691
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Because then I will get syphilis.

692
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,040
That's the, um, that's the, uh, like, that's the real challenge in the fight.

693
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,040
The actual, like, fight itself doesn't matter, but as long as I-as I don't get the blood on me, then I'll be fine.

694
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Yeah.

695
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Yeah.

696
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I mean, I mean, the fight itself poses no challenge.

697
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Uh-huh.

698
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Uh, due to his, you know, due to his condition.

699
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
His-his stature.

700
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Uh, do you know what I'm supposed to do here?

701
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,040
No, I've never played a game before in my life.

702
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Oh, here we go.

703
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
It's completely alien to me.

704
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
This has to be.

705
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
And frankly, it's scary.

706
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Look.

707
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
I moved the fruit.

708
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Look at the animation.

709
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
I moved the fruit.

710
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I just need more power.

711
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Oh.

712
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Jesus.

713
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I fell through a thing.

714
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Clever.

715
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Oh, look, some rope.

716
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Uh, wow.

717
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,040
That'll prove useful in the coming battle.

718
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,040
At least we got the fruit up there and the rope in the process.

719
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,040
At least we accomplished the thing that we were doing.

720
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,040
And I'll make a little quip about it and hit this lever.

721
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
Uh, I need to find a second.

722
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Who's the writer of this game?

723
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Where can I find the sta-

724
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
I wrote this game.

725
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
I wrote this game.

726
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Oh.

727
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Well, you did a really great job.

728
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Yeah.

729
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I know I did.

730
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
You fucking idiot.

731
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Uh.

732
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Let's see.

733
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm-I'm on the pop-tropica wiki right now.

734
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Pop-tropicon, a convention.

735
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Oh.

736
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Ooh.

737
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,040
That's almost- that sounds almost as tempting as Nickelodeon Slime Fest.

738
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Wait.

739
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Excuse me?

740
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Okay, it's not-

741
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Sorry, I'm at the Slime Corp.

742
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Slime Fest.

743
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Okay.

744
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,040
It is not a convention in real life.

745
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,040
It's a convention within pop-tropica itself.

746
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Oh.

747
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:47,040
It's-it's-it's-it's an island that is based on conventions.

748
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Uh, I-

749
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,040
So it's a level that you play inside of a convention center.

750
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Is-is the-have any items for me?

751
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Uh, yeah.

752
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,040
I've got, uh-fucking let me click the fucking-what?

753
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Oh, it's based off the fucking San Diego Convention Center.

754
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
So it has, like-

755
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Oh my god.

756
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
What is happening?

757
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Okay, I'm looking at images of it.

758
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
It's a nightmare.

759
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Why would you make a video game level off of a convention center?

760
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,040
With the-like has-has like a-like a comic-con going on in it.

761
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Uh, hey, are you seeing what's going on here?

762
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,040
No, I've long since looked away from the screen.

763
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Okay, well, like, I can't click on anything.

764
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Uh, did you save your progress?

765
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
No.

766
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Okay.

767
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Yeah, I'm just getting-I don't think it's showing up on OBS,

768
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,040
but I'm just getting a little, like, spinning thing that seems to mean that it's loading,

769
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
and there's nothing-

770
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
That's fine.

771
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
We'll-we'll just restart.

772
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Don't worry.

773
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
It's fine.

774
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Oh my god.

775
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Ugh.

776
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
No, don't worry.

777
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
This is a-this is a blessing disguise.

778
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Now that we-now we can avoid the, uh, the tutorial.

779
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
This is the way things were meant to be.

780
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
So you've been staying in the house a lot lately?

781
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
I have.

782
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
That's true.

783
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
Yeah, that's true.

784
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Is there any particular reason, or is it just-

785
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,040
I mean, what's really out there for me?

786
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Fame.

787
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Wealth.

788
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Women.

789
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Ugh.

790
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Return.

791
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Hmm.

792
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Where?

793
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
No.

794
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
No.

795
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Did you click on it?

796
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Yeah, of course I did.

797
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Why?

798
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Why would you do this?

799
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
I don't know.

800
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
This is the game.

801
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
You had-you had the chance-

802
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
This is-this is the game!

803
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
This is the game!

804
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Are we-are we here to play pop-are we here to play pop-tropica or not?

805
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Fuck's sake.

806
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Oh god.

807
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,040
At least I would be having fun seeing the game be played that I remember.

808
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
This is the game you remember.

809
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
This is the game.

810
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
No, it's not!

811
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
It's a betrayal!

812
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
You're a perversion and a betrayal.

813
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,040
I know you are, but what am I?

814
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,520
Well, I guess I'm an Arctic guy now.

815
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,320
I'm a betrayal, I'm a perversion.

816
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,840
That's what your mom said to me when we had sex last night.

817
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,280
Oh no, not that.

818
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,560
It's not- not again.

819
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,280
I still need that cloth.

820
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,480
What?

821
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:38,240
Oh, sick. Alright, now we're making progress. Now we're cooking the gas.

822
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:47,080
I have basically spent the entire like past four years inside my room. Almost like never

823
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,680
venturing outside. I've become a hikikomori.

824
00:35:51,680 --> 00:36:04,200
I went out to get the, okay, so I went out to Kelly's roast beef last night to get some,

825
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,760
you know, I went out with, you know, Crack and my friend John.

826
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,880
Is that roast beef, the same derogatory slur roast beef that is spoken by many incels on

827
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
the internet?

828
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
Yeah, it is, in fact.

829
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Okay.

830
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,400
Just wanted to make sure.

831
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,920
But so I went out and I got, you know, I wanted a keto, right? So I said, no bun, just put

832
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
it on lettuce.

833
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,320
And the resulting sandwich was literally just a small pile of sliced roast beef with a slice

834
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,240
of American cheese on top of it.

835
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,720
And it cost me $12.

836
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Was it worth it?

837
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
No.

838
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,280
What a retarded question.

839
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Playing machine balloons, drink, me, bucket.

840
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Okay.

841
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:57,160
Uh, when the animation skills on display here, man, I'll bet you and I could get jobs working

842
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,560
at PopTrapica.

843
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,440
And what jobs they would be.

844
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,200
These were the brains behind the offer.

845
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,320
I'm going to die from playing this game.

846
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
I hate it.

847
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,440
Our career path would be so rock solid.

848
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
Yeah.

849
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,760
We would be, um, on, it's over.

850
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
I think it's over.

851
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
I think it's done.

852
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,320
Just getting, I think getting the blimp and then leave forever.

853
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,040
Well, I'm trying.

854
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
You click on it.

855
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,520
You click on it, my man.

856
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,720
Oh, there we go.

857
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,200
Where's Crusoe?

858
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,040
He's going to be here to send us off, probably taking a nap somewhere to get back in the

859
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
race.

860
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,520
He's actually, he's actually just going to the bathroom and he wants to get off this

861
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,880
just God forsaken island without him.

862
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Yeah.

863
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Yeah.

864
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,280
Like he needed us.

865
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Okay.

866
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,400
What's like, this is still happening.

867
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,880
We're going to win somehow.

868
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Yeah.

869
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,080
We just spent like two hours on my island in like canonical time.

870
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:13,160
Uh, yeah, this is how you go faster in a hot air balloon as you drop ballast.

871
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,520
Yeah.

872
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,560
Just, just fucking let us just fly up in the sky.

873
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,760
Oh my God, you're so close, dude.

874
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Oh no.

875
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Oh no.

876
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Oh my God.

877
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Jesus Christ.

878
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,160
This is nothing to break your fall.

879
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,360
Somehow the balloon descended faster than I fell.

880
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Okay.

881
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,760
You're going to have to beat the shit out of him.

882
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Yeah.

883
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,040
I'm going to have to take a gun.

884
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,560
I'm just going to have to start shooting.

885
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Is no one else seeing this?

886
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,320
Is no one else able to report to the authorities?

887
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,800
He's dropping metal on you.

888
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,400
Oh, it's awesome.

889
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,640
Ben as a physicist, is this probable?

890
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,840
Is this how, is this, is this, is this likely?

891
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,400
I can't.

892
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,520
I can't, you know, I think when we started a hot air balloon race, I think this was

893
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,560
the inevitable result.

894
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,560
I think this was, this was unavoidable.

895
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,080
All right, here we go.

896
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,120
You're out of tricks to red Baroness.

897
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,600
Now that we've dropped all our ballast, our hot air balloon is as fast as your, as your,

898
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,440
as your tri-

899
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Procolic plane.

900
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Tri-plane, yeah.

901
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,720
Oh look.

902
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Here he was.

903
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,440
He escaped from his, he escaped from his monkey hell like he always wanted.

904
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Well-

905
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Go slave, free us from losing.

906
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
We're cat, yeah, I want to drop you.

907
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,440
I want to, I want to drop you out of my plane.

908
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Can, can you, what, what are you doing?

909
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
What can happen right now?

910
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I don't know.

911
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
It's telling me to drop weight.

912
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
And I'm clicking on everything.

913
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
Oh, am I carrying anything heavy?

914
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,440
I'm, I'm, I'm, is it the helicopter?

915
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,440
Could it be the helicopter?

916
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Dude, dude, dramatic irony, dramatic irony!

917
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Oh, I almost hit her.

918
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Oh, he's gonna, he's gonna make the ultimate sacrifice?

919
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
The pathos on display here is overwhelming.

920
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Now, to win this race.

921
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
What?

922
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,440
I just, what the hell?

923
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
What?

924
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
From a little juice, okay.

925
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I, I can't, this is such a dangerous unregulated race.

926
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
I can't believe I'm 12 year old then.

927
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Looks like Crusoe is just, you know, he's just such a disaster.

928
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,440
He's just such an unmitigated, incompetent fool

929
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
that his mere presence in that plane ruined.

930
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,440
Oh, and we won despite being beached for like 18 days.

931
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Um, thanks.

932
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
It was a shortcut.

933
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
Yeah.

934
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Landing and not flying was a shortcut to the end of the race.

935
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Alright, you have to leave. You have to leave this place and be.

936
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,440
Congratulations on winning the race.

937
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
No, I did it.

938
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,440
No, look, I'm an esteemed member of society now.

939
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,440
You get one of those medallions whenever you complete like an island.

940
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Alright.

941
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Whoa, look at that slime girl on the left over there.

942
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Oh no.

943
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Look at that RFCK.

944
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Shit.

945
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Did you see on Twitter that I officially declared war on the phrase cute girls?

946
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,440
Uh, I, I did not see, I saw a response to that tweet.

947
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
I know the one you're, yeah, why?

948
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
I mean, actually I probably agree.

949
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,440
I'm probably in full agreement in what you're about to say.

950
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:55,440
It's, it's because the phrase cute girls is always accompanied with like slimy, disgusting people

951
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,440
who just want to, all they want to do is just draw, draw girls in different stages of undress,

952
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
fucking obnoxiously in forever.

953
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
I think it's obnoxious too.

954
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,440
When I see, like some people they're just like, I draw cute girls.

955
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
It's like you're a pervert.

956
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Yeah.

957
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Yeah.

958
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Um, which is fine, I guess.

959
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,440
If you want to go to jail.

960
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
Visit the map.

961
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
You got to visit the map.

962
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
How?

963
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
How do I do that?

964
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Click on the button that says visit the map.

965
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Oh, okay.

966
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Yeah, it works.

967
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,440
Oh, here we are.

968
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
Should I go home?

969
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
Oh my God.

970
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
No, should I go to next gen?

971
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
No, that's way too dangerous.

972
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Should I go to Lego City?

973
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
No, go, go to early PopTropica.

974
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
That's the first island.

975
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
I don't know where you just keep going until you see it.

976
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
PopTropica Worlds.

977
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
No.

978
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Time-tagled Mission Atlantis.

979
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
Frosted Flakes.

980
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Legendary Swords.

981
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Survival.

982
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
There's some crazy shit going.

983
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,440
They've added way more on's than I remember.

984
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Galactic Hot Dogs.

985
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Timmy Failure.

986
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,440
Go all the way to the end.

987
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
All right.

988
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
Skip all these.

989
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Vampires Cryptids.

990
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,440
That's pretty interesting.

991
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,440
You got some interesting choices here.

992
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Mocktropica.

993
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,440
Oh, is that SharkTooth Island right there?

994
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Is that...

995
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Yeah, SharkTooth.

996
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Oh, yeah.

997
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
Okay, you go.

998
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Is that where you want to go?

999
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,440
I just want to look at everything.

1001
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
Oh, Big Nate.

1002
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Oh, and Great Pump.

1003
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Oh, Wimpy Wonderland.

1004
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
Holy fucking shit.

1005
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Oh, my God.

1006
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,440
Okay, for the next episode,

1007
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
we have to get Monkey Island,

1008
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
so we can go and Wimpy Wonderland.

1009
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
Yeah, we can bring him to Wimpy.

1010
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
We got Wimpy.

1011
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
He's on the Wimpy board.

1012
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Okay, yeah.

1013
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
He's...

1014
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
All right.

1015
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
I'll have my people.

1016
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
I'll have my people talk to his people.

1017
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Yeah, yeah.

1018
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
SharkTooth.

1019
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
Only you can save it if it's...

1020
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,440
I guess I will play...

1021
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
this video game.

1022
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Oh, God.

1023
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
Oh, God, what have I done?

1024
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Oh, wow.

1025
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
The, um...

1026
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,440
God, the fucking aspect ratio keeps changing.

1027
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I hope it hasn't been like this for too long.

1028
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
This game's horrible, by the way.

1029
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
This game's...

1030
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
No!

1031
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
This is the worst sign.

1032
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
This is like...

1033
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,440
It's like, what if Neopets were even worse?

1034
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
What if...

1035
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
It's...

1036
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,440
What if Neopets were the worst game ever conceived by man?

1037
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,440
It's what if video games reached their natural evolutionary course,

1038
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,440
and they became the full thing they were meant to be from the very beginning.

1039
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,440
Good.

1040
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
Uh, SharkTooth.

1041
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
SharkTooth.

1042
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,440
It's what if video games became palatable.

1043
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
The aspect ratio just keeps changing.

1044
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
It just won't stop.

1045
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,440
It's probably because it was meant to fill the computer screen,

1046
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,440
but computer screens have changed aspect ratio,

1047
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,440
and they just didn't bother formatting it differently, I guess.

1048
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,440
It's meant to fill your life with pain.

1049
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Get a fart.

1050
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Yeah, yeah, a shark skin.

1051
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Shark fin.

1052
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
So, did I put it on or what?

1053
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,440
No, you can put it on if you'd like, though.

1054
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
Well, of course I would.

1055
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Oh, put on a smile.

1056
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Actually, no, keep your smile.

1057
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,440
It's very nice.

1058
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
Okay, well, you've ruined it.

1059
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,440
Too late.

1060
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
Looks like I can't take my hood off.

1061
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,440
Ever since you found that yeti, you've just had to keep it on.

1062
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,440
I just have to be an ice climber now.

1063
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
Look at that cafe.

1064
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Oh, this is what Hawaii was like in real life.

1065
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
Yeah.

1066
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Yeah, this is just what it was like.

1067
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
I'm pretty jealous.

1068
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Yeah, I get off the planet like,

1069
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
here's your committer of shark fin.

1070
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
Please put it on.

1071
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,440
What?

1072
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
Look at this.

1073
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
Yeah, what?

1074
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
What's the problem then?

1075
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
What is it now?

1076
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Nothing.

1077
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,440
Put it on the show.

1078
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
It's on, okay?

1079
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,440
Okay, okay.

1080
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,440
I'm going to the coconut cafe already.

1081
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
Fuck's sake.

1082
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,440
Oh, this puts me back in my little space.

1083
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
Roll over a player.

1084
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
A player?

1085
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
What?

1086
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Yeah, there's gonna be people who have to shoot in here.

1087
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,440
Well, normally there would be other players,

1088
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,440
but I think no one plays this game anymore.

1089
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,440
You think so?

1090
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
Well.

1091
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,440
Do you think that might be the case?

1092
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,440
I don't want to be the case.

1093
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
Yeah, I wonder if I can meet up with you in Pop Tropica.

1094
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,440
Yeah, hold on.

1095
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,440
Please.

1096
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Yeah, I'm gonna try that right now.

1097
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,440
We're gonna do some co-op right now.

1098
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,440
It's so lonely at the top.

1099
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Don't worry, I'm gonna come rescue you.

1100
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
PopTropica.com.

1101
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Get yourself to the coconut cafe.

1102
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Yeah, I'm gonna speed up the shoot.

1103
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,440
And let's engage in some gang violence.

1104
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,440
To celebrate the relaunch of Endless War.

1105
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,440
Hey, look at this slime coin.

1106
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
See?

1107
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Yeah.

1108
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
Oh, yeah, it basically is.

1109
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,440
Little slime coin there.

1110
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,440
Got a little slime coin.

1111
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
How old am I?

1112
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,440
Six.

1113
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,440
Half my age.

1114
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,440
My name is Silly Monster.

1115
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
I look like a pedophile.

1116
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,440
Hold on.

1117
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Well.

1118
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Costumerizer.

1119
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,440
I gotta be black.

1120
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
First of four months I have to be black.

1121
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,440
Yeah, because you're the opposite of me.

1122
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Yeah.

1123
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,440
We're like yin and yang.

1124
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Oh no, I took the shark off.

1125
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,440
All right, I actually prefer the hood.

1126
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
I don't want to be a Roman man.

1127
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
How did I get here?

1128
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
I should be on Time Twisted Island.

1129
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,440
Well, sorry.

1130
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,440
Sorry, buckaroo.

1131
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,440
All right, I'm coming for you.

1132
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
I'm coming for you, bub.

1133
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
This is the kind of wholesome RFCK

1134
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
that everyone strives for.

1135
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,440
This is the sort of RFCK that you can, like,

1136
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
download and, like, put on your phones

1137
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,440
so you can listen to it on your commute to work every day.

1138
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
Hey, how come, uh...

1139
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
I'm looking good.

1140
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,440
How come the...

1141
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
I forget.

1142
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
Oh, the music brand.

1143
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
How about the music? Where'd the music go?

1144
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
It was good for a minute there.

1145
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,440
I was listening.

1146
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
The intro had music.

1147
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,440
Well, it's an atmospheric, it's like a tone piece.

1148
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,440
Oh, look, Lego City again.

1149
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
All right, here, all right.

1150
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,440
Go to the Coconut Cafe.

1151
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,440
I'll meet you inside.

1152
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
Oh, my God.

1153
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
Okay.

1154
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
I'm waiting.

1155
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Oh, there you are.

1156
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,440
There you are.

1157
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
Hold on.

1158
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,440
Battle.

1159
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,440
Uh, balloons,

1160
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
Starlink,

1161
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
Paint Wars, Skydive.

1162
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,440
Wait, I thought we had to shoot each other.

1163
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,440
Yeah, I have to friend you.

1164
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,440
Uh, I'll have to make a username first.

1165
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Okay, well, it's a good thing my keyboard doesn't work.

1166
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,440
God, I'm looking good.

1167
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,440
All right, hold on.

1168
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
All right, well, my keyboard, literally,

1169
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
is not responding right now for some reason.

1170
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,440
Just in pop-shop, okay, it just won't work.

1171
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Why does it say that my name is Comical Fang

1172
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,440
when I clearly called myself Cop Killer?

1173
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,440
Well, it's usually the choice at the beginning of the game.

1174
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Oh, shit, I left.

1175
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
I can't do anything.

1176
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,440
My life is ruined.

1177
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,440
Why?

1178
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,440
Why don't you just play the game like I did?

1179
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
We can't see each other outside this room, by the way.

1180
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,440
Yeah, I figured.

1181
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,440
Okay, great.

1182
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,440
Can we shoot each other in here?

1183
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,440
I don't know how.

1184
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,440
Can I come to play at a chair battle?

1185
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,440
I just asked you a question.

1186
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Oh.

1187
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,440
What an illegal alien that is.

1188
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,440
Hey, kid, can you tell your parents

1189
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,440
to meet me at the corner of third and fifth?

1190
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,440
I don't have a ride.

1191
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Hey, kid, can I borrow 20 books?

1192
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
I spent all my money on Magic Gathering cards.

1193
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
I'm going to roll.

1194
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
All right, this sucks.

1195
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Yeah, we're going to speedrun this.

1196
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
We're going to see who gets to win the game first.

1197
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,440
It's probably going to be you.

1198
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
Yeah, that's why you have to try.

1199
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,440
Because I have to admit,

1200
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,440
I'm really not putting my best foot forward on this.

1201
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,440
Just go all the way around here.

1202
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,440
Wait, a shark museum.

1203
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,440
No, no, don't get distracted.

1204
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,440
We have a shark pool.

1205
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
There's a shark.

1206
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,440
We all know that sharks take showers, not baths.

1207
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Hold on.

1208
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
I want to steal this guy's outfit.

1209
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
Oh, I'm in the fucking side scrolling section

1210
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
that I used to play all the time as a baby.

1211
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,440
I can't even click on anything that he's wearing.

1212
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
Okay, fine.

1213
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Waste of time.

1214
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,440
Okay, go all the way to the right

1215
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,440
and go to the fucking shark ruins.

1216
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,440
That's how you know you're going to get into some mad shit

1217
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,440
when sharks build ruins.

1218
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Yeah, that's pretty...

1219
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,440
It's the ancient ruins, not the shark ruins.

1220
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,440
It's on Shark Island, though.

1221
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Well, alright.

1222
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,440
God, this Lego city is everywhere.

1223
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,440
Well, they need to get money somehow, Ben.

1224
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Well, I don't think it's working.

1225
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,440
I had a page from Hammerhead's journal,

1226
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
but the wind blew it onto the roof.

1227
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,440
Oh, look, a coconut.

1228
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,440
Alright, it's going to stop playing now.

1229
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,440
Yeah, I'm jealous.

1230
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Man, this man sucks to be you.

1231
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,440
I wish I could do that.

1232
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,440
But this is what the people have demanded.

1233
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,440
This is what we had to do to fulfill our

1234
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,440
contractional obligations.

1235
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Jesus Christ.

1236
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,440
Alright, hey, look, I made it.

1237
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
Oh, look, I fell.

1238
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,440
Oh, look, I jumped.

1239
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,440
Oh, I...

1240
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
A bat hit me.

1241
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,440
I don't even have any health.

1242
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,440
I can't even die, can I?

1243
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,440
This is like Wario's Adventures in Wario Adventureland.

1244
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,440
Yeah, that's almost exactly what the name is.

1245
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,440
Here we go, here we go.

1246
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,440
I made it.

1247
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,440
Now, you meet an indigenous native.

1248
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,440
Hello, do you have syphilis?

1249
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,440
Would you like some?

1250
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
Would you like some syphilis, please?

1251
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
There's a study journal in the Shark Museum,

1252
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,440
but the translation key is missing.

1253
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,440
Oh, my God.

1254
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,440
Why is this guy over here?

1255
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,440
How did he get over here?

1256
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
How can I get through that door?

1257
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,440
I'll have to decide for the code.

1258
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
What are you doing?

1259
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,440
I've been studying those hieroglyphics by the door.

1260
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
Oh, wow.

1261
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Here, here, go to the door.

1262
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
I'll get the walkthrough open.

1263
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,440
Ben, don't pretend and act like

1264
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,440
you're above this.

1265
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,440
Where's the door?

1266
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,440
It's to the left.

1267
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,440
Alright.

1268
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,440
Here we go.

1269
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,440
Alright, let me figure out how to do this.

1270
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,440
Are these Japanese?

1271
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
No, they're not Japanese.

1272
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,440
Some of them look a little like Japanese.

1273
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,440
No, not all non-English characters are Japanese.

1274
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,440
I'm just saying, this one right here in the middle

1275
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,440
looks pretty much like Japanese.

1276
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,440
I'm just going to brute force it.

1277
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,440
It's fine.

1278
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,440
Okay, okay, okay.

1279
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
No, no, no, don't worry.

1280
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Okay, okay, I got it.

1281
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,440
Alright, listen to me, listen to me.

1282
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,440
There's only like three possible combinations.

1283
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,440
No, no, okay, I got it.

1284
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,440
Okay, so the two things that like,

1285
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,440
like two V's on top of one another, do that.

1286
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
Yeah.

1287
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,440
Alright, then you're going to want to do

1288
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,440
the fucking thing that looks like a Japanese letter.

1289
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,440
It's like two boxes with like a dash through it.

1290
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
Yeah, that, yeah, yeah.

1291
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,440
Then you want to do the box that has like a,

1292
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,440
like a corner, a bottom right corner below the box.

1293
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,440
Yeah, that.

1294
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,440
And then the last one is like the, god damn it.

1295
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
No, okay, okay, then you want to do the swirly,

1296
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,440
the swirly, the little swirly.

1297
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,440
Hey, I did it.

1298
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,440
You did it.

1299
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,440
How did you know?

1300
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,440
Oh, call it a beginner's law.

1301
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,440
Call it a beginner's, I will.

1302
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,440
Oh my God.

1303
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
Call it instinct, man.

1304
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
Call it instinct.

1305
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,440
Call it team instinct.

1306
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
Hmm, hashtag.

1307
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,440
Whoa, a nasty creepy crawly.

1308
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,440
I can't believe you're a disgusting team mystic.

1309
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Ew, gross.

1310
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
I don't like that.

1311
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

1312
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,440
I'm thinking about mystics too.

1313
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,440
No one told me this game was rated M for mature

1314
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,440
for having creepy crawlies.

1315
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,440
Oh, that is a really disgusting display.

1316
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,440
Yeah.

1317
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,440
I miss the music, honestly.

1318
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,440
I kind of was enjoying myself when there was music.

1319
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,440
And how it's just a silent period piece.

1320
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
Yeah.

1321
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
What's the word?

1322
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,440
A relic.

1323
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
Yeah.

1324
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Like a weird mausoleum of video games.

1325
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Imagine if you raid someone's grave

1326
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,440
and then this game starts playing.

1327
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,440
No.

1328
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,440
I'm going to have this, I'm going to be buried

1329
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,440
in a little electric, a little power cell computer

1330
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,440
that just plays pop-tropic.

1331
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Imagine you're a down-trap man.

1332
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,440
You're a popper and you just need whatever money you can

1333
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,440
to survive so you resort to raiding people's graves

1334
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,440
and then you raid someone's tomb

1335
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,440
and then as soon as you do you hear a voice from behind

1336
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,440
and you turn around to a Lego figure

1337
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,440
and he says, hey, can you help me find the mammoth?

1338
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,440
Don't be, I found that mammoth though.

1339
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,440
I found that mammoth real good.

1340
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,440
Do you think there's a, Jesus Christ, Ben.

1341
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,440
What?

1342
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
What is your problem?

1343
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,440
Why are you yawning?

1344
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
And there's no problem.

1345
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Why would there be a problem, you idiot?

1346
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
It's not like someone's got an attitude.

1347
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,440
No.

1348
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
That's what I don't appreciate.

1349
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,440
I have a great attitude.

1350
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,440
I have, my attitude is that of a winner.

1351
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,440
That of a winner, Munchy.

1352
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,440
Hey, wait, what did the Batman give you?

1353
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,440
I don't know, did he give me something?

1354
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,440
I'm sure you must be something in that room, right?

1355
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Says who?

1356
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,440
I talked to him, I asked him all three things.

1357
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
You got it all done.

1358
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,440
Look at the, okay, look at the banner on the side there.

1359
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,440
The fucking banner ad for smallfoot.

1360
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,440
The fucking most blight on American civilization

1361
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,440
that's ever happened.

1362
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,440
Yeah, I imagine that John Cena probably voices smallfoot.

1363
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
Yeah, probably.

1364
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,440
He's voicing all the kid's characters nowadays.

1365
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
Yeah, he's that boy.

1366
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,440
He's SpongeBob.

1367
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,440
He's SpongeBob.

1368
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,440
Now he beat up Tom Kenny in WWE.

1369
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
And now he's SpongeBob.

1370
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,440
He's the world-famous Lego City Manus.

1371
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Here we go.

1372
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,440
Costumizer.

1373
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,440
It's time to become, look at this.

1374
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,440
Pure purple.

1375
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Oh, reminds you of someone?

1376
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,440
And the cop killer.

1377
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,440
There we go.

1378
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,440
Look at your ghastly white skin.

1379
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,440
Your fucking ghoulish sway palms.

1380
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,440
So I got the old bone.

1381
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,440
I assume that's good.

1382
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,440
Now to bed.

1383
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,440
Man, I didn't think this is what my day was going to be like.

1384
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,440
I didn't think-

1385
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,440
What did you think your day was going to be like?

1386
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,440
I woke up.

1387
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:28,440
I didn't think I was going to be having a great time with my best friend, Munchy.

1388
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:36,440
But boy, how I was wrong.

1389
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Have you ever played a good game on the show?

1390
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
Yeah, Frog Fractions 2.

1391
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,440
And one.

1392
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,440
No.

1393
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,440
Heck, it sucks.

1394
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,440
No, Frog Fractions 2 was awesome.

1395
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,440
Okay, Frog Fraction 1 is good.

1396
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:54,440
Frog Fraction 1 is really great, and Frog Fraction 2 carries on its legacy almost flawlessly.

1397
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,440
Disgusting.

1398
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,440
Can I-

1399
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,440
Oh, fuck.

1400
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,440
Let's turn this into the sad RFCK.

1401
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,440
We've had episodes ranging from being happy to being like, you know, reflective.

1402
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,440
Yeah.

1403
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,440
We've had moments of anger.

1404
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,440
We haven't had like a sad RFCK.

1405
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,440
Have we not?

1406
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,440
Aren't they all kind of?

1407
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,440
No.

1408
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,440
When you get right down to it.

1409
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
Not in a meta way, yeah.

1410
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Okay, so we're turning subtext into pure text here.

1411
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,440
Yeah.

1412
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,440
Yeah, yeah.

1413
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,440
I can't think of a better game to do it with.

1414
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:39,440
Where were you when your first family member died?

1415
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,440
I was crashing a plane to the Twin Towers.

1416
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,440
The family member was screaming.

1417
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,440
Oh, I can't.

1418
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,440
I can't stay awake.

1419
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,440
What, Bind?

1420
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,440
Okay, you knew we were recording today.

1421
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,440
I don't know why you woke 10 minutes ago.

1422
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,440
Yeah, and I got a good night's sleep and everything, you know.

1423
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,440
Did you have another soiree?

1424
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,440
Or seance, I'm sorry.

1425
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,440
No, I did not have another seance.

1426
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,440
I just woke up and didn't want to.

1427
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,440
I was just like, why can't I just sleep forever?

1428
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,440
Can you imagine a seance soiree?

1429
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,440
The double?

1430
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,440
I think, you know, our seance was kind of, it did kind of double as a soiree to be perfectly,

1431
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,440
to be perfectly frank.

1432
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,440
You know, okay, you know, it's a follow up to the hashtag follow up on last episode.

1433
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,440
The main reason I want to become a politician is that I can get invited to spirit cooking parties.

1434
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,440
Like, I can dine and dash on some corpses with my big age here.

1435
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,440
My big Hillary.

1436
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,440
The big age.

1437
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,440
You know about spirit cooking, Ben?

1438
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,440
No, I don't know about spirit cooking.

1439
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,440
Spirit cooking is what the elite, the elite of the country do.

1440
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,440
Whenever they get bored, they just bring up some corpses and cook them like a pot roast.

1441
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,440
And then they dip some spoons in and they get a mouthful of the dead stew.

1442
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,440
And it's spirit cooking because there's a spirit inside the stew and the cooking.

1443
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,440
Uh, how do you know there's a spirit?

1444
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,440
Where's your proof?

1445
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,440
Oh, I died.

1446
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,440
Wait, no, I just fell.

1447
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,440
Uh, okay.

1448
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,440
Uh, so I have a big, whoa, I got crushed by a coconut.

1449
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,440
I have a bone.

1450
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,440
I have an old bone.

1451
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,440
Uh, I guess I'll just keep going to the right because that medicine man said,

1452
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,440
See, he said he doesn't look like a native islander.

1453
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,440
I thought if I just, oh my God, Lego city.

1454
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,440
I thought if I just stole his mask that that would work, but it didn't.

1455
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,440
Yeah, it's like between every room is an ad for Lego city.

1456
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,440
Uh, grass skirts.

1457
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,440
I'll bet maybe this will make me into a native islander.

1458
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,440
Yep, you'll look like a native islander.

1459
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,440
Here we go.

1460
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,440
Come on.

1461
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:08,440
You can tell by the limp if they're a native, a native American.

1462
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,440
A native Sharktuthian.

1463
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,440
Oh, appropriate that culture then.

1464
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,440
Put that on.

1465
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,440
Yeah, I have to.

1466
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,440
Otherwise the medicine man won't do unspecified services for me.

1467
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,440
Old bone.

1468
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,440
It's an old bone from the temple ruins.

1469
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,440
Uh, okay.

1470
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,440
Here we go.

1471
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,440
Here we go.

1472
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,440
Yeah, I got a grass skirt.

1473
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,440
I'm a native.

1474
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,440
I have appropriated their culture and now I'm going to go appropriate this medicine man's goods and or services.

1475
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:46,440
Where were you the first time that the news came on your television that they had refound the first man myth?

1476
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,440
Um, I think I was...

1477
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,440
I was at my dad's family members funeral.

1478
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,440
I think I was under the table.

1479
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:00,440
I think I was under my coffee table, sipping Hennessy.

1480
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Trying to make the pain go away.

1481
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:12,440
Yeah, smoking a cigar like a Hollywood fat cat exec.

1482
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,440
You know, just living my best life.

1483
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,440
This Lego city man myth is really haunting us.

1484
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,440
Oh, yeah, over on the left there.

1485
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
Yeah.

1486
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
I'll spare the viewer.

1487
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,440
I'll spare the viewer.

1488
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,440
But like every single time your fresh as a prey page, a new ad shows up and it's almost always the Lego city man.

1489
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
Yeah, there it is, right there.

1490
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,440
Well, there were chocolate frosted flakes.

1491
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,440
Um, there's Lego city mammoth.

1492
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,440
There's that Yeti movie.

1493
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,440
The Yeti movie makes me so fucking upset.

1494
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,440
It's so awful.

1495
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,440
There's no...

1496
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,440
Why are people making movies that obviously will be bad?

1497
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Why would you green light something that will like there's no way can be good?

1498
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,440
And then why would you do it?

1499
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,440
And there's Lego Ninjago.

1500
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,440
Wait, why did I why did he come in here?

1501
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,440
I didn't want this isn't what I was supposed to go.

1502
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,440
Yeah.

1503
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,440
And then I get we got Lego.

1504
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,440
We can watch the dragon cam to see what the ninjas are up to now and Lego Ninjago.

1505
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,440
God, I almost want to click it.

1506
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,440
I'm almost curious to see what the dragon cam will show.

1507
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,440
I'm gonna get my Lego premium account ready so I can so I can log in.

1508
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,440
Fucking clicking it.

1509
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,440
I'm clicking it.

1510
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,440
I want to see the dragon cam.

1511
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,440
Oh, Ben, you know what game we got to play?

1512
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,440
We got to play Lego digital designer 3D.

1513
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,440
What?

1514
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:41,440
Lego digital designer 3D is a game where you can you can like like you have access to every single Lego block ever made and you can design your own Lego sets like in a computer setting and then you can actually like ship it to yourself.

1515
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,440
You can like order what you have created online and you can have it sent to your house.

1516
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,440
You can get like whatever Lego parts you want.

1517
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,440
You can build in real life.

1518
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,440
Do they do they?

1519
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,440
Okay, so you build it online and then they send you the pieces for it.

1520
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,440
Do they send it to you?

1521
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,440
Yeah.

1522
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,440
Or do you have to build it yourself?

1523
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,440
Yeah, you have to build it yourself.

1524
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,440
Okay.

1525
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
That's pretty interesting.

1526
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,440
That's pretty cool actually.

1527
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,440
It's on the Lego.

1528
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,440
It's on the Lego set.

1529
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,440
Do kids still play with Legos?

1530
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,440
Do kids still like Legos?

1531
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,440
Has Minecraft not like completely?

1532
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
Yeah, yeah.

1533
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,440
I mean I play with Legos.

1534
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,440
I mean I did assume that it's still a thing.

1535
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,440
I mean Lego still has a website.

1536
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,440
It's definitely still a thing.

1537
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,440
I wonder if it shrunk.

1538
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,440
I wonder if it shrunk due to Minecraft.

1539
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,440
The Lego movie just came out a couple years ago.

1540
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,440
That was really big.

1541
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,440
Yeah, and I guess Minecraft was huge even then.

1542
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,440
Yeah.

1543
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,440
I mean Lego's definitely still around, right?

1544
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,440
It's definitely not gone.

1545
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,440
What about Lincoln Logs?

1546
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,440
Now those I think are probably bigger than ever.

1547
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,440
Go-Bots.

1548
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,440
People still love Go-Bots.

1549
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,440
Michael Bay re-invigorated Go-Bots.

1550
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,440
You don't know Go-Bots?

1551
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,440
No.

1552
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,440
What are those?

1553
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,440
Well back in the day, sometimes your grandma would buy you, well not me,

1554
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,440
because all my grandparents are dead.

1555
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,440
And they always were.

1556
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,440
Back in the day, someone would buy you.

1557
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,440
You would be a kid who really liked Transformers,

1558
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,440
and someone would buy you what they believed was a Transformers toy,

1559
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,440
but was in fact a Go-Bot.

1560
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:22,440
I think Go-Bots were owned by Duplo.

1561
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,440
Duplo is such a betrayal.

1562
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Duplo is a perversion.

1563
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
Yeah, well Go-Bots were pretty much the same.

1564
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,440
It was just knock-off Transformers.

1565
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,440
But they kind of flooded the market for a while there.

1566
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,440
You'd see them everywhere.

1567
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,440
It was like Asylum Films.

1568
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,440
It was like the Asylum Films version of Transformers.

1569
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,440
Oh Jesus Christ, these are awful.

1570
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,440
Oh, you looked them up?

1571
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,440
Yeah.

1572
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,440
I think I had at least one Go-Bot.

1573
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,440
Oh, no.

1574
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
Yeah.

1575
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
Yeah.

1576
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,440
Well, that's life.

1577
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,440
Their designs are just so, like they...

1578
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,440
I think I had one.

1579
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,440
They really did not intend them to ever move,

1580
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,440
or be shown from any other angle than the forward-facing angle.

1581
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,440
Yeah, they're not designed for functionality.

1582
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:18,440
They're not designed to express emotions other than anxiety and pain.

1583
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,440
Let me see, let me see.

1584
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,440
Oh, here, I'm going to link it to you right now.

1585
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,440
Yeah, please.

1586
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,440
We should not have the password open.

1587
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,440
Let's look on Discord.

1588
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,440
We'll see.

1589
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,440
Yeah.

1590
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,440
Oh my God, that's even worse.

1591
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
That's even worse than I remember.

1592
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,440
You would think that maybe in toy form they would look bad,

1593
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,440
but animated they would look okay.

1594
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,440
No, they actually look even worse in the animated medium.

1595
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,440
Why?

1596
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,440
They actually look more awkward.

1597
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,440
This is so bad.

1598
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,440
They actually look more awkward in that illustration

1599
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,440
than they do in toy form.

1600
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,440
Look at how everything about this is so wrong.

1601
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,440
Like, it's the most...

1602
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,440
Yeah, it's so awkward.

1603
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,440
I remember, I remember that grey guy and his weird skull head.

1604
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,440
I remember these things in real life.

1605
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,440
Look at this.

1606
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,440
It feels weird.

1607
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,440
What, what...

1608
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,440
Hold on, okay.

1609
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,440
Oh, look at this fucking garbage meta...

1610
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,440
Garbage Megatron.

1611
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,440
Yeah.

1612
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,440
God, these are really bad.

1613
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,440
These are really fucking bad.

1614
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,440
I can't believe these happen.

1615
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,440
This is worse than I thought.

1616
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,440
This is worse than I remembered.

1617
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,440
These are like old, you're like ancient.

1618
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,440
You're an ancient man, Ben.

1619
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,440
I am pretty fucking ancient.

1620
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,440
These might have been old even when I found them,

1621
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,440
or had them.

1622
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,440
Maybe.

1623
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,440
Well, no, because they were coming out like contemporary

1624
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,440
with the Transformers,

1625
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,440
and the Transformers were like on the air,

1626
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,440
like when I was a kid.

1627
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,440
They might have been around for a little while.

1628
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,440
Might have come at the tail end of the Transformers.

1629
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,440
Jesus.

1630
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,440
These fucking things are the opposite of quality.

1631
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,440
They just, like, they just clearly...

1632
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,440
It's so bizarre that they were made in such a way

1633
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,440
that it obviously indicates that it wasn't meant to move

1634
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,440
or bend or be able to be posed or played with

1635
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,440
or to be seen from any angle at all.

1636
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,440
They just look so flat and horrible,

1637
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,440
and yet they had a cartoon and a toy series.

1638
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,440
All of which don't fix their designs.

1639
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,440
Did they have a cartoon?

1640
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,440
Was there... I'm not sure there actually was

1641
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,440
any, like, Go-Bots cartoon.

1642
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,440
They might have just pretended there was.

1643
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,440
I keep looking at animated screenshots.

1644
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,440
Oh.

1645
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,440
This could just... Oh, God.

1646
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,440
Yeah, look at the back.

1647
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,440
Oh, God.

1648
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,440
This could just be a commercial.

1649
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,440
I mean, I would be very disappointed

1650
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,440
if this were an actual show.

1651
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,440
No, there's a Go-Bots intro.

1652
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,440
No. You want to watch it?

1653
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,440
It's my Hannah Barbera, yeah.

1654
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,440
Yeah, here.

1655
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,440
I mix potions and put them in coconuts.

1656
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,440
All right. Tell me when you're ready.

1657
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,440
I...

1658
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,440
We'll do it on three.

1659
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,440
It's coming in 1984.

1660
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,440
Uh...

1661
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,440
I'm going to open this in YouTube.

1662
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,440
Oh, wait.

1663
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,440
There it is.

1664
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,440
Okay.

1665
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,440
On count of three.

1666
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1667
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,440
I got to get... I got to center it.

1668
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
Yeah, that's good enough.

1669
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,440
Okay.

1670
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,440
One, two, three.

1671
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,440
Oh, the prestigious Hannah Barbera.

1672
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,440
Woo me.

1673
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,440
Ooh.

1674
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,440
Looking good.

1675
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,440
Oh, they're looking great.

1676
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:12,440
They're looking perfect.

1677
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,440
Oh.

1678
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,440
Oh, that one's from the helicopter or something.

1679
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,440
It doesn't turn into a helicopter.

1680
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,440
It just has propellers on its back.

1681
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,440
Oh, my God.

1682
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,440
That one with, like, the weird, like, my little toaster.

1683
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,440
No, my little toaster.

1684
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,440
That weird, brave little toaster face.

1685
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,440
Oh, the transformations are not right.

1686
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,440
No.

1687
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,440
They aren't right.

1688
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,440
Challenge of the Go-Bots.

1689
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,440
All right.

1690
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,440
It's so funny how that is literally just transformers.

1691
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,440
Like, they transform everything too.

1692
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,440
Yeah.

1693
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1694
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,440
No, it's literally just the asylum films version of Transformers.

1695
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,440
Imagine going to sleep tonight knowing that you work on the Go-Bots.

1696
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:59,440
Even though it's like an episode director or just like an unnamed Korean animator.

1697
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,440
Man, tough day at the office today.

1698
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,440
Tough day at the office animating Go-Bots.

1699
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,440
And, you know, tomorrow I'm going to do it all over again.

1700
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:13,440
Jesus Christ.

1701
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,440
What is this?

1702
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,440
Okay.

1703
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,440
Deep in the temple there is a wall carving that will show you what you need to bring.

1704
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,440
Did I not already go and do that?

1705
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,440
Well, obviously you don't know what you need to bring.

1706
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,440
Is it the bone?

1707
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,440
I mean, I might be the bone in other things.

1708
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,440
Let me see what you got to get.

1709
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,440
I found the wall carving and it just let me into that room and I found the bone.

1710
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:43,440
You need to get carbonated coconut milk from the coconut cafe.

1711
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,440
What?

1712
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,440
Okay.

1713
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,440
All right.

1714
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,440
Sure, whatever.

1715
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:53,440
And then you need to go deeper inside the temple to get the key ingredient in the temple.

1716
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,440
That's what it's called, the key ingredient?

1717
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,440
Yeah.

1718
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,440
Okay.

1719
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:04,440
I really miss the music in which there is music in every level.

1720
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,440
The music was actually pretty good.

1721
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,440
Just turn on the Go-Bots intro and you'll be fine.

1722
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,440
Just play that on loop.

1723
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,440
You know, why not?

1724
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,440
You need to listen and repeat.

1725
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:21,440
Why not?

1726
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,440
Nice recommended videos, by the way.

1727
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,440
Nice worthless from Brave Little Toaster.

1728
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,440
Oh, maybe.

1729
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:29,440
I guess YouTube.

1730
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:37,440
YouTube must think that that guy bears a weird resemblance to my little toaster.

1731
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,440
Okay.

1732
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:43,440
Can you imagine a Lorne Fouse directed TV series about Brave Little Toaster?

1733
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,440
I'm imagining it right now and I've already watched it.

1734
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:52,440
I'm pretty sure Brave Little Toaster already said everything it had to say and that's why in the sequel they go to Mars.

1735
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,440
Yeah.

1736
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,440
I've never seen the sequel.

1737
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,440
I have not either.

1738
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,440
Did you know there's a reference to Brave Little Toaster at California Adventure Disneyland?

1739
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,440
No.

1740
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,440
Yeah, in Cars Land.

1741
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,440
There's the car that went on the end.

1742
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:14,440
Yeah, there's the car that drove in the Indy 500 and he speaks and he says,

1743
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,440
the one that said I went on the Indy 500, you know that one.

1744
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:24,440
Yeah, that's true, but I wish they had the one that drove the text into the wedding.

1745
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,440
This is my favorite.

1746
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,440
Yeah, I wish they had Michael Jackson's first one.

1747
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,440
Wait, is it was one of them Michael Jackson's hearse?

1748
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,440
Yeah.

1749
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,440
No, yeah.

1750
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,440
Well, I mean, he is a hearse who sounds like Michael Jackson.

1751
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,440
Yeah.

1752
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,440
Oh, okay.

1753
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,440
Okay.

1754
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,440
Not the hearse that canonically.

1755
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,440
I'm pretty sure.

1756
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was before Michael Jackson died.

1757
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,440
It was pathetic.

1758
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:53,440
It was like they called it that Michael Jackson would die eventually.

1759
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,440
How the fuck do I get carbonated coconut water?

1760
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,440
He was talking to the guy outside.

1761
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,440
This is not rocket science.

1762
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,440
Jesus Christ.

1763
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,440
Yes, it is.

1764
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
PopTropic has the hardest game I've ever played.

1765
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,440
I already talked to this guy.

1766
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,440
Yeah.

1767
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,440
I talked to him harder.

1768
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
Oh, wow, it looks like you did it.

1769
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,440
I already talked to that guy.

1770
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,440
Why did I not already get it?

1771
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,440
Okay, fine.

1772
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,440
You just didn't ask Karthina.

1773
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,440
Sure.

1774
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,440
Oh, I feel bad.

1775
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,440
I feel ill.

1776
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:24,440
I feel hungry.

1777
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,440
No, that guy right there.

1778
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,440
That fucking statue Lego person is the scariest thing in this entire game or any game for

1779
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
that matter.

1780
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,440
He's a fucking nightmare.

1781
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,440
He's way taller than you for no reason.

1782
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,440
There was a Lego City ad on the last room and then I moved to the new room.

1783
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,440
But before I went to the new room, I had to get an advertised for Lego City.

1784
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,440
Why?

1785
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,440
Why?

1786
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,440
Okay, so.

1787
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,440
Why are they pushing the mammoth so hard?

1788
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,440
Yeah, yeah.

1789
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,440
All the way to the left and up.

1790
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,440
Left and up.

1791
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,440
Got it.

1792
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,440
Got it.

1793
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,440
Good thing these...

1794
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,440
These platforming challenges are just way too hard.

1795
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:08,440
Good thing this cop killer bat costume is going to help me be more aerodynamic.

1796
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:14,440
Thank God my family is all bad at me so I can't let them down anymore.

1797
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,440
Finally.

1798
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,440
All right.

1799
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,440
I'm free from their admiration and judgment.

1800
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,440
Deep in the temple.

1801
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,440
I'm looking for the key ingredient.

1802
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,440
Oh God.

1803
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,440
Just listening to...

1804
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,440
That's going to get you.

1805
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,440
Just listening to...

1806
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,440
Jesus Christ.

1807
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,440
I hate that thing.

1808
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,440
Just listening to GoBots on repeat.

1809
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,440
Here we go.

1810
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,440
Here we go.

1811
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,440
Here we go.

1812
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,440
This is it.

1813
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,440
GoBots.

1814
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,440
Oh.

1815
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,440
No, don't go down any of it.

1816
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,440
Too late.

1817
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,440
I went down.

1818
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,440
You ruined the progress.

1819
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,440
So that was not...

1820
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,440
Okay, so that...

1821
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,440
There's more to the left?

1822
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,440
I see.

1823
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,440
Yeah.

1824
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,440
I see.

1825
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,440
Here we go.

1826
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,440
Then I won't go down.

1827
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,440
I see.

1828
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,440
I thought that hole was like the end.

1829
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,440
No.

1830
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,440
Wait.

1831
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,440
Can I...

1832
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,440
Oh, I can't get out of here.

1833
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,440
It's too...

1834
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,440
All right.

1835
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,440
Okay.

1836
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,440
I got to knock her down the spike pit.

1837
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,440
Yeah.

1838
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,440
Who would have thought?

1839
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,440
Ew.

1840
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,440
Really not a fan of that buggo.

1841
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,440
Why is there a giant bug in this underground temple?

1842
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,440
I don't know, because this is his ecosystem.

1843
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,440
What does he feed upon?

1844
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,440
Spiders.

1845
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,440
There's spiderwebs too.

1846
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,440
Platformers.

1847
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,440
Yeah, he feeds...

1848
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,440
He eats platforms.

1849
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,440
Okay, okay.

1850
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:41,440
So now it's time to be very, very cautious and careful.

1851
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,440
And skilled.

1852
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,440
There we go.

1853
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,440
All right.

1854
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,440
Easy.

1855
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,440
Hashtag easy.

1856
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,440
We're making mad progress.

1857
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,440
We're going to get a medallion.

1858
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,440
We're making mad dash.

1859
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,440
Can we please get another ad, please?

1860
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,440
I forgot that I have to buy Lego product.

1861
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,440
I forgot about the Lego mammoth.

1862
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,440
I am going...

1863
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,440
Oh.

1864
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
Oh, the ingredients.

1865
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,440
The carving on the temple shows something that I couldn't read.

1866
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,440
Sick.

1867
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,440
I'm not going to mess with me.

1868
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,440
He should deliver you.

1869
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,440
Will he deliver me from evil?

1870
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,440
Yeah, he'll take you to the Promised Land.

1871
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,440
He'll take you to the land of milk and honey.

1872
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,440
He'll deliver you.

1873
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,440
That's not keto.

1874
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,440
Yeah, all the Jews are kind of like,

1875
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,440
God, that's not keto.

1876
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,440
Coconut milk?

1877
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,440
Sorry, man.

1878
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,440
It's not keto.

1879
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,440
Take us to the land of unsold cashews.

1880
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,440
Yes, please.

1881
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,440
The only thing I'll eat.

1882
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,440
Did I...

1883
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,440
Oh, I've got to climb this rope.

1884
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,440
I've got to climb this rope.

1885
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,440
Definitely do not want to go to Bugabay

1886
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,440
because, frankly, it sounds pretty racist.

1887
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,440
Oh, can you swim in the Bugabay?

1888
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,440
Hold on.

1889
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,440
After me and the medicine man conclude our business together.

1890
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,440
There's another typical white man walking up

1891
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,440
to the indigenous natives of an island

1892
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:19,440
and demanding, you know, potions and brews.

1893
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,440
Yeah, like, this is their potions.

1894
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,440
You know, I didn't...

1895
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,440
I didn't come down...

1896
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,440
He doesn't come down to where I work

1897
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,440
and slap the potion out of my mouth.

1898
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,440
So you brought everything.

1899
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,440
I'll put the potion into a coconut for you.

1900
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,440
Yes, please.

1901
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,440
Here's a little chant.

1902
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,440
This is Uga-Buga.

1903
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,440
Mmm, some nice bone and milk.

1904
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,440
Okay, so I did need the bone.

1905
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,440
This cocoa contains a thing.

1906
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,440
All right, cool.

1907
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,440
There's nothing else I can do for you.

1908
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,440
I'll miss what you need to do.

1909
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:05,440
I probably got to go to Bugabay.

1910
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,440
Problematic though, it is.

1911
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,440
Yeah.

1912
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,440
All right, all right.

1913
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,440
You got to like drain.

1914
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,440
You got to shoot the potion into the water.

1915
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,440
Do I have to drain the swamp?

1916
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:22,440
Yeah, if you'd please.

1917
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,440
I mean, someone...

1918
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,440
Please help.

1919
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,440
My son is stranded at sea, trapped by that monster shark.

1920
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:32,440
Woo lad!

1921
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,440
Are you her son?

1922
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:42,440
We're gonna have to buy some children there, no.

1923
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:48,440
What happened to the boats?

1924
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,440
Man, these go-bots sure are enticing.

1925
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,440
I want to buy some for my children.

1926
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,440
We're gonna have to buy some mammoths.

1927
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,440
We're gonna have to buy some go-bots.

1928
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,440
We're gonna have to buy some chocolate frosted flakes.

1929
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,440
We're gonna have to...

1930
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,440
Hey, did you see what I was seeing when we were looking at the Dragon Cam

1931
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,440
at the Lego Ninjago Dragon Cam?

1932
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,440
Were you seeing that shit?

1933
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,440
Oh, it was a live feed of a Lego Dragon.

1934
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,440
Whoa, really?

1935
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,440
Yeah, kinda.

1936
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,440
Wow.

1937
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,440
Yeah, then it was like flopping around

1938
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,440
and there was like a tank.

1939
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,440
I think there was a tank.

1940
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,440
And there was a dragon.

1941
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,440
Not with a boom and a rage like this.

1942
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:36,440
Do I know anything about Professor Hammerhead's journal?

1943
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,440
I sold it to an archeologist.

1944
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:45,440
Here we go.

1945
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,440
Oh, wow.

1946
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,440
A lot more potions than I thought that would be.

1947
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,440
These are just regular coconuts.

1948
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,440
Oh.

1949
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,440
Alright, well...

1950
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:09,440
I've calmed the wrath of Booga.

1951
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,440
Go right.

1952
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,440
Well, you did it. You won the video game.

1953
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,440
Wait, you're that lady's son?

1954
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:22,440
You're like an old man and she was like a young yuppie.

1955
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:26,440
Oh, there. That must be you.

1956
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,440
Does it mean I have to go back to...

1957
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,440
He's a fucking zoomer.

1958
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:34,440
Will you lead us back to the mainland?

1959
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,440
Oh, look, it's Wilson!

1960
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,440
Wilson!

1961
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:44,440
Wilson, I'm sorry! Wilson, I'm sorry!

1962
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,440
Remember?

1963
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,440
Remember Hamlet?

1964
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,440
Wilson, I'm sorry!

1965
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,440
Woo!

1966
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,440
Oh my god, game design.

1967
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,440
Yeah, that was game feel.

1968
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,440
Oh, I'm hungry.

1969
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,440
Watch your step. Don't step on a shark.

1970
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,440
I'm really hungry even though I ate salami.

1971
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,440
Even though I ate salami and took drugs.

1972
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,440
Mess will probably fill you up.

1973
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,440
Take this gold medallion! Woo!

1974
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,440
You won. You won, Shark Island.

1975
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,440
You won the island. Now you can go to the other one.

1976
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,440
I'm gonna fuck out of here.

1977
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,440
Alright, I think I get what PopTrop is all about.

1978
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,440
It's about fucking sluts. It's about taking names.

1979
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,440
Yeah, yeah. It's about banging that milk

1980
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:39,440
after I saved her son from that old rapist on the island.

1981
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,440
From the jaws of jaws.

1982
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,440
Hey, look, it says that Shark 2000 isn't quite complete.

1983
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,440
Should I complete it?

1984
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,440
Nah, fuck you.

1985
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,440
You got a recommendation for round two.

1986
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,440
Yeah, early PopTropica.

1987
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,440
Oh, there it is. Early PopTropica.

1988
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,440
This is the first time.

1989
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,440
Whoa, they're pixelated!

1990
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,440
Yeah, I know. It's almost like a video game.

1991
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,440
Dude, that's awesome.

1992
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,440
It's like the remake.

1993
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,440
It's like we're going from the original Binding of Isaac

1994
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,440
to the remake of Binding of Isaac.

1995
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,440
Where they pretended to be pixel art.

1996
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,440
They made fake pixel art to make it look as though

1997
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,440
they had integrity.

1998
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,440
Yeah, why is the remake of Binding of Isaac so terrible?

1999
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,440
I... yeah, I don't like it at all.

2000
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,440
I think it's... I mean, it's got more features

2001
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,440
and the features are good, but art-wise,

2002
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,440
I hate how it looks. I think it looked better before.

2003
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,440
I feel an unpopular opinion on that.

2004
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,440
No, I completely agree. It looks like...

2005
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,440
Oh, Khaled's Frosted Flakes!

2006
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,440
Oh, my God. You know what really bothers me about it?

2007
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Is that like, okay, yeah, all the art is pixel,

2008
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,440
but it still moves like a flash game.

2009
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,440
And it just feels weird. It doesn't move like...

2010
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,440
Like, you can tell the pixels...

2011
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,440
You can tell the pixels are like a fake affectation

2012
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:00,440
that they made to make it look like a video game

2013
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,440
instead of just looking like itself.

2014
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,440
Yeah, why would they disregard the original art style?

2015
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,440
For what purpose?

2016
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,440
I think... honestly, I think they did it for Mass Market Appeal

2017
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,440
because they thought people like retro games,

2018
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,440
people like pixels.

2019
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,440
I do like pixels, but I hate being lied to.

2020
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,440
And that's what those pixels are doing. They're lying to me.

2021
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,440
It's not even real pixel art,

2022
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,440
so everything just has like a dark black outline?

2023
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:27,440
Yeah.

2024
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,440
It's not trying all.

2025
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,440
Yeah. It's ugly.

2026
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,440
It's ugly and stupid.

2027
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,440
And, uh...

2028
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,440
I don't know why they did that.

2029
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,440
I don't know why they couldn't have just added more features.

2030
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,440
Well, you know what? They had to remake it.

2031
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,440
They had to pay someone to remake it

2032
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,440
so that they could sell it again

2033
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,440
instead of just selling like DLC.

2034
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,440
Because not everyone will buy a DLC,

2035
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,440
but everyone will buy a remake.

2036
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,440
I'm gonna kill myself.

2037
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,440
Yeah.

2038
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,440
The world would live in.

2039
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,440
Is this what you do every single day?

2040
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,440
Ben, you leave your house, you go to downtown Boston,

2041
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,440
you start jumping on clotheslines.

2042
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,440
Yeah, sorry.

2043
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,440
It's just a summer song through the air,

2044
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,440
you know, running up on people.

2045
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,440
Man, I gotta... Oh, I can go down to the sewers.

2046
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,440
That sounds like a good idea.

2047
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,440
Um, shit. It's probably too late now.

2048
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,440
Well, no.

2049
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,440
I was gonna call around to those comic shops

2050
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,440
and ask if my books sold.

2051
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,440
Someone tweeted at me a picture of themselves

2052
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,440
having bought one of my books.

2053
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,440
Ah, yeah. You haven't followed up with that?

2054
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,440
Uh, well, kinda.

2055
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,440
Uh, I went around

2056
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,440
and put books in a couple of stores

2057
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,440
and had a couple people tell me, like,

2058
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,440
come back later.

2059
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,440
And then I went around a second time

2060
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,440
to a couple more stores,

2061
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,440
put them in some more stores, had a couple stores

2062
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,440
be like, we don't really do that.

2063
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,440
And I was like, alright, that's fine.

2064
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,440
And then I went, I hit up, like, one or two

2065
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,440
of the first places that told me,

2066
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,440
like, that bought a couple more.

2067
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,440
So, yeah, I feel like the books actually

2068
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,440
are selling.

2069
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,440
What's the process?

2070
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,440
Do you just, like, walk into the store and say,

2071
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,440
hey, I've made a comic before,

2072
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,440
why don't you sell my comic instead?

2073
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,440
That's literally what you do.

2074
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,440
Really? Really?

2075
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,440
You just walk in and you say, hey,

2076
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,440
I made a book, do you want to sell it?

2077
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,440
Because some, you know, because

2078
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,440
book store is right, we're talking about old media, right?

2079
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,440
And these old media people,

2080
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,440
you know, they need

2081
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,440
something, they need something

2082
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,440
to compete with the internet. And that something

2083
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,440
is, like, the idea that they are, like,

2084
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,440
supporting local artists or, like, working in

2085
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,440
a junction with local artists. This guy is selling

2086
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,440
race.

2087
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,440
This guy is selling the abstract concept

2088
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,440
of race.

2089
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,440
Oh my god.

2090
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,440
Alright, I'm a little

2091
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,440
left ghastly pale now.

2092
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,440
Oh, no, you've ruined it.

2093
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,440
You have to go back. Yeah, should I?

2094
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,440
Yeah, that's what you look like in real life.

2095
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,440
It's funny how this guy does not have any of these

2096
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,440
pigments. He's above it.

2097
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,440
This guy's got jaundice or whatever.

2098
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,440
But yeah, you just walk into a store,

2099
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,440
and not every store will do it. It depends

2100
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,440
on the place. But if a place is interested

2101
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,440
in, in, hey kids,

2102
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,440
hey kids, this is advertising!

2103
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,440
Wait, what?

2104
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,440
Is that what it says? Yeah, look!

2105
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,440
Right next to me, it says, hey kids,

2106
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,440
this is advertising.

2107
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,440
I...

2108
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,440
I don't know what to make

2109
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,440
of this.

2110
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,440
Like, it already says advertisement

2111
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,440
underneath frosted flakes.

2112
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,440
This is advertising.

2113
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,440
Frosted flakes of corn. I feel like the devs

2114
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,440
put that in there because they felt bad

2115
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,440
about selling the ad space

2116
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,440
and they wanted to undermine it in any way

2117
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,440
they popularly could.

2118
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,440
Yeah, I can.

2119
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,440
What's like, oh now that I know it's an advertisement,

2120
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,440
now I'm, now I'm gonna buy it.

2121
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,440
Now, now, now I'm really convinced.

2122
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,440
I know, I think it's the other way.

2123
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,440
I think they want it to be like, guys,

2124
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,440
just don't look at this. Just ignore this.

2125
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,440
It's fine, don't worry about it.

2126
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,440
It's just advertising, don't worry, don't worry.

2127
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,440
Yeah.

2128
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,440
Anyway, yeah, you walk in.

2129
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,440
I walk in with my Sonic Boom backpack

2130
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,440
with a box of comics in it

2131
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,440
and I say...

2132
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,440
Oh, so you bring the comic with you?

2133
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,440
Yeah, yeah. Cause you know,

2134
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,440
all the places they've just been like,

2135
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,440
yeah, they just take it and put it

2136
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,440
right on the shelf, like right out of my bag.

2137
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,440
Really?

2138
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,440
Yeah.

2139
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,440
What the fuck?

2140
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,440
They pay you for each thing that you give them, right?

2141
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,440
Well, okay, some of them...

2142
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,440
Actually, I think only one place...

2143
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,440
Wait, why is the pet...

2144
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,440
Wait, okay, hold on.

2145
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,440
Why in this big game is the pet...

2146
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,440
Why is the pet right here?

2147
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,440
Oh, the Pieta?

2148
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,440
Oh, the Pieta.

2149
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,440
Um, and the thinker.

2150
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,440
Well, because... and Disco...

2151
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,440
Discobolis.

2152
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,440
I thought that was a joke name for a second,

2153
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,440
but then I realized, no, it's what it's actually called

2154
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,440
Discobolis.

2155
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,440
This is not pop art.

2156
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,440
This is classical art. I don't know why this is called

2157
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,440
the pop art museum. No, no, it's just pop

2158
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,440
Chopika.

2159
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,440
Idiot.

2160
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,440
Um...

2161
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,440
Wait, I wanted to do...

2162
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,440
finish my thought before.

2163
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,440
Uh, something about...

2164
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,440
They pay you for each book you sell.

2165
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,440
Only one place just like

2166
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,440
handed me some money in exchange for some books.

2167
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,440
The others were like, just give us

2168
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,440
some books. We will take your name down

2169
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,440
and like, we will like

2170
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,440
give you... we will like, split the profit.

2171
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,440
We will like, split the cost of the sales

2172
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,440
from you after we sell them.

2173
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,440
Uh, so, yeah.

2174
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,440
It makes like...

2175
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,440
Yeah, it makes like no money, by the way.

2176
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,440
It makes... they took like... each place would take

2177
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,440
like, three to... like,

2178
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,440
three or four copies and they sell for like,

2179
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,440
six bucks a piece.

2180
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,440
Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, it's exposure.

2181
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,440
I guess it is exposure.

2182
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,440
To the like,

2183
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,440
yeah.

2184
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,440
I feel like that's somewhat real exposure.

2185
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,440
I mean, if you're going to a comic book shop,

2186
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,440
you care somewhat about

2187
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,440
comics in any way.

2188
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,440
Yeah, I feel like this is like,

2189
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,440
a more hardcore audience.

2190
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,440
We'll see it here.

2191
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,440
These people are legit.

2192
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,440
Assuming anyone actually cares.

2193
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,440
Assuming the people that

2194
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,440
freak with these places are not just like,

2195
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,440
cape readers, you know?

2196
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,440
They might be.

2197
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,440
Uh, anyway, there's a couple of places

2198
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,440
that I have not checked back in to see if any

2199
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,440
of my shit has sold. It might have.

2200
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,440
And there's also, there's one more store

2201
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,440
in Boston that I have not

2202
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,440
hit up yet to see if they'll stock my shit.

2203
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,440
I've hit up like, all the other ones

2204
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,440
that exist.

2205
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,440
Do you only try things that you think

2206
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,440
have like, a decent chance?

2207
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,440
Or do you try...

2208
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,440
Uh...

2209
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,440
I've tried a couple of like, long shots.

2210
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,440
I walked into like, a book slash

2211
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,440
game store.

2212
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,440
They did not...

2213
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,440
They were not interested because the guy

2214
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,440
who owned the place was like, I pretty much only do

2215
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,440
sell sci-fi shit.

2216
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,440
I was like, alright, fair enough.

2217
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,440
Yeah.

2218
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,440
Mostly I do...

2219
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,440
I mean, mostly it's

2220
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,440
comic shops. And almost every comic shop

2221
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,440
has been like, yeah, we sell indie shit.

2222
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,440
Only two have been like,

2223
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,440
one was like, we don't sell indie shit

2224
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,440
unless we are like, unless

2225
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,440
like, we are like, publishing

2226
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,440
with the artist. Like, the artist

2227
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,440
is like, an affiliate of ours that

2228
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,440
is publishing through us. And I was like,

2229
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,440
okay, well, I'm not interested in doing that.

2230
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,440
So good luck.

2231
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,440
And then the other, another one was like,

2232
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,440
kind of an out of the way place. And he was like,

2233
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,440
we don't really do indie shit. We like,

2234
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,440
our clientele only, only buys

2235
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,440
cape shit. And I was like, okay, cool.

2236
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,440
Thanks for telling me.

2237
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,440
I like to imagine that he says those terms too.

2238
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,440
Indie shit and cape shit.

2239
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,440
He pretty much did.

2240
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,440
You could tell that he was,

2241
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,440
you could tell he was a little abashed to admit that

2242
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,440
like, yeah, the people that come here basically

2243
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,440
only buy the cape stuff and they're not interested

2244
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,440
in anything that you've never,

2245
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,440
you've never heard of before. He seemed a little

2246
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,440
bit like, eh, yeah, it's

2247
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,440
unfortunately this is how it is.

2248
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,440
It's really funny. Yeah.

2249
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,440
I mean, I assume that this

2250
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,440
would not work. Have you tried

2251
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,440
Newberry Comics? Yeah, Newberry Comics

2252
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,440
is not, they're fully

2253
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,440
corporatized. They don't do

2254
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,440
walk-in deals.

2255
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,440
They don't do walk-in back alley shady dealings

2256
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,440
like I'm interested in. It's so

2257
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,440
crazy that you literally just walk in with a

2258
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,440
fucking box, a box of comics

2259
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,440
under your arms and you're hard in your sleeve

2260
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,440
and you just infect the people

2261
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,440
to sell your fucking comics and stuff.

2262
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,440
One, a place

2263
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,440
called, actually, you know what?

2264
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,440
I think at least

2265
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,440
one place explicitly told me like, tweet

2266
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,440
like tweet that your store

2267
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,440
that your book is in our store and we

2268
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,440
will retweet about

2269
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,440
your book. You scratch

2270
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,440
our back, we'll scratch yours. I have

2271
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,440
not done it, but I'm sure there's no time limit.

2272
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,440
I should probably do that.

2273
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,440
Definitely.

2274
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,440
Ben, this is like the coolest

2275
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,440
fucking thing that's ever happened to you. I'm surprised

2276
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,440
so nonchalant you're treating it. Well, it's

2277
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,440
not making me any money.

2278
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,440
Yeah, but you know

2279
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,440
it's a nice

2280
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,440
mental thing. Your book is in the store, dude.

2281
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,440
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

2282
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,440
And plus, I'm sure

2283
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,440
if you gave it more attention than

2284
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,440
literally dropping the books off, then forgetting

2285
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,440
about it for a half a year, that I'm sure you

2286
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,440
can break in more dough.

2287
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,440
I don't know, maybe.

2288
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,440
Look, if I call them up

2289
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,440
and the places are like, oh yeah, we're all sold

2290
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,440
out, like we want more, right?

2291
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,440
Then maybe

2292
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,440
I'll be like, hmm, maybe I can make a small

2293
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,440
side income off of this whole

2294
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,440
physical media business.

2295
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,440
But if it's anything less than

2296
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,440
that, even if they're just like, yeah,

2297
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,440
we'll take another three,

2298
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,440
then I'll be like,

2299
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,440
you know, that's just not

2300
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,440
there's just not very much

2301
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,440
in that, you know.

2302
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,440
There's just not enough,

2303
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,440
even if these stores are

2304
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,440
selling out of like the three copies

2305
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,440
that I'm leaving there, there's only

2306
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,440
like five of them. So that only

2307
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,440
Rick adds up to like, you know, 50 bucks

2308
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,440
of sales

2309
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,440
or less. But it's fun.

2310
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,440
It is fun. It is fun.

2311
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,440
But it also involves leaving my house, which is a hassle.

2312
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,440
Oh, they asked a nightmare.

2313
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,440
I wonder if there's any way to like

2314
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,440
get the stats.

2315
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,440
Like who has visited your

2316
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,440
website? Like who's

2317
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,440
gone to, you know,

2318
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,440
stcomics.com? Well, I

2319
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,440
Oh my god. Even down here

2320
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,440
in the dungeon, Tony, Tony

2321
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,440
the Tiger is even down here in the dungeon.

2322
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,440
He's so huge. He's made a house.

2323
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,440
Look at the interface between

2324
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,440
his top and bottom halves. Do you see

2325
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,440
like where his top and bottom

2326
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,440
or his top is moving and his bottom is still

2327
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,440
I won't. Where's he right

2328
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,440
in that bike down here in the sewers?

2329
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,440
Why is he even cast away

2330
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,440
into the book? Have a nice little white

2331
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,440
nice little white picket fence house.

2332
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,440
What? Why is he in the pop

2333
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,440
tropical catacombs? Why is he

2334
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,440
been banished here? What power does he wield

2335
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,440
so that the government officials were too wary

2336
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,440
of his influence and power?

2337
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,440
Yeah, he was banished.

2338
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,440
Who's afraid of the dark?

2339
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,440
Ooh, spooky.

2340
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,440
Hey kids, are you afraid

2341
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,440
of the dark? That's still on

2342
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,440
television, right? Says Ben

2343
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,440
Saint. That's not, no

2344
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,440
no. Look, I'm

2345
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,440
with it, okay? Whoa, an egg. Oh my god.

2346
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,440
Golden.

2347
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,440
This is the plot of James and the

2348
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,440
Beanstalk, by the way.

2349
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,440
Yeah, James and the Beanstalk.

2350
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,440
Got it. Yeah.

2351
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,440
James and the Giant Peachstalk.

2352
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
Yeah. Okay, wrong way.

2353
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,440
Someone left me a helpful hint.

2354
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,440
I gotta tell you, Munchy,

2355
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,440
this is important and you should take

2356
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,440
note. Is that my

2357
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,440
my balls hurt from

2358
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,440
sitting and playing this game and I don't know why.

2359
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,440
I feel like

2360
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,440
garbage. My balls have hurt

2361
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,440
like a lot lately and I don't know why. I think

2362
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,440
it's because I'm wearing new underwear

2363
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,440
and all I have is like really cheap

2364
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,440
so it's like a weird sort of like not

2365
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,440
really like, it's

2366
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,440
it's like, it feels like paper almost. It's

2367
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,440
like a weird paper, like really stiff material

2368
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,440
that isn't really like bend

2369
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,440
and you know, fold well and I really

2370
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,440
hate it. It really sucks. All I'm saying is

2371
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,440
I'm right there with you. It's making my guts

2372
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,440
hurt. This game is making my guts hurt

2373
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,440
by way of my balls and I don't

2374
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,440
like it. I don't appreciate it.

2375
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,440
This is, not only is this RFCK

2376
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,440
but this is also an audio show so you don't

2377
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,440
have to wear any pants if you don't want to.

2378
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,440
Though it might be a criminal, no it's

2379
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,440
not even a criminal offense anymore. I'm of age

2380
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,440
it doesn't even matter.

2381
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,440
You children aren't allowed to be naked.

2382
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,440
Yeah, no, yeah

2383
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,440
fucking uh, no

2384
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,440
no, no jury would

2385
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,440
persecute you. No jury would, no jury would

2386
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,440
convict me. Ooh, yeah. Here we go.

2387
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,440
Okay, I've got the giant

2388
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,440
big egg because

2389
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,440
Oh, is that, wait, wait, okay I can't

2390
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,440
tell because the quality is too bad. Is that the font?

2391
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,440
Is that Showcard Gothic? Wait

2392
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,440
No, no

2393
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,440
way. It's like

2394
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,440
that font right there. Yeah.

2395
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,440
No, well, no, wait, wait, he's spoken.

2396
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,440
I don't think it was

2397
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,440
Showcard Gothic.

2398
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,440
But I wasn't paying attention. Okay, Ben you

2399
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,440
have to enter the Kellogg's Frosted Flakes

2400
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,440
house. Oh god, no.

2401
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,440
I get, maybe I'll find another mammoth.

2402
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,440
Yeah, I hope so.

2403
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,440
Talk to Tony

2404
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,440
to ride the bike.

2405
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,440
We got cinnamon frosted flakes.

2406
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,440
Oh my god, that's some like bourgeoisie

2407
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,440
shit.

2408
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,440
Hey kids, this is advertising.

2409
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,440
Why?

2410
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,440
I like the hey kids in front of it.

2411
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,440
Oh, you have to

2412
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,440
avoid the frosted flakes.

2413
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,440
No, surely

2414
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,440
I'm supposed to get the frosted flakes.

2415
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,440
Surely.

2416
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,440
No, they're bad.

2417
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,440
The frosted flakes impede your

2418
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,440
progress.

2419
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,440
You can't hear it, but like the GoBots

2420
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,440
theme is playing

2421
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,440
it's action packed.

2422
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,440
At least my character is not

2423
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,440
on screen anymore

2424
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,440
for this minigame at least.

2425
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,440
I wonder how often new sponsors

2426
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,440
show up to like put minigames in

2427
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,440
Pop Tropica.

2428
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,440
Oh, this game

2429
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,440
actually has music.

2430
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,440
Uh

2431
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,440
Uh

2432
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,440
It's loading. Hey, you still there or what?

2433
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,440
Uh oh. Uh oh.

2434
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,440
My internet. Oh no.

2435
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,440
Oh god.

2436
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,440
Oh god, the recording.

2437
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,440
Oh

2438
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,440
Oh my god, my internet died.

2439
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,440
My internet died while recording an RFCK.

2440
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,440
Now what do I do?

2441
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,440
Alright, stand stand by

2442
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,440
stand by ladies and gentlemen.

2443
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,440
Uh

2444
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,440
Got it.

2445
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,440
I'm back.

2446
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,440
Hello?

2447
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,440
Hey, you there? Hey. Yeah, Tony

2448
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,440
is striking us down.

2449
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,440
Tony, okay, so my internet just died

2450
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,440
but it's back.

2451
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,440
Okay, well fortunately

2452
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,440
I saved right before

2453
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,440
that but obviously I have to

2454
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,440
obviously I have to do that again

2455
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,440
to complete Tony's bike challenge.

2456
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,440
Sure, sure.

2457
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,440
I mean, if Tony's running for breast cancer

2458
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,440
then you'd do too. Yeah, that's

2459
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,440
it's just what you do.

2460
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,440
You know how they should just must beat people

2461
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,440
to do those runs? They'll say if they don't run fast enough

2462
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,440
then breast cancer will catch up with them

2463
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,440
and they'll get it.

2464
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,440
Uh isn't that

2465
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,440
isn't that what happens? Trying to outrun

2466
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,440
outrun breast cancer is what they're called, I believe.

2467
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,440
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

2468
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,440
Oh god

2469
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,440
I've never

2470
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,440
never been less comfortable.

2471
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,440
Uh, here we go. Returning to my game.

2472
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,440
Uh, yeah.

2473
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,440
Did you ever

2474
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,440
post on like Tumblr or DeviantArt before

2475
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,440
it's also ugly or was that like the first time

2476
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,440
you ever posted your art online?

2477
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,440
Um

2478
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,440
Hmm

2479
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,440
I think

2480
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,440
I had a DeviantArt account

2481
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,440
that I would post like

2482
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,440
crappy pixel stuff that I

2483
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,440
made like

2484
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,440
when I was like 20

2485
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,440
when I was like

2486
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,440
still didn't know how to draw

2487
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,440
um

2488
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,440
Oh wait, I gotta complete the Tony

2489
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,440
challenge.

2490
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,440
Yeah, you gotta concentrate really fucking hard for it.

2491
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,440
Oh wait, oh no, it's Lego City. Okay, well fuck that.

2492
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,440
Fuck Lego City. Oh Jesus Christ.

2493
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,440
The mammoth give it and the mammoth

2494
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,440
take it away.

2495
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,440
It's Tony or Bust. It's Tony or Bust.

2496
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,440
Um

2497
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,440
So yeah, I

2498
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,440
drew some. Did you ever see those like

2499
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,440
uh, I posted them on Twitter.

2500
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,440
They were like old like

2501
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,440
sprite parts of

2502
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,440
people's characters on um

2503
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,440
D&D on TG

2504
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,440
on 4chan. Oh right, okay.

2505
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,440
So D&D the 4.

2506
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,440
D&D the 4chan room.

2507
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,440
Uh, yeah, I did that.

2508
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,440
Oh my god, every fucking room is an ad.

2509
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,440
Hey, this is advertising.

2510
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,440
This is advertising.

2511
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,440
That, oh my god.

2512
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,440
That room does not say hey, this is advertising kids.

2513
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,440
At least I don't think it does. Only, only

2514
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,440
I guess it's Tony himself speaking.

2515
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,440
Or maybe it's just because that one's kind of like white

2516
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,440
and on snow. I'm gonna look closely next time.

2517
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,440
Maybe the white text was just disappearing

2518
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,440
against the snow.

2519
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,440
This looks like

2520
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,440
an item. It is. Oh my god.

2521
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,440
A jetpack. Wait.

2522
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,440
I can

2523
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,440
I can take off.

2524
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,440
Oh my god. This menu. This menu

2525
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,440
is so annoying. I don't understand.

2526
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,440
It looks great.

2527
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,440
Oh my god.

2528
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,440
You're unstoppable. Dude, I can fly.

2529
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,440
I'm Jimmy Neutron.

2530
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,440
Got a blast.

2531
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:35,440
Got a fast, he says. Got a fast.

2532
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,440
Uh, ugh.

2533
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,440
I'm Jimmy Neutron's

2534
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,440
key though.

2535
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,440
I hear.

2536
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,440
Yeah, I feel, I feel like,

2537
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,440
he's like Sheen. Like, why are you

2538
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,440
eating so much carbs? Why are you

2539
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,440
taking so much protein? Sheen, why?

2540
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,440
Sheen, don't you know all those, all that gluten

2541
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,440
will cause inflammation?

2542
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,440
Carls of vegetarian.

2543
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,440
Never makes fun of them even Jimmy.

2544
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,440
Yeah, well.

2545
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,440
Oh, here we go. Here we go. I gotta climb this.

2546
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,440
No.

2547
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,440
No.

2548
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,440
There was nothing there.

2549
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,440
Maybe I need to go back down to the ground?

2550
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,440
Look at his awful feet.

2551
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,440
This reminds me of MapleStory.

2552
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,440
Is PopTropicaMapleStory?

2553
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,440
Yeah, but better.

2554
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,440
Yeah, and for free.

2555
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,440
Oh, is MapleStory paid?

2556
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,440
No.

2557
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,440
Uh, MapleStory 2 might be.

2558
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,440
But I don't think so.

2559
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,440
Isn't it just MapleStory 2? That's a perversion.

2560
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,440
There is a MapleStory 2.

2561
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,440
I don't know anything about it or what it's deal is.

2562
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,440
Have you ever played Yet Another Zombie Defense?

2563
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,440
No.

2564
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,440
Yet Another Zombie Defense

2565
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,440
is a great game that cost 99 cents.

2566
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,440
Uh, I found it one day

2567
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,440
in the Steam, deep, deep

2568
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,440
in the, in the annals of the Steam Marketplace.

2569
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,440
Mm-hmm.

2570
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,440
It's a fun game called Yet Another Zombie Defense.

2571
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,440
It was made with, like, some built-in,

2572
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,440
like, make-your-own-game software

2573
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,440
for Xbox.

2574
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,440
And it's really great.

2575
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,440
And I instantly bought it, and I sent to Ethan.

2576
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,440
And Ethan, upon playing it

2577
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,440
for 10 minutes, bought 10 copies

2578
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,440
and sent to everyone and his friends.

2579
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,440
And so whenever we had,

2580
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,440
we add a new friend into our friends list,

2581
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,440
we bad them Yet Another Zombie Defense,

2582
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,440
and we spray it like a curse.

2583
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,440
How come you never bought me Yet Another Zombie Defense?

2584
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,440
That's a good question.

2585
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,440
We have to be the next game that we play.

2586
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,440
Wait, wait, I missed it.

2587
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:43,440
This flag signals, um...

2588
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,440
This

2589
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,440
menu is so annoying.

2590
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,440
This flag signals ships to

2591
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,440
dock into early...

2592
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,440
Click, click, okay, okay, click on the card.

2593
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,440
Do you not know what you're supposed to do?

2594
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,440
No.

2595
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,440
Look, I've tried, look,

2596
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,440
you try to put your fucking mouse over it,

2597
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,440
and it, like, flies through the other way.

2598
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,440
Okay, fine. No, it's not. It's stupid.

2599
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,440
It's fucking easy.

2600
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,440
It's pussy shit.

2601
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,440
So, all you

2602
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,440
posted on that DeviantArt account was just

2603
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,440
pictures from a TG?

2604
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,440
Uh, yeah, mostly.

2605
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,440
I drew a picture of, like, some

2606
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,440
friends' characters from a campaign

2607
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,440
they were doing, you know, just some of that

2608
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,440
shit. So, I did have

2609
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,440
a Deviant on it.

2610
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,440
But...

2611
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,440
And then I think, yeah, I think the first

2612
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,440
time I was really posting online was it's all

2613
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,440
so ugly.

2614
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,440
I know, I know the steps that you took.

2615
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,440
I remember the original Insight and Incidents.

2616
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,440
Why did you want to be an artist again?

2617
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,440
Um,

2618
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,440
because I,

2619
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,440
because

2620
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,440
working as a physicist was boring

2621
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,440
and sucked.

2622
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,440
And, uh, I watched,

2623
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,440
and I read Bakuman and got inspired.

2624
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,440
And I also watched, uh,

2625
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,440
I watched a strip search and got inspired.

2626
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,440
And then

2627
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,440
you know, and then

2628
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,440
we decided

2629
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,440
we decided to do T-Bap just for fun

2630
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,440
and it took off. And I was like, yeah.

2631
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,440
Yeah.

2632
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,440
I can do it.

2633
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,440
I can be the champion.

2634
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,440
That was like, you started T-Bap in, like, what,

2635
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,440
2014, right?

2636
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,440
Yeah.

2637
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,440
That was four years ago, but didn't you start drawing earlier than that?

2638
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:25,440
Um,

2639
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,440
it's also ugly was before T-Bap.

2640
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,440
Yeah, it was slightly before T-Bap.

2641
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,440
But yeah. So you just started drawing like 2012?

2642
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,440
Well,

2643
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,440
uh,

2644
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
I would draw before that

2645
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,440
just not very often,

2646
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,440
you know? Like not, like,

2647
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,440
just every now and then. And it was for recreational use

2648
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,440
just for your own, just, you know, it's fun to draw.

2649
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,440
Yeah, yeah.

2650
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:49,440
Not, not like that regularly or anything.

2651
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,440
Um,

2652
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,440
I was kind of okay at it.

2653
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,440
And then,

2654
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,440
and then, you know,

2655
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,440
T-Bap started and suddenly I was drawing

2656
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,440
a shit ton of stuff for that.

2657
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,440
Um,

2658
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,440
Have you ever gone back

2659
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,440
and looked at the old T-Bap tumbler?

2660
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,440
At the tumbler?

2661
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,440
Yeah.

2662
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,440
Does it hold up?

2663
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,440
Hmm.

2664
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,440
I think there's no.

2665
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,440
Okay, the tumbler was meant,

2666
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,440
there was meant to be a lot more on the tumbler.

2667
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,440
It was, it was, the tumbler was going

2668
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,440
to be, like,

2669
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,440
basically any, like, story or lore

2670
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,440
idea we had for T-Bap

2671
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,440
that we couldn't fit into a video

2672
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,440
was going to go on the tumbler.

2673
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,440
Remember the joke where the fandom

2674
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,440
touches poison joke and he turns into doge?

2675
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,440
Yeah, that's where that is.

2676
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,440
Yeah.

2677
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,440
It's great. Nice. Yeah.

2678
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,440
Um, I mean, what would you expect

2679
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,440
to happen?

2680
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,440
Um, that's something I can imagine. Yeah.

2681
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,440
How's the

2682
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,440
T-Bap from Brad Kongo? Are you at Liberty Talk

2683
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,440
about that? Oh, I can talk

2684
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,440
about it. Um,

2685
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,440
so actually, Nate just,

2686
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,440
like, after the PCP

2687
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,440
the other day,

2688
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,440
Nate was like, Hey Ben, by the way,

2689
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,440
I am like, I'm

2690
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,440
going to send you like a

2691
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,440
somewhat edited video file soon

2692
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,440
and then it will be time

2693
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,440
for you to, like, draw some assets

2694
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,440
for it. And I was like,

2695
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,440
okay, cool.

2696
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,440
So he is, uh, I'm currently

2697
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,440
waiting on him to do

2698
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,440
something.

2699
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,440
I probably could draw some assets now,

2700
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,440
but like, we're not ready for them.

2701
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,440
Uh, we had a plan.

2702
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,440
There was a document explaining

2703
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,440
like, what

2704
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,440
shit we needed, but I forget

2705
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,440
what it said and I don't know where it is.

2706
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,440
So I'll just... It's gone forever.

2707
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,440
Nate's around somewhere.

2708
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,440
Uh, hey, what do we do?

2709
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,440
I have no clue. Do you want to get the walkthrough?

2710
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,440
Yeah. Okay.

2711
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,440
Don't worry, I'm coming to the rescue here.

2712
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,440
I just got to go to Pop Tropica Wiki.

2713
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,440
Do you have the glow stick? Yeah.

2714
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,440
Do you have the

2715
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,440
prized porker?

2716
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,440
No. Okay.

2717
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,440
Go to Main Street.

2718
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,440
Go down the main hall and into the pit.

2719
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,440
Are you in the pit? I guess that's what the

2720
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,440
supers are called.

2721
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,440
So go down to the pit.

2722
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,440
Okay, the dark pit, I guess?

2723
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,440
Yeah, sure. Uh, fuck me.

2724
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,440
Um, okay.

2725
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,440
And you got to go to the bottom until you get

2726
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,440
the prized porker. Okay.

2727
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,440
Yeah, I did not get the prized porker.

2728
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,440
A porker is like a racial

2729
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,440
thing.

2730
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,440
For fat people? Yeah.

2731
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,440
The most downtrodden and oppressed race

2732
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,440
there is.

2733
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,440
How much weight have you lost because of Keto?

2734
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,440
Uh, okay.

2735
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,440
When I was fasting, I had lost like 20 pounds.

2736
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,440
Predictably,

2737
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,440
I gained, okay, I gained a bunch back.

2738
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,440
Um,

2739
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,440
I gained maybe like 5 or 10 back because

2740
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,440
uh,

2741
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,440
well, you know, I,

2742
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,440
okay, so I bought a shit ton of

2743
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,440
sausage and I was eating lots of sausage.

2744
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,440
And I think I ended up eating too much

2745
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,440
protein.

2746
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,440
And if you eat too much protein, it's basically

2747
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,440
knocks you out of Keto.

2748
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,440
Out of Ketosis, you mean?

2749
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,440
Out of Ketosis, yeah.

2750
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,440
So I refilled my glycogen stores.

2751
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,440
So I was back up maybe 10 pounds.

2752
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,440
But I am,

2753
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,440
but I am slowly getting back into Keto

2754
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,440
because I stopped eating so much meat.

2755
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,440
I'm getting back into Keto.

2756
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,440
And so I think, I was peeing a lot yesterday.

2757
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,440
I'm pretty sure that was my water weight coming off

2758
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,440
as my glycogen was depleted.

2759
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,440
Uh, so I'm back down another 5.

2760
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,440
So I guess overall I've lost like 15 pounds.

2761
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,440
Total.

2762
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,440
Yeah.

2763
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,440
And what's the purpose of this?

2764
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,440
Is it just to get fitter?

2765
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,440
Or is there any other grander?

2766
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,440
It's just to get fitter and so I won't look

2767
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,440
like the fat piece of shit that I was

2768
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,440
at Radcon 3.

2769
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,440
Yeah.

2770
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,440
You commonly are remissed about how you look

2771
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,440
in Radcon 3.

2772
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,440
Yeah, because I look like I'm about to drop dead.

2773
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,440
Well, you know.

2774
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,440
The, um,

2775
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,440
no, like,

2776
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,440
I look at the Tales Get Strolled video

2777
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,440
and I just think, man, I thought I looked bad

2778
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:13,440
in the, I thought I looked bad in the

2779
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,440
Sonichu video, but like,

2780
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:17,440
I would do literally anything

2781
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,440
to look like that again.

2782
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,440
Instead of like this.

2783
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,440
Ben, I want, I want, I want you to promise

2784
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,440
me something, Ben. I want, I want, I want to

2785
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,440
make it like a, a swear right now.

2786
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,440
I want you to vow something right now

2787
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,440
on RCK, so that if you don't

2788
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,440
fulfill it, you'll get mocked and humiliated

2789
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,440
a thousand times in the content section

2790
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,440
of videos. Okay.

2791
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,440
You have to have a beard for Radcon 4.

2792
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

2793
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,440
I know. I never want to appear in public

2794
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,440
without a beard again. Okay.

2795
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,440
I just want to, I just want to lay that down.

2796
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,440
Guys, if Ben is plucked out

2797
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,440
beard hairs and does not have any beard

2798
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,440
at Radcon 4, humiliate him?

2799
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,440
I feel like I'm getting there. You know, like

2800
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,440
I keep pulling my beard out, but like, I make

2801
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,440
it further and further each time.

2802
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,440
I feel like it's, it's just around the core.

2803
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,440
The day, the day when I have an actual beard

2804
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,440
that doesn't, that I don't destroy

2805
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,440
is, is, is fat,

2806
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,440
is close at hand.

2807
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,440
To give you hope, by the way, Ben, I want to let you know

2808
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,440
that this was a universal feeling

2809
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,440
that literally everyone in the Brony fandom

2810
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,440
and in the PCP felt

2811
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,440
when you and Ben first revealed yourselves

2812
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,440
or, Nate, you're the same.

2813
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:23,440
Yeah. In the Q&A,

2814
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,440
everyone thought you were the most

2815
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,440
handsome Bronies that existed.

2816
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,440
Yeah. So if you can just return to your state

2817
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,440
which you have achieved prior

2818
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,440
in your life, then everything will be fine

2819
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,440
and you'll return to, to manhood.

2820
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,440
Yeah. I mean, that's

2821
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,440
pretty much how I feel.

2822
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,440
I'm just going to start wearing flannel again.

2823
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,440
Uh, well, I mean,

2824
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,440
yeah, now that I'm a little less fat

2825
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,440
and maybe if I become

2826
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,440
even a little less fat,

2827
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,440
maybe I can fit in, like, that, that

2828
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,440
shirt that I wore in the T-Bat Q&A

2829
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,440
is like my favorite shirt of all time

2830
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,440
and I've been too fat for it for like, a while.

2831
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,440
Uh, and so

2832
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:01,440
Keto is my ticket out of that.

2833
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,440
Personal hell.

2834
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,440
Dude, I've been on such a fucking

2835
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,440
on an F.A.

2836
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,440
killing spree, a fucking, a fucking

2837
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,440
fashion killing spree. I've been, I've been slaying

2838
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,440
a fascist killing spree.

2839
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,440
Yeah, yeah. Uh,

2840
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,440
God, side,

2841
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,440
side note, uh, I went, I went

2842
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,440
water jet, like, water skiing

2843
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,440
with, uh,

2844
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,440
Kazzie when she was over here

2845
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:27,440
in San Diego the entire time.

2846
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,440
I just would scream at the top of my lungs,

2847
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,440
I'd go bloodthirsty on these fascists and never

2848
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,440
go buy a boat.

2849
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,440
On these fascists?

2850
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,440
Yeah. Uh, hey, am I done here?

2851
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,440
No. Have I won the game yet?

2852
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,440
No, when you, when you get a medallion, that's

2853
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,440
when you'll do it. Uh, have you,

2854
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,440
have you, have you gone to the

2855
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,440
Pop Tropica Towers?

2856
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,440
What?

2857
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,440
Have you gone to the Pop Tropica Towers?

2858
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,440
No.

2859
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,440
Alright, hold on.

2860
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,440
Wait, okay, okay, I think it might be done, actually.

2861
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,440
Once you get the medallion, okay, go to

2862
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,440
early Pop Tropica and talk to the pilgrims.

2863
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,440
I, I, I, I, I gave

2864
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,440
the guys pig, I gave the guy the bucket.

2865
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,440
You didn't give someone a, a flag.

2866
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,440
I gave him a flag.

2867
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,440
Did you? Okay.

2868
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,440
Tell me your inventory.

2869
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,440
Uh, it was just my inventory.

2870
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,440
You haven't gotten your medallion yet, right?

2871
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,440
I don't think so.

2872
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,440
Wait, I, I mean, how

2873
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,440
would I know?

2874
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,440
I mean, did it say on screen that you got it?

2875
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,440
No, I don't think so.

2876
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:29,440
Okay, I have the glow stick for the sewers,

2877
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,440
and I have the jet pack.

2878
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,440
Okay, um, um,

2879
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,440
fuck.

2880
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,440
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2881
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,440
Sigma flag.

2882
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,440
Thanks for your help. Thanks for your help.

2883
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,440
Yeah, I, you know, I think you did do it.

2884
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,440
Right?

2885
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,440
Wait, oh no, here, here we go, here we go.

2886
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,440
This boat was not here before. Take this gold medallion

2887
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,440
and it's token of my appreciation.

2888
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,440
Hey!

2889
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,440
Alright, let's have it.

2890
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,440
Let's have it, friend.

2891
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,440
Click, progress.

2892
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,440
There we go. Oh my God.

2893
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,440
Delicious. Alright, alright.

2894
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,440
Uh, let's see what other islands there are.

2895
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:13,440
Let's see what other great fucking islands

2896
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,440
we can go to, and it will just be

2897
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,440
a fucking delight for everyone.

2898
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,440
Um, there, there's reality TV island.

2899
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,440
That one's good.

2900
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,440
A 24 carat island.

2901
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,440
There's cryptids island.

2902
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,440
If you want to get some cryptids going on.

2903
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,440
Yeah, sure.

2904
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,440
Why not?

2905
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:33,440
Why not cryptids, I guess.

2906
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,440
Oh, this is difficult. This is a level 3 difficulty.

2907
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,440
Oh my fucking God!

2908
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:39,440
I'm doing it.

2909
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,440
Oh, you're going, you're going to headlong in there.

2910
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,440
Jesus Christ.

2911
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,440
Yeah, I'm not afraid.

2912
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,440
I'm not afraid of what poptropica has in front of me.

2913
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,440
Oh my God, Ben.

2914
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,440
These islands have been like two paragraphs long.

2915
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,440
This one is like fucking like an entire

2916
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,440
novel written down.

2917
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,440
Oh, good.

2918
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:59,440
Oh, fuck!

2919
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,440
Muse is giving away a million bucks.

2920
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,440
Alright, just go until you get

2921
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:07,440
lost, and then we'll have to work our way

2922
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,440
back up from zero.

2923
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,440
Okay, someone called Muse is giving

2924
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,440
away money. I assume it's

2925
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,440
to find a cryptid.

2926
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,440
I assume that the goal here is you get

2927
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,440
money if you find a cryptid.

2928
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,440
Okay, great, great.

2929
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,440
Ever since going, like knowing

2930
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,440
I was going to go to Hawaii, I wanted to be able

2931
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,440
to get Hawaiian shirts.

2932
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:33,440
But I hate wearing

2933
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,440
button-up shirts, because

2934
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,440
I'm like way taller

2935
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,440
than, like, the people

2936
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,440
that they were designed for most of the time.

2937
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,440
And so, like, it's too short.

2938
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,440
I mean, it looks weird.

2939
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,440
So, I hate wearing them.

2940
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,440
But, I recently

2941
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,440
unlocked what was always fable

2942
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,440
for me, what was always, like, destined to be the case.

2943
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,440
I've engaged with

2944
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,440
full dad mode, and now I

2945
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,440
wear a wife beater and a

2946
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,440
Hawaiian shirt every single day of my life.

2947
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,440
And I've unlocked

2948
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,440
Uncle Status, and it's

2949
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,440
fucking delicious. It's incredible.

2950
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,440
I love it.

2951
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,440
Dude, for only 45 cents

2952
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,440
we can buy a paperback

2953
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,440
book

2954
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,440
called

2955
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,440
Cryptids Island Pop Tropica.

2956
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,440
What is this thing?

2957
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:23,440
Written by Max Braulier.

2958
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,440
Braulier.

2959
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,440
Based on, based on Pop

2960
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,440
Tropica's popular

2961
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:31,440
Cryptids Islands.

2962
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,440
This illustrated novel

2963
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,440
follows the story of an eccentric

2964
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,440
billionaire who is promising a big reward to whoever

2965
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,440
can prove the existence of cryptids.

2966
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,440
Legendary beasts like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.

2967
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:43,440
A quest is underway

2968
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,440
to track down the hidden creatures, and the competitors

2969
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,440
will stop at nothing to find them.

2970
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,440
45 cents.

2971
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,440
30...

2972
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:53,440
31 U... No, I'm not paying for shipping.

2973
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,440
Fuck that.

2974
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,440
Whoa!

2975
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:59,440
Dude, 31 U is from 45 cents.

01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,440

2978
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,440
This is $25 new.

2979
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,440
Jesus Christ.

2980
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,440
Max Braulier must be

2981
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,440
raking it in.

2982
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,440
Um...

2983
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,440
God. Goddamn.

2984
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,440
Oh, you know what else I got? I also got a fucking

2985
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:21,440
satchel.

2986
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:23,440
The satchel is the most FA thing

2987
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:25,440
that I can really imagine.

2988
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,440
It's functional.

2989
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,440
It's nice utility, and also it looks

2990
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,440
delectable. It looks delicious.

2991
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,440
A satchel, you say?

2992
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,440
Yeah, a satchel, I say.

2993
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,440
I'm gonna...

2994
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,440
Guys are all like, there's gotta be a way off this island

2995
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,440
when I literally just arrived on a

2996
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,440
hot air balloon.

2997
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,440
Like, yeah.

2998
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,440
There is.

2999
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:49,440
I could see you walking

3000
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,440
the satchel life.

3001
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,440
I used to have a satchel.

3002
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:55,440
It was made of like hemp and it had Buddha on it.

3003
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,440
Oh, shit.

3004
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,440
Hold on.

3005
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,440
Can I try out one of these kites?

3006
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,440
No problem.

3007
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,440
Just point out the one you'd like to try.

3008
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:07,440
I want the pony one.

3009
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,440
Of course.

3010
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,440
What does this entail?

3011
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,440
Fly a kite for free.

3012
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,440
Well, I have a kite now.

3013
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,440
For some reason.

3014
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,440
How nice.

3015
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,440
Thanks for returning the kite.

3016
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,440
You're welcome.

3017
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,440
Oh, we'll get the panda one.

3018
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,440
Wow, kitesurf, that would be a blast.

3019
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,440
This dialogue is so realistic.

3020
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,440
Ben, what is your problem?

3021
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:47,440
You yourself have chosen

3022
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,440
the three difficulty island.

3023
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,440
It's not about the difficulty.

3024
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,440
It's about

3025
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,440
what it entails

3026
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:57,440
doing.

3027
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:59,440
It's about what the moment to moment experience

3028
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,440
of Pop Tropica is.

3029
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,440
Do you understand why I like this game so much?

3030
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,440
As a kid, do you get it?

3031
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:07,440
Do you understand?

3032
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,440
I think the kite just like

3033
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,440
took me away

3034
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:13,440
for a second there.

3035
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,440
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3036
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,440
Yeah, yeah, no.

3037
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,440
It makes perfect sense.

3038
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,440
It's

3039
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,440
one of a kind experience.

3040
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:25,440
It's only a hinder bond for me to show this to you.

3041
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,440
Now you understand my life story

3042
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,440
even a little bit more.

3043
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,440
There we go.

3044
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,440
Is this

3045
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,440
the gender change that you've been waiting for?

3046
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:41,440
Wait, I don't want

3047
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,440
I heard that Muse never leaves this creepy mansion.

3048
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:47,440
I want to jack some of your swagger.

3049
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:49,440
But not all of it.

3050
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,440
No, the hit.

3051
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,440
That's good. Don't go too far.

3052
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,440
Jesus, you've ruined it.

3053
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:01,440
I still got the grass hurt.

3054
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,440
It's fine.

3055
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,440
Woo-hoo-hoo!

3056
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,440
Yeah!

3057
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:09,440
Riding the bike!

3058
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,440
Hey kids, it's advertising.

3059
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,440
When are we going to get

3060
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:15,440
Hey kids, it's advertising shirt.

3061
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,440
Dude, dude, we should...

3062
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:19,440
Okay, we got to put that

3063
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,440
on the Rowdyfuckers cop killers store.

3064
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,440
Oh, we have a store by the way.

3065
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,440
A shirt that just...

3066
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:27,440
Oh yeah, there's a store.

3067
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,440
There's gonna be a shirt that says

3068
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:31,440
Hey kid, this is advertising.

3069
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,440
Maybe with a picture of Tony the Tiger.

3070
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:35,440
I don't know.

3071
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:37,440
You know, it changed in a way.

3072
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,440
This is so weird that you have to

3073
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,440
avoid the Frosted Flakes.

3074
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,440
Avoid Frosted Flakes at all costs.

3075
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,440
Avoid sports balls

3076
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,440
and other

3077
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,440
active activities.

3078
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,440
Eventually it's going to be children

3079
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:53,440
that are laying down, strapped to the side of the road

3080
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,440
so that Tony can run over them.

3081
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,440
Oh my god.

3082
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:59,440
Oh no.

3083
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,440
You're going so fast.

3084
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,440
Oh dude, we got to play...

3085
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,440
Okay, we got to play Cartoon Network games too.

3086
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,440
Flash games.

3087
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,440
Dude, Adult Swim has like some good ass games

3088
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,440
on its website.

3089
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,440
Does it really? Oh, you got a fuck.

3090
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:15,440
Yeah, Adult Swim has a...

3091
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,440
It's got the Cream Wolf.

3092
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,440
Cream Wolf is fucking sick. You're a werewolf.

3093
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,440
You drive around... During the day you drive around

3094
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,440
giving kids ice cream

3095
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,440
and you sing your siren song

3096
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,440
and all the kids you gave ice cream are attracted to you

3097
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,440
and then you lure them

3098
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,440
into your ice cream truck and eat them.

3099
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,440
Oh, whoa. Yeah, it's

3100
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,440
very sick.

3101
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,440
Look how happy the Spy Child is

3102
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,440
to have Frosted Flakes.

3103
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,440
It's got Unicorn Robot Attack

3104
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,440
which is a classic, obviously.

3105
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,440
Yeah.

3106
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,440
Obviously.

3107
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,440
Alright, well I did it.

3108
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,440
Hey kids, this has been advertising.

3109
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,440
Thanks for joining us.

3110
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,440
That's the new YouTube series.

3111
02:03:55,440 --> 02:03:57,440
It's going to be the RFCK spin-off.

3112
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,440
Hey kids, this is advertising.

3113
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,440
That's going to be Nate's

3114
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,440
slime-core rip-off of the RFCK.

3115
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:05,440
Hey kids, it's advertising.

3116
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,440
Like, explanation point.

3117
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,440
I think this kite lets me

3118
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:11,440
jump ridiculously high.

3119
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,440
Show me.

3120
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,440
Wow, ridiculous.

3121
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:17,440
Oh, maybe not. Maybe that's just normal.

3122
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,440
Maybe that's just normal jump height.

3123
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,440
That feels floaty.

3124
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,440
This is a really story-driven island.

3125
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:27,440
Yeah.

3126
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:29,440
This is like a murder mystery.

3127
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,440
And I'm the murderer.

3128
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:37,440
Grrrr.

3129
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,440
Nightmare.

3130
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:43,440
I cannot wait until I'm in Boston again.

3131
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,440
It's been like half a year at least.

3132
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,440
Yeah, when I moved here

3133
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:49,440
you said that you've come out here like four times a year.

3134
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,440
And it's been like ten years since then.

3135
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:53,440
No, I do.

3136
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:55,440
And what I said has not been

3137
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,440
proven otherwise.

3138
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:59,440
But the fourth time was before

3139
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,440
you came.

3140
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,440
Did you see how high I jumped just there?

3141
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,440
No, I was paying attention.

3142
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:09,440
So I don't believe you.

3143
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:11,440
Let me try and recreate it.

3144
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,440
Oh my god. Yeah, okay.

3145
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,440
I think I went even higher before.

3146
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,440
Uh, here we go.

3147
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,440
Stay away from Grimlock.

3148
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:23,440
Yeah, I will. Thank you.

3149
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,440
Stay away from Gridlock.

3150
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,440
Traffic speed.

3151
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,440
Gridlock is my favorite energy drink.

3152
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,440
You can only buy it at Aldi.

3153
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,440
Oh my god.

3154
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:35,440
And it costs $0.99 for a can.

3155
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:37,440
And it's almost indistinguishable from Monster Ultra.

3156
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,440
Fucking?

3157
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,440
Oh my god. Okay.

3158
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:43,440
I took a vow to not drink soda again.

3159
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,440
So I'm on the no-soda life.

3160
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,440
And it's been going good for like a couple months now.

3161
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,440
But before I did that,

3162
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,440
I had bought a Monster Energy drink.

3163
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,440
And it's still sitting in my fridge

3164
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:55,440
tempting me every single time I open the fridge.

3165
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:57,440
And I have to say no.

3166
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:59,440
I just say no to it every single time.

3167
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:01,440
With the monster?

3168
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:03,440
Just throw it out.

3169
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,440
Don't keep it in your fridge.

3170
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,440
Yeah, you know, for some reason, that didn't

3171
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,440
dawn on me until just now.

3172
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:11,440
Yeah, okay.

3173
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,440
Hmm.

3174
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:15,440
Yes?

3175
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,440
I feel like...

3176
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,440
It feels like this kite

3177
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,440
should be able to like fly me over.

3178
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,440
But maybe not.

3179
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,440
Ben, do a different level, please.

3180
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,440
Why?

3181
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,440
What difference does it make?

3182
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,440
They're all garbage.

3183
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,440
This is gonna be awful.

3184
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,440
You're just gonna like get so sidetracked

3185
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,440
and you're gonna lose the story so hard.

3186
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:39,440
No, I get it.

3187
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:41,440
I'm already invested.

3188
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,440
There's an eccentric millionaire.

3189
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:45,440
And that's it. There's an eccentric millionaire.

3190
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,440
Yeah, yeah. Like yourself.

3191
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,440
Like, yeah.

3192
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,440
He's relatable.

3193
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,440
That's what we call a relatable character.

3194
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,440
I guess you wouldn't know about that.

3195
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:57,440
I wonder if this guy has

3196
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:59,440
child soldiers to do this bidding for him.

3197
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,440
I mean...

3198
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,440
What...

3199
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:05,440
There we go.

3200
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,440
What would be the point of being an eccentric millionaire

3201
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,440
Yeah.

3202
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,440
If someone's gotta defend his fortune...

3203
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,440
What do you think he's gonna do it himself?

3204
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,440
By the way, everyone,

3205
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,440
if you go to teespring.com

3206
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:19,440
slash stores

3207
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,440
slash info-war

3208
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:23,440
you will see designs

3209
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:25,440
for RFCKs in this war.

3210
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,440
We've got designs.

3211
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:29,440
We've got designs.

3212
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,440
We've got one or two.

3213
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,440
I wanna make more.

3214
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,440
I wanna make more.

3215
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,440
We've got a few.

3216
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,440
I've made some designs

3217
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,440
for a rowdy shirt and a killer shirt.

3218
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:43,440
Yes.

3219
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,440
An endless war poster.

3220
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:47,440
I wanna make some of my own designs

3221
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:49,440
for all these things.

3222
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,440
I've been saying that for a while.

3223
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,440
Have you ever drawn

3224
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:55,440
endless war before?

3225
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:57,440
Um...

3226
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:59,440
The only time I...

3227
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:01,440
The only time I drew

3228
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,440
endless war was for the

3229
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:05,440
icons on Crack's website.

3230
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:07,440
Oh, those are you?

3231
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,440
Yeah.

3232
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:11,440
They're not Crack.

3233
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:13,440
Yeah, well, you know,

3234
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:15,440
they're not great.

3235
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,440
I didn't spend that much time on them

3236
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,440
because they're like

3237
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,440
50 pixel wide

3238
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,440
buttons.

3239
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,440
Yeah, I think that's the only time

3240
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,440
that I have drawn them

3241
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:29,440
canonically.

3242
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,440
How have you not drawn

3243
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:33,440
the boy himself?

3244
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,440
I mean, I've taken

3245
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,440
your... I've taken the official

3246
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,440
background art

3247
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:41,440
and taken...

3248
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,440
sort of copy pasted him

3249
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,440
and modified him and turned him into

3250
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:47,440
icons.

3251
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:49,440
You gotta appreciate

3252
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,440
the jump.

3253
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,440
How the grace thing

3254
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,440
about the Roman Empire

3255
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:59,440
was...

3256
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,440
how to go from being a pauper

3257
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,440
to being, you know, a ruler, a government official,

3258
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,440
the social economic, you know,

3259
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:07,440
uh...

3260
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,440
What do you fucking call it?

3261
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:11,440
You could transcend the chains that your father

3262
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:13,440
would lay upon you

3263
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,440
by your, you know, poor birth

3264
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,440
and you could transcend the social plan.

3265
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,440
You could, you know, become

3266
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,440
a real rich person.

3267
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:23,440
That's what the background art

3268
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,440
of R.C.K. has done.

3269
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,440
It was just some fucking obelisk

3270
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,440
that I had just thrown a Y.V. face onto.

3271
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:31,440
And now he's the

3272
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,440
mascot and the main character of an entire video game.

3273
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,440
Yeah.

3274
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:37,440
Um...

3275
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:39,440
That was, like, a totally

3276
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,440
incidental detail.

3277
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,440
I think...

3278
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,440
Was it my idea

3279
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:47,440
that, like, that thing is

3280
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:49,440
the endless war?

3281
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,440
Was it my thought?

3282
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:53,440
I don't know. Yeah, probably.

3283
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:55,440
I remember I was like,

3284
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,440
okay, I will make

3285
02:09:57,440 --> 02:09:59,440
a game. I will learn Python

3286
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:01,440
and make a video game and the game will be called

3287
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,440
Endless War.

3288
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,440
Yeah. Okay.

3289
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,440
I approached you to make a discord server

3290
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,440
and immediately you were like, yes, we should.

3291
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,440
And then, and then, and then I

3292
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:13,440
set up a bot that would

3293
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:15,440
allow you to, like, join

3294
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:17,440
routies or join killers with, like, a fan,

3295
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,440
like, you know, like, endless forever.

3296
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:21,440
And then you're like, what if you,

3297
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:23,440
what if you were able to, like, program

3298
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:25,440
the bot, which was just, you know, some

3299
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:27,440
Google search, like, discord bot role

3300
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:29,440
assigner, to, like, be able

3301
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:31,440
to, like, have, like, currency

3302
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:33,440
and to shoot things. And I was like, yeah, but already.

3303
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:35,440
What if we could kill each other?

3304
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:37,440
Yeah. What if we could have gang violence

3305
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,440
simulated?

3306
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,440
Mm-hmm.

3307
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:43,440
Uh, and, and, and then...

3308
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,440
It was just, it was just

3309
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:47,440
going to be, originally it was just going

3310
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:49,440
to be, like, there would be

3311
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,440
nothing but, like, the slime command.

3312
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:53,440
You would have slime, and there would

3313
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,440
be a kill command, and that would be it.

3314
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:57,440
Um, but that was for cowards.

3315
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:59,440
Mm-hmm.

3316
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:01,440
Hey. How far we've come?

3317
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,440
This lady wants to push.

3318
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:05,440
But I don't know how to push it.

3319
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,440
Well, run into her, I guess.

3320
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,440
I, I did. Believe me.

3321
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:13,440
Well, as soon as I saw her, I ran

3322
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:15,440
directly for her in an attempt

3323
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,440
to smash.

3324
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:19,440
Uh, I have no clue. Try and, like,

3325
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,440
get, like, a fan item, I guess,

3326
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,440
and blow the wind towards her.

3327
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:25,440
This person wants me to cut

3328
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:27,440
their balloon loose.

3329
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:29,440
Uh, I don't have any

3330
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:31,440
means of doing that.

3331
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,440
I, oh, I've got Tony the Tiger.

3332
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:35,440
Oh, I've got Serial.

3333
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:37,440
Oh, perfect.

3334
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,440
Thank God. Search the world and bring

3335
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,440
your proof to Harold Muse to claim your

3336
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:43,440
award. Okay.

3337
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,440
We're in fortunate name, Harold Muse.

3338
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:47,440
Yeah. Doesn't he know that's already

3339
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,440
a Pokemon?

3340
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:51,440
Disgusting.

3341
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:53,440
Maybe I can, can I get up here? No.

3342
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,440
Oh, yeah.

3343
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:59,440
It's so impressive

3344
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,440
to look back at it in this war and

3345
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,440
think how far it's come.

3346
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,440
Like, like, like how we're just describing.

3347
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:07,440
Like, it's gone from just, like, a shitty

3348
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,440
fucking, just press one command and then

3349
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:11,440
you die.

3350
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,440
The entire ecosystem.

3351
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,440
Yeah. Well, I mean,

3352
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:17,440
Crack just, like, executed

3353
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:19,440
on, like, every retarded idea that I

3354
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:21,440
had. He just, like,

3355
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:23,440
made them happen

3356
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:25,440
in, like, I don't know,

3357
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:27,440
somehow.

3358
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,440
I don't know how he did it. Uh, he just

3359
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,440
I guess, you know,

3360
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,440
computers are powerful, man.

3361
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,440
Computers do magic things. But the human mind

3362
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,440
is powerful. The human mind is weak.

3363
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:39,440
No, the human mind is weak. Only computers

3364
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:41,440
have power. The ideas

3365
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,440
in my human brain mean nothing.

3366
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:45,440
This is the core difference between killers

3367
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,440
and, and, and raties.

3368
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:49,440
Yeah, killers are, are, are

3369
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,440
machine-oriented

3370
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:52,440
drones. And, and raties are full of heart

3371
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:54,440
and passion and human instinct.

3372
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:56,440
Killers are all about that machine learning.

3373
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:00,440
I'm on the map right now and this fucking Genesis quote

3374
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:02,440
still, like, shatters my soul

3375
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:04,440
thinking about how perfect it is.

3376
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:06,440
Do you want to read it? Yeah, sure.

3377
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:08,440
Genesis 1, uh,

3378
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:10,440
134. 1, 2, 3, 4.

3379
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,440
Yeah. Yeah.

3380
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:14,440
Genesis ABC.

3381
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:16,440
Uh, and they had Brick for Stone and they had

3382
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,440
Slime for Mortar. And they said

3383
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:20,440
go to, let us build a city in a

3384
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:22,440
tower whose top may reach into the

3385
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:24,440
heaven. And let us make a name

3386
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:26,440
lest we be scattered abroad on the face

3387
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:28,440
of the whole earth.

3388
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:30,440
Slime, Slime they had for Mortar.

3389
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:32,440
Slime they had for Mortar.

3390
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:34,440
And, and, and a tower whose top may reach

3391
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,440
into the heavens. Yes.

3392
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:38,440
Um,

3393
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:40,440
what could it mean?

3394
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,440
What does it mean?

3395
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:46,440
It's crazy.

3396
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:48,440
Cover your ears, children,

3397
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:50,440
in case you don't want the illusion to be broken.

3398
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:52,440
But, uh, the

3399
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:54,440
endless war, you know,

3400
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:56,440
New Los Angeles City just happens

3401
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:58,440
to look very similar to Boston, Massachusetts.

3402
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:00,440
And, uh,

3403
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:02,440
yeah, just weirdly,

3404
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:04,440
weirdly, I don't understand why.

3405
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:06,440
God damn.

3406
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:08,440
Uh, it's really, it's really

3407
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:10,440
like, like, like I, like I've been

3408
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:12,440
to crack a bay before. I know

3409
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:14,440
what crack bay is like.

3410
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:16,440
And I, and I wonder, I wonder, I, like

3411
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,440
I wonder what it would be like to, to

3412
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:20,440
traverse those, those

3413
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:22,440
streets that I have done so in my life.

3414
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:24,440
But, you know, with a gun in my hand.

3415
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:26,440
I mean, the, the, the last

3416
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:28,440
time I went out, the last

3417
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:30,440
time I went out shilling my books

3418
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:32,440
to, uh, you know,

3419
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:34,440
oh, shears. I want those shears.

3420
02:14:34,440 --> 02:14:36,440
Okay, this guy wants a drink.

3421
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:38,440
And then maybe he'll give me his shears

3422
02:14:38,440 --> 02:14:40,440
because I have to cut the balloon, Liz.

3423
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:42,440
Uh, the last time I went out

3424
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:44,440
shilling my comics and such,

3425
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:46,440
um, I gave, uh,

3426
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:48,440
oh yeah, yeah, I took, I took pictures.

3427
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:50,440
I was out in New Los Angeles City

3428
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:52,440
taking pictures, taking

3429
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:54,440
some not at all photo

3430
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:56,440
filtered, uh, you know,

3431
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:58,440
you know, uh, uh,

3432
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:00,440
uh, urban photography.

3433
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:02,440
Yeah.

3434
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:04,440
Just looking at all the green and pink

3435
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,440
and purple buildings.

3436
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:08,440
Oh fuck.

3437
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:10,440
Oh, Ben, you know what we should do? We should go

3438
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:12,440
urban exploring. We should find like an abandoned

3439
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:14,440
building and just spend the night there.

3440
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:16,440
I think we were talking about

3441
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,440
this. There is a like

3442
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:20,440
obelisk in Boston, isn't there?

3443
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:22,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3444
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:24,440
Yeah.

3445
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:26,440
You might do something with someday.

3446
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:28,440
Yeah.

3447
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:30,440
I have not made

3448
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:32,440
any progress.

3449
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:34,440
You have to leave this place.

3450
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:36,440
You must leave. You must leave now.

3451
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:38,440
You must go from whence you came.

3452
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:40,440
Fine.

3453
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,440
Pick a baby easy island

3454
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:44,440
and fucking be done with this.

3455
02:15:44,440 --> 02:15:46,440
I want to be done with this whole game.

3456
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:48,440
No, no,

3457
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:50,440
not like that. This game is a nightmare.

3458
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:52,440
Nothing like that.

3459
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:54,440
Look, look how much progress I made.

3460
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:56,440
Look how much progress I made on cryptids.

3461
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:58,440
I was getting somewhere.

3462
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:00,440
No, stop.

3463
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:04,440
Wait, just go to the fucking

3464
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,440
just look up what the next step was.

3465
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:08,440
No.

3466
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:10,440
Okay, okay, hold on.

3467
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:12,440
They find cryptids on here. I don't even know what step

3468
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:14,440
you were on. I had done

3469
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:16,440
basically nothing.

3470
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:18,440
Jump up a tree,

3471
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:20,440
get a five dollar bill, fun

3472
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:22,440
Loch Ness monster.

3473
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:24,440
Okay, that jumping up a tree

3474
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:26,440
and finding a five dollar bill sounds easy.

3475
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:28,440
Finding the Loch Ness monster sounds a little

3476
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:30,440
more difficult.

3477
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:32,440
Okay, go to like the fucking

3478
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:34,440
convention center island.

3479
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:40,440
This is tearing us apart.

3480
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:42,440
Wait, Burt's bed is breakfast.

3481
02:16:42,440 --> 02:16:44,440
There's like six different cryptids

3482
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:46,440
we're gonna have to find.

3483
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:48,440
Oh, I haven't even been in here.

3484
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:50,440
There's a fucking nightmare.

3485
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:52,440
Look, there's fresh food.

3486
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:56,440
Alright, fuck it, I'm out.

3487
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:58,440
I'll go to convention center.

3488
02:16:58,440 --> 02:17:00,440
Why not?

3489
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:12,440
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

3490
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:14,440
There we go. Alright.

3491
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:16,440
According to the PopTropica blog,

3492
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:18,440
this is the hardest island to be

3493
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:20,440
created. Really?

3494
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:22,440
Yeah. This cryptid is the hardest.

3495
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:24,440
Well, that's why if we beat it,

3496
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:26,440
we'll have beaten the entire game.

3497
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:28,440
I'll never have to play it again.

3498
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:30,440
No, we, no, the game, okay, go to

3499
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:32,440
the fucking funny convention center.

3500
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:34,440
I'm interested in what that is. Is it

3501
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:36,440
MockTropica? No, it's PopTropicon.

3502
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:38,440
PopTropicon.

3503
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:46,440
Game show, SkullDuggery,

3504
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:48,440
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

3505
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:50,440
Nice, nice.

3506
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:52,440
Sorry, Johnny Depp are coming soon.

3507
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:02,440
Counterfeit,

3508
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:04,440
Wimpy Boardwalk,

3509
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:06,440
Cryptids,

3510
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:08,440
where's PopTropicon?

3511
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:10,440
Oh, there it is, there it is, PopTropicon.

3512
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:12,440
This one's difficulty level 2.

3513
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:14,440
What's the blurb? What's the blurb?

3514
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:16,440
PopTropicon is the hottest ticket in town.

3515
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:18,440
It'll take all your wits and more

3516
02:18:18,440 --> 02:18:20,440
than a few disguises to crash the

3517
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:22,440
party.

3518
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,440
Ugh, fucking destroy

3519
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:26,440
AnimeExpo.

3520
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:28,440
Okay, I'm there.

3521
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:30,440
You know, Gern, Ligon,

3522
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:32,440
HunterXHunter, all those are fine

3523
02:18:32,440 --> 02:18:34,440
Anime, but when I'm going to get a panel

3524
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:36,440
of what the creators of PopTropicon

3525
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:38,440
at AnimeExpo are.

3526
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:42,440
Okay, I already know how to costume

3527
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:44,440
minds.

3528
02:18:48,440 --> 02:18:50,440
Ugh.

3529
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:52,440
Look at this, look at this fucking stupid this is.

3530
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:54,440
Come watch the premiere trailer of

3531
02:18:54,440 --> 02:18:56,440
Mighty Action Force.

3532
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:58,440
Only today at

3533
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:00,440
PopTropicon.

3534
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:02,440
Pop, Cock, Pop, Pop

3535
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:04,440
and Lockticon.

3536
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:06,440
Imagine, like,

3537
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:08,440
how many layers remove this is.

3538
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:10,440
Like, you're so engrossed in nerd culture

3539
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:12,440
that you would pass for not, like, playing

3540
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:14,440
a video game about Spider-Man, but you would play

3541
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:16,440
a video game about going to a convention

3542
02:19:16,440 --> 02:19:18,440
to talk about Spider-Man.

3543
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:24,440
I mean, maybe

3544
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:26,440
you just really love PopTropicon.

3545
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:28,440
You just really want, I mean this is part of the lore.

3546
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:30,440
Copkiller!

3547
02:19:30,440 --> 02:19:32,440
Copkiller's Assemble!

3548
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:36,440
You know, I'm surprised you haven't made

3549
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:38,440
the Copkiller theme song, the song

3550
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:40,440
Copkiller, which the Copkiller name was based upon.

3551
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:42,440
Wait, what?

3552
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:44,440
Yeah, you don't know how.

3553
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:46,440
I am the one

3554
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:48,440
who came up with the writer's Copkiller's name

3555
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:50,440
and the Copkiller part

3556
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:52,440
is based off a song

3557
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:54,440
by the name Copkiller.

3558
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:56,440
Wait, John Manos.

3559
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:58,440
Wait, really?

3560
02:19:58,440 --> 02:20:00,440
I had no idea.

3561
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:02,440
I've never heard this before.

3562
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:04,440
I think you would like it.

3563
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:06,440
If you like Shitty Vaporwave

3564
02:20:06,440 --> 02:20:08,440
then you'll like this quite a bit.

3565
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:10,440
Oh, and there's nothing I like quite so much

3566
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:12,440
as Shitty Vaporwave.

3567
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:14,440
Okay, so I guess I'm looking for

3568
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:16,440
like a gray wizard guy.

3569
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:18,440
Put this on in the background. Stop the go-bots.

3570
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:20,440
Stop it and put on this.

3571
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:24,440
Fine.

3572
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:26,440
Well, let's get our video flags.

3573
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:30,440
I mean, this video I'm sitting

3574
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:32,440
is on YouTube, so...

3575
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:34,440
So yes.

3576
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:36,440
No, right?

3577
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:38,440
It's fine, it's fine. I don't know.

3578
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:40,440
I mean, whatever.

3579
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:42,440
Let's get our video get deleted

3580
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:44,440
and it'll be a collector's item.

3581
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:46,440
Yeah, download this video as soon as you hear it.

3582
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,440
Is it playing?

3583
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:54,440
Yes. Let's kill the cops tonight.

3584
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:56,440
Yeah.

3585
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:58,440
Yeah, this is me to a T.

3586
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:02,440
There's a cop.

3587
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:04,440
I'll let him go for now.

3588
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:06,440
What happened in your past

3589
02:21:06,440 --> 02:21:08,440
that made you hate cops so much?

3590
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:14,440
You don't want to talk about it?

3591
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:16,440
No, I don't think I don't want to talk about it.

3592
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:18,440
That's dark.

3593
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:20,440
There's a lot of pain there.

3594
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:22,440
This is the sad episode of RBCK.

3595
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:24,440
This is the official sad episode.

3596
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:26,440
Yeah.

3597
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:28,440
Because we've been extremely sad so far.

3598
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:30,440
You know, I mean,

3599
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:32,440
the first cop I ever killed

3600
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:34,440
was Mad Bull.

3601
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:36,440
And as you know, Mad Bull is my dad

3602
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:38,440
and everyone's dad.

3603
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:40,440
So, you know,

3604
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:42,440
there's a lot there.

3605
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:44,440
Ben, how can we get this episode to be sadder?

3606
02:21:44,440 --> 02:21:46,440
Let's say something sad.

3607
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:48,440
Um...

3608
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:50,440
Uh...

3609
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:52,440
This music's actually quite loud.

3610
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:54,440
Um...

3611
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:56,440
I'm tearing it down.

3612
02:21:56,440 --> 02:21:58,440
That's sad, because the audio recording won't be as good.

3613
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:00,440
Yeah, yeah, bummer, right?

3614
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:02,440
Yeah, that, you know, I'm crying.

3615
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:04,440
Where...

3616
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:06,440
is the fucking video there?

3617
02:22:06,440 --> 02:22:08,440
Let's kill...

3618
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:10,440
Let's kill the cops tonight.

3619
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:14,440
Okay.

3620
02:22:14,440 --> 02:22:16,440
Now I've got the pop-tropica music

3621
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:18,440
that you're playing at the same time.

3622
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:20,440
Yeah.

3623
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:22,440
Get down from there. No, you dig.

3624
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:24,440
Oh.

3625
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:28,440
Um...

3626
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:30,440
Hey, uh, well, you know,

3627
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:32,440
life is, in fact,

3628
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:34,440
a swirling maelstrom of meaningless chaos.

3629
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:36,440
None of which we can escape from.

3630
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:38,440
Right?

3631
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:40,440
That's pretty sad, right?

3632
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:42,440
Doesn't that just bum you right the fuck out?

3633
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:44,440
It does.

3634
02:22:44,440 --> 02:22:46,440
You've been grumpy lately,

3635
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:48,440
and I want to get to the bottom of why you've been so grumpy.

3636
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:50,440
Have I?

3637
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:52,440
Yeah, you've been nothing but a sourpuss lately.

3638
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:54,440
Well, I mean...

3639
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:56,440
Whenever I join a PCP episode,

3640
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:58,440
you're always like,

3641
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:00,440
oh, I'm in a pissed-off mood today.

3642
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:02,440
You always have to see how this recording goes,

3643
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:04,440
and, you know, if you wrong me one more time,

3644
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:06,440
you know, your head's gonna be clean off.

3645
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:08,440
Yeah.

3646
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:10,440
Um...

3647
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:12,440
Scram.

3648
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:14,440
Uh, well, I mean...

3649
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:16,440
That was true of the last one.

3650
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:18,440
And maybe of the one before that.

3651
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:20,440
And maybe even of the one before that.

3652
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:22,440
Um, but I mean, I'm not...

3653
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:24,440
I don't think there's any pattern there.

3654
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:26,440
Is what...

3655
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:28,440
Is all I'm saying.

3656
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,440
Um, I don't know.

3657
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:32,440
I...

3658
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:34,440
I guess I've been...

3659
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:36,440
I don't feel like I've been feeling

3660
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:38,440
worse than usual or anything.

3661
02:23:38,440 --> 02:23:40,440
Maybe I'm just an asshole.

3662
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:42,440
Do you think of that?

3663
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:44,440
Yeah, well, I mean, that's why I was first thinking.

3664
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:46,440
But I thought, no.

3665
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:48,440
No, impossible.

3666
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:50,440
Well, I'm sorry.

3667
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:52,440
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

3668
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:54,440
Um...

3669
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:56,440
It won't be the last.

3670
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:58,440
So don't worry about it.

3671
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:00,440
Can I land on these cinder blocks?

3672
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:02,440
No.

3673
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:04,440
Oh, look at this fantastical world we're in.

3674
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:06,440
The fucking dumpsters in your convention setting.

3675
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:08,440
Yeah.

3676
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:10,440
We're bursting out of the...

3677
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:12,440
Of the building.

3678
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:14,440
Ruining the environment around us.

3679
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:16,440
I guess I'll go climb up some other building.

3680
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:18,440
This is fucking...

3681
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:20,440
This is really based off of Comic-Con.

3682
02:24:20,440 --> 02:24:22,440
And it is clearly based upon, like, the convention center.

3683
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:24,440
That I lived here and I passed every single day.

3684
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:26,440
Wait, this is convention center.

3685
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:28,440
Oh, convention center up this way.

3686
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:30,440
Okay.

3687
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:32,440
This is really bizarre.

3688
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:34,440
This is really bizarre.

3689
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,440
I don't like it.

3690
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:38,440
Did you earn the Tony and the Tiger blow-up inflatable

3691
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:40,440
at Comic-Con last year?

3692
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:42,440
Yeah, I do.

3693
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:44,440
I understand.

3694
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:46,440
Did that really happen?

3695
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:48,440
No. I'm just talking about the advertising.

3696
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:50,440
The Hey Kids is advertising.

3697
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:52,440
Do you know what a Hey Kids entertainment is?

3698
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,440
No.

3699
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:56,440
It was an AI who made

3700
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:58,440
children's

3701
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,440
comedy on YouTube.

3702
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:02,440
And he would appear as an Indian man with his skull broken.

3703
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:04,440
And he would say,

3704
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:06,440
I don't forget you to tie your sport shoes.

3705
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:08,440
Sometimes he would appear as Hitler

3706
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:10,440
and slash or Darth Maul.

3707
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:12,440
And he would scream at you.

3708
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:14,440
Um, was he

3709
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:16,440
paid to do this?

3710
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:18,440
No, this was a robot.

3711
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:20,440
Oh.

3712
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:22,440
Was he paid in

3713
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,440
circuit chips?

3714
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:26,440
Yeah.

3715
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:28,440
Yeah, energy balls?

3716
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:30,440
He was paid in oil and nuts and bolts.

3717
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:32,440
Delectable.

3718
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:34,440
Delectable.

3719
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:36,440
He was

3720
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:38,440
he was paid in human suffering.

3721
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:40,440
I wish

3722
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,440
I could get me some of that.

3723
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:44,440
Ooh.

3724
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:46,440
Do you see that guy's facial hair?

3725
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:48,440
No.

3726
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:50,440
I don't know what to make without any instructions.

3727
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:52,440
Instructions.

3728
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:54,440
If you want to make your own costume parts,

3729
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:56,440
this is the place to do it.

3730
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:58,440
Instructions.

3731
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:00,440
Yeah.

3732
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:02,440
Space John.

3733
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:04,440
That guy has nothing to say.

3734
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:06,440
Uh...

3735
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:10,440
Space John.

3736
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:14,440
No, he spoke Fremulon.

3737
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:16,440
Study Up.

3738
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:18,440
Oh my goodness, like Klingon.

3739
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:20,440
Yeah.

3740
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:22,440
What if it was like Aliens

3741
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:24,440
in space?

3742
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:26,440
Okay.

3743
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:28,440
Great.

3744
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:30,440
You guide to frequent Fremulon phrases.

3745
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:32,440
How are you?

3746
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:34,440
Scrash some Baloo.

3747
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:36,440
I'm fine.

3748
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:38,440
Scrum Belizu.

3749
02:26:38,440 --> 02:26:40,440
Where is the restroom?

3750
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:42,440
Crosses up Bamblex.

3751
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:44,440
The restroom is behind you.

3752
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:46,440
Bamblex is up and frozen.

3753
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:48,440
I can't.

3754
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:50,440
I can't be bothered.

3755
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:52,440
Study Up.

3756
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:54,440
Yes sir.

3757
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:56,440
Oh, he's so cool.

3758
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:58,440
But he's not Keto.

3759
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,440
He's eating pizza.

3760
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:02,440
So unfortunately, I have to cut our relationship.

3761
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:04,440
Yeah.

3762
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:06,440
You know, priorities.

3763
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:08,440
Blah, blah, pet baits.

3764
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:10,440
Okay.

3765
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:12,440
Great. Thank you.

3766
02:27:12,440 --> 02:27:14,440
Pony Whisperer. That's me.

3767
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:16,440
That's me.

3768
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:18,440
Oh look, Bamblex.

3769
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:20,440
That's Fremulon for restroom.

3770
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:22,440
This fucking...

3771
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:24,440
This awful

3772
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:26,440
Frosted Flakes advertisement needs to stop

3773
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:28,440
immediately.

3774
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:30,440
Space Jump.

3775
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:32,440
It seems you've filled the brim with advertising.

3776
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:34,440
You cannot escape it.

3777
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:36,440
Watch the

3778
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:38,440
trailer for Magi Man Action Force.

3779
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:40,440
Can I do that?

3780
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:42,440
How do you do that?

3781
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:44,440
Click on the billboard.

3782
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:46,440
I mean, I'm sure

3783
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:48,440
it will happen.

3784
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:50,440
Is that Starbucks?

3785
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:52,440
I think it's Starbucks.

3786
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:54,440
I have a Starbucks thing.

3787
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:56,440
It says coffee

3788
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:58,440
with something

3789
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,440
coffeehouse. I can't read the

3790
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:02,440
top word.

3791
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:04,440
Someone's coffeehouse.

3792
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:06,440
Maybe if I go around

3793
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:08,440
to the other side.

3794
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:10,440
This

3795
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:12,440
level is really depressing

3796
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:14,440
and makes me

3797
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:16,440
never ever want to go

3798
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:18,440
to a convention again.

3799
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:20,440
I don't know

3800
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:22,440
what the fuck they were thinking.

3801
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:24,440
Yeah, it's like

3802
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:26,440
let's recreate

3803
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:28,440
the human misery that is

3804
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:30,440
a convention.

3805
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:32,440
Ooh, Watch Parts.

3806
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:34,440
Now I can go to the steampunk convention.

3807
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:36,440
Oh, thank god.

3808
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:38,440
I think that's literally what that's about.

3809
02:28:38,440 --> 02:28:40,440
I think that's literally the point of that.

3810
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:44,440
Yeah, let's recreate standing

3811
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:46,440
in line. Let's recreate getting

3812
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:48,440
shit expensive food.

3813
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:50,440
Yeah, let's recreate

3814
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:52,440
a bunch of idiots

3815
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:54,440
all in a

3816
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:56,440
weird mad frenzy

3817
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:58,440
to consume some culture

3818
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:00,440
for a price

3819
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:02,440
as they all show up

3820
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:04,440
and shill for their favorite intellectual

3821
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:06,440
properties that they don't own.

3822
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:08,440
Yeah, let's recreate the terrible advertising

3823
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:10,440
that's ever around there.

3824
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:12,440
Everyone enjoys because that's the way

3825
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:14,440
that culture is now.

3826
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:16,440
It's culture and it's actively participated.

3827
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:18,440
Ugh, god.

3828
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:20,440
Dammit.

3829
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:22,440
That's how this makes me feel.

3830
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:24,440
Bad.

3831
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:26,440
Um,

3832
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:28,440
Poptropicon.

3833
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:30,440
This is fucked.

3834
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:32,440
Those bushes and that like

3835
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:34,440
structure I have seen in my life

3836
02:29:34,440 --> 02:29:36,440
in real life before.

3837
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:38,440
I'm so sorry.

3838
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:40,440
I don't believe this.

3839
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:42,440
I can't believe this.

3840
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:44,440
Why?

3841
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:46,440
Don't tell anyone I'm up here.

3842
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:48,440
Dammit. Where's the...

3843
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:50,440
There's another wizard. I'm looking for a different...

3844
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:52,440
Where's the steampunk?

3845
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:54,440
I'm looking for a different wizard.

3846
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:56,440
Uh...

3847
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:02,440
This watch was just hanging

3848
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:04,440
from like a street sign and I just stole it.

3849
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:06,440
Um, well, that's fine.

3850
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:08,440
That's vandalism.

3851
02:30:08,440 --> 02:30:10,440
That's vandalism.

3852
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:12,440
Can you give me this where you

3853
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:14,440
steal stop signs so that people don't stop

3854
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:16,440
and they hit people?

3855
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:18,440
Hey, that's pretty good.

3856
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:20,440
That looks pretty dang good right there.

3857
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:22,440
Yeah.

3858
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:24,440
Yeah.

3859
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:32,440
Okay, perfect.

3860
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:34,440
Look at me.

3861
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:36,440
Look how perfect I am.

3862
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:38,440
Look how

3863
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:40,440
beautiful.

3864
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,440
Alright.

3865
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:44,440
Beautiful, it's true.

3866
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:46,440
Beautiful, it's true.

3867
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:48,440
I saw your face.

3868
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:50,440
Ooh.

3869
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:52,440
Uh, what is the point of this one?

3870
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:54,440
No turning point for stuck in the road.

3871
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:56,440
Da, da, da, da.

3872
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:58,440
She by the ribs directs

3873
02:30:58,440 --> 02:31:00,440
to where to go.

3874
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:02,440
Da, da, da, da.

3875
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:04,440
To choose memories and dead skin on trial.

3876
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:06,440
Da, da, da, da.

3877
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:08,440
I got a question, but a lesson

3878
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:10,440
learned in time.

3879
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:12,440
When it hasn't been your day,

3880
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:14,440
your week, your month, or...

3881
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:16,440
I'll be there for you.

3882
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:18,440
I'll be there for you.

3883
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:20,440
And I'll be there for you.

3884
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:22,440
Da, da, da, da, da.

3885
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:24,440
Found a way.

3886
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:26,440
Found a way.

3887
02:31:26,440 --> 02:31:28,440
You should open up your eyes.

3888
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:30,440
I'll be there for you.

3889
02:31:30,440 --> 02:31:32,440
Da, da, da, da.

3890
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:34,440
Thanks.

3891
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:36,440
Uh, where do I go?

3892
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:38,440
Uh, where do I go?

3893
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:40,440
Uh, where do I go?

3894
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:42,440
Uh, where do I go?

3895
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:44,440
Uh, where do I go?

3896
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:46,440
Uh, where do I go?

3897
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:48,440
Uh, where do I go?

3898
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:50,440
Uh, where do I go?

3899
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:52,440
Uh, where do I go?

3900
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:54,440
Uh, where do I go?

3901
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:56,440
Uh, where do I go?

3902
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:58,440
Uh, where do I go?

3903
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:00,440
Uh, where do I go?

3904
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:02,440
You get to be in the same room

3905
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:04,440
with someone who's made your favorite

3906
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:06,440
children's cartoon.

3907
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:08,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3908
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:10,440
I get to meet someone

3909
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:12,440
who met Lauren Faust.

3910
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:14,440
Yeah.

3911
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:20,440
You remember how

3912
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:22,440
Bronies would ask the voice actors

3913
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:24,440
things about the story?

3914
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:26,440
Did they really?

3915
02:32:26,440 --> 02:32:28,440
Yeah. How embarrassing.

3916
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:31,440
Yeah, they would ask the voice actors.

3917
02:32:31,440 --> 02:32:33,440
Why would they be so foolish?

3918
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:35,440
The voice actors, they would be like,

3919
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:37,440
hey, so Tara Strong, why did this happen

3920
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:38,440
in this episode?

3921
02:32:38,440 --> 02:32:40,440
What was Tara's characterization, then?

3922
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:42,440
Like, why did that happen?

3923
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:44,440
Yeah, like, why did, hey Tara Strong,

3924
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:46,440
why didn't, uh,

3925
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:48,440
Princess Celestia,

3926
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:50,440
why didn't Twilight just tell Princess Celestia

3927
02:32:50,440 --> 02:32:52,440
to get fucked?

3928
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:54,440
Yeah!

3929
02:32:54,440 --> 02:32:56,440
Why didn't she tell that

3930
02:32:56,440 --> 02:32:58,440
to Celestia? Lay off.

3931
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:00,440
Damn straight.

3932
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:02,440
She's trying to be a single mom in Ponyville.

3933
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:04,440
She won't

3934
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:06,440
do it, though.

3935
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:08,440
God damn!

3936
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:10,440
I mean, I feel like I'm supposed to jump

3937
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:12,440
into the basket of the catapult?

3938
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:14,440
Ever since Brad got her teenage

3939
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:16,440
pregnant, she's had teenage

3940
02:33:16,440 --> 02:33:18,440
children, and she needs to get rid of them

3941
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:20,440
pronto. God!

3942
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:24,440
Well, Twilight, it would make you Princess,

3943
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:26,440
but you are a D4C twice over.

3944
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:28,440
Yeah, so, you know,

3945
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:30,440
the ship has sailed on that.

3946
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:32,440
Yeah.

3947
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:34,440
Oh, man.

3948
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:36,440
When are you coming,

3949
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:38,440
when are you coming to visit Boston again?

3950
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:40,440
Um,

3951
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:42,440
soon. And by soon, I mean,

3952
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:44,440
probably December.

3953
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:46,440
Hmm, what,

3954
02:33:46,440 --> 02:33:48,440
that's like, that's like an entire year.

3955
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:50,440
I, um,

3956
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:52,440
well,

3957
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:54,440
you're such a bullshitter.

3958
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:56,440
You bullshat me.

3959
02:33:56,440 --> 02:33:58,440
You could view time

3960
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:00,440
that way if you wanted to.

3961
02:34:00,440 --> 02:34:02,440
All right.

3962
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:04,440
You could view

3963
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:06,440
three months a year if you chose

3964
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:08,440
to do that. Wait, when was the last time

3965
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:10,440
you were here?

3966
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:12,440
March. So, like,

3967
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:14,440
most of a year.

3968
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:16,440
Oh, you're saying

3969
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:18,440
that, I thought you meant that December

3970
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:20,440
was a year away. No, no, like, since

3971
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:22,440
the last time you were here. That's like, from

3972
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:24,440
March to December is most of a year.

3973
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:26,440
Um, well been. Yeah.

3974
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:28,440
This, this is a,

3975
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:30,440
this is a, I don't know, I don't know

3976
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:32,440
describe, I don't know the feeling that this might,

3977
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:34,440
you know, give off.

3978
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:36,440
But this might be

3979
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:38,440
starting, like,

3980
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:40,440
next fall

3981
02:34:40,440 --> 02:34:42,440
around this time. I might be in

3982
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:44,440
Boston forever.

3983
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:46,440
Oh, really?

3984
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:48,440
Is that so? Yeah. Is that a fact?

3985
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:50,440
I'm thinking of going

3986
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:52,440
to college.

3987
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:54,440
And, like, really thinking. Oh, god.

3988
02:34:54,440 --> 02:34:56,440
With my real brain.

3989
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:58,440
Well,

3990
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:00,440
uh, okay.

3991
02:35:00,440 --> 02:35:02,440
And you'd, you'd

3992
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:04,440
come around here?

3993
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:06,440
Yeah, I would. Yeah.

3994
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:08,440
Um, sick.

3995
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:10,440
Like, do you know where

3996
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:12,440
you want to apply to?

3997
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:14,440
Yeah, I do. I don't want to

3998
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:16,440
speak in, I do want to talk

3999
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:18,440
about this. This is one of the things I want to talk about.

4000
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:20,440
But I don't know how specific I want to get

4001
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:22,440
for, you know, obvious reasons.

4002
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:24,440
And also the fact that if, for some

4003
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:26,440
reason, I change my mind, I don't want to have

4004
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:28,440
people, you know, fucking

4005
02:35:28,440 --> 02:35:30,440
giving me shit about it. But I,

4006
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:32,440
it is a pretty, you know, like

4007
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:34,440
my, my, my

4008
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:36,440
thoughts and feelings are there.

4009
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:38,440
And they might change, but I don't think that they will.

4010
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:40,440
Thoughts

4011
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:42,440
never change.

4012
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:44,440
Yeah, feelings never change.

4013
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:46,440
I can't change your mind.

4014
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:48,440
Okay, okay. Um, I just,

4015
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:50,440
the, the, I feel like

4016
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:52,440
I'm supposed to be putting on, like,

4017
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:54,440
a disguise?

4018
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:56,440
Like, I think that's what the game wants me to do.

4019
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:58,440
They told me to linger over it.

4020
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:00,440
But, I don't know how.

4021
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:02,440
Like, there's the,

4022
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:04,440
like, okay.

4023
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:06,440
They, the lady at the beginning

4024
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:08,440
was like, do you know how to

4025
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:10,440
customize? And like, yes I do.

4026
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:12,440
But, and then, but then

4027
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:14,440
there's this costume closet.

4028
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:16,440
And like, I feel like

4029
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:18,440
I'm supposed to have

4030
02:36:18,440 --> 02:36:20,440
like items

4031
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,440
in,

4032
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:26,440
I don't know, man.

4033
02:36:28,440 --> 02:36:30,440
This costume, I just,

4034
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:32,440
Do you want me to get the walkthrough open? I don't understand.

4035
02:36:32,440 --> 02:36:34,440
Yeah, this, this costume closet is

4036
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:36,440
clearly supposed to do something.

4037
02:36:36,440 --> 02:36:38,440
Here, here, don't worry.

4038
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:40,440
I'll come to your rescue here.

4039
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:42,440
Probably, I'm supposed to do something with the

4040
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:44,440
Fracksulons or whatever.

4041
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:48,440
Alright, how long have we been going?

4042
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:50,440
Oh, two and a half hours.

4043
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:52,440
That's nothing.

4044
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:54,440
That's two and a half hours too long.

4045
02:36:54,440 --> 02:36:56,440
That's absolutely nothing.

4046
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:58,440
Uh, okay.

4047
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:02,440
Ask the girl in line

4048
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:04,440
who's holding two tickets

4049
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:06,440
and waiting, if she has

4050
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:08,440
an extra ticket. She will say that she's

4051
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:10,440
looking for someone who hasn't arrived yet.

4052
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:12,440
Ask her what he looks like

4053
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:14,440
and she will show you a selfie that looks

4054
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:16,440
like a regular photo. Okay.

4055
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:18,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the wizard guy, right?

4056
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:20,440
I guess so.

4057
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:22,440
Now, customize yourself to look like him

4058
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:24,440
and steal his fucking ticket, I guess.

4059
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:26,440
And he probably spent like

4060
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:28,440
$120 on it. Look, that guy's got like a beard, though.

4061
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:32,440
Sure. Alright. Okay.

4062
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:34,440
Yeah, I figured it was something like that.

4063
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:36,440
Well, that's why I put on this wizard.

4064
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:38,440
Asshole. Jesus Christ.

4065
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:40,440
That's why I put on this wizard hat.

4066
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:42,440
Um,

4067
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,440
is it this girl?

4068
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:46,440
No, it's this girl.

4069
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:52,440
You're not my friend. He looks like this.

4070
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:56,440
Oh, god.

4071
02:37:56,440 --> 02:37:58,440
Look at that smartphone.

4072
02:38:00,440 --> 02:38:02,440
Okay, I need a fake beard.

4073
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:04,440
Gray hair.

4074
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:06,440
Look at him. What you have to do is you have to

4075
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:08,440
find him and then, you know,

4076
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:10,440
just take all the hashtag

4077
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:12,440
steal his look. Well,

4078
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:14,440
I haven't seen anyone that looks like that.

4079
02:38:14,440 --> 02:38:16,440
Well, you have to find him.

4080
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:18,440
That's the point of the game.

4081
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,440
I don't think that

4082
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:22,440
is the point of the game.

4083
02:38:22,440 --> 02:38:24,440
I think I'm supposed to like mix

4084
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:26,440
and match.

4085
02:38:26,440 --> 02:38:28,440
I think I'm supposed to mix and match people's

4086
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:30,440
costumes until I look like him.

4087
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:32,440
Let me consult the rock.

4088
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:34,440
Wait.

4089
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:36,440
Hold on. Open up the

4090
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:38,440
open up the

4091
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:40,440
the fucking

4092
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:42,440
the photo.

4093
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:48,440
Okay.

4094
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:50,440
Can you can you

4095
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:52,440
like click on him or something?

4096
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:54,440
Can you like do it from this screen?

4097
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:56,440
No, I can't.

4098
02:38:56,440 --> 02:38:58,440
I cannot do it from that screen.

4099
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:00,440
Okay. Okay. Okay. You're right.

4100
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:02,440
You are right, actually.

4101
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:04,440
I knew it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

4102
02:39:04,440 --> 02:39:06,440
So I just have to

4103
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:08,440
get his staff. Someone in line.

4104
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:10,440
I got the staff. I got the staff.

4105
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:12,440
Okay. Okay. I need like a moon

4106
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:14,440
and stars belt. I need like a Jedi

4107
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:16,440
robe.

4108
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:18,440
All right. All right. Climb up the next level

4109
02:39:18,440 --> 02:39:20,440
on the building and run across the tables

4110
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:22,440
and grab some bottles.

4111
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:24,440
I got the bottles. Customize the guy

4112
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:26,440
pushing the solar dispenser. You need his

4113
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:28,440
beard.

4114
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:30,440
Okay. I think the guy at the

4115
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:32,440
solar dispenser is this way.

4116
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:34,440
All right. Well, now that I know

4117
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:36,440
what I'm looking for is probably

4118
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:38,440
won't be that bad.

4119
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:44,440
This is this is a follow

4120
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:46,440
up to last episode where

4121
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:48,440
where I was I think I think was last

4122
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:50,440
episode or something like that where I was

4123
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:52,440
thinking about

4124
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:54,440
I was thinking about, you know, it sure would be

4125
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:56,440
cool if I were able to call him that's gone

4126
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:58,440
and passed and I can't do that anymore.

4127
02:39:58,440 --> 02:40:00,440
Why would you think that you're like 17?

4128
02:40:00,440 --> 02:40:02,440
I know

4129
02:40:02,440 --> 02:40:04,440
and it's silly.

4130
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:06,440
I thought that

4131
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:08,440
you know I had already like

4132
02:40:08,440 --> 02:40:10,440
like I had already like

4133
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:12,440
been so focused

4134
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:14,440
on doing like

4135
02:40:14,440 --> 02:40:16,440
you know fucking silly shit on the internet

4136
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:18,440
that I thought well that's just what I'm going to have to do with my life.

4137
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:20,440
It's actually a perfect

4138
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:22,440
timing and I can absolutely

4139
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:24,440
do that. What's wrong

4140
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:26,440
with you? Why would you think that it's not

4141
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:28,440
why would you think that this is not the time?

4142
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:32,440
Okay, I understand

4143
02:40:32,440 --> 02:40:34,440
I understand it at the time

4144
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:36,440
it looked bleep

4145
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:42,440
but yeah, so

4146
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:44,440
I

4147
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:46,440
I have no idea

4148
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:48,440
I've kept this close to

4149
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:50,440
my chest because I have no idea

4150
02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:52,440
how anyone else will respond to it.

4151
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:54,440
I assume that would be like

4152
02:40:54,440 --> 02:40:56,440
Oh, I found it. I found the moon and stars

4153
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:58,440
belt. Fuck yeah. Sick.

4154
02:40:58,440 --> 02:41:00,440
Oh, is it from the non-kido guy?

4155
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:02,440
Yeah, it's from the non-kido.

4156
02:41:02,440 --> 02:41:04,440
I'll have to dip into this.

4157
02:41:04,440 --> 02:41:06,440
Have you found the tiny machine guy?

4158
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:08,440
No, not yet. Okay.

4159
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:10,440
Yeah, there we go.

4160
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:12,440
Wait.

4161
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:14,440
What else do I, oh the beard.

4162
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:16,440
Yeah, I think the beard's the last thing.

4163
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:20,440
Uh, let me see.

4164
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:24,440
Okay.

4165
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:28,440
Okay, okay.

4166
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:30,440
After you get the beard

4167
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:32,440
then you'll have to go to the girl again

4168
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:34,440
and then she'll say, she'll ask you for an item that you don't have

4169
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:36,440
and you're gonna go to the public restrooms

4170
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:38,440
and you'll find the girl, like one of her friends

4171
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:40,440
crying.

4172
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:42,440
Uh,

4173
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:44,440
ask him if he's holding something for his friend.

4174
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:46,440
He says he left it in the bathroom.

4175
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:48,440
He'll leave after complimenting your costume

4176
02:41:48,440 --> 02:41:50,440
and then you'll have to go in and get the item

4177
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:52,440
to be the person.

4178
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:54,440
I have gone, like, I've gone

4179
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:56,440
the entire breadth of this map

4180
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:58,440
and I have not seen a guy pushing a vending machine.

4181
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:00,440
I feel like I saw him before.

4182
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:02,440
You, you, you did.

4183
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:04,440
He's like on, like, a second story of the villain.

4184
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:06,440
Oh, okay.

4185
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:10,440
Well, that helps.

4186
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:12,440
Let's see.

4187
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:16,440
I'm really hungry

4188
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:18,440
but the thought of eating food makes me sick.

4189
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:20,440
You ever feel like that?

4190
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:22,440
No. I do feel sick from

4191
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:24,440
being full, though, now.

4192
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:26,440
I feel like

4193
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:28,440
whenever I eat any food, no matter how little

4194
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:30,440
food I eat, my stomach always feels like

4195
02:42:30,440 --> 02:42:32,440
it's upset now.

4196
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:36,440
Is, okay, okay.

4197
02:42:36,440 --> 02:42:38,440
I think it's, I think it's here, right?

4198
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:40,440
That makes sense.

4199
02:42:42,440 --> 02:42:44,440
Go to the right.

4200
02:42:48,440 --> 02:42:50,440
Okay.

4201
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:54,440
This is weird.

4202
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:56,440
You have definitely seen him before.

4203
02:42:58,440 --> 02:43:00,440
Does it say where he is?

4204
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:02,440
No.

4205
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:08,440
Yeah, I've definitely...

4206
02:43:08,440 --> 02:43:10,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Go to the level.

4207
02:43:10,440 --> 02:43:12,440
Go to the part of the map where you see the girl.

4208
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:16,440
The one who's going to give me the ticket.

4209
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:18,440
Yeah, it says that it's above there.

4210
02:43:18,440 --> 02:43:20,440
Oh, okay.

4211
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:22,440
Alright.

4212
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:24,440
Let's see.

4213
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,440
Come on.

4214
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:30,440
Come on.

4215
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:32,440
Oh, there we go.

4216
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:34,440
Here we are. There we go.

4217
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:36,440
Now we're cooking.

4218
02:43:36,440 --> 02:43:38,440
You want the gas?

4219
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:40,440
Alright, there we go. Get that guy's fucking beard.

4220
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:42,440
Oh, okay.

4221
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:46,440
So that's how you get a beard.

4222
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:50,440
You're the spitting image.

4223
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:52,440
The spitting image, yeah.

4224
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:54,440
You know, I changed my hair color, but whatever.

4225
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:58,440
No pain, no game.

4226
02:43:58,440 --> 02:44:00,440
No pain, no game, no pain, no life.

4227
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:04,440
Alright.

4228
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:06,440
Here I am. I'll take my ticket now.

4229
02:44:06,440 --> 02:44:08,440
Asshole.

4230
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:12,440
Okay, I give you a ticket and you give me what you promised.

4231
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:18,440
To the restrooms.

4232
02:44:20,440 --> 02:44:22,440
I say that every day.

4233
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:24,440
I've never,

4234
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:26,440
never had a convention.

4235
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:28,440
It seems more unappealing.

4236
02:44:28,440 --> 02:44:30,440
If this is,

4237
02:44:30,440 --> 02:44:32,440
yeah, if this is like an advertisement

4238
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:34,440
to go to Comic-Con, then they're failing

4239
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:36,440
extremely hard.

4240
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:38,440
It almost works.

4241
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:40,440
It's like a, it almost works

4242
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:42,440
as like a cruel parody of one.

4243
02:44:48,440 --> 02:44:50,440
Awful.

4244
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:52,440
Oh, my body hurts.

4245
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:54,440
Hey.

4246
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:56,440
A tropical is a cruel, cruel mistress.

4247
02:44:56,440 --> 02:44:58,440
Yeah.

4248
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:00,440
Are you holding something for your friend?

4249
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:02,440
I had it when I went into the bathroom, but I must have left it in there.

4250
02:45:02,440 --> 02:45:04,440
What? Let me go!

4251
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:06,440
Fuck!

4252
02:45:08,440 --> 02:45:10,440
I had it when I went into the bathroom,

4253
02:45:10,440 --> 02:45:12,440
but I must have left it there.

4254
02:45:12,440 --> 02:45:14,440
In the bathroom, you say.

4255
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:16,440
Okay. Nice costume, by the way.

4256
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:18,440
There, there, there should be

4257
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:20,440
an arcade island

4258
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:22,440
where you get to play this game in Tycho.

4259
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:24,440
And they're trapped in their favorite video game.

4260
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:26,440
There is.

4261
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:28,440
It's called On the Rain Slick

4262
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:30,440
Precipice of Darkness.

4263
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:34,440
All of us have read Cave Story.

4264
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:36,440
I'm racking my brain. Who played Thor

4265
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:38,440
in that old Viking movie?

4266
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:40,440
Wait, is that a real, wait, wait, real?

4267
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:42,440
Yeah, look, I'm racking, I'm racking

4268
02:45:42,440 --> 02:45:44,440
my brain

4269
02:45:44,440 --> 02:45:46,440
to remember who played Thor in that old Viking movie.

4270
02:45:46,440 --> 02:45:48,440
Remind me and I'll trade my spot.

4271
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:52,440
What?

4272
02:45:56,440 --> 02:45:58,440
Okay, well, I think

4273
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:00,440
that the guy with the catapult

4274
02:46:00,440 --> 02:46:02,440
was talking about

4275
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:04,440
Vikings.

4276
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:06,440
So, uh, you know.

4277
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:12,440
Let's go do that, I guess.

4278
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:18,440
Man, I hate how I look right now.

4279
02:46:20,440 --> 02:46:22,440
What do you mean? I mean in real life.

4280
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:24,440
Oh, okay, great.

4281
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:26,440
Yeah.

4282
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:28,440
Owns.

4283
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:30,440
Uh...

4284
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:32,440
Hey, this guy is a Viking.

4285
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:42,440
God, they're in line

4286
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:44,440
to watch a trailer.

4287
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:46,440
It's true, it's real.

4288
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:48,440
They're in line to watch a trailer

4289
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:50,440
and the tickets for the trailer

4290
02:46:50,440 --> 02:46:52,440
have been sold out for months.

4291
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:54,440
I'm gonna kill myself.

4292
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:56,440
It's true to life.

4293
02:46:56,440 --> 02:46:58,440
Well, me killing myself

4294
02:46:58,440 --> 02:47:00,440
is also true to life.

4295
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:02,440
The problem with this is that it's not accurate

4296
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:04,440
in the sense that there's not thousands of people.

4297
02:47:04,440 --> 02:47:06,440
Yeah.

4298
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:08,440
There's only a few weirdos.

4299
02:47:08,440 --> 02:47:10,440
Instead of this just being what culture is now.

4300
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:12,440
Which is the chaos.

4301
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:14,440
Yeah.

4302
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:16,440
This girl's cute.

4303
02:47:16,440 --> 02:47:18,440
This girl's cute, I like her.

4304
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:22,440
Bucky Lucas is Thor.

4305
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:24,440
Bucky Lucas is the Norse god of thunder, sounds like a hit.

4306
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:26,440
But wait, she said an old...

4307
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:28,440
She said an old, uh...

4308
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:30,440
Viking movie.

4309
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:32,440
This is like an ad for a new one.

4310
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:34,440
So that doesn't make any sense.

4311
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:36,440
Maybe you're supposed to say that to her and she'll be like

4312
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:38,440
ah, no you fucking idiot.

4313
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:40,440
No stupid, yeah, that's the new one.

4314
02:47:40,440 --> 02:47:42,440
Bucky Lucas is a

4315
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:44,440
is a hacked fraud and

4316
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:46,440
you know, he's getting hashtag me too

4317
02:47:46,440 --> 02:47:48,440
on Twitter as we speak, so don't even speak

4318
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:50,440
that name in my presence.

4319
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:52,440
You will be shot.

4320
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:55,440
I went to Disneyland recently.

4321
02:47:55,440 --> 02:47:57,440
Yeah.

4322
02:47:57,440 --> 02:48:00,440
And the entire time on every single roller coaster

4323
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:02,440
during the drop

4324
02:48:02,440 --> 02:48:04,440
I would either say

4325
02:48:04,440 --> 02:48:06,440
Alvin, Alvin, Alvin

4326
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:08,440
exclamation point, or I would say

4327
02:48:08,440 --> 02:48:10,440
you hire James Gunn at the top of my lungs

4328
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:12,440
or rehire James Gunn rather.

4329
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:16,440
I've never been to Disneyland.

4330
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:18,440
Have you ever been to Disney World?

4331
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:20,440
No, but I think it's gay

4332
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:22,440
because it's on the East Coast.

4333
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:24,440
It's better.

4334
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:26,440
Disneyland is fake.

4335
02:48:26,440 --> 02:48:28,440
You've never been to Disneyland.

4336
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:30,440
Yeah, but it's not the real one.

4337
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:32,440
Disney World is the real one.

4338
02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:34,440
It's not even true. Have you been to Epcot?

4339
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:36,440
Yeah.

4340
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:38,440
I've never been to Epcot. I want to go to Epcot really bad.

4341
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:40,440
Yeah, there you go.

4342
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:42,440
Disney World is the real and land is a pale imitation.

4343
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:46,440
Epcot is such a weird thing.

4344
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:48,440
I had not known

4345
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:50,440
that there were more theme parks in Disney World

4346
02:48:50,440 --> 02:48:52,440
than the Magic Kingdom until like a year ago.

4347
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:54,440
And I thought it was a weird

4348
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:56,440
disturbing discovery that there were like

4349
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:58,440
three parks.

4350
02:48:58,440 --> 02:49:00,440
Look what I'm doing. Look what I'm doing right now.

4351
02:49:00,440 --> 02:49:02,440
Yeah, it's offensive.

4352
02:49:02,440 --> 02:49:04,440
It's fucking really culturally insensitive.

4353
02:49:04,440 --> 02:49:06,440
Oh no, I think that I have just had the like

4354
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:10,440
I think that just like the aspect ratio

4355
02:49:10,440 --> 02:49:12,440
of the video has been fucked up for like a long time.

4356
02:49:12,440 --> 02:49:14,440
And I've been just off screen.

4357
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:16,440
I'm looking at the video. I've been like

4358
02:49:16,440 --> 02:49:18,440
off screen, off the bottom of the screen

4359
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:20,440
for like a, oh god.

4360
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:22,440
What are we?

4361
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:24,440
Disaster.

4362
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:26,440
Absolute nightmare.

4363
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:28,440
Okay, no, no, viewers, please

4364
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:30,440
forgive me.

4365
02:49:30,440 --> 02:49:32,440
This is what they deserve.

4366
02:49:32,440 --> 02:49:34,440
This is what they deserve.

4367
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:40,440
There we go.

4368
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:42,440
I mean, they haven't been getting the full

4369
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:44,440
Pop Tropica experience.

4370
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:46,440
They have themselves lucky.

4371
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:50,440
I'm jealous of them, yeah.

4372
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:56,440
Okay, there you go.

4373
02:49:56,440 --> 02:49:58,440
Do you want to stand in line for

4374
02:49:58,440 --> 02:50:00,440
six hours and pay $125

4375
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:02,440
to see the new Avengers 4

4376
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:04,440
trailer?

4377
02:50:04,440 --> 02:50:06,440
God, yes.

4378
02:50:08,440 --> 02:50:10,440
I want to,

4379
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:12,440
I want everyone to know how much personality I have

4380
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:14,440
because I like movies.

4381
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:16,440
I'm so quirky.

4382
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:18,440
Because I like that one movie that everyone likes.

4383
02:50:18,440 --> 02:50:20,440
Okay, I've been watching

4384
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:24,440
I've been watching The Bachelor a lot recently

4385
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:26,440
for reasons I won't describe

4386
02:50:26,440 --> 02:50:28,440
and that are top secret.

4387
02:50:28,440 --> 02:50:30,440
But what's

4388
02:50:30,440 --> 02:50:32,440
interesting is that everyone has tried

4389
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:34,440
themselves as a nerd

4390
02:50:34,440 --> 02:50:36,440
and I don't.

4391
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:38,440
On The Bachelor?

4392
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:40,440
Yeah, on The Bachelor.

4393
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:44,440
Why are they nerds?

4394
02:50:44,440 --> 02:50:46,440
What was their justification?

4395
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:48,440
They just say that they're a nerd

4396
02:50:48,440 --> 02:50:50,440
and they're like, oh yeah, don't worry, I'm such a nerd too.

4397
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:52,440
I'm such a nerd.

4398
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:54,440
I get what?

4399
02:50:54,440 --> 02:50:56,440
I get what?

4400
02:50:56,440 --> 02:50:58,440
That's just the way

4401
02:50:58,440 --> 02:51:00,440
that's just what you're supposed to be.

4402
02:51:00,440 --> 02:51:02,440
You're supposed to be a nerd.

4403
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:04,440
Yeah, you're supposed to have

4404
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:06,440
niche interests like the Avengers.

4405
02:51:06,440 --> 02:51:08,440
You know,

4406
02:51:08,440 --> 02:51:10,440
like being a bachelorette.

4407
02:51:10,440 --> 02:51:12,440
You're supposed to be in each niche interest.

4408
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:16,440
You know what, you're right.

4409
02:51:16,440 --> 02:51:18,440
I am cranky lately.

4410
02:51:18,440 --> 02:51:20,440
Is it because of the Avengers?

4411
02:51:20,440 --> 02:51:22,440
It's probably because of the end of

4412
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:24,440
Infinity War.

4413
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:26,440
Yeah, bummed me out.

4414
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:28,440
I've never recovered from when I didn't

4415
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:30,440
see that movie.

4416
02:51:30,440 --> 02:51:32,440
How could you not have seen the

4417
02:51:32,440 --> 02:51:34,440
Avengers of the summer been?

4418
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:36,440
How could I have not seen the most ambitious crossover

4419
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:38,440
in history? I don't know.

4420
02:51:38,440 --> 02:51:40,440
I managed it. And look, I'm still here.

4421
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:42,440
I'm still here.

4422
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:44,440
You're still breathing.

4423
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:46,440
I'm still relevant, baby.

4424
02:51:48,440 --> 02:51:50,440
I'm supposed to find out when the

4425
02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:52,440
cosplay contest is.

4426
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:54,440
I can't wait for the PCP video

4427
02:51:54,440 --> 02:51:56,440
we've all been working on for half a year.

4428
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:58,440
The ambitious last Jedi review

4429
02:51:58,440 --> 02:52:00,440
that's going to really break new ground

4430
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:02,440
and impress everyone

4431
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:04,440
with our last Jedi.

4432
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:06,440
I can't wait for that to drop.

4433
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:08,440
We've been working on it tirelessly for months now.

4434
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:10,440
Yeah.

4435
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:12,440
The hottest of takes.

4436
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:14,440
Yeah.

4437
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:16,440
This unbelievable

4438
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:18,440
125 Fahrenheit

4439
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:20,440
taker about to throw at you.

4440
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:22,440
For you to digest.

4441
02:52:22,440 --> 02:52:24,440
You might have thought you knew

4442
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:26,440
what this movie was.

4443
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:28,440
We're going to revolutionize it.

4444
02:52:28,440 --> 02:52:30,440
Yeah.

4445
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:32,440
We basically will be

4446
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:34,440
George Lucas

4447
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:36,440
in the sense that we didn't make the movie

4448
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:38,440
and had nothing to do with it.

4449
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:42,440
Hey.

4450
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:44,440
Where do I find out where the fucking

4451
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:46,440
cosplay contest is?

4452
02:52:46,440 --> 02:52:48,440
Did you go to the bathroom already?

4453
02:52:48,440 --> 02:52:50,440
Yeah. The girl was like

4454
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:52,440
tell me when the cosplay contest is

4455
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:54,440
and I'll trade you my spot.

4456
02:52:54,440 --> 02:52:56,440
She's Christ.

4457
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:58,440
But it is costume.

4458
02:53:00,440 --> 02:53:02,440
Costume craft station.

4459
02:53:02,440 --> 02:53:04,440
Get some coffee then.

4460
02:53:04,440 --> 02:53:06,440
I have my monster absolutely

4461
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:08,440
zero.

4462
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:10,440
All right.

4463
02:53:10,440 --> 02:53:12,440
Look.

4464
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:14,440
The problem is not chemical.

4465
02:53:14,440 --> 02:53:16,440
The problem is

4466
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:18,440
the problem is

4467
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:22,440
I can't I can't be expected

4468
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:24,440
to stay away from this.

4469
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:26,440
Go get the backpack

4470
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:28,440
in the dumpster.

4471
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:30,440
Did you get the backpack in the dumpster?

4472
02:53:30,440 --> 02:53:32,440
I don't think so.

4473
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:34,440
No.

4474
02:53:34,440 --> 02:53:36,440
All right.

4475
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:38,440
Backpack in the dumpster.

4476
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:40,440
I didn't even

4477
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:42,440
backpack in the dumpster.

4478
02:53:42,440 --> 02:53:44,440
Also, if you want to, you can run back

4479
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:46,440
to the guy in the restroom line

4480
02:53:46,440 --> 02:53:48,440
and tell him who Thor is.

4481
02:53:48,440 --> 02:53:50,440
I already did that.

4482
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:52,440
Okay.

4483
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:54,440
Come on.

4484
02:53:54,440 --> 02:53:56,440
God, there's so much

4485
02:53:56,440 --> 02:53:58,440
fucking Tony the Tiger.

4486
02:53:58,440 --> 02:54:00,440
Ask her.

4487
02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:02,440
Okay.

4488
02:54:02,440 --> 02:54:04,440
Ask the next lady in line

4489
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:06,440
who's next to the guy

4490
02:54:06,440 --> 02:54:08,440
who wants to know who Thor is

4491
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:10,440
and she'll tell you in the cosplay convention.

4492
02:54:10,440 --> 02:54:12,440
No, you

4493
02:54:12,440 --> 02:54:14,440
she's the one asking me

4494
02:54:14,440 --> 02:54:16,440
when the cosplay convention is.

4495
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:18,440
That's what the fucking guide says.

4496
02:54:18,440 --> 02:54:20,440
Well, it's wrong.

4497
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:22,440
Next to the

4498
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:24,440
next to the Thor guy?

4499
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:26,440
Oh, wait.

4500
02:54:26,440 --> 02:54:28,440
Oh, like this lady?

4501
02:54:28,440 --> 02:54:30,440
Next to the Thor person.

4502
02:54:30,440 --> 02:54:32,440
No, not that Thor.

4503
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:34,440
The guy who wants to know who Thor is.

4504
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:36,440
The person in line is the one

4505
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:38,440
that asked me when the cosplay contest is.

4506
02:54:40,440 --> 02:54:42,440
Okay.

4507
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:44,440
Let me see.

4508
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:50,440
Also,

4509
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:52,440
I know there were...

4510
02:54:52,440 --> 02:54:54,440
Okay, here's a dumpster.

4511
02:54:54,440 --> 02:54:56,440
But there's no backpack.

4512
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:58,440
Alright, run to the convention center

4513
02:54:58,440 --> 02:55:00,440
and hop to the second level.

4514
02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:02,440
There you'll find a picture of Lance Pitcher

4515
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:04,440
dresses what it looks like

4516
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:06,440
a goggle-wearing adventurer with a pirate sword.

4517
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:08,440
This poster will also say the cosplay contest

4518
02:55:08,440 --> 02:55:10,440
starts at noon. Click at the poster.

4519
02:55:10,440 --> 02:55:12,440
Go back to the lady and remind her

4520
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:14,440
and she'll trade her spot.

4521
02:55:14,440 --> 02:55:16,440
Okay, where's the poster?

4522
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:18,440
It's the convention center's second level.

4523
02:55:18,440 --> 02:55:20,440
Uh, okay.

4524
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:22,440
I think that's the one where

4525
02:55:22,440 --> 02:55:24,440
the people are waiting, so I think that's this one.

4526
02:55:24,440 --> 02:55:26,440
Probably.

4527
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:28,440
Mmm.

4528
02:55:30,440 --> 02:55:32,440
Alright.

4529
02:55:32,440 --> 02:55:34,440
Cosplay contest at noon.

4530
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:36,440
There it is.

4531
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:38,440
Costume contest at noon, eh?

4532
02:55:38,440 --> 02:55:40,440
Oh.

4533
02:55:40,440 --> 02:55:42,440
Cheers.

4534
02:55:42,440 --> 02:55:44,440
Cheers to that.

4535
02:55:44,440 --> 02:55:46,440
Oh, yeah.

4536
02:55:46,440 --> 02:55:48,440
What?

4537
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:50,440
What's this?

4538
02:55:50,440 --> 02:55:52,440
Slauncha.

4539
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:54,440
Yeah, Slauncha.

4540
02:55:54,440 --> 02:55:56,440
Did you, in fact, see

4541
02:55:56,440 --> 02:55:58,440
the periodical

4542
02:55:58,440 --> 02:56:00,440
post of the Flash Jedi?

4543
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:02,440
Have you seen the Periodic Table

4544
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:04,440
of Star Wars?

4545
02:56:04,440 --> 02:56:06,440
Have you seen the Periodic Table

4546
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:08,440
of Star Wars?

4547
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:10,440
You got C-3-P-M, R2-D-Tunium,

4548
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:12,440
you got Obi-Wan-Kinobium.

4549
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:14,440
You see, the laughs never stop.

4550
02:56:14,440 --> 02:56:16,440
You see, I'm a nerd

4551
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:18,440
because I can memorize the Periodic Table.

4552
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:20,440
Oh.

4553
02:56:20,440 --> 02:56:22,440
Yeah, I remember the first

4554
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:24,440
10 digits of Pi.

4555
02:56:24,440 --> 02:56:26,440
Yeah, I know Biggie.

4556
02:56:26,440 --> 02:56:28,440
You know, Nate has like 100 digits

4557
02:56:28,440 --> 02:56:30,440
of Pi memorized.

4558
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:32,440
Why? I don't know.

4559
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:34,440
Because he's such a nerd.

4560
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:36,440
Yeah.

4561
02:56:36,440 --> 02:56:38,440
Only the one

4562
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:40,440
who wields the power amulet

4563
02:56:40,440 --> 02:56:42,440
can displace me.

4564
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:44,440
The Cheetah Bandit has it.

4565
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:46,440
The Cheetah Bandit.

4566
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:48,440
Ah, Jesus Christ.

4567
02:56:48,440 --> 02:56:50,440
The Cheetah Bandit.

4568
02:56:50,440 --> 02:56:52,440
You mean Tony the Tiger?

4569
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:56,440
Tony the Tiger should be an artist again.

4570
02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:58,440
Do you mean Cheeto Man?

4571
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:00,440
I think you might mean Cheeto Man

4572
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:02,440
from Tales Get Strolled.

4573
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:08,440
Tell your dog that I hate it.

4574
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:10,440
Thanks. I will.

4575
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:12,440
Good.

4576
02:57:16,440 --> 02:57:18,440
Don't worry, the feeling's mutual.

4577
02:57:18,440 --> 02:57:20,440
Oh, Cheeto. Cheeto Bandit.

4578
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:22,440
Cheeto Bandit.

4579
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:26,440
Fucking hell.

4580
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:28,440
Got backtracked.

4581
02:57:28,440 --> 02:57:30,440
The power amulet cannot be given.

4582
02:57:30,440 --> 02:57:32,440
It can only be beat me to the top

4583
02:57:32,440 --> 02:57:34,440
of the water tower.

4584
02:57:34,440 --> 02:57:36,440
This is just one big fetch quest

4585
02:57:36,440 --> 02:57:38,440
to get into a fucking convention

4586
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:40,440
to watch a trailer of the Avengers.

4587
02:57:40,440 --> 02:57:42,440
Yeah.

4588
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:44,440
It's a big fetch quest to watch a trailer.

4589
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:48,440
Is that the point?

4590
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:50,440
Yeah, it's the point.

4591
02:57:50,440 --> 02:57:52,440
Are you sure?

4592
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:54,440
Yeah, you want a ticket to get it.

4593
02:57:54,440 --> 02:57:56,440
Really?

4594
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:58,440
That's what we're after here?

4595
02:57:58,440 --> 02:58:00,440
Yeah.

4596
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:02,440
Oh, motherfucker.

4597
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:04,440
What? I fell.

4598
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:07,440
I failed in my task.

4599
02:58:09,440 --> 02:58:11,440
This is a nightmare.

4600
02:58:11,440 --> 02:58:13,440
Yeah.

4601
02:58:18,440 --> 02:58:20,440
Somebody please end it.

4602
02:58:24,440 --> 02:58:26,440
Oh, no, no, no.

4603
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:28,440
I gotta learn the path.

4604
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:30,440
I gotta learn the path.

4605
02:58:30,440 --> 02:58:32,440
Okay.

4606
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:34,440
Get up here.

4607
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:36,440
Get on the window.

4608
02:58:36,440 --> 02:58:38,440
Get on the window seal.

4609
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:44,440
How do I...

4610
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:46,440
Do you see anywhere that I could jump to?

4611
02:58:48,440 --> 02:58:50,440
I mean, up on that little...

4612
02:58:50,440 --> 02:58:52,440
Go to the right, maybe?

4613
02:58:52,440 --> 02:58:54,440
On the window seal?

4614
02:58:54,440 --> 02:58:56,440
Oh, wait.

4615
02:58:56,440 --> 02:58:58,440
Okay, I gotta bounce on this clothesline.

4616
02:58:58,440 --> 02:59:00,440
Yeah, yeah.

4617
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:02,440
Alright, well, I failed.

4618
02:59:02,440 --> 02:59:04,440
The power of good triumphs again.

4619
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:06,440
Yeah, right.

4620
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:08,440
Wait, what?

4621
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:10,440
Oh, you have to race him.

4622
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:12,440
Yeah, it's a race.

4623
02:59:12,440 --> 02:59:14,440
Yeah, it's a bad video game.

4624
02:59:14,440 --> 02:59:16,440
Oh, well, you fucked up and you should stop.

4625
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:18,440
No, no, no.

4626
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:20,440
Oh, you're ahead.

4627
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:22,440
I just used a shortcut.

4628
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:24,440
Do you see that?

4629
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:26,440
Yeah, that was crazy.

4630
02:59:26,440 --> 02:59:28,440
Yeah, crazy.

4631
02:59:28,440 --> 02:59:32,440
That was crazy how I won this game.

4632
02:59:32,440 --> 02:59:34,440
Cheetah's never prospered.

4633
02:59:34,440 --> 02:59:36,440
Whoa, the whole thing was just for that pun.

4634
02:59:36,440 --> 02:59:38,440
Hmm.

4635
02:59:38,440 --> 02:59:40,440
Heck's cool.

4636
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:42,440
I don't get it.

4637
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:44,440
I don't get any of this.

4638
02:59:44,440 --> 02:59:46,440
You know what they say, Ben?

4639
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:48,440
There's no way out.

4640
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:52,440
You know what they say?

4641
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:56,440
Last year, I was a 4.5 out of 10.

4642
02:59:56,440 --> 02:59:58,440
Ugh.

4643
02:59:58,440 --> 03:00:00,440
Wow, guys.

4644
03:00:00,440 --> 03:00:02,440
Did you know there's no gravity in space

4645
03:00:02,440 --> 03:00:04,440
so that when they drop the bombs,

4646
03:00:04,440 --> 03:00:06,440
they would just float?

4647
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:08,440
Did you know that the Star Killer

4648
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:10,440
base is like bigger

4649
03:00:10,440 --> 03:00:12,440
than the Death Star?

4650
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:14,440
And that's stupid because

4651
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:16,440
fucking, it's stupid.

4652
03:00:16,440 --> 03:00:18,440
Yeah, like why would it be

4653
03:00:18,440 --> 03:00:20,440
bigger than the Death Star?

4654
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:22,440
It's retarded.

4655
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:24,440
Why are they the resistance

4656
03:00:24,440 --> 03:00:26,440
if they're

4657
03:00:26,440 --> 03:00:28,440
the good guys

4658
03:00:28,440 --> 03:00:30,440
and they're already in charge?

4659
03:00:32,440 --> 03:00:34,440
I'm in a real hurry.

4660
03:00:34,440 --> 03:00:36,440
Can I cut past you?

4661
03:00:36,440 --> 03:00:38,440
Only the one who goes the Power Emerald.

4662
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:40,440
Yeah, I got it.

4663
03:00:40,440 --> 03:00:42,440
Mark Davis.

4664
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:44,440
I mean,

4665
03:00:44,440 --> 03:00:46,440
Steven Spielberg.

4666
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:48,440
I mean, George, I mean,

4667
03:00:48,440 --> 03:00:50,440
Andy Warhol,

4668
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:52,440
director of Back to the Jedi

4669
03:00:52,440 --> 03:00:54,440
by my hands.

4670
03:00:54,440 --> 03:00:56,440
He's such a fucking idiot.

4671
03:00:56,440 --> 03:00:58,440
He made such a shitty movie.

4672
03:00:58,440 --> 03:01:00,440
Can you believe how stupid he is?

4673
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:02,440
Andy Williams?

4674
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:04,440
Yeah, yeah.

4675
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:06,440
Wait.

4676
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:08,440
Can't believe how idiot he is.

4677
03:01:08,440 --> 03:01:10,440
If you can trade me

4678
03:01:10,440 --> 03:01:12,440
the Fremulon Mask from the booth?

4679
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:16,440
I mean, I can get the Fremulon Mask.

4680
03:01:16,440 --> 03:01:18,440
That's easy.

4681
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:24,440
I am...

4682
03:01:24,440 --> 03:01:26,440
I'm feeling cold.

4683
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:28,440
I'm feeling cold in my extremities.

4684
03:01:28,440 --> 03:01:30,440
I think this game is

4685
03:01:30,440 --> 03:01:32,440
giving me diabetes.

4686
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:34,440
Hold on.

4687
03:01:34,440 --> 03:01:36,440
PopTropica Worlds is the sequel to PopTropica.

4688
03:01:36,440 --> 03:01:38,440
Maybe we've been playing the wrong game.

4689
03:01:38,440 --> 03:01:40,440
Maybe we should be playing the sequel to PopTropica.

4690
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:42,440
Ooh.

4691
03:01:42,440 --> 03:01:44,440
Gosh, you're mine.

4692
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:46,440
Okay.

4693
03:01:46,440 --> 03:01:48,440
So I got the Fremulon Mask.

4694
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:50,440
What the fuck is happening here?

4695
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:52,440
I wonder if this will...

4696
03:01:52,440 --> 03:01:54,440
I wonder if this will do the trick.

4697
03:01:54,440 --> 03:01:56,440
I have a feeling no.

4698
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:58,440
I want to see when the last island was added.

4699
03:01:58,440 --> 03:02:00,440
Yesterday.

4700
03:02:00,440 --> 03:02:02,440
Twenty-four hours ago.

4701
03:02:02,440 --> 03:02:04,440
They're adding...

4702
03:02:04,440 --> 03:02:06,440
They're adding...

4703
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:08,440
They're literally adding new islands every day.

4704
03:02:08,440 --> 03:02:10,440
They're adding islands faster than you can even play

4705
03:02:10,440 --> 03:02:12,440
the game.

4706
03:02:12,440 --> 03:02:14,440
They're adding islands faster than you can even play them.

4707
03:02:16,440 --> 03:02:18,440
Alright. Crisis Caverns.

4708
03:02:18,440 --> 03:02:20,440
May 23rd, 2017.

4709
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:24,440
May 23rd?

4710
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,440
27...

4711
03:02:26,440 --> 03:02:28,440
Okay, so like a year and a half ago.

4712
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:30,440
So almost as long ago as the last time

4713
03:02:30,440 --> 03:02:32,440
you were in Boston.

4714
03:02:32,440 --> 03:02:34,440
Hey.

4715
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:36,440
It's very funny then.

4716
03:02:36,440 --> 03:02:38,440
Yeah. Hey.

4717
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:40,440
What do I do?

4718
03:02:40,440 --> 03:02:42,440
So I'm wearing...

4719
03:02:42,440 --> 03:02:44,440
I'm wearing the Fremulon Mask.

4720
03:02:44,440 --> 03:02:46,440
He says he wants me to trade him a Fremulon Mask

4721
03:02:46,440 --> 03:02:48,440
from the booth.

4722
03:02:48,440 --> 03:02:50,440
I guess I have to buy it?

4723
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:52,440
Money?

4724
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:54,440
Yeah, maybe.

4725
03:02:56,440 --> 03:02:58,440
Look.

4726
03:02:58,440 --> 03:03:00,440
See?

4727
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:04,440
You want... Oh, you want this mask?

4728
03:03:04,440 --> 03:03:06,440
See if you can carry on a basic conversation

4729
03:03:06,440 --> 03:03:08,440
in our language.

4730
03:03:08,440 --> 03:03:10,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4731
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:12,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4732
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:14,440
That's not right. You should study your Fremulon.

4733
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:16,440
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

4734
03:03:16,440 --> 03:03:18,440
Uh...

4735
03:03:18,440 --> 03:03:20,440
Okay.

4736
03:03:20,440 --> 03:03:22,440
How are you?

4737
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:24,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4738
03:03:24,440 --> 03:03:26,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4739
03:03:26,440 --> 03:03:28,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4740
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:30,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4741
03:03:30,440 --> 03:03:32,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4742
03:03:32,440 --> 03:03:34,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4743
03:03:34,440 --> 03:03:36,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4744
03:03:36,440 --> 03:03:38,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4745
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:40,440
Alright. I think I got it.

4746
03:03:40,440 --> 03:03:42,440
I hate Star Trek.

4747
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:44,440
Uh...

4748
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:46,440
Here. No, no, no. Check this out.

4749
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:48,440
Check this out.

4750
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:50,440
Scram... Okay.

4751
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:52,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4752
03:03:52,440 --> 03:03:54,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4753
03:03:54,440 --> 03:03:56,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4754
03:03:56,440 --> 03:03:58,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4755
03:03:58,440 --> 03:04:00,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4756
03:04:00,440 --> 03:04:02,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4757
03:04:02,440 --> 03:04:04,440
Scram Beelzebub.

4758
03:04:04,440 --> 03:04:06,440
I really did it. Okay. There we go.

4759
03:04:06,440 --> 03:04:08,440
And...

4760
03:04:08,440 --> 03:04:10,440
You really did it.

4761
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:12,440
I really learned a lot today about...

4762
03:04:12,440 --> 03:04:14,440
About the nature of trust and friendship

4763
03:04:14,440 --> 03:04:16,440
and how it all means fucking nothing.

4764
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:18,440
About... Yeah.

4765
03:04:18,440 --> 03:04:20,440
It's not... It's all about what you like.

4766
03:04:20,440 --> 03:04:22,440
Not what you are like.

4767
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:24,440
And what I like

4768
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:26,440
is Star Wars.

4769
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:28,440
Did you...

4770
03:04:28,440 --> 03:04:30,440
Did you make that after that?

4771
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:32,440
It's not about what you're like, it's about what you like.

4772
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:34,440
No.

4773
03:04:34,440 --> 03:04:36,440
That's from

4774
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:38,440
a movie. I don't know what movie.

4775
03:04:38,440 --> 03:04:40,440
But it's got... But it's Star's...

4776
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:42,440
God.

4777
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:44,440
Who's Rocky?

4778
03:04:44,440 --> 03:04:46,440
Rocky Beelzebub.

4779
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:48,440
Yeah, no, no. Who's the actor?

4780
03:04:48,440 --> 03:04:50,440
Sylvester Stallone.

4781
03:04:50,440 --> 03:04:52,440
Yeah, it was a Sylvester Stallone movie.

4782
03:04:52,440 --> 03:04:54,440
And I don't know what movie it is,

4783
03:04:54,440 --> 03:04:56,440
but Innuendo Studios referenced it in a video

4784
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:58,440
and he's played that clip of Sylvester Stallone saying

4785
03:04:58,440 --> 03:05:00,440
it's about what you like,

4786
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:02,440
but it's not what you are like.

4787
03:05:02,440 --> 03:05:04,440
And, you know,

4788
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:06,440
never has that been more true than Comic-Con.

4789
03:05:06,440 --> 03:05:08,440
Heyo.

4790
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:10,440
Heyo.

4791
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:12,440
I'm thinking about coming to Boston for Halloween,

4792
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:14,440
but I don't know how long I'll be able to do it.

4793
03:05:14,440 --> 03:05:16,440
I hate Halloween.

4794
03:05:16,440 --> 03:05:18,440
It's a retard holiday for faggots.

4795
03:05:18,440 --> 03:05:20,440
Oh, I fucking hate you. How could you...

4796
03:05:20,440 --> 03:05:22,440
Why? Why do you think it's gay?

4797
03:05:22,440 --> 03:05:24,440
There's nothing good about it.

4798
03:05:24,440 --> 03:05:26,440
It's a scary holiday.

4799
03:05:26,440 --> 03:05:28,440
It's a time to indulge in scary things.

4800
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:30,440
It's not scary. It's boring.

4801
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:32,440
It's not scary. It's boring.

4802
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:34,440
What do you... Okay.

4803
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:36,440
Sure, the last of the Halloween

4804
03:05:36,440 --> 03:05:38,440
may not have been fun,

4805
03:05:38,440 --> 03:05:40,440
but it's all about the people you're with.

4806
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:42,440
Um...

4807
03:05:42,440 --> 03:05:44,440
I guess...

4808
03:05:44,440 --> 03:05:46,440
I...

4809
03:05:46,440 --> 03:05:48,440
Halloween's great if you know how to spend it.

4810
03:05:48,440 --> 03:05:50,440
Well, anything's...

4811
03:05:50,440 --> 03:05:52,440
Any day is fun

4812
03:05:52,440 --> 03:05:54,440
if you spend it with people that are fun.

4813
03:05:54,440 --> 03:05:56,440
Idiot.

4814
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:58,440
Yeah, this is not...

4815
03:05:58,440 --> 03:06:00,440
You've convinced me of nothing.

4816
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:02,440
I'm saying

4817
03:06:02,440 --> 03:06:04,440
as if I was there

4818
03:06:04,440 --> 03:06:06,440
and we all met up,

4819
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:08,440
it'd be a great Halloween.

4820
03:06:08,440 --> 03:06:10,440
I guess.

4821
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:12,440
Not because Halloween's any good,

4822
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:14,440
because it's not. It's dumb and...

4823
03:06:14,440 --> 03:06:16,440
I don't know.

4824
03:06:16,440 --> 03:06:18,440
It's just embarrassing.

4825
03:06:18,440 --> 03:06:20,440
Why is it embarrassing?

4826
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:22,440
The whole spooky conceit of it

4827
03:06:22,440 --> 03:06:24,440
is dumb and embarrassing

4828
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:26,440
anyway.

4829
03:06:26,440 --> 03:06:28,440
It's just a boring hassle

4830
03:06:28,440 --> 03:06:30,440
for nothing.

4831
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:32,440
It's like owning a pet.

4832
03:06:32,440 --> 03:06:34,440
Celebrating Halloween is similar to owning a pet,

4833
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:36,440
and that you should be ashamed of yourself if you do it.

4834
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:38,440
Owning a pet makes you human.

4835
03:06:38,440 --> 03:06:40,440
It's the only way that we can distinguish

4836
03:06:40,440 --> 03:06:42,440
ourselves from animals as if we own

4837
03:06:42,440 --> 03:06:44,440
and subjugate animals.

4838
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:46,440
Did we own them?

4839
03:06:46,440 --> 03:06:48,440
Uh...

4840
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:50,440
Oh, god.

4841
03:06:50,440 --> 03:06:52,440
Okay, I guess I need glue

4842
03:06:52,440 --> 03:06:54,440
and

4843
03:06:54,440 --> 03:06:56,440
a backpack.

4844
03:06:58,440 --> 03:07:00,440
Um...

4845
03:07:02,440 --> 03:07:04,440
Wait, no.

4846
03:07:04,440 --> 03:07:06,440
I need...

4847
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:08,440
I need... Yeah, okay.

4848
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:10,440
I need glue and I need spray paint

4849
03:07:10,440 --> 03:07:12,440
or spray...

4850
03:07:12,440 --> 03:07:14,440
something.

4851
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:16,440
I have the backpack straps.

4852
03:07:16,440 --> 03:07:18,440
I have the watch parts. I have the bottles.

4853
03:07:18,440 --> 03:07:20,440
Can you, uh...

4854
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:22,440
Uh...

4855
03:07:22,440 --> 03:07:24,440
If you can replace

4856
03:07:24,440 --> 03:07:26,440
my busted jetpack, you can

4857
03:07:26,440 --> 03:07:28,440
steam right past me.

4858
03:07:28,440 --> 03:07:30,440
Yeah, yeah, I gotta have steam punk...

4859
03:07:30,440 --> 03:07:32,440
I gotta have watch parts for my steam punk backpack.

4860
03:07:32,440 --> 03:07:34,440
Christ, stupid.

4861
03:07:34,440 --> 03:07:36,440
I just need... Steampunk and Doctor Who

4862
03:07:36,440 --> 03:07:38,440
are, like, my least favorite things

4863
03:07:38,440 --> 03:07:40,440
in society.

4864
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:42,440
I don't know anything about Doctor Who, but I feel like

4865
03:07:42,440 --> 03:07:44,440
I wouldn't like it if I did.

4866
03:07:44,440 --> 03:07:46,440
I hate anyone

4867
03:07:46,440 --> 03:07:48,440
who, like,

4868
03:07:48,440 --> 03:07:50,440
likes anything about Doctor Who. I hate people who are, like,

4869
03:07:50,440 --> 03:07:52,440
like, fezzes are cool.

4870
03:07:52,440 --> 03:07:54,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4871
03:07:54,440 --> 03:07:56,440
People that like Doctor Who are awful.

4872
03:07:56,440 --> 03:07:58,440
Oh, there's some glue.

4873
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:00,440
Well, I remember when

4874
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:02,440
Vincent van Gogh cried.

4875
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:06,440
Um, what?

4876
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:08,440
I remember when Vincent van Gogh cried

4877
03:08:08,440 --> 03:08:10,440
in Doctor Who.

4878
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:12,440
Uh...

4879
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:14,440
Eee, Vincent van Gogh.

4880
03:08:14,440 --> 03:08:16,440
Did that really happen?

4881
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:18,440
Yeah, he cried.

4882
03:08:18,440 --> 03:08:20,440
That's funny.

4883
03:08:20,440 --> 03:08:22,440
Well, I mean, I think so.

4884
03:08:22,440 --> 03:08:24,440
Um...

4885
03:08:24,440 --> 03:08:26,440
Oh, look, it's a jetpack now!

4886
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:34,440
Oh, perfect. You know what?

4887
03:08:34,440 --> 03:08:36,440
That works.

4888
03:08:36,440 --> 03:08:38,440
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

4889
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:40,440
I've done good work here today.

4890
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:42,440
The only cosplay was that easy.

4891
03:08:42,440 --> 03:08:44,440
Basically is.

4892
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:46,440
Yeah.

4893
03:08:46,440 --> 03:08:48,440
If you've got boobs,

4894
03:08:48,440 --> 03:08:50,440
cosplay is just that easy.

4895
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:52,440
You don't have...

4896
03:08:52,440 --> 03:08:54,440
There's no craft involved in making a thing.

4897
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:56,440
That looks like a thing.

4898
03:08:56,440 --> 03:08:58,440
I'll give them one to ten. How much do you respect cosplayers?

4899
03:08:58,440 --> 03:09:00,440
If they make the costumes,

4900
03:09:00,440 --> 03:09:02,440
right,

4901
03:09:02,440 --> 03:09:04,440
if they craft the costumes themselves,

4902
03:09:04,440 --> 03:09:06,440
they might reach...

4903
03:09:08,440 --> 03:09:10,440
Okay, so cosplayers meaning

4904
03:09:10,440 --> 03:09:12,440
that they're making like an established character,

4905
03:09:12,440 --> 03:09:14,440
we're not talking about like original

4906
03:09:14,440 --> 03:09:16,440
characters and costumes,

4907
03:09:16,440 --> 03:09:18,440
then maybe a seven at tops.

4908
03:09:18,440 --> 03:09:20,440
Seven and a half on a good day.

4909
03:09:22,440 --> 03:09:24,440
And that's only if they've mastered their craft.

4910
03:09:24,440 --> 03:09:26,440
That's the height to which they can aspire.

4911
03:09:32,440 --> 03:09:34,440
What's the lowest we would respect the cosplayer?

4912
03:09:34,440 --> 03:09:36,440
I mean, I guess one.

4913
03:09:36,440 --> 03:09:38,440
There's no lower limit.

4914
03:09:38,440 --> 03:09:40,440
Oh, there she goes.

4915
03:09:40,440 --> 03:09:42,440
Escaping from above.

4916
03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:48,440
Can we watch the fucking trailer yet?

4917
03:09:48,440 --> 03:09:50,440
No.

4918
03:09:50,440 --> 03:09:52,440
Enjoy yourself in there.

4919
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:54,440
I kept it nice and warm for you.

4920
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:56,440
Great.

4921
03:09:56,440 --> 03:09:58,440
Gross.

4922
03:09:58,440 --> 03:10:00,440
Why am I even in here?

4923
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:04,440
What did you just do?

4924
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:06,440
Oh, I left...

4925
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:08,440
in the bathroom.

4926
03:10:08,440 --> 03:10:10,440
Jesus Christ.

4927
03:10:10,440 --> 03:10:12,440
And nobody took it for some reason.

4928
03:10:12,440 --> 03:10:14,440
Mighty action force.

4929
03:10:18,440 --> 03:10:20,440
I don't know whether this

4930
03:10:20,440 --> 03:10:22,440
or an actual convention would be more

4931
03:10:22,440 --> 03:10:24,440
miserable and soul-crushing.

4932
03:10:24,440 --> 03:10:26,440
I think it's a toss-up.

4933
03:10:26,440 --> 03:10:28,440
They've really both got their strengths.

4934
03:10:28,440 --> 03:10:30,440
Mm-hmm.

4935
03:10:36,440 --> 03:10:38,440
When's RFCKCon gonna happen?

4936
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:40,440
It's only gonna be the only good convention center.

4937
03:10:42,440 --> 03:10:44,440
Just imagine RFC...

4938
03:10:44,440 --> 03:10:46,440
Imagine the convention center just flooded

4939
03:10:46,440 --> 03:10:48,440
with wayward youths all committing

4940
03:10:48,440 --> 03:10:50,440
violence against one another.

4941
03:10:50,440 --> 03:10:52,440
Mm-hmm.

4942
03:10:52,440 --> 03:10:54,440
We're gonna legalize violence.

4943
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:56,440
Yeah, for one glorious weekend,

4944
03:10:56,440 --> 03:10:58,440
violence will be legal

4945
03:10:58,440 --> 03:11:00,440
in the Boston Convention Center

4946
03:11:00,440 --> 03:11:02,440
or whatever it's called.

4947
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:04,440
Uh...

4948
03:11:04,440 --> 03:11:06,440
Ugh.

4949
03:11:06,440 --> 03:11:08,440
Fuck. What was I doing?

4950
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:10,440
Oh, yes. I wanted to give you

4951
03:11:10,440 --> 03:11:12,440
something.

4952
03:11:12,440 --> 03:11:14,440
I found your look before.

4953
03:11:14,440 --> 03:11:16,440
Hey, I no longer look like your friends.

4954
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:18,440
But it doesn't matter.

4955
03:11:18,440 --> 03:11:20,440
Wait, what?

4956
03:11:20,440 --> 03:11:22,440
That whole thing was for nothing.

4957
03:11:22,440 --> 03:11:24,440
What?

4958
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:26,440
That whole thing was for nothing. The deal's off.

4959
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:28,440
Why?

4960
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:30,440
Because the thing that you wanted

4961
03:11:30,440 --> 03:11:32,440
was in the bathroom and bathrooms are gross.

4962
03:11:36,440 --> 03:11:38,440
What?

4963
03:11:38,440 --> 03:11:40,440
Everything I've done was for naught.

4964
03:11:40,440 --> 03:11:42,440
No, it can't be. It was on the walkthrough.

4965
03:11:42,440 --> 03:11:44,440
I mean, yeah, obviously I did...

4966
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:46,440
In terms of the game,

4967
03:11:46,440 --> 03:11:48,440
I did have to do it.

4968
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:50,440
But, like...

4969
03:11:50,440 --> 03:11:52,440
...

4970
03:11:52,440 --> 03:11:54,440
plot-wise, no.

4971
03:12:00,440 --> 03:12:02,440
Lovingly...

4972
03:12:02,440 --> 03:12:04,440
you sound wistful.

4973
03:12:04,440 --> 03:12:06,440
I'd like to go to the...

4974
03:12:06,440 --> 03:12:08,440
All right, now you need to make yourself look like Thor.

4975
03:12:08,440 --> 03:12:10,440
Customize the beard the first guy

4976
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:12,440
in the line is wearing.

4977
03:12:12,440 --> 03:12:14,440
Oh, okay.

4978
03:12:14,440 --> 03:12:16,440
Go to the parking line,

4979
03:12:16,440 --> 03:12:18,440
customize the chainmail suit the girl

4980
03:12:18,440 --> 03:12:20,440
is wearing. Just make yourself look like Thor.

4981
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:24,440
Um, all right.

4982
03:12:24,440 --> 03:12:26,440
So...

4983
03:12:26,440 --> 03:12:28,440
Okay, the costumeizer...

4984
03:12:28,440 --> 03:12:30,440
Okay, any chainmail from the costumeizer...

4985
03:12:30,440 --> 03:12:32,440
thing.

4986
03:12:32,440 --> 03:12:34,440
And I need a beard

4987
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:36,440
from the guy.

4988
03:12:36,440 --> 03:12:38,440
You need a Viking hat

4989
03:12:38,440 --> 03:12:40,440
from when the guy's in the restrooms.

4990
03:12:40,440 --> 03:12:42,440
You need a cape from a girl.

4991
03:12:44,440 --> 03:12:46,440
This guy's got a Viking hat.

4992
03:12:46,440 --> 03:12:48,440
Yeah, so probably...

4993
03:12:48,440 --> 03:12:50,440
Will that do?

4994
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:52,440
Maybe.

4995
03:12:58,440 --> 03:13:00,440
I just want to watch

4996
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:02,440
the Mighty Action Force trailer.

4997
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:04,440
That's all I want.

4998
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:06,440
Just wait 24 hours

4999
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:08,440
and it'll be on YouTube. God damn it.

5000
03:13:08,440 --> 03:13:10,440
Is that so much to ask?

5001
03:13:10,440 --> 03:13:12,440
No, I need it now.

5002
03:13:12,440 --> 03:13:14,440
I have to run around the convention center and get in.

5003
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:16,440
Well, I can wear a Viking hat over my wizard hat.

5004
03:13:18,440 --> 03:13:20,440
That's good shit.

5005
03:13:20,440 --> 03:13:22,440
Oh, no.

5006
03:13:22,440 --> 03:13:24,440
Oh, yeah.

5007
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:26,440
Oh, you've changed everything.

5008
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:28,440
You look so different now.

5009
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:30,440
Yeah, well, you know.

5010
03:13:30,440 --> 03:13:32,440
Oh, yeah, there we go.

5011
03:13:32,440 --> 03:13:34,440
Now we're talking.

5012
03:13:34,440 --> 03:13:36,440
Why can't I equip his fucking

5013
03:13:36,440 --> 03:13:38,440
like, shirt?

5014
03:13:38,440 --> 03:13:40,440
It's forbidden.

5015
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:42,440
Why...

5016
03:13:42,440 --> 03:13:44,440
Why is it not letting me equip

5017
03:13:44,440 --> 03:13:46,440
the fucking torso?

5018
03:13:46,440 --> 03:13:48,440
I just want to equip his clothes.

5019
03:13:48,440 --> 03:13:50,440
Fine, whatever.

5020
03:13:50,440 --> 03:13:52,440
Alright, well, I've got the beard.

5021
03:13:52,440 --> 03:13:54,440
I guess.

5022
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:56,440
Uh, where'd you say that was chain mail?

5023
03:13:58,440 --> 03:14:00,440
Uh, let me see.

5024
03:14:00,440 --> 03:14:02,440
I think it's near the bathroom.

5025
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:04,440
Okay.

5026
03:14:04,440 --> 03:14:06,440
No, no, no, no. It's the Forge Refinery.

5027
03:14:06,440 --> 03:14:08,440
The Forge Refinery?

5028
03:14:08,440 --> 03:14:10,440
Yeah, yeah.

5029
03:14:10,440 --> 03:14:12,440
It's where you made the jet pack.

5030
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:14,440
Oh, sure.

5031
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:16,440
Oh, the Forge Refinery, yeah.

5032
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:24,440
Let's see.

5033
03:14:24,440 --> 03:14:26,440
Costumize.

5034
03:14:26,440 --> 03:14:28,440
Chain mail, look at the chain mail.

5035
03:14:28,440 --> 03:14:30,440
Ooh, I just got...

5036
03:14:30,440 --> 03:14:32,440
Check it out, I got some anime hair now.

5037
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:34,440
Yeah. Awesome.

5038
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:36,440
Okay, I got chain mail.

5039
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:38,440
Uh, am I good?

5040
03:14:38,440 --> 03:14:40,440
Yeah, you're good.

5041
03:14:40,440 --> 03:14:42,440
Well, I mean, you need more things.

5042
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:44,440
Okay.

5043
03:14:44,440 --> 03:14:46,440
What do I need?

5044
03:14:46,440 --> 03:14:48,440
Uh, uh, costume...

5045
03:14:48,440 --> 03:14:50,440
Okay, go to the restrooms.

5046
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:52,440
Costumize the nearest guy's bike and hat.

5047
03:14:52,440 --> 03:14:54,440
Maybe you need a different bike and hat.

5048
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:56,440
Alright.

5049
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:58,440
Go to the bathroom.

5050
03:15:00,440 --> 03:15:02,440
I think you just got a...

5051
03:15:02,440 --> 03:15:04,440
You just got a Saunter Pass Tony the Tiger over here.

5052
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:06,440
Oh, wait, my beard is gone. Fuck.

5053
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:10,440
Oh, okay.

5054
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:12,440
It's probably this dude's horned helmet.

5055
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:14,440
Yeah, yeah.

5056
03:15:16,440 --> 03:15:18,440
That's so...

5057
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:20,440
I mean, how am I supposed to know which Viking hat?

5058
03:15:22,440 --> 03:15:24,440
When there's like ten of them.

5059
03:15:24,440 --> 03:15:26,440
Oh my god, look at my hair.

5060
03:15:26,440 --> 03:15:28,440
Oh, Jesus Christ.

5061
03:15:30,440 --> 03:15:32,440
Hell...

5062
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:34,440
Yeah.

5063
03:15:34,440 --> 03:15:36,440
I don't want to lose that cop killer purple.

5064
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:38,440
No, of course not.

5065
03:15:38,440 --> 03:15:40,440
Okay, so I've got a Viking hat.

5066
03:15:40,440 --> 03:15:42,440
I've got a hammer and chain mail.

5067
03:15:42,440 --> 03:15:44,440
Okay, I lost the beard, but I know where to get it.

5068
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:46,440
I've got...

5069
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:48,440
Okay, I lost the beard, but I know where to get it.

5070
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:50,440
Okay, I lost the beard, but I know where to get it.

5071
03:16:02,440 --> 03:16:04,440
Thank god I've got...

5072
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:06,440
Thank God I've got all this Mio energy.

5073
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:10,440
Yeah, what would you do without it?

5074
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:12,440
I've got a little bit of pineapple strawberry smash.

5075
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:17,200
pineapple strawberry smash, and when that's done I've got black cherry, I've got wicked

5076
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:22,720
blue citrus, and I've got my personal favorite, green thunder.

5077
03:16:22,720 --> 03:16:23,720
Ugh.

5078
03:16:23,720 --> 03:16:24,720
Ugh.

5079
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:30,520
How you feelin' there, Ben?

5080
03:16:30,520 --> 03:16:32,840
I love video games.

5081
03:16:32,840 --> 03:16:34,320
I can hear it in your voice.

5082
03:16:34,320 --> 03:16:35,320
Yeah?

5083
03:16:35,320 --> 03:16:36,320
Can you hear my enthusiasm?

5084
03:16:36,320 --> 03:16:39,320
Oh, oh, I can hear it.

5085
03:16:39,320 --> 03:16:41,360
Okay, I think...

5086
03:16:41,360 --> 03:16:42,360
Is this it?

5087
03:16:42,360 --> 03:16:44,360
Did I do it?

5088
03:16:44,360 --> 03:16:47,880
Now that I look completely like shit, have I succeeded in the given quest?

5089
03:16:47,880 --> 03:16:52,080
Yeah, go to that at the catapult, and he'll think you are Thor, not the actor, or like,

5090
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:55,600
you know, the, like, you know, anything I've got, he thinks you are really Thor.

5091
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:59,080
You wouldn't think that, like, he wouldn't assume that maybe I was someone in a costume

5092
03:16:59,080 --> 03:17:01,600
at a costume convention or anything.

5093
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:03,600
No.

5094
03:17:03,600 --> 03:17:11,280
Wow, that's an, okay, no, he thinks I'm a...

5095
03:17:12,200 --> 03:17:15,200
Okay, okay.

5096
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:17,880
Only Thor himself could move me from this spot.

5097
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:19,880
Okay, okay.

5098
03:17:19,880 --> 03:17:26,680
Wait, so, I guess, okay, you need a cape, I guess, do you not have a cape on?

5099
03:17:26,680 --> 03:17:29,800
Oh, yeah, I've got the, I'm wearing the wrong cape.

5100
03:17:29,800 --> 03:17:30,800
Okay.

5101
03:17:30,800 --> 03:17:36,400
Um, okay, it looks like I need, like, a brown fur cape.

5102
03:17:37,400 --> 03:17:46,480
All right, that'll be, it's right next to the guy with the hat that you got, so right

5103
03:17:46,480 --> 03:17:47,480
next to him.

5104
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:48,480
Okay.

5105
03:17:48,480 --> 03:17:53,480
Jesus Christ, this 20 chagrin adds, like, like, 20 seconds on to our speedrun time.

5106
03:17:53,480 --> 03:17:56,480
At least.

5107
03:17:56,480 --> 03:18:03,480
Imagine, imagine speedrunning this, imagine speedrunning Pop Tropica.

5108
03:18:03,480 --> 03:18:10,480
Hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna search that right now.

5109
03:18:10,480 --> 03:18:14,480
Pop, early Pop Tropica, 80% speedrun.

5110
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:17,480
Four minutes, two seconds.

5111
03:18:17,480 --> 03:18:23,480
Early Pop, I'm surprised early Pop Tropica by itself takes even that long.

5112
03:18:23,480 --> 03:18:30,480
Oh my god, this guy's going so fucking fast, holy shit.

5113
03:18:30,480 --> 03:18:32,480
Would you say that he's fasting?

5114
03:18:33,480 --> 03:18:35,480
I would say so, yes.

5115
03:18:35,480 --> 03:18:36,480
Good, good.

5116
03:18:36,480 --> 03:18:42,480
Oh, so, oh, oh, someone got early Pop Tropica in two minutes, 55 seconds.

5117
03:18:42,480 --> 03:18:44,480
It's gonna beat the record.

5118
03:18:44,480 --> 03:18:46,480
Oh, I found it, I found it.

5119
03:18:46,480 --> 03:18:51,480
All right, let's get this fucking cape.

5120
03:18:51,480 --> 03:18:56,480
Uh, okay.

5121
03:18:56,480 --> 03:18:57,480
Okay.

5122
03:18:57,480 --> 03:18:59,480
You look exactly like four.

5123
03:19:00,480 --> 03:19:11,480
So, like, the catapult guy, he'll trade me the Mjolnir replica knowing that it's a replica,

5124
03:19:11,480 --> 03:19:22,480
but only the real Thor can, can get him to move by trading him a replica of the hammer.

5125
03:19:22,480 --> 03:19:23,480
Yeah.

5126
03:19:23,480 --> 03:19:25,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5127
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:27,480
God, don't you love Thor?

5128
03:19:27,480 --> 03:19:28,480
No.

5129
03:19:28,480 --> 03:19:31,480
No, because they're not like two years old.

5130
03:19:31,480 --> 03:19:36,480
Do you like how they can use Thor knowing that he's an Avenger but get away with it

5131
03:19:36,480 --> 03:19:39,480
and not get copyright claimed because Thor is a mythological creature?

5132
03:19:39,480 --> 03:19:41,480
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty sneaky.

5133
03:19:44,480 --> 03:19:48,480
Yeah, yeah, Thor, even from that old Viking movie about the Vikings.

5134
03:19:48,480 --> 03:19:50,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5135
03:19:50,480 --> 03:19:52,480
Not like, nothing, yeah.

5136
03:19:52,480 --> 03:19:54,480
Like superhero type of thing.

5137
03:19:54,480 --> 03:19:58,480
Intellect, you know, intellectually defensible Thor?

5138
03:19:58,480 --> 03:20:02,480
I have come bearing an important message.

5139
03:20:02,480 --> 03:20:03,480
Oh my god.

5140
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:05,480
The Norse god Thor, is it really you?

5141
03:20:05,480 --> 03:20:07,480
Of course it's me.

5142
03:20:07,480 --> 03:20:10,480
Just look at my hammer.

5143
03:20:10,480 --> 03:20:13,480
Looks like a replica I saw earlier, but never mind.

5144
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:16,480
Hang on, with the con.

5145
03:20:16,480 --> 03:20:18,480
Yes, yes, it's all I ever wanted.

5146
03:20:18,480 --> 03:20:20,480
I hate this guy.

5147
03:20:20,480 --> 03:20:22,480
This guy's a bad man.

5148
03:20:22,480 --> 03:20:26,480
He's like the catapult, completely defenseless.

5149
03:20:26,480 --> 03:20:29,480
Here we go!

5150
03:20:29,480 --> 03:20:32,480
Uh...

5151
03:20:32,480 --> 03:20:34,480
Oh, okay.

5152
03:20:37,480 --> 03:20:39,480
Yeah, this is a good plan.

5153
03:20:39,480 --> 03:20:41,480
This is a great plan.

5154
03:20:41,480 --> 03:20:42,480
Alright.

5155
03:20:42,480 --> 03:20:43,480
Wait.

5156
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:45,480
Oh, oh!

5157
03:20:45,480 --> 03:20:47,480
For glory.

5158
03:20:47,480 --> 03:20:48,480
You did it.

5159
03:20:48,480 --> 03:20:49,480
I did it.

5160
03:20:49,480 --> 03:20:51,480
What did that?

5161
03:20:51,480 --> 03:20:54,480
Yes, now I can watch the trailer.

5162
03:20:54,480 --> 03:20:56,480
Yes!

5163
03:20:56,480 --> 03:21:00,480
Oh my god, thank fucking god, we did it.

5164
03:21:00,480 --> 03:21:01,480
Wait, is that it?

5165
03:21:01,480 --> 03:21:03,480
Like, do I not get to see what's inside?

5166
03:21:03,480 --> 03:21:04,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5167
03:21:04,480 --> 03:21:06,480
No, it's over, it's over.

5168
03:21:06,480 --> 03:21:08,480
So should I play next episode?

5169
03:21:08,480 --> 03:21:10,480
Oh.

5170
03:21:10,480 --> 03:21:13,480
Oh, there's two episodes.

5171
03:21:13,480 --> 03:21:15,480
So, oh you say you beat the first episode,

5172
03:21:15,480 --> 03:21:17,480
but you didn't beat the entire island.

5173
03:21:17,480 --> 03:21:20,480
Oh, well that's no good.

5174
03:21:22,480 --> 03:21:25,480
Jesus Christ, this can't go on much longer.

5175
03:21:25,480 --> 03:21:27,480
Oh, I think it can, I see.

5176
03:21:27,480 --> 03:21:29,480
Here we go.

5177
03:21:29,480 --> 03:21:34,480
These timings are, the cut-assist doesn't start for until the noon.

5178
03:21:34,480 --> 03:21:38,480
Oh man, the whole body is screaming at me.

5179
03:21:38,480 --> 03:21:40,480
When the costume contest.

5180
03:21:40,480 --> 03:21:44,480
Well, I mean, I've already got the ultimate costume.

5181
03:21:44,480 --> 03:21:46,480
Wait, the best...

5182
03:21:46,480 --> 03:21:53,480
Omega costume, a walk-on role in the mighty Action Force sequel.

5183
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:55,480
That's the prize of a lifetime.

5184
03:21:55,480 --> 03:21:59,480
Who will make the best Omega costume?

5185
03:21:59,480 --> 03:22:00,480
I mean, that's if you did really good cosplaying,

5186
03:22:00,480 --> 03:22:03,480
then you got to be in the movie you were cosplaying.

5187
03:22:03,480 --> 03:22:06,480
Yeah, I mean, be pretty fucking neat.

5188
03:22:06,480 --> 03:22:10,480
The card games at these conventions are always the best.

5189
03:22:10,480 --> 03:22:12,480
Well, sure.

5190
03:22:13,480 --> 03:22:17,480
The same card games as anywhere else.

5191
03:22:17,480 --> 03:22:19,480
Yeah, but there's a person.

5192
03:22:19,480 --> 03:22:21,480
Oh god, it's Tony the Tiger, oh god.

5193
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:25,480
Tony the Tiger is a certified RC cashier at this point.

5194
03:22:25,480 --> 03:22:29,480
Yeah, I think he's earned his place in the war.

5195
03:22:29,480 --> 03:22:31,480
Hey kid, come here for a second.

5196
03:22:31,480 --> 03:22:33,480
I want to talk to you about an amazing opportunity.

5197
03:22:33,480 --> 03:22:38,480
Wicked cool news relies on spies to get us inside information.

5198
03:22:38,480 --> 03:22:45,480
We need the first site to post what Omega on looks like before the trailer premieres.

5199
03:22:45,480 --> 03:22:50,480
Here's a phone, get photos of Omega and I'll put together an amazing costume.

5200
03:22:50,480 --> 03:22:53,480
Oh, we got a smart phone!

5201
03:22:53,480 --> 03:22:55,480
I didn't have one before.

5202
03:22:55,480 --> 03:23:03,480
Costume contest in the theater meets Stan Ditko, creator of Elf Archer.

5203
03:23:03,480 --> 03:23:05,480
I want to kill myself.

5204
03:23:05,480 --> 03:23:11,480
Any idea where I can go find out what Omega on is?

5205
03:23:11,480 --> 03:23:15,480
It's Stan Lee crossed at Steve Ditko, I get it.

5206
03:23:15,480 --> 03:23:17,480
Who's Steve Ditko?

5207
03:23:17,480 --> 03:23:20,480
Oh god, I think he made...

5208
03:23:20,480 --> 03:23:22,480
He's a god, I don't know.

5209
03:23:22,480 --> 03:23:25,480
I'm going to embarrass myself if I try and remember which things he made.

5210
03:23:25,480 --> 03:23:27,480
But he made a bunch of things.

5211
03:23:28,480 --> 03:23:34,480
There's actually three episodes in this game.

5212
03:23:34,480 --> 03:23:39,480
And this is only difficulty level two.

5213
03:23:39,480 --> 03:23:42,480
God, how fucking long would cryptids have taken?

5214
03:23:42,480 --> 03:23:45,480
I'm so glad we didn't.

5215
03:23:45,480 --> 03:23:47,480
What a missed opportunity.

5216
03:23:47,480 --> 03:23:49,480
Jesus Christ.

5217
03:23:49,480 --> 03:23:52,480
If you guys want a pop-tropica episode two.

5218
03:23:52,480 --> 03:24:00,480
Like, comment, subscribe for pop-tropicon episode two.

5219
03:24:00,480 --> 03:24:07,480
If we get 300 likes, then we'll do pop-tropica episode two.

5220
03:24:07,480 --> 03:24:13,480
I mean, we're doing pop-tropicon episode two right now.

5221
03:24:13,480 --> 03:24:15,480
Oh, check it out.

5222
03:24:15,480 --> 03:24:17,480
It's Tony Bros. It's Kagan Phantom.

5223
03:24:17,480 --> 03:24:20,480
Oh my god, it actually is.

5224
03:24:20,480 --> 03:24:24,480
It's actually Kagan Phantom. No joke.

5225
03:24:24,480 --> 03:24:29,480
No fucking joke.

5226
03:24:29,480 --> 03:24:32,480
How can you sue? Where's the sue button?

5227
03:24:32,480 --> 03:24:34,480
Where's the sue button?

5228
03:24:41,480 --> 03:24:44,480
Man, I could be playing... I could be playing phenotopia right now.

5229
03:24:44,480 --> 03:24:47,480
What is phenotopia? That sounds like a pop-tropica rip-off.

5230
03:24:47,480 --> 03:24:50,480
It does, doesn't it? No, it was a Newgrounds game.

5231
03:24:50,480 --> 03:24:53,480
It was a game featured on Newgrounds like four years ago.

5232
03:24:53,480 --> 03:24:57,480
And the sequel's been in the works for like even longer than that.

5233
03:24:57,480 --> 03:25:03,480
It's like a flash, like side scroller. It's kind of like a cave story RPG kind of thing.

5234
03:25:03,480 --> 03:25:09,480
With a little more action, a little more adventure-like fetch-questiness

5235
03:25:09,480 --> 03:25:13,480
and a little less like twitchy, like action-shooter-y bits.

5236
03:25:13,480 --> 03:25:15,480
I didn't even see where she went.

5237
03:25:15,480 --> 03:25:18,480
Is that her? Yep.

5238
03:25:25,480 --> 03:25:28,480
Look how bored everyone is.

5239
03:25:31,480 --> 03:25:36,480
Sam. Relatable.

5240
03:25:36,480 --> 03:25:39,480
Is there anything more relatable than paying?

5241
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:41,480
Not for me.

5242
03:25:41,480 --> 03:25:44,480
It's even more relatable than pleasure for me, you know.

5243
03:25:44,480 --> 03:25:48,480
Oh, I fucked up. Wait, did I fucked up?

5244
03:25:51,480 --> 03:25:53,480
I look at someone who's smiling and I say, well, it's fleeting.

5245
03:25:53,480 --> 03:25:56,480
And then I look at someone who's utterly, you know, anxious and depressed.

5246
03:25:56,480 --> 03:26:00,480
I don't think, no, that's my guy. And now I can immerse myself in the story.

5247
03:26:04,480 --> 03:26:09,480
Uh, okay. I could maybe scrounge up some loose change.

5248
03:26:10,480 --> 03:26:14,480
You gotta reel off or call me. Here's my card.

5249
03:26:14,480 --> 03:26:19,480
Okay. So, I gotta trade her.

5250
03:26:19,480 --> 03:26:22,480
I'm gonna close her piece. Okay.

5251
03:26:22,480 --> 03:26:25,480
Uh, wait a minute.

5252
03:26:25,480 --> 03:26:30,480
Why would I want to call her?

5253
03:26:30,480 --> 03:26:32,480
Like, wouldn't I...

5254
03:26:32,480 --> 03:26:36,480
Why would I want to call her if I'm supposed to get into the theater

5255
03:26:36,480 --> 03:26:39,480
and take a picture of Omega on, right?

5256
03:26:39,480 --> 03:26:41,480
Isn't that my goal?

5257
03:26:41,480 --> 03:26:44,480
No, you're also winning the cosplay contest.

5258
03:26:44,480 --> 03:26:46,480
What? Okay.

5259
03:26:46,480 --> 03:26:51,480
Uh, but something about getting a picture of Omega on, right?

5260
03:26:51,480 --> 03:26:52,480
Right?

5261
03:26:52,480 --> 03:26:53,480
I don't know. Did you say that?

5262
03:26:53,480 --> 03:26:55,480
Yeah, totally.

5263
03:26:55,480 --> 03:26:56,480
Then yes.

5264
03:26:56,480 --> 03:26:57,480
This is the whole...

5265
03:26:57,480 --> 03:27:00,480
Look at that. Look at that.

5266
03:27:00,480 --> 03:27:04,480
This is a disgusting game. This is a gross grotesque game.

5267
03:27:05,480 --> 03:27:07,480
I don't want... No, I don't want the bubble.

5268
03:27:07,480 --> 03:27:10,480
I want to have a green furry head.

5269
03:27:10,480 --> 03:27:12,480
Piece of shit.

5270
03:27:14,480 --> 03:27:15,480
This is grotesque.

5271
03:27:15,480 --> 03:27:17,480
This is a horror game for me.

5272
03:27:17,480 --> 03:27:21,480
This homeless person needs to stop banging on the fucking mini machine.

5273
03:27:26,480 --> 03:27:29,480
This is such a fucking nightmare.

5274
03:27:30,480 --> 03:27:34,480
It's me. Look, it's me. This guy's me.

5275
03:27:34,480 --> 03:27:36,480
Oh, it looks exactly like you.

5276
03:27:36,480 --> 03:27:38,480
He's just like me.

5277
03:27:38,480 --> 03:27:39,480
I got a...

5278
03:27:39,480 --> 03:27:41,480
Is it that stern cold exterior?

5279
03:27:41,480 --> 03:27:44,480
I got to put out some fan art. I got to put out enough fan art.

5280
03:27:44,480 --> 03:27:51,480
Some original art by the creators of a cop killer Ben with my skull hat design.

5281
03:27:51,480 --> 03:27:55,480
I want to push that skull hat.

5282
03:27:55,480 --> 03:27:57,480
Posting community service.

5283
03:27:57,480 --> 03:27:59,480
I'll get people riled up.

5284
03:27:59,480 --> 03:28:04,480
Yeah, I'm sure that'll get their juvenile cocks big and green.

5285
03:28:04,480 --> 03:28:05,480
Don't say that.

5286
03:28:05,480 --> 03:28:09,480
No, whoops. Can I not say juvenile cocks on this show?

5287
03:28:11,480 --> 03:28:14,480
Leave cell phones and tablets here before entering the room.

5288
03:28:14,480 --> 03:28:15,480
Will do.

5289
03:28:17,480 --> 03:28:19,480
Oh god, she had to leave her phone.

5290
03:28:19,480 --> 03:28:22,480
She left her phone here and I'm going to steal it.

5291
03:28:25,480 --> 03:28:28,480
Granny Tech Lounge down the hall.

5292
03:28:38,480 --> 03:28:39,480
It's been with no...

5293
03:28:39,480 --> 03:28:45,480
Okay, maybe if I give him my phone, then something will happen.

5294
03:28:45,480 --> 03:28:47,480
What?

5295
03:28:47,480 --> 03:28:50,480
What is happening right now?

5296
03:28:50,480 --> 03:28:52,480
Okay, so...

5297
03:28:52,480 --> 03:28:57,480
Did I ever tell you how I went to BabsCon one year and I met with someone from SlashMLP

5298
03:28:57,480 --> 03:28:58,480
and his...

5299
03:28:58,480 --> 03:29:04,480
Not like his wallpaper, but like his lock screen was a picture of Anthro-Vinyl Scratch getting fucked.

5300
03:29:04,480 --> 03:29:06,480
Did you guys make that up?

5301
03:29:06,480 --> 03:29:08,480
Yeah, basically.

5302
03:29:08,480 --> 03:29:10,480
Can you imagine having that as your lock screen?

5303
03:29:10,480 --> 03:29:12,480
Not your wallpaper, but like your lock screen.

5304
03:29:12,480 --> 03:29:14,480
So like no matter what, it'll just turn on your phone.

5305
03:29:14,480 --> 03:29:18,480
Everyone will always see it 100% of the time.

5306
03:29:18,480 --> 03:29:19,480
Yeah.

5307
03:29:19,480 --> 03:29:22,480
Vinyl Scratch is a cutie pie.

5308
03:29:22,480 --> 03:29:25,480
Don't say that.

5309
03:29:25,480 --> 03:29:27,480
That's even worse than doing alcox.

5310
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:28,480
I can't say anything.

5311
03:29:28,480 --> 03:29:30,480
I can't say anything anymore.

5312
03:29:30,480 --> 03:29:32,480
God damn this fucking liberals.

5313
03:29:32,480 --> 03:29:34,480
This PC culture.

5314
03:29:34,480 --> 03:29:38,480
Uh, what the fuck?

5315
03:29:38,480 --> 03:29:40,480
Her phone is in there.

5316
03:29:40,480 --> 03:29:45,480
I just need it.

5317
03:29:45,480 --> 03:29:47,480
Look, it was fun with early pop tropica.

5318
03:29:47,480 --> 03:29:49,480
It was fun with short teeth island.

5319
03:29:49,480 --> 03:29:53,480
We were blasting through things.

5320
03:29:53,480 --> 03:29:54,480
And now look at us.

5321
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:55,480
Yeah.

5322
03:29:55,480 --> 03:29:57,480
We're ruined.

5323
03:29:57,480 --> 03:30:02,480
Jesus.

5324
03:30:02,480 --> 03:30:03,480
Look at me.

5325
03:30:03,480 --> 03:30:05,480
I'm dressed up as Thor.

5326
03:30:05,480 --> 03:30:07,480
I want to replay value does this game have.

5327
03:30:07,480 --> 03:30:11,480
Do you think you're going to replay this to get 100% anytime in your life?

5328
03:30:11,480 --> 03:30:13,480
Uh, like every island?

5329
03:30:13,480 --> 03:30:14,480
Yeah.

5330
03:30:14,480 --> 03:30:18,480
Uh, you know, all 9,000 moons.

5331
03:30:18,480 --> 03:30:19,480
Um, yeah.

5332
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:24,480
I mean, I really don't have anything better to do.

5333
03:30:24,480 --> 03:30:27,480
Popular media collectibles.

5334
03:30:27,480 --> 03:30:29,480
Popular media collectibles.

5335
03:30:29,480 --> 03:30:31,480
Is this a parody?

5336
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:34,480
Is this a parody of the con experience?

5337
03:30:34,480 --> 03:30:40,480
Because if so, I think it's pretty effective in making me laugh at it and pity it.

5338
03:30:40,480 --> 03:30:43,480
Wicked cool news.

5339
03:30:43,480 --> 03:30:44,480
Yeah, man.

5340
03:30:44,480 --> 03:30:46,480
That's, that's who needs the picture.

5341
03:30:46,480 --> 03:30:49,480
That's who needs, uh, the thing.

5342
03:30:49,480 --> 03:30:52,480
That's who needs to know about the, uh, thing.

5343
03:30:52,480 --> 03:30:54,480
The guy.

5344
03:30:54,480 --> 03:30:56,480
Omega on.

5345
03:30:56,480 --> 03:30:58,480
Holy shit.

5346
03:30:58,480 --> 03:31:05,480
Wicked cool news subsidiary of, of, of nerd news, whatever.

5347
03:31:05,480 --> 03:31:08,480
Nerd news nightly.

5348
03:31:08,480 --> 03:31:11,480
Kira nightly that is.

5349
03:31:11,480 --> 03:31:12,480
Great to see you again.

5350
03:31:12,480 --> 03:31:14,480
Do you want to learn how to customize?

5351
03:31:14,480 --> 03:31:17,480
I, I must, I know.

5352
03:31:17,480 --> 03:31:18,480
I already know.

5353
03:31:18,480 --> 03:31:19,480
I have to.

5354
03:31:19,480 --> 03:31:21,480
Holy shit.

5355
03:31:21,480 --> 03:31:22,480
Holy shit.

5356
03:31:22,480 --> 03:31:25,480
I can't stand it any longer.

5357
03:31:25,480 --> 03:31:27,480
Do you want to go to different islands?

5358
03:31:27,480 --> 03:31:28,480
You beat episode one.

5359
03:31:28,480 --> 03:31:29,480
You beat episode one.

5360
03:31:29,480 --> 03:31:31,480
I can't fucking stand this game.

5361
03:31:31,480 --> 03:31:32,480
Jesus Christ.

5362
03:31:32,480 --> 03:31:33,480
What do you mean, man?

5363
03:31:33,480 --> 03:31:34,480
I hate pop tropica.

5364
03:31:34,480 --> 03:31:38,480
So this is the worst game I've ever played in my life.

5365
03:31:38,480 --> 03:31:40,480
I've never been so miserable.

5366
03:31:40,480 --> 03:31:43,480
I've never been so unhappy with any video game.

5367
03:31:43,480 --> 03:31:47,480
I don't care who, what makes you think that I value your life even a little bit.

5368
03:31:47,480 --> 03:31:48,480
You fool.

5369
03:31:48,480 --> 03:31:50,480
You fool.

5370
03:31:50,480 --> 03:31:53,480
Oh, I went to the atrium.

5371
03:31:53,480 --> 03:31:57,480
Now, now, now here's what.

5372
03:31:57,480 --> 03:32:00,480
Oh, oh, it's one of these.

5373
03:32:00,480 --> 03:32:02,480
Oh, it's one of these.

5374
03:32:02,480 --> 03:32:04,480
A common room.

5375
03:32:04,480 --> 03:32:07,480
I need to lie down.

5376
03:32:07,480 --> 03:32:09,480
Yeah, you put yawning nonstop.

5377
03:32:09,480 --> 03:32:14,480
Yeah, because this game is fucking, it's a fucking snore.

5378
03:32:14,480 --> 03:32:19,480
We're talking about battle bots, go bots.

5379
03:32:19,480 --> 03:32:21,480
Go bots was great.

5380
03:32:21,480 --> 03:32:23,480
Go bots was the best.

5381
03:32:23,480 --> 03:32:25,480
Back in my day, we had go bots.

5382
03:32:25,480 --> 03:32:27,480
We didn't have fucking pop tropica.

5383
03:32:27,480 --> 03:32:28,480
We didn't have any of this shit.

5384
03:32:28,480 --> 03:32:30,480
And we liked it.

5385
03:32:30,480 --> 03:32:38,480
Back in my day, you know, back in my day, we just, um, uh, back in my day, we had, uh, we had Etch-a-Sketch.

5386
03:32:38,480 --> 03:32:50,480
And, you know, we just had like that weird, like white board and you had like the little magnet pen and you could like, it had iron filings in it and you could like draw on it with the iron filings pen.

5387
03:32:50,480 --> 03:32:56,480
And then the magnet pen and then you could shake it up afterwards and then you could do it all over afterwards.

5388
03:32:56,480 --> 03:33:03,480
And then with the fucking, coming along with these fucking troll two ass pop tropica.

5389
03:33:03,480 --> 03:33:07,480
I literally don't know what the fuck you were just describing by the way.

5390
03:33:07,480 --> 03:33:08,480
You know?

5391
03:33:08,480 --> 03:33:11,480
So it's gone, it's gone from culture and society.

5392
03:33:11,480 --> 03:33:13,480
No, no, no.

5393
03:33:13,480 --> 03:33:24,480
It's like an Etch-a-Sketch, but instead of drawing with like little dials, it was like a board of like little white cells and each of the cells had like iron filings in it.

5394
03:33:24,480 --> 03:33:29,480
And you would just take like a magnetized pen and drag the pen over the server and it would pull the-

5395
03:33:29,480 --> 03:33:30,480
Oh!

5396
03:33:30,480 --> 03:33:31,480
And it would pull the iron-

5397
03:33:31,480 --> 03:33:32,480
I do know what you're talking about.

5398
03:33:32,480 --> 03:33:37,480
Yeah, it would pull the iron filings to the front and it would make, you know, a mark and then you could shake it up or whatever and it would-

5399
03:33:37,480 --> 03:33:42,480
No, no, you could use the eraser side of the pen and it would push the iron filings away.

5400
03:33:42,480 --> 03:33:44,480
I do know what you're talking about actually.

5401
03:33:44,480 --> 03:33:45,480
How do I know that?

5402
03:33:45,480 --> 03:33:46,480
What's that called?

5403
03:33:46,480 --> 03:33:47,480
I don't know.

5404
03:33:47,480 --> 03:33:49,480
I have no idea what it's called.

5405
03:33:49,480 --> 03:33:50,480
Um.

5406
03:33:51,480 --> 03:33:53,480
That's like Doctor's Office Core.

5407
03:33:53,480 --> 03:33:55,480
Doctor's? That's like-

5408
03:33:55,480 --> 03:33:58,480
No, that's like my weird aunt's core.

5409
03:33:58,480 --> 03:34:03,480
That's like my weird aunt's or uncle's or someone who I don't know whose name I don't even know.

5410
03:34:03,480 --> 03:34:04,480
Who I just-

5411
03:34:04,480 --> 03:34:06,480
They have it in a box somewhere.

5412
03:34:06,480 --> 03:34:10,480
The height of childhood pleasure was all these doctors-

5413
03:34:10,480 --> 03:34:11,480
Er, no, no.

5414
03:34:11,480 --> 03:34:12,480
Dentist-

5415
03:34:12,480 --> 03:34:13,480
Dentist Lobby Core.

5416
03:34:13,480 --> 03:34:15,480
Dentist Lobby Core.

5417
03:34:15,480 --> 03:34:19,480
Because they would always lure you into a false security.

5418
03:34:19,480 --> 03:34:23,480
They were designed to be, you know, as appealing to a child as-

5419
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:25,480
There was nothing more appealing.

5420
03:34:25,480 --> 03:34:26,480
Yeah.

5421
03:34:26,480 --> 03:34:30,480
Than reading Highlights Magazine in the Dentist office.

5422
03:34:30,480 --> 03:34:38,480
Yeah, reading Highlights Magazine and like, uh, fucking doing that one alligator tooth brushing game.

5423
03:34:38,480 --> 03:34:39,480
I don't know that one.

5424
03:34:39,480 --> 03:34:40,480
It's-

5425
03:34:40,480 --> 03:34:41,480
Oh, the one where you pull the teeth out?

5426
03:34:41,480 --> 03:34:42,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5427
03:34:42,480 --> 03:34:44,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5428
03:34:45,480 --> 03:34:47,480
Oh, Mighty Action Force the card game.

5429
03:34:47,480 --> 03:34:49,480
Sign up here, yes.

5430
03:34:49,480 --> 03:34:52,480
Want to try a hand at the Mighty Action Force card game?

5431
03:34:52,480 --> 03:34:53,480
Of course.

5432
03:34:54,480 --> 03:34:55,480
May I-

5433
03:34:55,480 --> 03:34:56,480
May I order the-

5434
03:34:56,480 --> 03:34:59,480
The Milo Pony train card system?

5435
03:34:59,480 --> 03:35:00,480
No.

5436
03:35:02,480 --> 03:35:03,480
Good.

5437
03:35:04,480 --> 03:35:05,480
Welcome to the-

5438
03:35:05,480 --> 03:35:07,480
I only remember, uh-

5439
03:35:09,480 --> 03:35:10,480
The flanks.

5440
03:35:10,480 --> 03:35:13,480
I only remember Bruce Flanks or whatever his name was.

5441
03:35:13,480 --> 03:35:15,480
Oh my god, the first card pony girl.

5442
03:35:17,480 --> 03:35:20,480
Uh, show an extra card from your deck.

5443
03:35:20,480 --> 03:35:21,480
Choose card.

5444
03:35:21,480 --> 03:35:22,480
Ah, Jesus.

5445
03:35:22,480 --> 03:35:25,480
What is this final fancy shit right now?

5446
03:35:25,480 --> 03:35:26,480
Mutton chops.

5447
03:35:26,480 --> 03:35:28,480
He's one tough tenderizer.

5448
03:35:28,480 --> 03:35:29,480
Henchbot.

5449
03:35:29,480 --> 03:35:31,480
Another one of this-

5450
03:35:31,480 --> 03:35:32,480
Mutton chops.

5451
03:35:32,480 --> 03:35:33,480
There you go.

5452
03:35:33,480 --> 03:35:34,480
Bam.

5453
03:35:34,480 --> 03:35:35,480
Robo-dobo.

5454
03:35:36,480 --> 03:35:37,480
Yeah, Robo-dobo.

5455
03:35:37,480 --> 03:35:38,480
Robo-dobo.

5456
03:35:38,480 --> 03:35:39,480
What about him?

5457
03:35:39,480 --> 03:35:40,480
Robo-bo.

5458
03:35:40,480 --> 03:35:41,480
My mortal enemy.

5459
03:35:42,480 --> 03:35:44,480
I'm losing my mind right now.

5460
03:35:52,480 --> 03:35:54,480
Is there rules to this game?

5461
03:35:54,480 --> 03:35:55,480
Yeah.

5462
03:35:56,480 --> 03:35:57,480
Yeah.

5463
03:35:57,480 --> 03:35:59,480
What are they?

5464
03:35:59,480 --> 03:36:00,480
Uh, okay.

5465
03:36:00,480 --> 03:36:05,480
So I think the goal is to get a lot of the jewels.

5466
03:36:06,480 --> 03:36:07,480
Uh-oh.

5467
03:36:08,480 --> 03:36:10,480
He's gonna get lots of jewels.

5468
03:36:12,480 --> 03:36:14,480
God, my deck sucks.

5469
03:36:14,480 --> 03:36:15,480
My right, fellow.

5470
03:36:15,480 --> 03:36:16,480
My deck sucks balls.

5471
03:36:19,480 --> 03:36:22,480
Ben, do you want to form a fief-

5472
03:36:22,480 --> 03:36:28,480
a fiefing organization in which we lust after large, uh, cartoonish diamonds?

5473
03:36:30,480 --> 03:36:31,480
Wait, a what?

5474
03:36:31,480 --> 03:36:32,480
Where we do that?

5475
03:36:32,480 --> 03:36:34,480
A fiefing organization.

5476
03:36:34,480 --> 03:36:35,480
Yeah, yeah.

5477
03:36:35,480 --> 03:36:39,480
Like, uh, like a side gig in international diamond smuggling.

5478
03:36:39,480 --> 03:36:40,480
Yeah.

5479
03:36:40,480 --> 03:36:45,480
Um, this, I'm not getting any fucking cards at all.

5480
03:36:45,480 --> 03:36:47,480
It's making me mad, man.

5481
03:36:47,480 --> 03:36:50,480
Listen, don't be mad.

5482
03:36:50,480 --> 03:36:51,480
Get glad.

5483
03:36:51,480 --> 03:36:52,480
No.

5484
03:36:52,480 --> 03:36:53,480
Pay for it.

5485
03:36:53,480 --> 03:36:54,480
Pay for it.

5486
03:36:54,480 --> 03:36:55,480
Pay for it.

5487
03:36:55,480 --> 03:36:58,480
Invite the trash can organization of America.

5488
03:36:58,480 --> 03:37:01,480
You're the trash can organization.

5489
03:37:01,480 --> 03:37:02,480
There.

5490
03:37:02,480 --> 03:37:05,480
That's what your mom said to me when we had sex last night.

5491
03:37:05,480 --> 03:37:06,480
No, not again.

5492
03:37:06,480 --> 03:37:08,480
Why do you keep doing that?

5493
03:37:08,480 --> 03:37:12,480
Why do you keep having sex?

5494
03:37:12,480 --> 03:37:13,480
Stop.

5495
03:37:13,480 --> 03:37:15,480
Would you please?

5496
03:37:15,480 --> 03:37:16,480
Shit.

5497
03:37:17,480 --> 03:37:21,480
Uh, there's one thing we can all agree on.

5498
03:37:21,480 --> 03:37:24,480
Yes, I can read the fucking rules of the card.

5499
03:37:24,480 --> 03:37:25,480
What?

5500
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:26,480
Yeah.

5501
03:37:26,480 --> 03:37:27,480
What?

5502
03:37:27,480 --> 03:37:28,480
Don't worry.

5503
03:37:28,480 --> 03:37:29,480
It's nothing.

5504
03:37:29,480 --> 03:37:33,480
No, but you got to talk over anything anymore.

5505
03:37:33,480 --> 03:37:35,480
You got to talk over this game.

5506
03:37:35,480 --> 03:37:36,480
Yeah.

5507
03:37:36,480 --> 03:37:39,480
I've realized, I've realized that everything I've been saying has just been going in one

5508
03:37:39,480 --> 03:37:42,480
year at the other because you're so focused on pop-tropic that you can't, you can't, you

5509
03:37:42,480 --> 03:37:43,480
can't do anything.

5510
03:37:43,480 --> 03:37:46,480
Under the banner of friendship, little peace is possible.

5511
03:37:46,480 --> 03:37:51,480
Uh.

5512
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:55,480
All this conversation starts, I've been throwing out every, every second or so.

5513
03:37:55,480 --> 03:37:57,480
You've just been deflecting nonstop.

5514
03:37:57,480 --> 03:37:59,480
That's what I do.

5515
03:37:59,480 --> 03:38:00,480
I deflect.

5516
03:38:00,480 --> 03:38:02,480
He's a deflector, Jerry.

5517
03:38:02,480 --> 03:38:04,480
He deflects.

5518
03:38:04,480 --> 03:38:06,480
I'll ask you, what do you think about this?

5519
03:38:06,480 --> 03:38:07,480
You'll be like, oh, well, that's cool.

5520
03:38:07,480 --> 03:38:11,480
And then you know, let's go back to trying to min-max your card, your card capture skills

5521
03:38:11,480 --> 03:38:12,480
and pop-tropica.

5522
03:38:12,480 --> 03:38:13,480
I'm going to win.

5523
03:38:13,480 --> 03:38:14,480
I'm going to win.

5524
03:38:14,480 --> 03:38:15,480
What?

5525
03:38:15,480 --> 03:38:16,480
What?

5526
03:38:16,480 --> 03:38:17,480
What is the goal of this game?

5527
03:38:17,480 --> 03:38:20,480
The goal is to fill up the meter on the bottom of the thing and prevent your opponent from

5528
03:38:20,480 --> 03:38:21,480
doing the same.

5529
03:38:21,480 --> 03:38:22,480
All right, let me just walk through immediately.

5530
03:38:22,480 --> 03:38:26,480
No, I, I understand, I understand how to play.

5531
03:38:26,480 --> 03:38:29,480
It's quite, it's quite simple.

5532
03:38:29,480 --> 03:38:30,480
Quite simple.

5533
03:38:30,480 --> 03:38:31,480
Child's play, really.

5534
03:38:31,480 --> 03:38:32,480
It really is child's play.

5535
03:38:32,480 --> 03:38:34,480
It literally is child's play.

5536
03:38:34,480 --> 03:38:40,480
I literally am playing a game for little children.

5537
03:38:40,480 --> 03:38:48,480
Apparently, you're supposed to be getting Pokemon, or you're supposed to be able to get

5538
03:38:48,480 --> 03:38:56,480
cards outside of this and supposed to collect a good set of cards so that you can beat him

5539
03:38:56,480 --> 03:39:01,480
or her, or her whatever.

5540
03:39:01,480 --> 03:39:05,480
I mean, she's pretty much running train on me.

5541
03:39:05,480 --> 03:39:12,480
Yeah, so you've got to go get good cards.

5542
03:39:12,480 --> 03:39:15,480
I mean, I think we're going to draw.

5543
03:39:15,480 --> 03:39:22,480
I don't think you can, the, the walkthrough says to get cards.

5544
03:39:23,480 --> 03:39:32,480
It might be literally impossible to do it without.

5545
03:39:32,480 --> 03:39:34,480
I think we might draw.

5546
03:39:34,480 --> 03:39:42,480
Depends what she's got in her hands.

5547
03:39:42,480 --> 03:39:43,480
Here we go.

5548
03:39:43,480 --> 03:39:46,480
I love Mighty Action Force so much.

5549
03:39:46,480 --> 03:39:48,480
I know, right?

5550
03:39:48,480 --> 03:39:54,480
Such a well-beloved, well-established series.

5551
03:39:54,480 --> 03:39:57,480
I can't get over the nuance.

5552
03:39:57,480 --> 03:40:00,480
There's been sheer nuance of it all.

5553
03:40:00,480 --> 03:40:02,480
No, I'm doing it too.

5554
03:40:02,480 --> 03:40:04,480
Yeah.

5555
03:40:04,480 --> 03:40:07,480
This game is a fucking snooze.

5556
03:40:07,480 --> 03:40:08,480
No.

5557
03:40:08,480 --> 03:40:09,480
No.

5558
03:40:09,480 --> 03:40:10,480
Yeah.

5559
03:40:10,480 --> 03:40:11,480
I don't agree.

5560
03:40:11,480 --> 03:40:12,480
Yeah, though.

5561
03:40:12,480 --> 03:40:15,480
I don't agree with what you just said right now.

5562
03:40:15,480 --> 03:40:28,480
Okay, well, I'm definitely going to end with more gems, but I don't know if that's good enough.

5563
03:40:28,480 --> 03:40:30,480
Did you restart just now?

5564
03:40:30,480 --> 03:40:33,480
No.

5565
03:40:33,480 --> 03:40:35,480
She ran out of cards.

5566
03:40:35,480 --> 03:40:38,480
Yeah, I'm going to win.

5567
03:40:38,480 --> 03:40:41,480
I think.

5568
03:40:41,480 --> 03:40:52,480
It might be a draw, I don't know.

5569
03:40:52,480 --> 03:40:53,480
Heck yeah.

5570
03:40:53,480 --> 03:40:55,480
Uh, well, great.

5571
03:40:55,480 --> 03:40:57,480
Is that it?

5572
03:40:57,480 --> 03:40:58,480
World Guy.

5573
03:40:58,480 --> 03:40:59,480
Under the band.

5574
03:40:59,480 --> 03:41:00,480
World Guy.

5575
03:41:00,480 --> 03:41:01,480
Great game.

5576
03:41:01,480 --> 03:41:03,480
That card should help strengthen your deck.

5577
03:41:03,480 --> 03:41:05,480
You can reorganize cards in your deck item.

5578
03:41:05,480 --> 03:41:07,480
Just try swapping.

5579
03:41:07,480 --> 03:41:11,480
Well, obviously I'm going to get rid of this piece of shit.

5580
03:41:11,480 --> 03:41:23,480
Like, this is the easiest card game in the world because you literally just want all World Guys and nothing else, and then you'll win.

5581
03:41:23,480 --> 03:41:26,480
Alright, Todd is the girl upstairs and she will challenge you to a card game.

5582
03:41:26,480 --> 03:41:29,480
If you win, you'll get an unreleased Omeghani card.

5583
03:41:29,480 --> 03:41:31,480
That's actually pretty neat.

5584
03:41:31,480 --> 03:41:33,480
This is actually a pretty neat little subplot.

5585
03:41:33,480 --> 03:41:35,480
Oh my god, oh my god, look at what it is.

5586
03:41:35,480 --> 03:41:36,480
What?

5587
03:41:36,480 --> 03:41:38,480
Look what I'm pointing to.

5588
03:41:38,480 --> 03:41:41,480
Oh my god, holy shit.

5589
03:41:41,480 --> 03:41:42,480
There it is.

5590
03:41:42,480 --> 03:41:46,480
It's the fucking Slime Casino Dice.

5591
03:41:46,480 --> 03:41:48,480
It's the Slime Casino Dice.

5592
03:41:48,480 --> 03:41:51,480
What are the odds that those exact colors would be here?

5593
03:41:51,480 --> 03:41:55,480
Everyone go hit up the Slime Casino and play the new Slime Roulette.

5594
03:41:55,480 --> 03:42:04,480
Slime Roulette, yeah, Slime Roulette is new and it's there and it's weird and complicated and way more so than it probably needed to be.

5595
03:42:04,480 --> 03:42:05,480
And it's a hot new thing.

5596
03:42:05,480 --> 03:42:08,480
It's a hot new way to lose all your Slime Coin.

5597
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:11,480
Jesus Christ, it's, oh, remember Investor?

5598
03:42:11,480 --> 03:42:12,480
First one for Investor.

5599
03:42:12,480 --> 03:42:14,480
Yeah, no.

5600
03:42:14,480 --> 03:42:20,480
I remember, I mean, I remember people talking about him as though he was real, but I know he was just an urban legend.

5601
03:42:20,480 --> 03:42:22,480
He's a cryptid, coming from Cryptid Island.

5602
03:42:22,480 --> 03:42:26,480
I know that a juvie could never really achieve such heights.

5603
03:42:26,480 --> 03:42:30,480
I know that he's just a folk legend that juvies tell their children to convince-

5604
03:42:30,480 --> 03:42:33,480
To make themselves feel better about their lowly station life.

5605
03:42:33,480 --> 03:42:42,480
To convince their kids not to join a gang because they know that once they join a gang, they will have the courage to kill themselves and they'll do it.

5606
03:42:42,480 --> 03:42:46,480
It's like children, it's like child suicide versus adult suicide.

5607
03:42:46,480 --> 03:42:52,480
You know, gang suicide is more brave than juvie suicide because there was nothing to live for anyway, so why would you even try?

5608
03:42:52,480 --> 03:42:59,480
Juvie kids are too cowardly, but gang kids, killer and rowdy kids, they've got the guts.

5609
03:42:59,480 --> 03:43:02,480
Hey, where do I go to challenge? What's your name?

5610
03:43:02,480 --> 03:43:05,480
I don't know why you left, it was just-

5611
03:43:05,480 --> 03:43:08,480
There was no way up, there was no way up.

5612
03:43:08,480 --> 03:43:10,480
You gotta get there somehow.

5613
03:43:10,480 --> 03:43:13,480
I guess, I guess that makes sense.

5614
03:43:13,480 --> 03:43:17,480
Talk to the girl upstairs and she'll challenge you to a math card game.

5615
03:43:17,480 --> 03:43:20,480
Well, I've gone the wrong way.

5616
03:43:20,480 --> 03:43:22,480
Just like in life, Ben.

5617
03:43:22,480 --> 03:43:25,480
Just like in life, I chose the wrong path.

5618
03:43:25,480 --> 03:43:27,480
God, I hate Tony the Tiger.

5619
03:43:27,480 --> 03:43:30,480
Tony the Tiger is the antagonist of this video game.

5620
03:43:30,480 --> 03:43:35,480
Ben, how would you arrange your life in such a way that you didn't have to play this game? What would be the first thing to go?

5621
03:43:35,480 --> 03:43:36,480
You.

5622
03:43:36,480 --> 03:43:37,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, I would say-

5623
03:43:37,480 --> 03:43:41,480
You'd be the first thing, you'd be the first thing on the chopping block.

5624
03:43:41,480 --> 03:43:44,480
Um, okay.

5625
03:43:44,480 --> 03:43:47,480
A demo area, I think that's where it was.

5626
03:43:51,480 --> 03:43:54,480
The bike unit game just entices you so.

5627
03:43:55,480 --> 03:43:59,480
I actually really like that there is like a collectible card game.

5628
03:43:59,480 --> 03:44:01,480
I think that's really cool.

5629
03:44:01,480 --> 03:44:02,480
It's the first-

5630
03:44:02,480 --> 03:44:05,480
It's the first thing that's been any good about this game at all.

5631
03:44:05,480 --> 03:44:07,480
Look, how do I get up there?

5632
03:44:07,480 --> 03:44:10,480
I have no clue, but you gotta charge up on the balloon.

5633
03:44:16,480 --> 03:44:18,480
Jesus fuck.

5634
03:44:19,480 --> 03:44:21,480
You gotta get up there.

5635
03:44:22,480 --> 03:44:24,480
There's a person up there, you gotta talk to that person.

5636
03:44:24,480 --> 03:44:26,480
I know, I know.

5637
03:44:26,480 --> 03:44:29,480
Maybe you have to collect the other cards first.

5638
03:44:32,480 --> 03:44:34,480
Listen, there's not that many of them.

5639
03:44:34,480 --> 03:44:35,480
There's not that many.

5640
03:44:35,480 --> 03:44:37,480
There's like five.

5641
03:44:37,480 --> 03:44:38,480
We can get them.

5642
03:44:38,480 --> 03:44:40,480
Okay, well where are they?

5643
03:44:40,480 --> 03:44:43,480
Okay, the first one is go to the theater and find a big box.

5644
03:44:43,480 --> 03:44:45,480
Push and get the teen acronym card.

5645
03:44:48,480 --> 03:44:50,480
Man, I was just at the theater.

5646
03:44:51,480 --> 03:44:52,480
Well, go back.

5647
03:44:52,480 --> 03:44:54,480
You told me.

5648
03:44:54,480 --> 03:44:56,480
You told me I had to go and challenge.

5649
03:44:56,480 --> 03:44:57,480
What's your name?

5650
03:44:57,480 --> 03:44:58,480
The demo area.

5651
03:44:58,480 --> 03:45:00,480
This game is gonna come between us, Ben.

5652
03:45:00,480 --> 03:45:02,480
It already has.

5653
03:45:02,480 --> 03:45:04,480
There's nothing to say.

5654
03:45:04,480 --> 03:45:05,480
I'm just gonna-

5655
03:45:05,480 --> 03:45:06,480
I don't like you anymore.

5656
03:45:06,480 --> 03:45:09,480
I'm just gonna come right out and say that I don't like you anymore.

5657
03:45:09,480 --> 03:45:10,480
And this game is the reason.

5658
03:45:10,480 --> 03:45:12,480
Is this gonna be the inciting?

5659
03:45:12,480 --> 03:45:14,480
Is this gonna be the lower canonical reason?

5660
03:45:14,480 --> 03:45:16,480
This is why it started the game.

5661
03:45:16,480 --> 03:45:17,480
Yeah.

5662
03:45:17,480 --> 03:45:19,480
Is this her?

5663
03:45:19,480 --> 03:45:21,480
I asked you to play pop trap.

5664
03:45:21,480 --> 03:45:23,480
I did.

5665
03:45:23,480 --> 03:45:25,480
And that was it.

5666
03:45:25,480 --> 03:45:27,480
Wait, is this it?

5667
03:45:27,480 --> 03:45:29,480
Is she it?

5668
03:45:29,480 --> 03:45:31,480
How do I challenge people?

5669
03:45:31,480 --> 03:45:33,480
Get the box.

5670
03:45:33,480 --> 03:45:35,480
That's the box, I assume.

5671
03:45:35,480 --> 03:45:37,480
Oh, yeah.

5672
03:45:37,480 --> 03:45:38,480
I think, right?

5673
03:45:38,480 --> 03:45:39,480
Sure.

5674
03:45:39,480 --> 03:45:40,480
There.

5675
03:45:40,480 --> 03:45:41,480
Yeah, the card's right there.

5676
03:45:41,480 --> 03:45:42,480
Oh.

5677
03:45:42,480 --> 03:45:43,480
With your eyes.

5678
03:45:43,480 --> 03:45:46,480
Oh, gotcha.

5679
03:45:47,480 --> 03:45:50,480
I don't know why it's so hard.

5680
03:45:50,480 --> 03:45:52,480
I can't.

5681
03:45:52,480 --> 03:45:55,480
I need to know what angel to use.

5682
03:45:55,480 --> 03:45:59,480
You're just somersaulting and back looking over it.

5683
03:45:59,480 --> 03:46:01,480
Okay.

5684
03:46:01,480 --> 03:46:02,480
All right, all right.

5685
03:46:02,480 --> 03:46:05,480
Now find the soda machine in the hallway and bang it.

5686
03:46:05,480 --> 03:46:08,480
And a pony girl card will fall out.

5687
03:46:11,480 --> 03:46:13,480
Sign the soda machine in the hallway?

5688
03:46:13,480 --> 03:46:15,480
Yeah.

5689
03:46:15,480 --> 03:46:17,480
Okay.

5690
03:46:19,480 --> 03:46:22,480
I assume the expo floor is that...

5691
03:46:22,480 --> 03:46:25,480
I mean, whatever.

5692
03:46:29,480 --> 03:46:32,480
This is getting me like...

5693
03:46:32,480 --> 03:46:37,480
Imagine if real conventions were like this where I just was so smart and there was literally nothing.

5694
03:46:37,480 --> 03:46:43,480
Just you going around in an endless circle trying to like look under trash cans and find cards to challenge people with.

5695
03:46:44,480 --> 03:46:46,480
That part I don't mind.

5696
03:46:46,480 --> 03:46:47,480
Okay, here we go.

5697
03:46:47,480 --> 03:46:48,480
Here we go.

5698
03:46:48,480 --> 03:46:50,480
I found the soda machine.

5699
03:46:52,480 --> 03:46:54,480
Uh, bang it.

5700
03:46:54,480 --> 03:46:57,480
Yeah, draw an extra card from your deck.

5701
03:46:57,480 --> 03:46:58,480
All right.

5702
03:46:58,480 --> 03:46:59,480
Yeah.

5703
03:46:59,480 --> 03:47:02,480
Get a balloon from the demo area and go to the expo floor.

5704
03:47:02,480 --> 03:47:04,480
You will see a card stuck in a window.

5705
03:47:04,480 --> 03:47:08,480
Go upstairs, jump and collect the trash collector card.

5706
03:47:08,480 --> 03:47:10,480
Wait, what?

5707
03:47:10,480 --> 03:47:12,480
Okay, I'll read it again.

5708
03:47:12,480 --> 03:47:13,480
One more time, please.

5709
03:47:13,480 --> 03:47:16,480
Get a balloon from the demo area and go to the expo floor.

5710
03:47:16,480 --> 03:47:18,480
You will see a card stuck in a window.

5711
03:47:18,480 --> 03:47:20,480
Go upstairs, jump and collect the trash collector card.

5712
03:47:20,480 --> 03:47:23,480
So get a balloon from the exhibit hall.

5713
03:47:25,480 --> 03:47:28,480
A balloon from the exhibit hall or from the demo area?

5714
03:47:28,480 --> 03:47:31,480
Oh, uh, the demo area.

5715
03:47:31,480 --> 03:47:35,480
Okay, I think that's over here.

5716
03:47:35,480 --> 03:47:36,480
Yes.

5717
03:47:37,480 --> 03:47:41,480
God, these frosted flakes houses.

5718
03:47:41,480 --> 03:47:42,480
I know, I know.

5719
03:47:42,480 --> 03:47:43,480
They're so bizarre.

5720
03:47:43,480 --> 03:47:45,480
Like, they're, they're, it's really surreal.

5721
03:47:45,480 --> 03:47:47,480
You'll just be walking through a convention center.

5722
03:47:47,480 --> 03:47:49,480
There's a nice little white picket fence house.

5723
03:47:49,480 --> 03:47:50,480
We're telling you the title.

5724
03:47:50,480 --> 03:47:51,480
Just ask him.

5725
03:47:51,480 --> 03:47:52,480
Just ask him.

5726
03:47:52,480 --> 03:47:54,480
That's the guy in the night helmet.

5727
03:47:54,480 --> 03:47:55,480
Oh, here we go.

5728
03:47:55,480 --> 03:47:56,480
I got the balloon.

5729
03:47:56,480 --> 03:47:57,480
Oh, okay.

5730
03:47:57,480 --> 03:47:58,480
You got it.

5731
03:47:58,480 --> 03:47:59,480
Okay.

5732
03:47:59,480 --> 03:48:01,480
Oh, wait, I think I can get up there now.

5733
03:48:01,480 --> 03:48:03,480
Oh, well, perfect.

5734
03:48:04,480 --> 03:48:07,480
Feed my epic deck.

5735
03:48:07,480 --> 03:48:09,480
No, I want to get, I want to get all the cards.

5736
03:48:09,480 --> 03:48:10,480
Okay.

5737
03:48:10,480 --> 03:48:12,480
I have a feeling it'll be tough.

5738
03:48:12,480 --> 03:48:14,480
She's going to be a tough opponent.

5739
03:48:14,480 --> 03:48:15,480
Uh, okay.

5740
03:48:15,480 --> 03:48:17,480
Where's the next one?

5741
03:48:17,480 --> 03:48:20,480
Uh, it's in the, the, the Explo4.

5742
03:48:20,480 --> 03:48:21,480
Okay.

5743
03:48:22,480 --> 03:48:23,480
All right.

5744
03:48:23,480 --> 03:48:24,480
There's a card stuck in a window.

5745
03:48:24,480 --> 03:48:27,480
Go upstairs and jump and collect the card.

5746
03:48:29,480 --> 03:48:30,480
Okay.

5747
03:48:31,480 --> 03:48:33,480
So like it's in a window somewhere.

5748
03:48:33,480 --> 03:48:35,480
The card's stuck in a window.

5749
03:48:35,480 --> 03:48:37,480
I assume it'll be out of reach if I'm a normal jump.

5750
03:48:37,480 --> 03:48:39,480
That's why you need the balloon.

5751
03:48:44,480 --> 03:48:45,480
Hmm.

5752
03:48:45,480 --> 03:48:46,480
Hmm.

5753
03:48:46,480 --> 03:48:49,480
It's like somewhere fucking crazy, I guess.

5754
03:48:49,480 --> 03:48:50,480
Okay.

5755
03:48:52,480 --> 03:48:53,480
Oh, there it is.

5756
03:48:53,480 --> 03:48:54,480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5757
03:48:54,480 --> 03:48:56,480
I see, I just got a float over there.

5758
03:48:56,480 --> 03:48:57,480
All right.

5759
03:48:57,480 --> 03:48:58,480
Not too bad.

5760
03:49:00,480 --> 03:49:01,480
Oh God.

5761
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:04,480
Hey, like the controls of this game.

5762
03:49:04,480 --> 03:49:05,480
Oh, they're wonderful.

5763
03:49:05,480 --> 03:49:06,480
Trash collector.

5764
03:49:06,480 --> 03:49:08,480
You mean, okay, okay.

5765
03:49:09,480 --> 03:49:10,480
Costumerizer item.

5766
03:49:10,480 --> 03:49:11,480
All right.

5767
03:49:11,480 --> 03:49:12,480
There's like two more.

5768
03:49:12,480 --> 03:49:13,480
Okay.

5769
03:49:13,480 --> 03:49:16,480
Go to the exhibit hall and get up on the huge green statue above you.

5770
03:49:16,480 --> 03:49:20,480
Jump on the hand and a fashion ninja card will fall out.

5771
03:49:21,480 --> 03:49:22,480
Okay.

5772
03:49:22,480 --> 03:49:23,480
The exhibit.

5773
03:49:23,480 --> 03:49:26,480
Jump on the hand in the green statue in the exhibit hall.

5774
03:49:26,480 --> 03:49:28,480
Oh, look, it's Tony the Tiger again.

5775
03:49:28,480 --> 03:49:29,480
Oh, wow.

5776
03:49:30,480 --> 03:49:34,480
Like I have like a stat bar and it's, you know, one from 100.

5777
03:49:34,480 --> 03:49:39,480
And every time I see a frosty flakes thing, it goes by one point.

5778
03:49:39,480 --> 03:49:41,480
So I'm going to get there one bit.

5779
03:49:43,480 --> 03:49:44,480
Okay.

5780
03:49:44,480 --> 03:49:46,480
Somehow I never came here before.

5781
03:49:48,480 --> 03:49:50,480
Oh, there it is.

5782
03:49:50,480 --> 03:49:51,480
There it is.

5783
03:49:51,480 --> 03:49:54,480
Oh, wait.

5784
03:49:54,480 --> 03:49:55,480
Wait.

5785
03:49:59,480 --> 03:50:00,480
Come on.

5786
03:50:01,480 --> 03:50:04,480
I guess this is plot or something.

5787
03:50:04,480 --> 03:50:05,480
Stupid.

5788
03:50:10,480 --> 03:50:11,480
Get the card.

5789
03:50:11,480 --> 03:50:12,480
I can't.

5790
03:50:13,480 --> 03:50:14,480
I'm too high.

5791
03:50:15,480 --> 03:50:16,480
Come on.

5792
03:50:17,480 --> 03:50:18,480
There we go.

5793
03:50:18,480 --> 03:50:19,480
All right.

5794
03:50:19,480 --> 03:50:20,480
All right.

5795
03:50:20,480 --> 03:50:21,480
One more.

5796
03:50:21,480 --> 03:50:22,480
One more.

5797
03:50:22,480 --> 03:50:23,480
Okay.

5798
03:50:23,480 --> 03:50:24,480
Go upstairs.

5799
03:50:26,480 --> 03:50:28,480
This is where we're going to have to find the person anyway.

5800
03:50:28,480 --> 03:50:31,480
Keep stomping in front of the bulletin board by clicking on it.

5801
03:50:31,480 --> 03:50:34,480
Collect the dirt cloud card on the board.

5802
03:50:35,480 --> 03:50:36,480
Okay.

5803
03:50:36,480 --> 03:50:37,480
Demo area.

5804
03:50:38,480 --> 03:50:40,480
It's where the cards are.

5805
03:50:40,480 --> 03:50:41,480
Yeah.

5806
03:50:42,480 --> 03:50:43,480
Pretty sure it's over here.

5807
03:50:43,480 --> 03:50:44,480
Okay.

5808
03:50:44,480 --> 03:50:48,480
Demo area and then I stomp on the what now?

5809
03:50:48,480 --> 03:50:49,480
Bulletin board.

5810
03:50:49,480 --> 03:50:50,480
Okay.

5811
03:50:51,480 --> 03:50:53,480
You have to click on it a lot.

5812
03:50:53,480 --> 03:50:54,480
Oh, here we go.

5813
03:50:54,480 --> 03:50:55,480
Yeah.

5814
03:50:55,480 --> 03:50:56,480
Yeah.

5815
03:50:56,480 --> 03:50:57,480
So just click on it.

5816
03:51:02,480 --> 03:51:03,480
There we go.

5817
03:51:04,480 --> 03:51:05,480
All right.

5818
03:51:05,480 --> 03:51:06,480
Now you have all the cards.

5819
03:51:06,480 --> 03:51:07,480
Dirt cloud.

5820
03:51:07,480 --> 03:51:08,480
All right.

5821
03:51:08,480 --> 03:51:09,480
Sick.

5822
03:51:09,480 --> 03:51:18,480
Let me just smack him, smash him right into my deck here and steal one jump for your opponent.

5823
03:51:18,480 --> 03:51:19,480
Okay.

5824
03:51:21,480 --> 03:51:23,480
Play another card.

5825
03:51:23,480 --> 03:51:24,480
Yeah.

5826
03:51:24,480 --> 03:51:25,480
I want that one.

5827
03:51:27,480 --> 03:51:30,480
There's got to be an RFCK praying card someday.

5828
03:51:30,480 --> 03:51:31,480
Someday.

5829
03:51:31,480 --> 03:51:35,480
Block your opponent's action if it is of equal or lesser value.

5830
03:51:35,480 --> 03:51:36,480
Yeah.

5831
03:51:36,480 --> 03:51:37,480
I guess I want that one.

5832
03:51:37,480 --> 03:51:39,480
Your opponent's next turn is skipped.

5833
03:51:39,480 --> 03:51:40,480
Yeah.

5834
03:51:40,480 --> 03:51:41,480
I guess I want that one too.

5835
03:51:41,480 --> 03:51:42,480
Okay.

5836
03:51:42,480 --> 03:51:43,480
Yeah.

5837
03:51:43,480 --> 03:51:44,480
I'm pretty sure I've got the old dude.

5838
03:51:44,480 --> 03:51:47,480
You mean fuck what was it called?

5839
03:51:47,480 --> 03:51:48,480
Sea creatures.

5840
03:51:48,480 --> 03:51:49,480
Yeah.

5841
03:51:49,480 --> 03:51:50,480
Yeah.

5842
03:51:50,480 --> 03:51:51,480
Sea creatures.

5843
03:51:51,480 --> 03:51:53,480
Dude, dude, dude.

5844
03:51:53,480 --> 03:51:54,480
We can make that.

5845
03:51:54,480 --> 03:51:55,480
Okay.

5846
03:51:55,480 --> 03:51:56,480
We can?

5847
03:51:56,480 --> 03:51:57,480
Okay.

5848
03:51:57,480 --> 03:51:58,480
Okay.

5849
03:51:58,480 --> 03:52:00,480
Once slime oids are in.

5850
03:52:00,480 --> 03:52:06,680
Once slime oids are in, I think making sea creatures will not be, like designing sea creatures

5851
03:52:06,680 --> 03:52:10,480
will obviously take some work, but I think that's the easy part.

5852
03:52:10,480 --> 03:52:16,720
But I think that once slime oids are in, designing sea creatures will be, like most of the work

5853
03:52:16,720 --> 03:52:17,720
will be done.

5854
03:52:17,720 --> 03:52:18,720
Yeah.

5855
03:52:18,720 --> 03:52:19,720
Yeah.

5856
03:52:19,720 --> 03:52:25,960
Sea creatures and sass effects are the, are the, are sass conditions are the best thing

5857
03:52:25,960 --> 03:52:26,960
I've ever thought of.

5858
03:52:26,960 --> 03:52:27,960
For the game.

5859
03:52:27,960 --> 03:52:28,960
Yeah.

5860
03:52:28,960 --> 03:52:29,960
Here we go.

5861
03:52:29,960 --> 03:52:30,960
Here we go.

5862
03:52:30,960 --> 03:52:31,960
Here.

5863
03:52:31,960 --> 03:52:35,320
Take aim at the heart of you.

5864
03:52:35,320 --> 03:52:36,320
Oh no.

5865
03:52:36,320 --> 03:52:38,720
She's got an epic deck.

5866
03:52:38,720 --> 03:52:40,720
Epic shit, dude.

5867
03:52:40,720 --> 03:52:46,520
Oh, make, make your opponent skip the turn, I think, right?

5868
03:52:47,520 --> 03:52:50,520
So that she can't attack you or something?

5869
03:52:50,520 --> 03:52:51,520
Uh, yeah.

5870
03:52:51,520 --> 03:52:52,520
Yeah.

5871
03:52:52,520 --> 03:52:53,520
Okay.

5872
03:52:53,520 --> 03:53:00,520
I wish I could have skipped this turn.

5873
03:53:00,520 --> 03:53:06,520
Girl, I'll get you for that.

5874
03:53:06,520 --> 03:53:07,520
Nurgh.

5875
03:53:07,520 --> 03:53:11,520
And, uh, these nerds.

5876
03:53:11,520 --> 03:53:15,520
Yeah, bring out world guy.

5877
03:53:15,520 --> 03:53:16,520
Yeah.

5878
03:53:16,520 --> 03:53:20,520
We'll probably do just two world guys in a row.

5879
03:53:20,520 --> 03:53:22,520
He'll obliterate her.

5880
03:53:22,520 --> 03:53:30,520
I'm going to go, I'm going to go for the quick victory.

5881
03:53:30,520 --> 03:53:34,920
As opposed to, I could attack her gems down, but I'm going to go for gaining gems fast

5882
03:53:34,920 --> 03:53:35,920
as possible.

5883
03:53:35,920 --> 03:53:36,920
Oh no.

5884
03:53:36,920 --> 03:53:37,920
Oh no.

5885
03:53:38,920 --> 03:53:41,920
Oh shit, dog.

5886
03:53:45,920 --> 03:53:46,920
Okay.

5887
03:53:46,920 --> 03:53:49,920
Are you just putting a world guy again, I guess?

5888
03:53:49,920 --> 03:53:52,920
Draw an extra card from your deck.

5889
03:53:52,920 --> 03:53:53,920
Yeah.

5890
03:53:53,920 --> 03:53:54,920
Yeah.

5891
03:53:54,920 --> 03:53:57,920
I think we can do more.

5892
03:53:57,920 --> 03:54:01,920
Can you do attack opponent again?

5893
03:54:01,920 --> 03:54:08,920
You can only do, only if you use trash collector can you do two cards at once.

5894
03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:11,920
That's like trash collector special skill.

5895
03:54:11,920 --> 03:54:12,920
Okay.

5896
03:54:12,920 --> 03:54:15,920
Well, she gets a free turn, but whatever.

5897
03:54:15,920 --> 03:54:17,920
Yeah, who cares.

5898
03:54:17,920 --> 03:54:19,920
She can't possibly keep up.

5899
03:54:19,920 --> 03:54:22,920
Oh wait, we're tied now.

5900
03:54:22,920 --> 03:54:23,920
Well.

5901
03:54:23,920 --> 03:54:30,920
There's a little intricate game I've ever played.

5902
03:54:31,920 --> 03:54:33,920
Uh, teen erect.

5903
03:54:33,920 --> 03:54:34,920
Oh no.

5904
03:54:34,920 --> 03:54:36,920
Oh no, she's stealing my gem.

5905
03:54:36,920 --> 03:54:38,920
Oh no, she's stealing my gem.

5906
03:54:38,920 --> 03:54:40,920
Oh, but guess what?

5907
03:54:40,920 --> 03:54:42,920
But guess what, idiot?

5908
03:54:52,920 --> 03:54:54,920
I might win next turn.

5909
03:54:54,920 --> 03:54:56,920
Oh my god.

5910
03:54:56,920 --> 03:54:59,920
Or, actually wait, you know what?

5911
03:55:00,920 --> 03:55:02,920
Oh wait, maybe I shouldn't have done that.

5912
03:55:02,920 --> 03:55:07,920
Maybe I should have attacked more just to prevent her from winning.

5913
03:55:07,920 --> 03:55:13,920
Oh no, if she plays a world guy, if she plays a world guy or a mutton chops, I think she'll win.

5914
03:55:13,920 --> 03:55:14,920
Holy shit.

5915
03:55:14,920 --> 03:55:19,920
So she might win, depending on what she's got in her hand.

5916
03:55:19,920 --> 03:55:20,920
Yep, there it is.

5917
03:55:20,920 --> 03:55:23,920
Oh fuck, god damn it.

5918
03:55:23,920 --> 03:55:26,920
Bear, you might go faster.

5919
03:55:26,920 --> 03:55:29,920
I don't think, I think I always go second.

5920
03:55:29,920 --> 03:55:33,920
Block your, oh I could block my opponent's action.

5921
03:55:33,920 --> 03:55:34,920
Do that, do that.

5922
03:55:34,920 --> 03:55:38,920
No, it won't work, because it's got to be equal lesser value.

5923
03:55:38,920 --> 03:55:43,920
I don't know man, we're both winning this turn.

5924
03:55:43,920 --> 03:55:44,920
No.

5925
03:55:44,920 --> 03:55:45,920
Fuck!

5926
03:55:45,920 --> 03:55:50,920
Oh wait, oh no, she didn't, she didn't do it.

5927
03:55:50,920 --> 03:55:52,920
Okay, there's one more slot.

5928
03:55:52,920 --> 03:55:55,920
We're both one slot away.

5929
03:55:55,920 --> 03:55:57,920
She's gonna win though, if she goes first.

5930
03:55:57,920 --> 03:56:01,920
Oh, I can block her action, fuck you!

5931
03:56:01,920 --> 03:56:03,920
This is the most legendary duel of all time.

5932
03:56:03,920 --> 03:56:06,920
This is the most legendary duel of all time.

5933
03:56:06,920 --> 03:56:07,920
Oh my god.

5934
03:56:07,920 --> 03:56:11,920
This is it, I did it, I did it.

5935
03:56:11,920 --> 03:56:13,920
It's like an out game.

5936
03:56:13,920 --> 03:56:17,920
Wait, blocked, draft, that card was used anyways, yeah!

5937
03:56:17,920 --> 03:56:18,920
Victory.

5938
03:56:18,920 --> 03:56:19,920
Yeah!

5939
03:56:19,920 --> 03:56:20,920
Yes!

5940
03:56:20,920 --> 03:56:23,920
We triumphed, we won the game.

5941
03:56:23,920 --> 03:56:25,920
Dirt Clawed won the day.

5942
03:56:25,920 --> 03:56:30,920
Wait, what, wait what just happened?

5943
03:56:30,920 --> 03:56:33,920
Why did I not just win?

5944
03:56:33,920 --> 03:56:37,920
I literally just filled up my gauge.

5945
03:56:37,920 --> 03:56:40,920
I literally just filled up my gauge.

5946
03:56:40,920 --> 03:56:41,920
Literally.

5947
03:56:41,920 --> 03:56:43,920
I literally filled up my gauge.

5948
03:56:43,920 --> 03:56:52,920
I don't understand.

5949
03:56:52,920 --> 03:56:56,920
I don't understand either.

5950
03:56:56,920 --> 03:56:59,920
Oh, now it goes backwards, you have to delete all of her gems.

5951
03:56:59,920 --> 03:57:01,920
No, no, no, no, that's not it.

5952
03:57:01,920 --> 03:57:05,920
Like, I thought the goal was to fill up your meter.

5953
03:57:05,920 --> 03:57:10,920
Like, you can attack to lower their meter, or you can collect to fill your meter.

5954
03:57:10,920 --> 03:57:13,920
But my meter was full, what the fuck?

5955
03:57:13,920 --> 03:57:19,920
I'm upset.

5956
03:57:19,920 --> 03:57:21,920
This is fucking weird.

5957
03:57:21,920 --> 03:57:24,920
I think I'm going to win anyway, probably.

5958
03:57:24,920 --> 03:57:27,920
Oh wait, maybe not.

5959
03:57:27,920 --> 03:57:30,920
I want to show what the rules of this game is.

5960
03:57:30,920 --> 03:57:39,920
I understand the rules, but I don't understand why I didn't win.

5961
03:57:39,920 --> 03:57:44,920
Alright, get, I mean, you might win this round.

5962
03:57:44,920 --> 03:57:50,920
I should win this round, because I'm going to have more gems.

5963
03:57:51,920 --> 03:58:01,920
You don't even have another card to take, idiot.

5964
03:58:01,920 --> 03:58:02,920
What?

5965
03:58:02,920 --> 03:58:03,920
What?

5966
03:58:03,920 --> 03:58:04,920
Oh, you know what I think it was?

5967
03:58:04,920 --> 03:58:12,920
I think that, like, it didn't let me do it, because it was putting too many gems in.

5968
03:58:12,920 --> 03:58:13,920
Oh!

5969
03:58:13,920 --> 03:58:16,920
I think it's because I was putting in two.

5970
03:58:16,920 --> 03:58:19,920
Beat my, and I'll give you an unreleased Omicron card.

5971
03:58:19,920 --> 03:58:21,920
Um, yeah, I want that.

5972
03:58:21,920 --> 03:58:23,920
That'll help me win the day.

5973
03:58:23,920 --> 03:58:31,920
Alright, okay.

5974
03:58:31,920 --> 03:58:37,920
I guess I just didn't understand the rules of overflow.

5975
03:58:37,920 --> 03:58:41,920
Stack overflow.

5976
03:58:41,920 --> 03:59:00,920
We're going down this time, whatever your name is.

5977
03:59:00,920 --> 03:59:02,920
God can only hope so.

5978
03:59:02,920 --> 03:59:18,920
Um, hey, what's going on here?

5979
03:59:18,920 --> 03:59:20,920
Um, we have to reload the game.

5980
03:59:20,920 --> 03:59:25,920
Cool.

5981
03:59:25,920 --> 03:59:26,920
Good times.

5982
03:59:26,920 --> 03:59:27,920
That's great.

5983
03:59:27,920 --> 03:59:31,920
Good times, yeah.

5984
03:59:31,920 --> 03:59:33,920
What made you sad recently?

5985
03:59:33,920 --> 03:59:34,920
What's made you sad?

5986
03:59:34,920 --> 03:59:36,920
What's the sad thing in your life?

5987
03:59:36,920 --> 03:59:37,920
Poptropica is the obvious.

5988
03:59:37,920 --> 03:59:41,920
You mean, yeah, like, it's almost too obvious.

5989
03:59:41,920 --> 03:59:43,920
What made me sad in my life?

5990
03:59:43,920 --> 03:59:47,920
Who are my stupid roommates that think that ghosts are real?

5991
03:59:47,920 --> 03:59:49,920
Is that sad, or is that just angry?

5992
03:59:49,920 --> 03:59:50,920
Both.

5993
03:59:50,920 --> 03:59:54,920
I feel bad for them.

5994
03:59:54,920 --> 04:00:03,920
Um, they're an embarrassment.

5995
04:00:03,920 --> 04:00:08,920
Wait, no, wrong, wrong, wrong.

5996
04:00:08,920 --> 04:00:12,920
Do you know what their opinion of Slenderman is?

5997
04:00:12,920 --> 04:00:16,920
Um, probably that it's real and coming for them.

5998
04:00:16,920 --> 04:00:18,920
Probably that you are Slenderman.

5999
04:00:18,920 --> 04:00:27,920
Probably that they probably tried to talk to it with that Ouija board, and we're disappointed that they received only.

6000
04:00:27,920 --> 04:00:28,920
Oh God.

6001
04:00:28,920 --> 04:00:32,920
Okay, no, I'm pretty sure that I have all the cards, right?

6002
04:00:32,920 --> 04:00:33,920
I have all the cards.

6003
04:00:33,920 --> 04:00:34,920
Yeah, I think you do it.

6004
04:00:34,920 --> 04:00:35,920
The bulletin board is fucked up.

6005
04:00:35,920 --> 04:00:37,920
Okay.

6006
04:00:37,920 --> 04:00:38,920
Okay, yay.

6007
04:00:38,920 --> 04:00:39,920
Yeah.

6008
04:00:39,920 --> 04:00:42,920
We got ourselves a game, boys.

6009
04:00:42,920 --> 04:00:43,920
Round two.

6010
04:00:43,920 --> 04:00:45,920
Well, two and a half.

6011
04:00:45,920 --> 04:00:47,920
Last one glitched out.

6012
04:00:47,920 --> 04:00:51,920
Round two glitched.

6013
04:00:51,920 --> 04:00:55,920
I've never lost a match, and I don't intend to start now.

6014
04:00:55,920 --> 04:00:58,920
I'm the ultimate gamer.

6015
04:00:58,920 --> 04:01:02,920
I can't wait for the creepypasta cinematic universe.

6016
04:01:02,920 --> 04:01:03,920
Ugh.

6017
04:01:03,920 --> 04:01:04,920
Same.

6018
04:01:04,920 --> 04:01:05,920
Um.

6019
04:01:05,920 --> 04:01:07,920
None of the Slenderman movies out now.

6020
04:01:07,920 --> 04:01:08,920
We're going to have the Jep the Killer.

6021
04:01:08,920 --> 04:01:12,920
We're going to have the Rick movie.

6022
04:01:12,920 --> 04:01:17,920
We're going to have normal porn for normalpeople.com.

6023
04:01:17,920 --> 04:01:20,920
Normal porn for normal people.

6024
04:01:20,920 --> 04:01:22,920
Have you not read that one?

6025
04:01:22,920 --> 04:01:23,920
No.

6026
04:01:23,920 --> 04:01:25,920
Wait, that's a creepypasta?

6027
04:01:25,920 --> 04:01:26,920
Yeah.

6028
04:01:26,920 --> 04:01:28,920
No, I never heard of it.

6029
04:01:28,920 --> 04:01:34,920
It's a story about a person going on the dark web to find a site called normalpornfornormalpeople.com.

6030
04:01:34,920 --> 04:01:35,920
And our witch.

6031
04:01:35,920 --> 04:01:41,920
There are videos about a man feeding a dog peanut butter sandwiches until the dog doesn't

6032
04:01:41,920 --> 04:01:43,920
watch anymore and he stops.

6033
04:01:43,920 --> 04:01:48,920
Uh, cool, I guess.

6034
04:01:48,920 --> 04:01:54,920
And then there's another video about a chimpanzee killing a girl.

6035
04:01:54,920 --> 04:01:58,920
And that's kind of funny, I guess.

6036
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:02,920
We're both skipping our next turn.

6037
04:02:02,920 --> 04:02:04,920
Pretty funny.

6038
04:02:04,920 --> 04:02:05,920
Funny stuff.

6039
04:02:05,920 --> 04:02:08,920
Did you rock in the game?

6040
04:02:08,920 --> 04:02:09,920
No.

6041
04:02:09,920 --> 04:02:11,920
No, no, it handled it.

6042
04:02:11,920 --> 04:02:12,920
It handled it just fine.

6043
04:02:12,920 --> 04:02:15,920
Just barely, just barely.

6044
04:02:15,920 --> 04:02:18,920
Okay, as long as I have...

6045
04:02:18,920 --> 04:02:19,920
Yeah.

6046
04:02:19,920 --> 04:02:21,920
Okay, this is fine.

6047
04:02:21,920 --> 04:02:26,920
This is good.

6048
04:02:26,920 --> 04:02:32,920
She basically wasted her turn with dirt clawed.

6049
04:02:32,920 --> 04:02:36,920
I think that's pretty much how you win is wait for your opponent to play dirt clawed

6050
04:02:36,920 --> 04:02:45,920
and then cuck them out of it.

6051
04:02:45,920 --> 04:02:49,920
Okay, so I've got, I gotta get five and I gotta get six gems.

6052
04:02:49,920 --> 04:02:51,920
I gotta get six gems.

6053
04:02:51,920 --> 04:02:54,920
So two mutton chops.

6054
04:02:54,920 --> 04:02:56,920
Two mutton chops should do it.

6055
04:02:56,920 --> 04:02:58,920
Well, unless she attacks you.

6056
04:02:58,920 --> 04:03:05,920
Unless she, unless she does some weird shit.

6057
04:03:05,920 --> 04:03:08,920
And you're one ahead of her.

6058
04:03:08,920 --> 04:03:11,920
So unless she plays world guy.

6059
04:03:11,920 --> 04:03:14,920
Yeah, you're good.

6060
04:03:14,920 --> 04:03:15,920
She's gonna do right now.

6061
04:03:15,920 --> 04:03:20,920
No, oh no, she's stealing one.

6062
04:03:20,920 --> 04:03:24,920
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

6063
04:03:24,920 --> 04:03:28,920
Yeah, but it means I won't win this turn.

6064
04:03:28,920 --> 04:03:29,920
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6065
04:03:29,920 --> 04:03:33,920
Wait, I can do trash collector and mutton chops.

6066
04:03:33,920 --> 04:03:34,920
Okay.

6067
04:03:34,920 --> 04:03:36,920
And then I win.

6068
04:03:36,920 --> 04:03:37,920
Wait, no.

6069
04:03:37,920 --> 04:03:40,920
No, I don't.

6070
04:03:40,920 --> 04:03:41,920
Fuck.

6071
04:03:41,920 --> 04:03:43,920
This is a complex game.

6072
04:03:43,920 --> 04:03:44,920
It is.

6073
04:03:44,920 --> 04:03:59,920
I mean, sort of.

6074
04:03:59,920 --> 04:04:02,920
Okay, okay.

6075
04:04:02,920 --> 04:04:05,920
Yeah, dog.

6076
04:04:05,920 --> 04:04:07,920
Alright, then you just need one with two more.

6077
04:04:07,920 --> 04:04:09,920
I need one, yeah.

6078
04:04:09,920 --> 04:04:12,920
I mean, you have one, you have one, right?

6079
04:04:12,920 --> 04:04:14,920
So.

6080
04:04:14,920 --> 04:04:18,920
Oh God, okay.

6081
04:04:18,920 --> 04:04:21,920
No, she's attacking me for one.

6082
04:04:21,920 --> 04:04:25,920
No, she's attacking me for two.

6083
04:04:25,920 --> 04:04:27,920
So you need one chop and you have one, right?

6084
04:04:27,920 --> 04:04:30,920
She's attacking me for two.

6085
04:04:30,920 --> 04:04:32,920
Yes.

6086
04:04:32,920 --> 04:04:33,920
Well then you're good, right?

6087
04:04:33,920 --> 04:04:35,920
I think I'm gonna win.

6088
04:04:35,920 --> 04:04:41,920
I think I'm gonna win.

6089
04:04:41,920 --> 04:04:45,920
Okay, okay, okay.

6090
04:04:45,920 --> 04:04:46,920
She doesn't even realize.

6091
04:04:46,920 --> 04:04:49,920
She doesn't realize how fucked she is.

6092
04:04:49,920 --> 04:04:50,920
Yeah!

6093
04:04:50,920 --> 04:04:51,920
Yeah!

6094
04:04:51,920 --> 04:04:52,920
There's only one thing to do now.

6095
04:04:52,920 --> 04:04:55,920
Return to my lucrative high-tech job.

6096
04:04:55,920 --> 04:04:59,920
Damn.

6097
04:04:59,920 --> 04:05:01,920
That's the equivalent of me saying nothing about it

6098
04:05:01,920 --> 04:05:03,920
when I had sex with her last night.

6099
04:05:03,920 --> 04:05:04,920
Oh.

6100
04:05:04,920 --> 04:05:07,920
Way to take the wind out of my sails.

6101
04:05:07,920 --> 04:05:09,920
Okay.

6102
04:05:09,920 --> 04:05:15,920
So I got a body like Zeus.

6103
04:05:15,920 --> 04:05:16,920
Why did the battery...

6104
04:05:16,920 --> 04:05:18,920
Why did they take the time to draw in

6105
04:05:18,920 --> 04:05:23,920
that the battery on this phone is low?

6106
04:05:23,920 --> 04:05:28,920
What an unnecessary detail.

6107
04:05:28,920 --> 04:05:31,920
Oh fuck, we're supposed to get other things before this.

6108
04:05:31,920 --> 04:05:32,920
Oh Jesus Christ.

6109
04:05:32,920 --> 04:05:34,920
What do you mean?

6110
04:05:34,920 --> 04:05:35,920
Alright, we need...

6111
04:05:35,920 --> 04:05:37,920
Okay, oh my God.

6112
04:05:37,920 --> 04:05:41,920
You've completed one of three quests

6113
04:05:41,920 --> 04:05:44,920
to unlock the different parts of this cosplay.

6114
04:05:44,920 --> 04:05:45,920
Yeah, yeah.

6115
04:05:45,920 --> 04:05:47,920
I gathered that much.

6116
04:05:47,920 --> 04:05:49,920
Oh my God, it's Lego City.

6117
04:05:49,920 --> 04:05:51,920
Oh, it's like an old friend.

6118
04:05:51,920 --> 04:05:53,920
I want...

6119
04:05:53,920 --> 04:05:56,920
No, I want fucking Lego Ninjago.

6120
04:05:56,920 --> 04:05:58,920
When am I gonna see Lego Ninjago World?

6121
04:05:58,920 --> 04:06:00,920
I don't think that's a thing.

6122
04:06:00,920 --> 04:06:01,920
Is it?

6123
04:06:01,920 --> 04:06:04,920
I mean, I keep seeing ads for it on the sides.

6124
04:06:04,920 --> 04:06:08,920
Alright, okay, okay, okay.

6125
04:06:08,920 --> 04:06:10,920
Oh my God.

6126
04:06:10,920 --> 04:06:13,920
I'm assaulted by words right now.

6127
04:06:13,920 --> 04:06:15,920
Yeah, let's do it.

6128
04:06:15,920 --> 04:06:16,920
Let's do it.

6129
04:06:16,920 --> 04:06:19,920
Let's guess these games.

6130
04:06:19,920 --> 04:06:22,920
Okay, okay.

6131
04:06:22,920 --> 04:06:26,920
Look like the elf archer from math.

6132
04:06:26,920 --> 04:06:29,920
Customize the guy in green on the left

6133
04:06:29,920 --> 04:06:31,920
to get his mask.

6134
04:06:31,920 --> 04:06:33,920
This is supposed to be the first area

6135
04:06:33,920 --> 04:06:36,920
where you crash through the Midget Center.

6136
04:06:36,920 --> 04:06:38,920
Um...

6137
04:06:38,920 --> 04:06:41,920
Okay, so that's the theater, I think.

6138
04:06:41,920 --> 04:06:44,920
Okay, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6139
04:06:44,920 --> 04:06:47,920
Okay, sick.

6140
04:06:47,920 --> 04:06:49,920
Yeah, so sick then.

6141
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:50,920
So sick.

6142
04:06:50,920 --> 04:06:51,920
Maybe I can...

6143
04:06:51,920 --> 04:06:53,920
Can I customize Lego Arctic Man?

6144
04:06:53,920 --> 04:06:55,920
Oh, try.

6145
04:06:55,920 --> 04:06:57,920
I'm sure that I can't.

6146
04:06:57,920 --> 04:06:58,920
Well, why not?

6147
04:06:58,920 --> 04:07:00,920
Because it would be cowardly.

6148
04:07:00,920 --> 04:07:01,920
Okay, here we go.

6149
04:07:01,920 --> 04:07:03,920
Alright, alright, alright.

6150
04:07:03,920 --> 04:07:07,920
Get his mask.

6151
04:07:07,920 --> 04:07:08,920
Alright.

6152
04:07:08,920 --> 04:07:10,920
Got it.

6153
04:07:10,920 --> 04:07:13,920
Uh...

6154
04:07:13,920 --> 04:07:15,920
Go to the expo floor on your right,

6155
04:07:15,920 --> 04:07:17,920
and you will talk to a man with orange hair

6156
04:07:17,920 --> 04:07:20,920
at the wicked cool news booth.

6157
04:07:20,920 --> 04:07:22,920
He'll tell you about an amazing opportunity.

6158
04:07:22,920 --> 04:07:25,920
He says he hired spies to help him get info

6159
04:07:25,920 --> 04:07:27,920
on the next math movie.

6160
04:07:27,920 --> 04:07:29,920
Yeah, yeah, I talked to that guy.

6161
04:07:29,920 --> 04:07:31,920
That would be the first site to poke

6162
04:07:31,920 --> 04:07:33,920
what Omega looks like for the preview

6163
04:07:33,920 --> 04:07:34,920
of the next math movie.

6164
04:07:34,920 --> 04:07:36,920
Okay, so what this is,

6165
04:07:36,920 --> 04:07:38,920
is that you're supposed to be dressing up

6166
04:07:38,920 --> 04:07:41,920
as Thanos before anyone knows who Thanos is.

6167
04:07:41,920 --> 04:07:43,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6168
04:07:43,920 --> 04:07:45,920
And that's how you win the costume contest,

6169
04:07:45,920 --> 04:07:46,920
is by dressing up as a character

6170
04:07:46,920 --> 04:07:48,920
that nobody's ever seen before.

6171
04:07:48,920 --> 04:07:50,920
Yeah, but be so impressed that you know

6172
04:07:50,920 --> 04:07:52,920
they'll just have to give it to you.

6173
04:07:52,920 --> 04:07:53,920
Okay.

6174
04:07:53,920 --> 04:07:54,920
Okay.

6175
04:07:54,920 --> 04:07:56,920
So, um...

6176
04:07:56,920 --> 04:07:59,920
I'm supposed to dress up as the green archer?

6177
04:07:59,920 --> 04:08:00,920
Mm-hmm.

6178
04:08:00,920 --> 04:08:02,920
Or elf archer?

6179
04:08:02,920 --> 04:08:04,920
Yeah.

6180
04:08:04,920 --> 04:08:05,920
Alright.

6181
04:08:05,920 --> 04:08:07,920
So, you go to the exit hall?

6182
04:08:07,920 --> 04:08:08,920
Alright.

6183
04:08:08,920 --> 04:08:10,920
He says...

6184
04:08:10,920 --> 04:08:11,920
Okay.

6185
04:08:11,920 --> 04:08:13,920
There's a girl with a red leather jacket

6186
04:08:13,920 --> 04:08:15,920
who has a picture of Omega on.

6187
04:08:15,920 --> 04:08:16,920
Right over there.

6188
04:08:16,920 --> 04:08:17,920
Okay.

6189
04:08:17,920 --> 04:08:19,920
Find a girl with a red leather jacket

6190
04:08:19,920 --> 04:08:22,920
who I think is in this part, I think.

6191
04:08:22,920 --> 04:08:24,920
Maybe.

6192
04:08:24,920 --> 04:08:25,920
Not in here.

6193
04:08:25,920 --> 04:08:26,920
There's nobody in here.

6194
04:08:26,920 --> 04:08:27,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6195
04:08:27,920 --> 04:08:29,920
In the part with the Wicked New Cools guy.

6196
04:08:29,920 --> 04:08:31,920
Wicked New Cools?

6197
04:08:31,920 --> 04:08:32,920
Wicked New Cools.

6198
04:08:32,920 --> 04:08:34,920
Wicked New Cools brand cigarettes.

6199
04:08:34,920 --> 04:08:37,920
I got some Wicked New Cools on right now, dude.

6200
04:08:37,920 --> 04:08:38,920
They're so wicked.

6201
04:08:38,920 --> 04:08:39,920
Oh, my God.

6202
04:08:39,920 --> 04:08:41,920
And my brand is screaming,

6203
04:08:41,920 --> 04:08:42,920
Stop, stop.

6204
04:08:42,920 --> 04:08:45,920
What are you doing to me?

6205
04:08:45,920 --> 04:08:47,920
Okay.

6206
04:08:47,920 --> 04:08:51,920
We gotta stop after we fucking feed this episode.

6207
04:08:51,920 --> 04:08:53,920
Yeah, I don't want anymore.

6208
04:08:53,920 --> 04:08:54,920
Yeah.

6209
04:08:54,920 --> 04:08:55,920
We gotta finish what we started,

6210
04:08:55,920 --> 04:08:57,920
but we gotta stop some way.

6211
04:08:57,920 --> 04:08:59,920
Okay.

6212
04:08:59,920 --> 04:09:01,920
So what am I looking for?

6213
04:09:01,920 --> 04:09:03,920
A girl with a leather jacket

6214
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:07,920
who's in the Wicked New Cools room place.

6215
04:09:07,920 --> 04:09:08,920
Okay.

6216
04:09:08,920 --> 04:09:10,920
Which I think is the exit hall.

6217
04:09:10,920 --> 04:09:12,920
I think it's...

6218
04:09:12,920 --> 04:09:14,920
Yeah.

6219
04:09:18,920 --> 04:09:21,920
These in-between rooms are awful.

6220
04:09:21,920 --> 04:09:24,920
Yeah, they are awful and they drag the game to a halt

6221
04:09:24,920 --> 04:09:26,920
and they suck and they make me cry.

6222
04:09:26,920 --> 04:09:27,920
No, I don't know where they are.

6223
04:09:27,920 --> 04:09:29,920
I don't know where it is.

6224
04:09:29,920 --> 04:09:30,920
Okay.

6225
04:09:30,920 --> 04:09:31,920
Costumized the Lego Man.

6226
04:09:31,920 --> 04:09:33,920
No, I can't customize the Lego Man.

6227
04:09:33,920 --> 04:09:36,920
He's not a real person.

6228
04:09:36,920 --> 04:09:38,920
I won't say that about him.

6229
04:09:38,920 --> 04:09:39,920
God damn it.

6230
04:09:39,920 --> 04:09:40,920
No characters.

6231
04:09:40,920 --> 04:09:42,920
He has no character.

6232
04:09:42,920 --> 04:09:44,920
He has no moral fiber.

6233
04:09:44,920 --> 04:09:45,920
Yeah.

6234
04:09:45,920 --> 04:09:46,920
He doesn't believe...

6235
04:09:46,920 --> 04:09:47,920
He's lacking in personality.

6236
04:09:47,920 --> 04:09:49,920
...in anything.

6237
04:09:51,920 --> 04:09:52,920
Okay.

6238
04:09:52,920 --> 04:09:53,920
Which I hear.

6239
04:09:53,920 --> 04:09:54,920
Wicked Cool News.

6240
04:09:54,920 --> 04:09:57,920
So find a girl with a red leather jacket.

6241
04:10:05,920 --> 04:10:07,920
Not the pizza girl.

6242
04:10:07,920 --> 04:10:09,920
Not Stan Ditko.

6243
04:10:09,920 --> 04:10:11,920
There's nobody like that here.

6244
04:10:11,920 --> 04:10:12,920
What the fuck?

6245
04:10:12,920 --> 04:10:13,920
Wait, wait, wait.

6246
04:10:13,920 --> 04:10:16,920
Was it the girl who walked into...

6247
04:10:16,920 --> 04:10:19,920
Yeah, it was the girl that walked into the...

6248
04:10:20,920 --> 04:10:22,920
The fucking...

6249
04:10:22,920 --> 04:10:23,920
I don't know.

6250
04:10:23,920 --> 04:10:25,920
The screening or whatever.

6251
04:10:25,920 --> 04:10:27,920
Costumized...

6252
04:10:27,920 --> 04:10:29,920
Okay, hold on.

6253
04:10:29,920 --> 04:10:31,920
Jesus Christ.

6254
04:10:35,920 --> 04:10:37,920
Costumized the gray-haired girl.

6255
04:10:37,920 --> 04:10:39,920
Get her hat.

6256
04:10:39,920 --> 04:10:40,920
Wait.

6257
04:10:40,920 --> 04:10:42,920
Oh yeah, right there.

6258
04:10:42,920 --> 04:10:43,920
But that's not...

6259
04:10:43,920 --> 04:10:46,920
But she doesn't have the same hat though.

6260
04:10:46,920 --> 04:10:47,920
It's not the same hat.

6261
04:10:47,920 --> 04:10:49,920
That's not what the walkthrough says though.

6262
04:10:51,920 --> 04:10:53,920
Okay, fine.

6263
04:10:53,920 --> 04:10:54,920
I'll do it.

6264
04:10:54,920 --> 04:10:58,920
I'm just saying that that's not the hat that the elf archer wears.

6265
04:11:00,920 --> 04:11:01,920
Okay.

6266
04:11:01,920 --> 04:11:03,920
That's fine.

6267
04:11:04,920 --> 04:11:07,920
So I guess I gotta find her torso bits.

6268
04:11:07,920 --> 04:11:08,920
Yeah.

6269
04:11:08,920 --> 04:11:10,920
Looks like she's gotten okay.

6270
04:11:12,920 --> 04:11:13,920
Alright.

6271
04:11:13,920 --> 04:11:14,920
Alright.

6272
04:11:15,920 --> 04:11:19,920
Receive a free elf archer comic from the gray-haired man's booth.

6273
04:11:19,920 --> 04:11:20,920
I did that.

6274
04:11:20,920 --> 04:11:21,920
In the hallway, okay.

6275
04:11:21,920 --> 04:11:22,920
I did that already.

6276
04:11:22,920 --> 04:11:24,920
Now you should know what elf archer looks like.

6277
04:11:24,920 --> 04:11:25,920
Go into the hallway.

6278
04:11:25,920 --> 04:11:27,920
All the halls look exactly the same.

6279
04:11:27,920 --> 04:11:30,920
Follow her in each door she goes into.

6280
04:11:30,920 --> 04:11:33,920
Once you've finally caught here, ask her what Omega 1 looks like.

6281
04:11:33,920 --> 04:11:35,920
So this is you harassing the staff member.

6282
04:11:35,920 --> 04:11:36,920
I did that already.

6283
04:11:36,920 --> 04:11:37,920
I did that already.

6284
04:11:37,920 --> 04:11:38,920
Okay, alright.

6285
04:11:38,920 --> 04:11:39,920
Thank God.

6286
04:11:39,920 --> 04:11:40,920
Oh wait, wait, wait.

6287
04:11:40,920 --> 04:11:43,920
Look, in this one she does have that shitty hat on.

6288
04:11:43,920 --> 04:11:44,920
So okay.

6289
04:11:44,920 --> 04:11:45,920
Yeah.

6290
04:11:45,920 --> 04:11:46,920
That's weird.

6291
04:11:46,920 --> 04:11:47,920
Alright.

6292
04:11:47,920 --> 04:11:49,920
So I just need that gray-haired man.

6293
04:11:49,920 --> 04:11:52,920
Well, you know, they change the costumes for the movies to make it more mass.

6294
04:11:52,920 --> 04:11:53,920
Oh, there he is.

6295
04:11:53,920 --> 04:11:54,920
There he is.

6296
04:11:54,920 --> 04:11:55,920
He's got it.

6297
04:11:55,920 --> 04:11:56,920
Pinata man.

6298
04:12:01,920 --> 04:12:02,920
Okay.

6299
04:12:03,920 --> 04:12:05,920
I think that's it.

6300
04:12:07,920 --> 04:12:08,920
I think I have the free-

6301
04:12:08,920 --> 04:12:11,920
Did you call that person's phone already?

6302
04:12:12,920 --> 04:12:14,920
Uh, no.

6303
04:12:15,920 --> 04:12:18,920
Uh, call number.

6304
04:12:18,920 --> 04:12:19,920
Once you harass her.

6305
04:12:19,920 --> 04:12:21,920
No signal.

6306
04:12:21,920 --> 04:12:26,920
Once you harass her, you should have asked if you had any money.

6307
04:12:26,920 --> 04:12:27,920
Yeah.

6308
04:12:27,920 --> 04:12:28,920
Did that happen?

6309
04:12:28,920 --> 04:12:29,920
Yeah.

6310
04:12:29,920 --> 04:12:30,920
What did you say?

6311
04:12:30,920 --> 04:12:34,920
I said, she said call me if you've got a real offer.

6312
04:12:37,920 --> 04:12:38,920
Okay.

6313
04:12:38,920 --> 04:12:40,920
But there's no signal.

6314
04:12:40,920 --> 04:12:41,920
Okay.

6315
04:12:41,920 --> 04:12:44,920
So yeah, you have to go outside of the conference room.

6316
04:12:46,920 --> 04:12:49,920
Okay, go up the platform.

6317
04:12:49,920 --> 04:12:52,920
So the tech lounge and call her.

6318
04:12:52,920 --> 04:12:55,920
The tech lounge.

6319
04:12:58,920 --> 04:13:01,920
I don't know where the hell the tech lounge is.

6320
04:13:01,920 --> 04:13:06,920
Tech lounge?

6321
04:13:06,920 --> 04:13:09,920
Is that the place with the big demo?

6322
04:13:09,920 --> 04:13:13,920
I think that might be the place with the big green float.

6323
04:13:13,920 --> 04:13:14,920
Why is that?

6324
04:13:14,920 --> 04:13:16,920
Why is that the tech lounge?

6325
04:13:16,920 --> 04:13:17,920
Why would there be tech?

6326
04:13:17,920 --> 04:13:18,920
I don't...

6327
04:13:18,920 --> 04:13:20,920
I don't know.

6328
04:13:20,920 --> 04:13:27,920
Okay, the guy in front of the screening hall said something about the tech lounge.

6329
04:13:31,920 --> 04:13:34,920
Uh, it's not in the theater.

6330
04:13:34,920 --> 04:13:35,920
No.

6331
04:13:36,920 --> 04:13:39,920
Try the hallway.

6332
04:13:46,920 --> 04:13:48,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

6333
04:13:48,920 --> 04:13:50,920
Oh, here, tech lounge.

6334
04:13:50,920 --> 04:13:51,920
Okay.

6335
04:13:51,920 --> 04:13:52,920
Call.

6336
04:13:52,920 --> 04:13:54,920
Call number.

6337
04:13:54,920 --> 04:14:00,920
Hey, someone's network is getting amazing service here.

6338
04:14:00,920 --> 04:14:01,920
What?

6339
04:14:01,920 --> 04:14:02,920
Okay.

6340
04:14:03,920 --> 04:14:04,920
What?

6341
04:14:07,920 --> 04:14:08,920
Got it.

6342
04:14:08,920 --> 04:14:10,920
I'll just text myself this photo.

6343
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:15,920
Yeah.

6344
04:14:16,920 --> 04:14:18,920
Sick.

6345
04:14:18,920 --> 04:14:21,920
Wait, this is way too high IQ for me.

6346
04:14:21,920 --> 04:14:22,920
What is happening right now?

6347
04:14:22,920 --> 04:14:30,920
I just texted myself the photo of Omicron's cape from her phone.

6348
04:14:30,920 --> 04:14:35,920
Because she had a picture of it.

6349
04:14:35,920 --> 04:14:36,920
Okay.

6350
04:14:36,920 --> 04:14:37,920
Okay.

6351
04:14:37,920 --> 04:14:38,920
That's what happened.

6352
04:14:38,920 --> 04:14:39,920
All right.

6353
04:14:39,920 --> 04:14:44,920
Okay, so now what do we do with all this elf archer nonsense?

6354
04:14:44,920 --> 04:14:45,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6355
04:14:45,920 --> 04:14:47,920
Um, enter the demo area.

6356
04:14:47,920 --> 04:14:50,920
You'll see a kid with a bow and some arrows.

6357
04:14:50,920 --> 04:14:51,920
Okay.

6358
04:14:51,920 --> 04:14:53,920
I guess I gotta customize them?

6359
04:14:53,920 --> 04:14:54,920
Yeah.

6360
04:14:54,920 --> 04:14:55,920
Okay.

6361
04:14:57,920 --> 04:14:59,920
This is the demo area.

6362
04:15:00,920 --> 04:15:01,920
No hallway.

6363
04:15:01,920 --> 04:15:02,920
The hallway.

6364
04:15:02,920 --> 04:15:03,920
Okay.

6365
04:15:03,920 --> 04:15:04,920
Yeah.

6366
04:15:04,920 --> 04:15:05,920
Demo area.

6367
04:15:05,920 --> 04:15:06,920
Demo area.

6368
04:15:06,920 --> 04:15:07,920
Demo area.

6369
04:15:07,920 --> 04:15:08,920
Yeah.

6370
04:15:08,920 --> 04:15:10,920
But I can't make a mistake saying these things.

6371
04:15:10,920 --> 04:15:15,920
We have to do one more Lego city ad.

6372
04:15:15,920 --> 04:15:16,920
Yeah.

6373
04:15:16,920 --> 04:15:20,920
It just gets worse and worse every time.

6374
04:15:20,920 --> 04:15:21,920
All right.

6375
04:15:21,920 --> 04:15:22,920
Here he is.

6376
04:15:22,920 --> 04:15:23,920
Yeah.

6377
04:15:23,920 --> 04:15:24,920
He's got the.

6378
04:15:24,920 --> 04:15:25,920
Okay.

6379
04:15:25,920 --> 04:15:26,920
I got bow and arrow.

6380
04:15:26,920 --> 04:15:27,920
There you go.

6381
04:15:27,920 --> 04:15:28,920
Bam.

6382
04:15:28,920 --> 04:15:29,920
Done.

6383
04:15:29,920 --> 04:15:30,920
Done.

6384
04:15:30,920 --> 04:15:37,920
Enter the exhibit hall and you will see two people arguing over a lost elf archer statue.

6385
04:15:37,920 --> 04:15:41,920
When they're finished, click on the empty statue frame and do a pose.

6386
04:15:44,920 --> 04:15:45,920
Okay.

6387
04:15:45,920 --> 04:15:50,920
I can see a bit of a holly fuck.

6388
04:15:50,920 --> 04:15:53,920
I'm going to, I'm going to perish.

6389
04:15:53,920 --> 04:15:57,920
This game has perished me.

6390
04:15:58,920 --> 04:16:03,920
It's a, this, this game is a piece of poopy diarrhea.

6391
04:16:03,920 --> 04:16:05,920
Here we go.

6392
04:16:05,920 --> 04:16:07,920
Here we go.

6393
04:16:11,920 --> 04:16:12,920
There's got to be a way inside.

6394
04:16:12,920 --> 04:16:13,920
I think stand on the red thing.

6395
04:16:13,920 --> 04:16:14,920
Stand on the red thing.

6396
04:16:14,920 --> 04:16:17,920
Maybe the elf archer could get in.

6397
04:16:17,920 --> 04:16:18,920
Yeah.

6398
04:16:18,920 --> 04:16:19,920
Yeah.

6399
04:16:19,920 --> 04:16:21,920
With my balloon.

6400
04:16:21,920 --> 04:16:28,920
Oh, it's going to clip.

6401
04:16:28,920 --> 04:16:29,920
It's going to clip.

6402
04:16:29,920 --> 04:16:30,920
It's going to clip.

6403
04:16:30,920 --> 04:16:31,920
Oh, no.

6404
04:16:31,920 --> 04:16:32,920
It just flipped right through the wall.

6405
04:16:32,920 --> 04:16:37,920
Oh, wow.

6406
04:16:37,920 --> 04:16:44,920
They're staying very still.

6407
04:16:44,920 --> 04:16:49,920
I see that they, they whitewashed the character.

6408
04:16:49,920 --> 04:16:50,920
Yeah.

6409
04:16:50,920 --> 04:16:51,920
Again.

6410
04:16:51,920 --> 04:16:52,920
Thanks Hollywood.

6411
04:16:52,920 --> 04:16:55,920
I'm used to it by now.

6412
04:16:55,920 --> 04:16:56,920
I'm so sneaky.

6413
04:16:56,920 --> 04:16:59,920
Time to snoop for Omeghan's mask.

6414
04:16:59,920 --> 04:17:02,920
Oh, we got a ninja.

6415
04:17:02,920 --> 04:17:03,920
Wow.

6416
04:17:03,920 --> 04:17:04,920
I love superheroes.

6417
04:17:04,920 --> 04:17:06,920
We got some masks up there.

6418
04:17:06,920 --> 04:17:08,920
Oh, there it is.

6419
04:17:08,920 --> 04:17:10,920
There it is.

6420
04:17:10,920 --> 04:17:13,920
There it is.

6421
04:17:13,920 --> 04:17:19,920
Oh, imagine this person is such a, the player picture is such a fucking freak in this game.

6422
04:17:19,920 --> 04:17:20,920
Yeah.

6423
04:17:20,920 --> 04:17:21,920
Yeah.

6424
04:17:21,920 --> 04:17:22,920
That's true.

6425
04:17:22,920 --> 04:17:25,920
You just have to find out 30 seconds for anyone else.

6426
04:17:25,920 --> 04:17:27,920
You're going to these great, any legal lengths.

6427
04:17:27,920 --> 04:17:28,920
Wow.

6428
04:17:28,920 --> 04:17:30,920
I really like the direction they went with the mask.

6429
04:17:30,920 --> 04:17:32,920
That's some fine work right there.

6430
04:17:32,920 --> 04:17:33,920
Yeah.

6431
04:17:33,920 --> 04:17:34,920
Yeah.

6432
04:17:34,920 --> 04:17:35,920
All right.

6433
04:17:35,920 --> 04:17:36,920
I got all the pieces.

6434
04:17:36,920 --> 04:17:39,920
I've got all the pieces of Omeghan.

6435
04:17:39,920 --> 04:17:44,920
Now I can win the, now I can win the day.

6436
04:17:44,920 --> 04:17:45,920
All right.

6437
04:17:45,920 --> 04:17:46,920
Go.

6438
04:17:46,920 --> 04:17:47,920
Okay.

6439
04:17:47,920 --> 04:17:48,920
Okay.

6440
04:17:48,920 --> 04:17:52,920
Go to the Wicked Cool News Guy and get the pictures.

6441
04:17:52,920 --> 04:17:56,920
You will literally whip up the suit.

6442
04:17:56,920 --> 04:17:57,920
Okay.

6443
04:17:57,920 --> 04:18:01,920
I fucking, I've done the deed.

6444
04:18:01,920 --> 04:18:06,920
I committed, I committed corporate, corporate sabotage.

6445
04:18:06,920 --> 04:18:08,920
Now, now, now go to the theater.

6446
04:18:08,920 --> 04:18:10,920
Oh, did you like the animation?

6447
04:18:10,920 --> 04:18:15,920
I don't know why they didn't just have him walk.

6448
04:18:15,920 --> 04:18:22,920
He had to fucking turn a tornado for a second.

6449
04:18:22,920 --> 04:18:25,920
Wait, fuck.

6450
04:18:25,920 --> 04:18:27,920
Here we go.

6451
04:18:27,920 --> 04:18:30,920
Here we go.

6452
04:18:30,920 --> 04:18:32,920
Oh my God.

6453
04:18:32,920 --> 04:18:33,920
Here it is.

6454
04:18:33,920 --> 04:18:34,920
We've done it.

6455
04:18:34,920 --> 04:18:38,920
Hey, this is the spoils of our labors.

6456
04:18:38,920 --> 04:18:39,920
This is it.

6457
04:18:39,920 --> 04:18:43,920
We finally, we've, we've, I can't take my hat off.

6458
04:18:43,920 --> 04:18:44,920
I cannot take.

6459
04:18:44,920 --> 04:18:45,920
Oh wait.

6460
04:18:45,920 --> 04:18:46,920
There it is.

6461
04:18:46,920 --> 04:18:47,920
There it is.

6462
04:18:47,920 --> 04:18:48,920
Did you do it?

6463
04:18:48,920 --> 04:18:49,920
Yes.

6464
04:18:49,920 --> 04:18:50,920
What did it cost?

6465
04:18:50,920 --> 04:18:51,920
Everything.

6466
04:18:51,920 --> 04:18:52,920
Oh, great.

6467
04:18:52,920 --> 04:18:55,920
Now I'm dressed up as this character that nobody's seen.

6468
04:18:55,920 --> 04:18:58,920
Go win the cosplay contest.

6469
04:18:58,920 --> 04:18:59,920
Yep.

6470
04:18:59,920 --> 04:19:00,920
They're like, wow.

6471
04:19:00,920 --> 04:19:03,920
A character, a character we've never seen before.

6472
04:19:03,920 --> 04:19:05,920
That's exactly what we want.

6473
04:19:05,920 --> 04:19:10,920
That's exactly what the people want in the cosplay contest.

6474
04:19:10,920 --> 04:19:16,920
I hope I still have the balloon.

6475
04:19:16,920 --> 04:19:18,920
Oh, did you hear the laugh track?

6476
04:19:18,920 --> 04:19:19,920
No.

6477
04:19:19,920 --> 04:19:20,920
Is that a thing that's happening right now?

6478
04:19:20,920 --> 04:19:21,920
Yeah.

6479
04:19:21,920 --> 04:19:29,920
People, people are laughing and booing and mocking these people.

6480
04:19:29,920 --> 04:19:32,920
Put the life line.

6481
04:19:32,920 --> 04:19:37,920
Oh my God.

6482
04:19:37,920 --> 04:19:38,920
Lol.

6483
04:19:38,920 --> 04:19:41,920
Is it the real superhero?

6484
04:19:41,920 --> 04:19:42,920
The real him.

6485
04:19:42,920 --> 04:19:43,920
Oh my God.

6486
04:19:43,920 --> 04:19:47,920
He showed up to win the costume contest.

6487
04:19:47,920 --> 04:19:48,920
What?

6488
04:19:48,920 --> 04:19:52,920
Is that, what?

6489
04:19:52,920 --> 04:19:58,920
Oh my God, they're dead.

6490
04:19:58,920 --> 04:19:59,920
Easy.

6491
04:19:59,920 --> 04:20:03,920
Dude, there's more.

6492
04:20:03,920 --> 04:20:04,920
There's so much more.

6493
04:20:04,920 --> 04:20:05,920
There's one last episode.

6494
04:20:05,920 --> 04:20:06,920
We've got to do it.

6495
04:20:06,920 --> 04:20:07,920
I mean, we've got to find out.

6496
04:20:07,920 --> 04:20:08,920
No, no.

6497
04:20:08,920 --> 04:20:09,920
No, we've got to find out.

6498
04:20:09,920 --> 04:20:11,920
How does this resolve itself?

6499
04:20:11,920 --> 04:20:12,920
Oh my God.

6500
04:20:12,920 --> 04:20:13,920
Okay, fine.

6501
04:20:13,920 --> 04:20:16,920
Look, Omicron has taken over the pop-tropicon.

6502
04:20:16,920 --> 04:20:20,920
I've got to save humankind from him.

6503
04:20:20,920 --> 04:20:25,920
The first place he lands, he assumes, is like the citadel of all Earth.

6504
04:20:25,920 --> 04:20:28,920
Only you.

6505
04:20:28,920 --> 04:20:34,920
Only you who are dressed like him can defeat him.

6506
04:20:34,920 --> 04:20:38,920
Only you who has hashtag stolen his look.

6507
04:20:38,920 --> 04:20:41,920
He has to eject his swagger.

6508
04:20:41,920 --> 04:20:47,920
I bet I have to summon the real green archer to defeat him.

6509
04:20:47,920 --> 04:20:52,920
And with the power of you have cosplaying hurt.

6510
04:20:52,920 --> 04:20:56,920
That insane power.

6511
04:20:56,920 --> 04:21:03,920
If we gather the mighty action force weapons, sure.

6512
04:21:03,920 --> 04:21:10,920
There are three elf archers bow, gold faces, what?

6513
04:21:10,920 --> 04:21:13,920
Electron pulse and world guy's shield.

6514
04:21:13,920 --> 04:21:16,920
I read that as worst guy.

6515
04:21:16,920 --> 04:21:18,920
Talk to the ninja person.

6516
04:21:18,920 --> 04:21:20,920
I need to get the chance.

6517
04:21:20,920 --> 04:21:23,920
We'll give you a comic page that should help.

6518
04:21:23,920 --> 04:21:28,920
This is just like the reign of Omeghan Arc.

6519
04:21:28,920 --> 04:21:30,920
Well, this is just like my comic book.

6520
04:21:30,920 --> 04:21:32,920
The entire city is enslaved.

6521
04:21:32,920 --> 04:21:33,920
And I'm subjugated.

6522
04:21:33,920 --> 04:21:38,920
Yeah, my favorite comic books became a real.

6523
04:21:38,920 --> 04:21:40,920
Golly.

6524
04:21:40,920 --> 04:21:42,920
And Alphaion.

6525
04:21:42,920 --> 04:21:44,920
Look at these character signs.

6526
04:21:44,920 --> 04:21:47,920
They're fucking stellar.

6527
04:21:47,920 --> 04:21:49,920
Gold face.

6528
04:21:49,920 --> 04:21:51,920
Same as gold face and he's gold.

6529
04:21:51,920 --> 04:21:54,920
I love the it's a bugs life character.

6530
04:21:54,920 --> 04:21:56,920
Yeah, yeah, he has a bugs life.

6531
04:21:56,920 --> 04:21:59,920
He's really living his best bugs life.

6532
04:21:59,920 --> 04:22:01,920
Yeah.

6533
04:22:01,920 --> 04:22:03,920
Okay.

6534
04:22:03,920 --> 04:22:09,920
I'm going to take another look at that.

6535
04:22:09,920 --> 04:22:11,920
Collect the energy drink on the table.

6536
04:22:11,920 --> 04:22:13,920
Far left.

6537
04:22:13,920 --> 04:22:16,920
Get your nice monster zero carbs.

6538
04:22:16,920 --> 04:22:17,920
Oh, thank you.

6539
04:22:17,920 --> 04:22:18,920
Zero.

6540
04:22:18,920 --> 04:22:19,920
Is it this role of toilet paper?

6541
04:22:19,920 --> 04:22:22,920
Is this role of toilet paper, the energy drink?

6542
04:22:22,920 --> 04:22:23,920
Might as well be.

6543
04:22:23,920 --> 04:22:24,920
Taste the same.

6544
04:22:24,920 --> 04:22:27,920
I can't even remember life before Omeghan.

6545
04:22:27,920 --> 04:22:36,920
Like, yesterday.

6546
04:22:36,920 --> 04:22:40,920
Playing the mighty action force card game is the only joy I have left.

6547
04:22:40,920 --> 04:22:41,920
Good.

6548
04:22:41,920 --> 04:22:44,920
All we have left from the convention are mighty action force starter packs.

6549
04:22:44,920 --> 04:22:45,920
I want one.

6550
04:22:45,920 --> 04:22:46,920
Yeah, of course I do.

6551
04:22:46,920 --> 04:22:47,920
You fool.

6552
04:22:47,920 --> 04:22:49,920
All we have to pass the time.

6553
04:22:49,920 --> 04:22:54,920
Wait for inevitable death is just the Avengers.

6554
04:22:54,920 --> 04:22:55,920
God damn it.

6555
04:22:55,920 --> 04:22:56,920
I know how to play.

6556
04:22:56,920 --> 04:22:57,920
Stop.

6557
04:22:57,920 --> 04:22:58,920
No, you have to leave.

6558
04:22:58,920 --> 04:22:59,920
I can't.

6559
04:22:59,920 --> 04:23:00,920
I can't.

6560
04:23:00,920 --> 04:23:01,920
I have to.

6561
04:23:01,920 --> 04:23:05,920
The only way to, the only way to win is not to play.

6562
04:23:05,920 --> 04:23:06,920
Wait, actually.

6563
04:23:06,920 --> 04:23:07,920
No, I can just quit.

6564
04:23:07,920 --> 04:23:08,920
It doesn't matter.

6565
04:23:08,920 --> 04:23:12,920
Thank God.

6566
04:23:12,920 --> 04:23:13,920
All right.

6567
04:23:13,920 --> 04:23:15,920
So I got the energy drink.

6568
04:23:15,920 --> 04:23:17,920
Let's not, let's not dilly dally.

6569
04:23:17,920 --> 04:23:20,920
Let's, let's, let's, it's time to end this.

6570
04:23:20,920 --> 04:23:25,920
What a big exhibit hall.

6571
04:23:25,920 --> 04:23:28,920
What in God's name?

6572
04:23:28,920 --> 04:23:31,920
Oh, I got shocked by a laser.

6573
04:23:31,920 --> 04:23:34,920
They pay that guy 10K per diem.

6574
04:23:34,920 --> 04:23:42,920
That's a lot of, that's a lot of moolah.

6575
04:23:42,920 --> 04:23:47,920
How do you, what, what?

6576
04:23:47,920 --> 04:23:50,920
Wait, so exit, I guess.

6577
04:23:50,920 --> 04:23:52,920
It's something that you can do.

6578
04:23:52,920 --> 04:23:53,920
Just go there.

6579
04:23:53,920 --> 04:23:54,920
Okay.

6580
04:23:54,920 --> 04:23:55,920
I assume.

6581
04:23:55,920 --> 04:23:56,920
All right.

6582
04:23:56,920 --> 04:24:01,920
Oh, I was like, yeah, I'm glad to see that Omega is not destroyed the Lego city.

6583
04:24:01,920 --> 04:24:02,920
Yes.

6584
04:24:02,920 --> 04:24:03,920
No, of course not.

6585
04:24:03,920 --> 04:24:04,920
He's left those intact.

6586
04:24:04,920 --> 04:24:05,920
Oh, here we go.

6587
04:24:05,920 --> 04:24:06,920
Here we go.

6588
04:24:06,920 --> 04:24:07,920
I got the expo.

6589
04:24:07,920 --> 04:24:08,920
I can go through the vents.

6590
04:24:08,920 --> 04:24:10,920
I can crawl through the vents back to the expo.

6591
04:24:10,920 --> 04:24:11,920
There.

6592
04:24:11,920 --> 04:24:12,920
Even in the vents.

6593
04:24:12,920 --> 04:24:14,920
Even in the vents.

6594
04:24:14,920 --> 04:24:15,920
Oh, my God.

6595
04:24:15,920 --> 04:24:17,920
Love's expo city.

6596
04:24:17,920 --> 04:24:20,920
I mean, Lego city.

6597
04:24:20,920 --> 04:24:27,920
Oh, no, not Pinata, man.

6598
04:24:27,920 --> 04:24:29,920
Oh, God.

6599
04:24:29,920 --> 04:24:30,920
Yeah.

6600
04:24:30,920 --> 04:24:31,920
He's dead now.

6601
04:24:31,920 --> 04:24:32,920
Dumpster.

6602
04:24:32,920 --> 04:24:40,920
What is the point of that?

6603
04:24:41,920 --> 04:24:45,920
I thought they were like making new minions.

6604
04:24:45,920 --> 04:24:58,920
But no, they're just turning them into cruel cosplays.

6605
04:24:58,920 --> 04:25:03,920
Hypersocket wrench and competent henchman.

6606
04:25:03,920 --> 04:25:05,920
Uh-oh.

6607
04:25:05,920 --> 04:25:14,920
Should I really be walking around here dressed as the, as the almighty Omega?

6608
04:25:14,920 --> 04:25:17,920
Yeah, people will be like, oh, it's, it's you.

6609
04:25:17,920 --> 04:25:19,920
It's, it's, it's the boss.

6610
04:25:19,920 --> 04:25:21,920
Yeah.

6611
04:25:21,920 --> 04:25:24,920
What big furry paws you have.

6612
04:25:24,920 --> 04:25:28,920
I wouldn't touch that without hand protection.

6613
04:25:28,920 --> 04:25:31,920
Oh, there are pop tropical books.

6614
04:25:31,920 --> 04:25:32,920
Where?

6615
04:25:32,920 --> 04:25:34,920
Uh, on the website.

6616
04:25:34,920 --> 04:25:35,920
Wait.

6617
04:25:35,920 --> 04:25:36,920
Yeah.

6618
04:25:36,920 --> 04:25:37,920
I know.

6619
04:25:37,920 --> 04:25:42,920
I remember I was, I was looking, I thought for 45 cents we could buy the cryptids book.

6620
04:25:42,920 --> 04:25:43,920
Yeah.

6621
04:25:43,920 --> 04:25:44,920
Okay.

6622
04:25:44,920 --> 04:25:45,920
Ben.

6623
04:25:45,920 --> 04:25:46,920
Yeah.

6624
04:25:46,920 --> 04:25:47,920
On the website.

6625
04:25:47,920 --> 04:25:48,920
On the website.

6626
04:25:48,920 --> 04:25:50,920
A pop tropical.

6627
04:25:50,920 --> 04:25:53,920
They have a picture of Jeff Kinney.

6628
04:25:53,920 --> 04:25:57,920
Pop tropical creator and author of the best son, Daryl Wimpkin series.

6629
04:25:57,920 --> 04:25:58,920
Jeff Kinney.

6630
04:25:58,920 --> 04:25:59,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6631
04:25:59,920 --> 04:26:01,920
Made pop tropical.

6632
04:26:01,920 --> 04:26:02,920
Wait.

6633
04:26:02,920 --> 04:26:03,920
Yeah.

6634
04:26:03,920 --> 04:26:07,920
Pop tropical is by the diary of a wimpy kid guy.

6635
04:26:07,920 --> 04:26:08,920
Yes, it is.

6636
04:26:08,920 --> 04:26:09,920
Which came first.

6637
04:26:09,920 --> 04:26:12,920
I have to assume diary wimpy kid.

6638
04:26:12,920 --> 04:26:13,920
Uh, why?

6639
04:26:13,920 --> 04:26:14,920
Just because one's a video.

6640
04:26:14,920 --> 04:26:18,920
Well, I've never heard of pop tropical before, but I've heard of diary of a wimpy kid.

6641
04:26:18,920 --> 04:26:19,920
Well, okay.

6642
04:26:19,920 --> 04:26:20,920
It's just because you're old.

6643
04:26:20,920 --> 04:26:21,920
You don't, you don't, you don't get it.

6644
04:26:21,920 --> 04:26:22,920
You don't get it.

6645
04:26:22,920 --> 04:26:23,920
Sure.

6646
04:26:23,920 --> 04:26:24,920
Yeah.

6647
04:26:24,920 --> 04:26:25,920
That's true.

6648
04:26:25,920 --> 04:26:26,920
Um.

6649
04:26:26,920 --> 04:26:29,920
You don't know what, what, what fucking video games are about.

6650
04:26:29,920 --> 04:26:30,920
I don't.

6651
04:26:30,920 --> 04:26:31,920
Um.

6652
04:26:32,920 --> 04:26:34,920
I mean, how, how recent is this?

6653
04:26:34,920 --> 04:26:35,920
Okay.

6654
04:26:35,920 --> 04:26:36,920
Hold on.

6655
04:26:36,920 --> 04:26:37,920
Okay.

6656
04:26:37,920 --> 04:26:38,920
How recent, how old is pop tropical?

6657
04:26:38,920 --> 04:26:39,920
Okay.

6658
04:26:39,920 --> 04:26:40,920
I want to figure it out.

6659
04:26:40,920 --> 04:26:41,920
Okay.

6660
04:26:41,920 --> 04:26:42,920
This is the most pointless laser trap of all time.

6661
04:26:42,920 --> 04:26:46,920
Daryl Wimpy kid came out in fucking 2007.

6662
04:26:46,920 --> 04:26:47,920
Yeah.

6663
04:26:47,920 --> 04:26:50,920
And pop tropical came out in 2007.

6664
04:26:50,920 --> 04:26:51,920
Weird.

6665
04:26:51,920 --> 04:26:52,920
What?

6666
04:26:52,920 --> 04:26:58,920
Imagine if like the, like the two series that you're going to base the rest of your

6667
04:26:58,920 --> 04:27:05,920
entire life on both of them at the exact same year.

6668
04:27:05,920 --> 04:27:08,920
How, how is he so prolific?

6669
04:27:08,920 --> 04:27:09,920
In 2011.

6670
04:27:09,920 --> 04:27:11,920
Pop tropical and diary of a wimpy kid.

6671
04:27:11,920 --> 04:27:16,920
In 2011, pop tropical was listed on China's magazines list of 50 websites that made the

6672
04:27:16,920 --> 04:27:18,920
web great.

6673
04:27:18,920 --> 04:27:19,920
No.

6674
04:27:19,920 --> 04:27:25,920
It's up there with Facebook, with Tumblr, with Twitter, with Wikipedia.

6675
04:27:25,920 --> 04:27:27,920
For God's sake.

6676
04:27:27,920 --> 04:27:28,920
I don't want to fight.

6677
04:27:28,920 --> 04:27:29,920
Okay.

6678
04:27:29,920 --> 04:27:30,920
Hold on.

6679
04:27:30,920 --> 04:27:31,920
Let me get the website.

6680
04:27:31,920 --> 04:27:35,920
I want to see what, like what's listed that too.

6681
04:27:35,920 --> 04:27:37,920
All right.

6682
04:27:37,920 --> 04:27:38,920
Full list.

6683
04:27:38,920 --> 04:27:39,920
What do I do?

6684
04:27:39,920 --> 04:27:40,920
No.

6685
04:27:40,920 --> 04:27:41,920
Stop.

6686
04:27:41,920 --> 04:27:42,920
What do I do?

6687
04:27:42,920 --> 04:27:43,920
I'm stuck.

6688
04:27:43,920 --> 04:27:44,920
No.

6689
04:27:44,920 --> 04:27:45,920
No.

6690
04:27:45,920 --> 04:27:46,920
No.

6691
04:27:46,920 --> 04:27:47,920
I don't care.

6692
04:27:47,920 --> 04:27:48,920
You have to figure it out yourself.

6693
04:27:48,920 --> 04:27:49,920
No.

6694
04:27:49,920 --> 04:27:50,920
Okay.

6695
04:27:50,920 --> 04:27:51,920
Hold on.

6696
04:27:51,920 --> 04:27:52,920
Okay.

6697
04:27:52,920 --> 04:27:53,920
We're avoiding the lasers.

6698
04:27:53,920 --> 04:27:54,920
Wait.

6699
04:27:54,920 --> 04:27:55,920
Wait.

6700
04:27:55,920 --> 04:27:56,920
What?

6701
04:27:56,920 --> 04:28:02,920
Well, I can go to the expo and then nothing else is labeled.

6702
04:28:02,920 --> 04:28:05,920
We'll just figure it out.

6703
04:28:05,920 --> 04:28:06,920
Okay.

6704
04:28:06,920 --> 04:28:07,920
Well, maybe this is the exhibit hall.

6705
04:28:07,920 --> 04:28:08,920
Whatever.

6706
04:28:08,920 --> 04:28:09,920
Now what?

6707
04:28:09,920 --> 04:28:10,920
Doesn't look like it.

6708
04:28:10,920 --> 04:28:13,920
Well, neither does anything else.

6709
04:28:13,920 --> 04:28:17,920
Once you're in the hall, you'll see a person dressed up as the elf archer from math.

6710
04:28:17,920 --> 04:28:18,920
What?

6711
04:28:18,920 --> 04:28:19,920
God.

6712
04:28:19,920 --> 04:28:20,920
No.

6713
04:28:20,920 --> 04:28:21,920
Not true.

6714
04:28:21,920 --> 04:28:24,920
Well, you're not in the right place then.

6715
04:28:24,920 --> 04:28:25,920
Fine.

6716
04:28:25,920 --> 04:28:26,920
All right.

6717
04:28:26,920 --> 04:28:27,920
All right.

6718
04:28:27,920 --> 04:28:28,920
All right.

6719
04:28:28,920 --> 04:28:30,920
The times list of 50 websites that made the web great.

6720
04:28:30,920 --> 04:28:31,920
You got eight tracks.

6721
04:28:31,920 --> 04:28:32,920
Never heard of it.

6722
04:28:32,920 --> 04:28:34,920
HBO go.

6723
04:28:34,920 --> 04:28:38,920
How cast my damn channel.

6724
04:28:38,920 --> 04:28:41,920
I've never heard of any of these things before.

6725
04:28:41,920 --> 04:28:42,920
Well.

6726
04:28:42,920 --> 04:28:45,920
Cafe mom, dear photograph.

6727
04:28:45,920 --> 04:28:47,920
What the fuck?

6728
04:28:47,920 --> 04:28:49,920
None of these are any.

6729
04:28:49,920 --> 04:28:51,920
None of these even exist.

6730
04:28:51,920 --> 04:28:54,920
I think this is made up.

6731
04:28:54,920 --> 04:28:55,920
Police.

6732
04:28:55,920 --> 04:28:57,920

No.

6740
04:29:04,920 --> 04:29:05,920
Espionation.

6741
04:29:05,920 --> 04:29:06,920
All right.

6742
04:29:06,920 --> 04:29:08,920
I actually do know espionation.

6743
04:29:08,920 --> 04:29:10,920
That's the first one.

6744
04:29:10,920 --> 04:29:11,920
All right.

6795
04:30:05,420 --> 04:30:07,920
Those aren't even real.

6796
04:30:07,920 --> 04:30:08,920

I don't know.

6800
04:30:14,920 --> 04:30:17,920
What I guess we value in the Internet.

6801
04:30:17,920 --> 04:30:21,840
I guess we thought the Internet was going to do one thing and it just.

6802
04:30:21,840 --> 04:30:30,420
did the exact opposite pop tropica really who would ever look at this and say

6803
04:30:30,420 --> 04:30:34,240
that this makes anything great I can't fucking believe this shit that's so

6804
04:30:34,240 --> 04:30:39,000
infuriating that's live that's really infuriating Jesus Christ

6805
04:30:40,000 --> 04:30:41,000
look at this

6806
04:30:41,000 --> 04:30:42,000

6809
04:31:14,600 --> 04:31:18,960
please parents the chat feature for instance doesn't permit free form

6908
04:42:22,040 --> 04:42:29,280

6909
04:42:29,280 --> 04:42:35,440
moat that's I'm stunned I'm stunned that that's what they thought that they

6910
04:42:35,440 --> 04:42:42,480
went with that they thought that was acceptable what do you mean that's the

6911
04:42:42,480 --> 04:42:46,040
way a pulse works my advocate mirror used to work cartoon your renditions of

go wow this is so bad why why did you say that is the visual presentation of

6914
04:43:03,040 --> 04:43:07,920
these pulses is so underwhelming I think the visual the visual representation of

6915
04:43:07,920 --> 04:43:18,520
you is astounded okay so I think that I definitely have to use the the energy

6916

drinks is like batteries right I guess so you also okay go to the exhibit hall
