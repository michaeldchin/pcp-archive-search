00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello, and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's another week. It's another low-energy week, everybody. The streak continues.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No, Nate. No, watch. See you next week. Bye, everybody.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We've got sleepy Tom Oliver here.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We have the tragically, I don't know, Gibbontake who sucks.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where are you going with that tragically?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I was going to say, I was going to do another synonym for low-energy, but I couldn't think of anything other than low-energy.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Tragically, like asleep, like dead?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In a coma.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, tragically comatose. Tragically removed from consciousness.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Blip, gone.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, no.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And there's me. You all know. I don't need to say it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Comic book shipper extraordinaire, Ben Singh.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, yeah. You got my ratings.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dude, Pogger's moment.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That was Pogger's moment. I was excited. I was excited to see your tweet.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I hope other people will tweet like, oh, look, I just opened up my copy.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Especially, I've been doing drawings, right?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like sketches and drawings in the cover, right?

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
For people that paid extra for signed drawing stuff in there.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And some of them are pretty high effort.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And I hope that people will like, it would be very gratifying to me to be like, see on Twitter,

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
like people take a picture of my drawing in their copy, post on Twitter at me.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I would retweet the shit out of that.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It would be really cool if I could just have like, my feed or just all that.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, I am unsubtly telling you, hey, I would really appreciate it.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I would think it was cool if I could do, if you do that, you know, if you want to, if you're down.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm ready. I'm ready for a flood of that.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Although I probably won't be shipping those out for a little bit because they take a really long time.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've managed to get like three done today.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ooh.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ooh.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I have like 50 or 60 more to go. I don't know.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm glad mine came so quick going like literally 40 minutes down the road from where you are or something like that.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah. Yeah.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Have you done the UK ones? Have you done the Europe?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't. Yeah, I did them by tier.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have sent out all of them from, okay, every tier that didn't involve me doing like a signature and a sketch.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have sent out almost all of those except there were like a few in the like both books, $25 tier that were like,

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I had, I made a trip to the post office, but I couldn't carry anymore.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So I had to leave like a box of like 20 of them behind.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So a few of them haven't made it out yet.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But for the most part, all the like non signature and non sketch tiers are shipped out and hopefully people get them.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I mean, how long does it take to ship like to the UK? Not more than like a week, right?

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No. It's just an envelope.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It depends. It depends. Like international shipping is all fucked now because of the Rona.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They gave me, they gave me a little bit of a hassle.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They gave me a little bit of a hassle of the post office, right?

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Because here's my, I'll like, I'll have these boxes, the same boxes that the comics came in from the printer.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I take them out, I put them in envelopes, I put the envelopes back in the boxes.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I put the boxes in stacks and put them on sort of a cardboard pallet.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And then I call an Uber and the Uber shows up and I put it in the trunk and I get them to take me in like the,

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the like eight minute drive down the road to the post office because it's too heavy to carry.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And I can take maybe like 50 or 60 envelopes at once.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then I go in there and I stand in line.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And the first time I get in there, I go up to the post office counter and the lady's just like,

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
ah, you know, you should have, you could have postmarked these ahead of time.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You know, you could have just put postage on these and use stamps.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And I'm like, I couldn't, I really couldn't have.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Earn your keep wage slave.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I would have had to know to postmark them or to postage them successfully and accurately.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I would have had to know how much they were going to charge me by weight,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
which like, I could have done extensive research and like gone and found, oh, okay.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, it's technically this class of mail and this is the size and this is the weight.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So calculate, calculate.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, I think this time is how much so I need this much postage,

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but I wouldn't have known for sure until I brought it in and gave it to them.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As someone who did all of that for Radcon rewards, it sucks.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You made the right choice passing the baton.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, after the first time, because I got the receipt and I was like,

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and I was able to look at it and be like, okay, these ones cost this much.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I did end up was like, okay, give me a whole bunch of postage and I went home and I did, in fact,

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
put stamps on a lot of them because I was like, based on the previous ones,

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I know how much these will cost a ship.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So I don't have to because it takes forever.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I like stand there for like 45 minutes while she like takes like a minute per envelope to like scan it,

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
type in the information, put the stamp on it, put it in the box, you know, it's very time consuming.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You don't have to line.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't have to line.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I had people and I had people in line behind me like literally like turn around and walk out

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
because they didn't because they were so mad to be behind me in line, which I could makes total sense.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But like I got to do it at some point.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Surely surely there's a way to do like bulk sending out of items to people like like that isn't a piece of shit.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Surely there's a way to do that.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I didn't pre-label the Radcon three rewards.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And so what I did is I went to like Postal Center, which is like a business that does like multiple shipping services in from one location.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so I just went there and none of them were labeled because I wasn't smart enough to pre-label them.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And I was just like, I need this.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And they're like, Oh God, you fucking loser.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Just give them all to us and we'll go through them one at a time in between other orders.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is going to take us like a week and we'll give you the total when we're done and you come in and you'll pay for them and then we'll ship them out.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I had to wait like a week for them to like slowly go through them day after day.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And so like one of the people who works there now knows my name because like they mailed all of them and saw my address like 200 times and they want me dead.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Rightfully so.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And they know where you live.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Exactly.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's not good.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not good.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, I have spent over $1,000 on postage in the last like week or two.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dude, it's brutal.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's really brutal.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And it costs because because the envelopes with two books in them, the ones with two books cost like 320 to ship domestically to send an envelope with two books to like anywhere in the Europe or South America or anywhere other than like Canada,

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Mexico, U.S. costs like $11 and change.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's one thing.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
One of the Radcon four one envelope with two books in it.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The Radcon four rewards went to some country.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't remember what it was, but it was just the pin and the poster and the pin and the poster itself to ship to this country was $52.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Jesus.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And I'm just like, why?

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
God, why?

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Was it because was it in the tube?

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No, this was just a tiny poster like the letter sized poster and a pin.

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's that's bizarre.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It was it was criminal, I tell you.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And all the international ones were like $20 to $30 to ship normally.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
How do you know how much they weighed?

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because like it's by it's by weight and it's by right.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They they the lady at the.

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This was on my second day bringing like a big shipment of boxes in to have them post my and this the second day because the first time she got annoyed with me because she was like, you could have just postage these ahead of time.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But she was like, okay, it's kind of understandable for the for the foreign ones because like that varies country to country.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So the next day I brought in mostly just the foreign ones to be like, okay, these are the ones that I can't post.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then the next day I was like, okay, these ones I all pre stamped and you don't have to scan them.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And that was like, it was really easy.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And I think she really appreciated it.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But the second day I'm handing over these foreign ones to send to other countries.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And like the ladies got a like, it's like a different woman than the usual one is like scanning it.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And she's getting like confused.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I don't know why.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I'm telling her like, she's asking me questions about like, like, what like category of shipping and I'm like, I don't know.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I sent these all like yesterday and it was fine.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Like there wasn't any problem.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Like why, why are you asking me like what I am trying to do?

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It was why, why is it not simple?

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And she like brought the manager over and the manager like flexed a little bit.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think she wanted to like flex her nuts on me.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And she was like, hmm, what did he say?

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What did he say was in these?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, okay.

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The books.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's all paper and bubble wrap.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm putting bubble wrap in them.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm getting really fancy and a pin or a metal pin.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Like, oh, you know, technically, you know, technically, if there's anything other than paper in there, it counts as a package and not an envelope.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And it should cost like a million fucking dollars to ship it.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And she's just like, you understand that?

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I'm like, yes.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And she's like, okay, and leaves.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And then let's me continue to scan them and ship them as envelopes and not packages.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Like, what was the point?

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What was the fucking point of coming over here and asking me to confirm that I understand that she is doing me a big favor by letting me ship these envelopes as envelopes?

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's probably like her one thrill in life at this point.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
She has so little reason for existing.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And this is like, she can arguably, she can argue, but she can have an, this is a situation where she can have an impact.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Not a positive or a good impact, but an impact nonetheless.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She has power over you.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
She's choosing not to enforce it, but the option is there at any moment.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
She could.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Living fear.

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I could really, hey, you know, I could really fuck you over right now, right?

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You know, I could really fuck your whole day up.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You know.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
All right.

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Have a good day.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
All right.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
See you tomorrow.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She was so wet after that.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Fortunately, I have not, that was, I only saw her once.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I have not seen her since.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I hope I never do again.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
She didn't seem, I don't know.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She didn't seem to be like, she didn't seem like threatening.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
She wasn't, but she like, why?

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Like, why are you saying this to me?

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Like, go away.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The first time in a month, she should be able to like flex her postal center knowledge.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Just like, yes, I can do this.

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I was afraid.

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was, I was afraid I would go back and she'd be there and they'd be like, no, no, we warned

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you last time.

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We warned you last time.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We were going to, we were going to charge you quadruple for these because they're technically

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
packages because they have.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's like a links awakening when you steal something from a store and you go back the

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
next day, they just kill you with lightning.

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Right.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Right.

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I was, um, I was watching a speed run of links awakening the other day and I saw that.

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I didn't know that was a thing before, but I, I just so happened to have very recently

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
discovered, like, found out about the thing you just referenced.

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh good.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm glad.

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm glad I kept that in my back pocket until right now.

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It wouldn't, it would have been wasted before.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Damn.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hmm.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Hmm.

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Um, yeah.

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So that's, uh, that's what the, that's what the fucking vapors shipping is like.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's really, it's really time consuming.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's takes so fucking long.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Shipping sucks.

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, it does.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I feel like I kind of like it because it's mindless and I don't have to, it's not like,

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I have to think about it.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You can ship radcon five then.

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Uh, cause let me tell you, you know, four shipping was pretty rough.

212
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If I, if it means I can just like sit at my desk and like address envelopes and like

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
put on fucking like every GDQ run from the, from the, from the last year on a playlist

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and just autoplay it for like days straight.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Like, yeah, share whatever.

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No problem.

217
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll take it.

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That does sound pretty nice.

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah.

220
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's what I've been, that's what I've been doing.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
God, I miss mindless work.

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
All of this creative shit is just too much.

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I gotta think about things.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, it's a little bit like a vacation.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Gotta make decisions all the time.

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
To just, to just do busy work for a long time.

227
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's like, oh, I don't, I don't, you mean, I don't have to make any decisions.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't have to think about what I'm doing.

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Thank God.

230
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sounds like, sounds like just what the capitalist want you to think like.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Well, I can't help it.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I can't, you know, capitalism was designed to prey on, on humanities, uh, uh, worse

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
creatures.

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And here it is doing that to me.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Turning me into a drama.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Turn me into obedient workers.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, God.

238
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I, you know, I, I'm, I'm kind of craving some busy work.

239
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I feel like, like I've been drawing a lot, you know, all that stuff.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And then I stopped.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I was like realizing I was stressing myself out.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It was weird because I like, I had no idea.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And I thought about it for a second.

244
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I was like, oh my God.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I had to stop everything.

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Um, but I could, I could quite easily sit down and like turn bell jpe into a PDF.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Like that is a lot of mindless copying and pasting and like getting stills from gifts

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and putting them all in pages.

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I could do that.

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That would be a good use of my time while I'm like low, like creative juices.

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I do that when I'm low.

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah.

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have things that I can do that are useful when I'm like low creative juices.

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Um, in particular, like, um, banking and stuff, like looking at like, and like, like

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
making notes about like my, my taxes from like 2019 and stuff when I'm, I don't know,

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
like, because I, because I have to file them by October.

257
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
When I'm, when I'm feeling like, yeah, low energy need busy work.

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm just like, let me just pull up my, my bank statements and like go over that and like

259
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
a list, add up some numbers and be like, oh, okay.

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And it's great.

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It feels, it feels good.

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let me just, let me pay my, let me pay my credit card balance.

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Like, mm, mm, delicious.

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Uh, let me, let me do some online grocery shopping.

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Ooh, do I need hot dogs?

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes, I do.

267
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Done.

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I forgot hot dogs today.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
By the way, I ordered groceries and I was like, mm, yes, I'm going to get all this good

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
stuff and I forgot hot dogs and I can't get them now because I can't just order hot dogs.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I need to order like $35 worth of ship to get free shipping or like.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Where are you ordering from?

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Just get $35 worth of hot dogs.

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I, I could.

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Um, I was using Instacart.

276
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Does Instacart take EBT now or are you just paying with cash with real money?

277
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, it doesn't.

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Um, but I don't, but I don't, I don't get enough EBT that I'm like worried about like

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
running out or that I'm worried about like, oh, I'll never be able to spend this.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So it's like, uh, whatever.

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Uh, I'll just, uh, you know, you know who did start taking EBT?

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Um, I think, I think, uh, food stamps.

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, right.

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Poor people.

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think, I think specifically in response to COVID, you know, who does take EBT now is Amazon.

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What?

287
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can, you can, you can, like it's not everything, but you can buy food on Amazon and like pay for it with EBT.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh wait, Ben, did I tell you?

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Maybe you already know this, but you can get Amazon Prime for 50% off if you have EBT.

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Really?

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah.

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If you're a Prime member, you can, you can cut your subscription cost in half if you have EBT.

294
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The, I don't, what do you, what do you get from being an Amazon Prime member?

295
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You just get like Prime shipping.

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You get like Prime music and Prime video and all that kind of stuff, which I never use.

297
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I just use it because it gives me like good shipping.

298
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The only things I think, I mean, you can sometimes get a discount at Whole Foods, but

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
like I'm trying not to shop at Whole Foods because like fucking almond milk is twice as

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
like more than twice as expensive there.

301
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Uh, so it's not.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
As someone who worked for Whole Foods, Whole Foods is a scam for white people.

303
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Don't go there.

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I wish, it makes me really mad.

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It makes me really mad to think about all the money that I have wasted because I had

306
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
to shop at Whole Foods just because it's closer and because I didn't want to risk exposure

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
to COVID by taking a bus to Wegmans like I used to.

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Don't you feel like the people who would most likely like not be practicing social distancing

309
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
would be the people that's smelling their farts so much they go to Whole Foods?

310
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Whole Foods seems like an epicenter for COVID in my book.

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No, I don't know about that.

312
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think that the Whole Foods is like the liberal elite yuppies who probably are like, oh my

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
god, if only Hillary had won in 2016.

314
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm still with her, you know?

315
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I guess that's true.

316
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's the kind of person I think.

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Random people riding the bus though.

318
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Those people seem scary.

319
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Those are the ones.

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I wouldn't be going on the bus.

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I have avoided taking the bus.

322
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I did have to take the subway one time since COVID started.

323
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's even worse.

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It was kind of dicey and they would announce over this megaphone like wear a mask at all

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
times while on the train or whatever.

326
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But there were some fucking blue collar looking guys who got on who were not wearing their

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
masks.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They didn't even have masks.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They looked at each other.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They heard the say, hey, wear your mask and they noticed each other and they're like,

331
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
we're not going to do that.

332
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's so stupid.

333
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm just going to cough on like deliberately.

334
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So yeah, that was on the day that I was coming back.

335
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I was going through the city on my way back from like Cassie's dad's house or whatever

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and I stopped.

337
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It was on the 4th of July when I stopped to do the March.

338
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes, that was the day when I was like, well, I have to make my way through here somehow

339
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and the train is the best way.

340
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So I did it.

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Struggle.

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I've been on the bus and a train a couple times.

343
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They've been off peak hours.

344
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So there wasn't that really many people.

345
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

346
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The one thing I will say, the train was pretty empty.

347
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There was only like seven or eight people on the most crowded car that I took.

348
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't know if it's still like that.

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The thing I always think about though is like on the bus when you're like, because the famous

350
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
double-decker buses, I was set at the top because I like that.

351
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I like the feeling of looking down upon all the people.

352
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Your rightful place above the peasants.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, but obviously you need to walk up the stairs and hold the handrail because sometimes

354
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the driver starts driving before you get up the stairs.

355
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And the handrail is like the primary like, if somebody has COVID and they touch this,

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the mask is never going to do anything.

357
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're fucked.

358
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You have to be very vigilant to not touch things with your hands if you can avoid it.

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I like sort of do like the wrist, the back of the wrist sort of like balancing technique

360
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and swinging around like the poles sometimes in my elbow.

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And I'm sure I look very strange, but at least my hands are safe.

362
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
True.

363
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I am very scrupulous about like sanitizing.

364
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like when I go into a store, like I'll like, you know, pay with a card and like type my

365
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
number into the keypad or whatever.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But like as soon as I'm at first thing I do is I bring, I have a big bottle of sanitizer,

367
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
which I, which I put green dye in and put an endless war sticker on.

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So it's slime.

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Fuck yeah.

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So I have a big, I have a big bottle of hand sanitizing slime that I carry around in a backpack

371
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
everywhere I go and I use it constantly.

372
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I mean, if it looks like slime, I would use it constantly as well.

373
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.

374
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's, it was like the best, it was like the best 1099 I ever spent at a CVS by a mile.

375
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So I'm, I'm sanitizing.

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sanitizing all day, every day when I'm, when I'm out of the house.

377
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah.

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Every time I come home from going somewhere, I'll always wash my hands or use hand sanitizer

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
or something.

380
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Just be like, you know, I don't want to risk it.

381
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I bring it with me and I do it.

382
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I sanitize every, like every time I go into a store or every time I come out of a store,

383
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
like when I, when I take an Uber, like I hand sanitize before I get into the Uber and then

384
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
after I get out, you know, make sure not to touch my face at any time in between.

385
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh man.

386
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I've taken three Ubers to the post office so far and the second one, the second guy,

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the first guy, he had like, he had like a big sort of like minivan and he had like a

388
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
big plastic sheet hanging up between like the front seat and the back seat.

389
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So he was like sealed off from like his passengers, which I respect.

390
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I was like, cool.

391
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Second guy, small car.

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's fine.

393
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Wearing his mask improperly, nose out of the mask.

394
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Fuck you.

395
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What an idiot.

396
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You piece of shit.

397
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Stupid.

398
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

399
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I hate when people do that.

400
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I've seen a few people, even like employees working at stores doing that.

401
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm like, why?

402
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
A guy at like the, at like the Italian restaurant that like sometimes me and Munchie have gotten

403
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
like pizza at a few times.

404
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
He is the same guy.

405
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This guy also, Munchie ordered Buffalo Wings.

406
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The guy gave him, Sauceless came out with no sauce.

407
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's even worse than not wearing your mask.

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What a douche.

409
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Despicable.

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And to top it all off, he had his nose out of his mask.

411
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh God.

412
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I have not, I have not gone in there since.

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It was topped, it was topped with COVID, not with Buffalo sauce.

414
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Because I was so of off, off put by the, by this improper mask usage.

415
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm like, fuck, fuck sake.

416
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If you're going to, if you're going to not wear a mask, just commit to the bit and take

417
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
it off.

418
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Be a man about it.

419
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Have you seen, have you seen those, or I saw like a post somewhere about like people,

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
there's like a, there's like fake masks you can buy that are just like mesh that literally

421
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
don't do anything.

422
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But it's like, ha ha, if someone tells you to put a mask on, you can put this on and

423
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
then it's easy to breathe.

424
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ha ha.

425
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's like the only benefit to that is that like I can see your entire face before I punch

426
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
it.

427
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't, I don't understand.

428
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't understand the people that are like, oh, it's hard to breathe in a mask.

429
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's not.

430
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I have never found it difficult to breathe.

431
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The one thing that does annoy me about it is that some, the ones that hook around my ears

432
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
are a little uncomfortable, but now I have a couple that, that like fasten behind my head

433
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and those are perfectly comfortable.

434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The one thing that sucks about them is that like my breath get catches in it and it fogs

435
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
up my glasses.

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's the one thing that I don't like about.

437
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't like, like the only reason I could ever imagine to get your nose out is so that

438
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
it doesn't like push the air up inside your glasses, but people who have the nose, they

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
never have glasses.

440
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They're just stupid.

441
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They just can't, they can't handle a tiny bit of uncomfortableness.

442
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's, it's, people say like it's uncomfortable.

443
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's hard to breathe.

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And I just, I just don't agree.

445
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I do not find it uncomfortable in this place.

446
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Neither do I.

447
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's like, it's a little bit.

448
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Except for the glasses.

449
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I haven't had a problem with it.

450
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
A little bit like warmer.

451
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah.

452
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If I'm already like sweaty, then yeah, I guess, but like, if I'm not.

453
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's like such a small price to pay for like being on the, you know, the down swing

454
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
of this, which we're not.

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
America is still in the thick of it and always will be.

456
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Massachusetts.

457
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's all everywhere.

458
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It seems to be like researching everywhere.

459
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's going to get worse.

460
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:40,000
India just reported the highest number of new cases in a single day ever of any country.

461
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So yeah, it's not Massachusetts is still, it's, it's low.

462
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's low, but it's higher than it was like a month ago.

463
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So, you know, it's not going away.

464
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That curve.

465
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
God damn it.

466
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We've, we've more or less flattened the curve here in the, in the, in the base state.

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The base state.

468
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It is.

469
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It is the, it is the base state.

470
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That's all.

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Fuck.

472
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's so good.

473
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That's genius.

474
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You're a genius.

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I have my moments.

476
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What can I say?

477
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I can coin a phrase with the best of them.

478
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm going, I'm going.

479
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm going to take that moment of genius and put it on a shirt and sell it on the PCP store

480
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
so that we all have to split it and you can't argue with it.

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That's, that's fine.

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Cause you, you set it on the podcast so it belongs to all of us.

483
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's fair.

484
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That's how it works.

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But what would it even be?

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Like Massachusetts is the base state.

487
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's just, it's just a silhouette of Massachusetts and it just says base state underneath it

488
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
in comic sans.

489
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And that's it.

490
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
All right.

491
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
All right.

492
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's a little different than I was envisioning.

493
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That's the, that's the shirt.

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
All right.

495
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What more do you need?

496
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's fair enough, fair enough.

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Good to wear on top of your, I'm just feeling cool or just being cool t-shirt.

498
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You know, also in comic sans.

499
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm just being Massachusetts.

500
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I saw, did you see that meme going around on Twitter that was like, um, draw yourself

501
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in what you're wearing right now?

502
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I saw that multiple times.

503
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It was way too lazy to do it.

504
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I did that.

505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I saw it first time when I was in bed naked and I was like, ha ha.

506
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
No clothing.

507
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Sick.

508
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Sick.

509
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Somebody, um, wait, uh, uh, you know what?

510
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'll, I'll, I'll report a name.

511
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I will, I will name names.

512
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Uh, it was, uh, I saw it was done by Stefan, Stefan Tantana, who did the meme and they

513
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
just, they drew themselves wearing the, I'm the reason people are dying shirt.

514
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And I thought that was fucking epic.

515
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah.

516
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So I had, had to get on the PCP Twitter and retweet that because I thought that was pretty

517
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
sick.

518
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I could hear a tragic story of someone wearing that shirt to school and getting like suspended

519
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
because of supporting violence or something done like that.

520
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Hey, if you, hey, oh, oh, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're Republican parents sending

521
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
you back to school, uh, in the middle of a pandemic.

522
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey, uh, go to the PCP, uh, uh, uh, uh, Teespring store by the, I'm the reason people are dying

523
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
shirt.

524
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Get yourself suspended so you don't have to go anywhere.

525
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We'll get you out of all that bullshit and just keep wearing it every time you get unsuspected.

526
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Just go back in and be like, back.

527
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Then just buy more PCP merch and buy that.

528
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Just buy another shirt and wear both shirts.

529
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It can even be like, like fast food for the occasion.

530
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You can just wear it while coughing, uh, sporadically.

531
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And then like, is it a COVID shirt or is it a PCP reference?

532
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We'll never know.

533
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Dude, new PCP shirt design idea.

534
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Big bold letters, just white, uh, black on white.

535
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I have COVID.

536
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I, nobody will fuck with you anymore.

537
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Does anyone sell those?

538
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Probably.

539
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
They can't.

540
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That can't be me.

541
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Hmm.

542
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What's the thing?

543
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Be patient.

544
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I have autism.

545
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Be patient.

546
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I have COVID.

547
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Be patient.

548
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I have COVID.

549
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh, man.

550
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Uh, well, that, that'll be on the storefront.

551
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Um, by the time you're listening to this, uh, of listeners.

552
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, uh, a link in the description, I think, right?

553
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

554
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
We probably have the link somewhere in the description to our Teespring.

555
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah.

556
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Which we don't plug enough, by the way.

557
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
We got great stuff.

558
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We really don't.

559
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm not good at chilling merch.

560
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
We really don't have great stuff.

561
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
No, me either.

562
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, it's just sort of like it.

563
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But we could be better.

564
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You know, the t-shirts, you wear them and you have them.

565
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But, uh, and, and you wear them and you should buy them.

566
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't know how to do it either.

567
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I actually, maybe I am kind of good at chilling merch because I sold, sold a bunch of those

568
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
yang shirts, sold a, I sold a bunch of the, uh, I sold at least, I think I sold one of

569
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the phantom horn feel the burn shirts.

570
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I sold all those, uh, uh, cancel Ben shirts, you know, a handful of those.

571
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Uh, once, once in a while, once in a while, when I put my mind to it, I can, I can chill

572
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
a shirt.

573
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's the trend.

574
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You got to respond to people on Twitter who are wearing the bullshit masks and then mention

575
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,000
that they can buy the I have COVID t-shirt and they'll probably get kicked out of it.

576
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
For really, you really want to make it where the fake mesh mask and the I have COVID shirt

577
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and just go around really complete to the look, you know, just go, just go everywhere.

578
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's how you show up on your first day of school.

579
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay.

580
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What, what font?

581
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What font is I have COVID?

582
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh no.

583
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Um, impact.

584
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah.

585
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah.

586
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Okay.

587
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
All right.

588
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I like that.

589
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Just the words.

590
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah.

591
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And no PCP like branding at all.

592
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's just, it's just, if you want to make a statement, buy our shirt.

593
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It sure does.

594
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It sure does make a statement of some kind.

595
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay.

596
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Well, I feel like we've, we've really hit, we've really struck something vital and true

597
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
today.

598
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We've made, we've made progress.

599
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We've, we've created something.

600
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:19,000
We've brought something out of creative juices yet coming up with all these great shirt ideas.

601
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I think it's because I've taken a little break.

602
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's, it's, it's always good to do that.

603
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I just don't know like the, the, the, the frequency at which it is like actually beneficial

604
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
because you can't take too long of a break because then it's hard to get the wheels turning

605
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
again later.

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

607
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I am, I have been, I haven't only been doing envelopes, I have been working on a little

608
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
thing, a little, a little slime and punishment related project that I'm going to not, I may

609
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
have talked about it before, but I'm going to like stop talking about it.

610
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Cause I don't want to like, I don't know.

611
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I feel like it might be a little while before it's done.

612
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And I don't want to have a situation where it's like the finale where I talk about it

613
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
for months and months.

614
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And then I feel stupid when it finally comes out.

615
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I'm like, this shouldn't have taken as long.

616
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I just, it's, you know what?

617
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Phantom horn reviews, um, slime and punishment.

618
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Phantom horn reviews, the slime and punishment finale.

619
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Like TBAP episode, uh, 239 or whatever.

620
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes, I'm ready.

621
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Uh, yes, yes.

622
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And, oh, speaking of TBAP, I feel like mentioning on the show that just that thing about how

623
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
the right opinion mentioned TBAP.

624
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, right, right, right.

625
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Some video about like scammers that steal YouTube channels and sell them.

626
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I guess he found, I guess he fucking found a listing for the TBAP channel and someone

627
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
responded to it.

628
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like, hey, I bought this channel, but then it went away.

629
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
What the fuck?

630
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Presumably because YouTube gave it back to us from whom it was stolen.

631
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah.

632
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
LaMalle.

633
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Uh, very, very funny.

634
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And, and, and it pissed me, it pissed me right the fuck off because he shows TBAP on these,

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,000
TBBBAP, but he says TBBAP like everybody fucking does because nobody can read that third B.

636
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
People's eyes just glide right off it.

637
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like, it's like, they can't see it.

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's, it's like, it's like, it's like.

639
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Fake fan, bro.

640
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Fake fan.

641
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I just, I just, I just don't understand why people don't see the third B. There's three

642
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
of them for fuck's sake.

643
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Everyone's just in such a hurry.

644
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It's not, it's not two brothers bitch about ponies.

645
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's two best brothers bitch about pony.

646
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Cagged phantom, like teeth and gums.

647
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Of course.

648
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Uh, wait.

649
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh, Gib, you said you were taking a, you're taking a break during that break.

650
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm delighted to see that I successfully got you into Mr. Boop.

651
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, yes.

652
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yes.

653
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You talked about this on the, the heckles for shackles Minecraft streams that we do

654
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
every so often.

655
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yes.

656
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Which I have started to commit to doing more often because we got this whole fucking

657
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Minecraft server that has all this like awesome shit in it.

658
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It has all this like really cool stuff.

659
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And like, I get in there.

660
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Showcase, like a showcase, like standalone showcase video edited like, look at all this

661
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
cool shit you can do in the Minecraft server.

662
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Maybe you should like do it.

663
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We, we haven't done a edited video, but Marin Pan did make a video explaining how to get

664
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
the server running.

665
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I think he looks at a few things.

666
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
He should like flies around.

667
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
How to get the server running is one thing, but like just, just for instance, the last

668
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
um, yeah,

669
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It was an intro video that like did show some of the stuff they had, but I, maybe I'm wrong.

670
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, okay.

671
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I haven't, I haven't seen that, but um, yeah, this past, this past time I was, um, I spent

672
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the whole stream trying to fight my way through the, the, the lethal Aurora mage Jim and face

673
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
off against mages team, which I, I, well, I won't spoil how it ends.

674
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But, but it was like, it was really involved and it was really irritating sometimes cause

675
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
there was like a lot of shit to do with like the Minecraft mods that I don't understand

676
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
because I'm a stupid boomer.

677
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Um, but if you know how Minecraft works, there was like a lot there that like Marin Pan had

678
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
to be like, no, Ben, no, you gotta, you gotta do the, no, no, go back to that other thing.

679
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You missed it.

680
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
No, look, just follow the instructions.

681
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
There's a sign right there.

682
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Just read the sign and do what it says on the sign.

683
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You fuck.

684
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Um, but I, but I got there.

685
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I got there eventually.

686
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Um, and I built a Minecraft house.

687
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I, building is cringe battle collect, building a Pokemon team is based and I got my contrary

688
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
milestone.

689
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I bought, I got my contrary Malamar and I got my, oh, and I got my new, uh, my new, uh,

690
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
my custom age slash with phantom force.

691
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That thing is sick.

692
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Phantom.

693
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And it's huge phantom force.

694
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So phantom horns.

695
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Uh, it's so big.

696
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's like 10 feet tall and it looks like a fucking bloody mess because it's like custom black

697
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
texture with like veins in it.

698
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's crazy looking.

699
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Uh, it's so good.

700
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's very exciting for me.

701
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I wish, I wish I could convince myself to care about Minecraft trying really hard.

702
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It doesn't work.

703
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But can you care about Pokemon?

704
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Uh, maybe.

705
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay.

706
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What about both of them together?

707
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
This thing, I think I may be like, and this thing I don't like, put them together.

708
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
What do you get?

709
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Put them together and mmm.

710
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's the definition of more than the sum of its parts.

711
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You know, that's right.

712
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Synergy.

713
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We've got, we've got to leverage our synergies to create brand recognition.

714
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
PCP Minecraft, putting the sin in synergy.

715
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And that's, that's what we've done here.

716
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Um, but anyway, anyway, no, I just wanted to be, I just wanted to celebrate.

717
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That you, uh, got into, uh, Mr. Booth.

718
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
What are your impressions of Mr. Booth?

719
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Um, all right.

720
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So Mr. Booth, uh, I got up to date.

721
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So I'm eagerly awaiting the, the, the next update might be a little behind.

722
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It might be like a week behind actually.

723
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Uh, it's like Mr. Booth.net.

724
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And it is, uh, as it, it's like, um, it's a comedy thing.

725
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And it's like unassuming, but, uh, but it's like.

726
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's farcical to the point of almost seeming sincere, which is really fun.

727
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah.

728
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Um, the, the story is about this artist.

729
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Tom, are you familiar with Mr. Booth?

730
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm not.

731
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm hearing about it for the first time right now.

732
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Okay.

733
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So there's, there's this artist who, um, is the creator of the comic he's drawing.

734
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And he, uh, he calls himself Mr. Booth.

735
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And he's married to Betty Boop, the cartoon character.

736
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And he thinks she is so hot and he talks about how hot she is.

737
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And he talks about how much he hopes she doesn't leave him.

738
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And she says, no, I won't leave you.

739
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And then, and then thought bubble, she says, oh my God, he's so hot.

740
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And then he smiles to the camera is like, yeah, she's so hot.

741
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I can't believe she's my wife.

742
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Things like that.

743
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I can't, I can't believe I get to have sex with my wife.

744
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Now I understand why Ben is into this.

745
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This is such a band core thing.

746
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What the fuck does that mean?

747
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You're into all this weird fucking cringe shit.

748
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh, that's no.

749
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's not cringe.

750
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You are.

751
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It is.

752
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It is.

753
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I mean, it's.

754
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay.

755
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Okay.

756
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I understand how, I understand how it sounds.

757
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I can see what you're saying, but it's not like, it's not like Sonichu where it's like,

758
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
oh, this, this weird person.

759
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
No, it's very, very self aware.

760
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
No, it's, it's completely self aware.

761
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's deliberately funny.

762
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And it's, and it's awesome.

763
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Okay.

764
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's like if a family guy joke just never, ever stopped, like it just kept going.

765
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It does.

766
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It does.

767
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
If you had not seen it and you just heard the description, I could see how you would

768
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
think that it was the product of some like deranged person, like the guy who made that

769
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
song about Reshiram.

770
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You know what I'm talking about?

771
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh yeah.

772
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The guy, the guy who sang the song about how he's married to Reshiram.

773
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, it's not, it's not, it's like, it's, it's parodying people like that, but is,

774
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
is totally self aware.

775
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And he, he cranks up the ridiculousness of stuff like that.

776
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And he introduces so much like nuance that you wouldn't expect into, into a whole thing

777
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
like that.

778
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
But it's also still like goofy, silly, stupid at the same time.

779
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's like,

780
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Like it never, it never breaks the con, the central conceit that like, well, I guess it,

781
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
it does go off in a couple of different directions.

782
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It never breaks the conceit that like it's completely reasonable for these characters

783
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to just like mug the camera and say, my wife is so hot.

784
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And then Betty Boop, my husband is so hot, I'll never leave him.

785
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I sure hope my wife, Betty Boop doesn't leave me.

786
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And then, and I also, we can have sex, which is pretty hot.

787
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah.

788
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And that's the, that's the fourth panel.

789
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But it, it's like, you know, there, there, there are developments.

790
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
There's a whole, it's, it's, it's, it's got a whole cast of characters.

791
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You know, it's got, it's got luminaries such as Goku, Mickey Mouse, Sonic the Hedgehog,

792
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Dr. Sonic the Hedgehog.

793
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh yeah.

794
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And there's, there's Bugs Bunny that works at Amazon after a time.

795
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And they won't let him pee.

796
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And then, and then Amazon.

797
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah.

798
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The running gag is that Amazon won't let him pee.

799
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Is this like Tails gets trolled?

800
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Or is this like on that?

801
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It is exactly like Tails gets trolled.

802
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Okay.

803
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So it, it absolutely is a Ben Core product.

804
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I was right on the money from the beginning.

805
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay.

806
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's, it's, it's like that.

807
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But like, it's, I mean, it does not come across as like something that you think is real.

808
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Like you could easily understand that, oh, it's, it's obviously like a funny joke that this guy is making this comic.

809
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's like, okay.

810
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The characters, the characters in the story.

811
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You don't ever feel like there's like a, maybe he is deranged actually.

812
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
There's like, there is what Tails gets trolled.

813
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I mean, it's, it's, it's almost like, like what Tails gets trolled, it's like he wanted to put the characters in there.

814
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like he wanted, you know, Timo from League of Legends to be in the story.

815
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So he put Timo in there, but then he didn't have any idea what Timo would do.

816
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So he just kind of like has Timo, you know, make some funny jokes and then, and then like die off screen for no reason.

817
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And that's Timo.

818
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's like the reverse in, in Mr. Boop.

819
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Mr. Boop.

820
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Mr. Boop is like, he just, he needs, he needs supporting characters to be like his roommates or like, you know, the person who, you know, wants, like, gives him like sex advice or whatever.

821
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And he will, and he, but he will just like, for no particular reason, he will make that supporting character just be Sonic the Hedgehog or, or Bugs Bunny or, or whatever.

822
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Or, or girl version, Ranma or Gina or Gina from Porco Rosso or whatever.

823
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Gina, Nina, whatever.

824
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And, you know, they're, they're just, they're, they're just there.

825
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And it's just exists, exists in this, I think it is probably takes place in the exact same universe as Tails gets trolled, though, if I'm being honest.

826
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Yeah.

827
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I don't, there's no contradiction.

828
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's just a timeline thing.

829
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
There's one takes place, one takes place earlier in the timeline and the other takes place later.

830
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
God, this is too complicated for my baby brain.

831
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But it sounds sick and I'll have to baby check it out if I ever remember after this conversation.

832
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's very sick.

833
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's very sick.

834
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And the guy who makes it, he does like video bits too.

835
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
There are like,

836
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Here's Mr. Boop.net.

837
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You can immediately see the, the, the comedy.

838
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:02,000
A couple of the, a couple of the updates are like him doing like a fake interview show where like a guy asks him about like his creative process.

839
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And he's like, yeah, well, I don't, I don't even remember, but he, but he, you know, he talks about how he is in fact married to Betty Boop in real life and how the comic is just an autobiography.

840
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And in the comic, he talks about how like, oh my, my, one of my favorite lines is the one, if there's an offhand like throwaway line about how like,

841
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
you know that me making these comics about our marriage is part of our thing.

842
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And like it's part of what gets me off about it.

843
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh my God.

844
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's part of it.

845
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's part of it.

846
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The website's incredible, by the way.

847
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I just can't recommend Mr. Boop.

848
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
If you read the first one, it's, I mean, it very quickly gets like, like, like, like intrigue.

849
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Like it's almost immediately that he's, he's talking about like, I'm never going to get a divorce.

850
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Like, oh, what does that imply that he's saying that?

851
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Oh no.

852
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But, but now, but now he's so worried about what if he divorces his wife, Betty Boop?

853
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh no.

854
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Like what's, what's he going to do?

855
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
He's, he's fraught.

856
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
He needs to, how's he, how's he going to tackle this?

857
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
This, this next hurdle on their path to happy marriage.

858
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
What's wrong?

859
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Betty Boop thought bubble.

860
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
She's my wife.

861
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I know that was the moment where I was like, okay, this is really funny.

862
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Incredible.

863
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
She is my wife.

864
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I can't believe I get to have sex with my wife.

865
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
God, I hope my 90 year old wife will let me have sex with her.

866
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh God.

867
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Incredible.

868
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I love it.

869
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I honestly feel like doing like a version of this, but with me and Vriska.

870
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because it's like, it's too, it's too correct.

871
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's too like, exactly the same.

872
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I mean, Vriska is already canon to Mr. Boop.

873
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
She is.

874
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
One, one panel.

875
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I got such the wrong impression of this.

876
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Cause you, the first one you linked in the chat was the, the, the homestuck one.

877
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And I've never read homestuck.

878
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So it did nothing for me.

879
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I can, I can only imagine.

880
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah.

881
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Like not, not having the context for what this comic is like and reading that as like,

882
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
yeah, this is the newest update in, in this comic I'm reading.

883
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

884
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Carcat.

885
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Come on.

886
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Please just suck me off.

887
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Okay.

888
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah.

889
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
No, I, I get you.

890
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I get where you're coming from.

891
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah.

892
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
This is happening.

893
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Gotta leave with the first comic.

894
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That's much more effective.

895
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
This is happening at the same time as Mr. Boop in the same canon.

896
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Thanks.

897
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Jack Noir to himself.

898
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It's all connected.

899
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Okay.

900
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I just had, I just had to take a moment to appreciate it.

901
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Do you want to take a moment to appreciate Canada and how they're probably going to implement

902
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
UBI like soon, apparently.

903
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Uh, you mentioned this before we started recording.

904
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah.

905
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And I, and I am still kind of shocked about it.

906
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I don't, I don't know anything about it other than I saw a tweet and it could be a complete

907
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
lie, but, uh, the guy has emojis and a check mark.

908
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So maybe, maybe he knows what he's talking about.

909
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Can you, can you, can you say what it is?

910
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Can you give the backstory for the listeners?

911
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Uh, I mean, sure.

912
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
No.

913
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
No, I cannot.

914
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
No?

915
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah.

916
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Fuck the listeners.

917
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

918
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
No, I just, I just scrolled through Twitter and I saw this tweet from Scott Santens, a

919
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
writer and unc, of unconditional basic income UBI advocate with a crowdfunding to basic income

920
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
via Patreon.

921
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Uh, so he's got a check mark.

922
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
He's like a real guy and he's like huge UBI news flooding out of Canada today that a

923
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
basic income guarantee for all Canadians has now become the ruling party's number one

924
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
policy resolution to adopt at their national convention in November.

925
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Will Canada be the first to adopt basic income after all?

926
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's now more possible.

927
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I don't know.

928
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I mean, it's strange to say that like it's become the number one platform of the ruling

929
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
party.

930
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I don't really know much about Canadian politics.

931
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm not, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it does make me a little suspicious that

932
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
this is like a UBI guy saying this.

933
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
It's very strange, right?

934
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But, but at the same time, like it would be interesting because like Canada had like a

935
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
way better stimulus program than America did.

936
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So I guess that probably woke a lot of people up over there like, Hey, this is kind of a

937
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
good deal.

938
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I heard that, yeah, I heard that like around the time, around the time that like we were

939
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
like Americans were hearing that like, Oh yeah, we're all going to get the $1,200 stimulus.

940
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I, you know, Canada, I thought slime is Canadian and he said like, Yeah, everyone in Canada

941
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
is getting like $2,000 a month, you know, Canadian dollars, but still, in just like,

942
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
in just like, you know, stimulus money or like relief money or whatever.

943
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And like, I had assumed that that would be temporary, but apparently it's still happening

944
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
and I can't fucking believe it.

945
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I think it's still happening.

946
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That blows my mind so hard.

947
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That's crazy.

948
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Imagine.

949
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
How do they do it?

950
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They probably just, I mean, I can only imagine, I don't know exactly, but they're probably

951
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
just paying for it.

952
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Maybe they're taxing the rich or something.

953
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't know.

954
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Like maybe they're paying for it and then pushing the cost of that onto something else down

955
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the line.

956
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Like, I can't imagine that they could successfully tax the rich just suddenly just because they

957
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
wanted to.

958
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah, it can't be that simple.

959
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
They're probably just like creating more debt as everybody is.

960
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
They might, they, you think they're just going into like some crazy deficit or whatever?

961
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I mean, that's what we're doing.

962
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Um, are we?

963
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah, we're just, we're just, we've like doubled the national debt.

964
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's like more than our GDP now.

965
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Like there's no way to pay it off.

966
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Lamal.

967
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

968
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Um, that's, it's fine.

969
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm sure that's fine.

970
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
My big worry is if we ever get past this inflation is going to hit us like a fucking

971
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
tidal wave and the only good thing about massive inflation will be my student loans will all

972
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
of a sudden be pennies.

973
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And I'll just be like, they're not worth as much as a loaf of bread.

974
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
But so is everything I own.

975
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Exactly.

976
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So it's just like, you know, ups and downs, you know, starving.

977
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But it all comes out in the wash.

978
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Well, speaking of massive inflation.

979
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Oh, God.

980
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Over on the.

981
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Are you going to talk about your discord server?

982
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah.

983
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Is this about Big Titty's Mommy Milkers?

984
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Big Boobies Mommy Milkers.

985
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Get it right there.

986
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Sorry.

987
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Sorry.

988
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It is, it is, it is bustling in there.

989
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It is burgeoning.

990
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It is jiggling in there.

991
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Everyone's, everyone's having a great time squeezing and jiggling.

992
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's great.

993
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That's all I wanted to say.

994
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I saw an opportunity to talk about like inflation.

995
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Looks looks like there's at least like a hundred people in there.

996
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Incredible.

997
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
What a good launch.

998
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Congratulations.

999
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Who would have thought who would have thought that that tits would prove like a big box office

1000
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
success.

1001
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You know, it's really riling up the industry, you know, this new.

1002
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I had my doubts that there was a market for such a thing, but it shows what I know.

1003
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It, it turns out that being horny on main is actually cool and everyone wants to do it.

1004
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And now we've made like a sanctuary for being horny.

1005
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We can just be like, I had boobs are cool guys.

1006
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Is it, I mean, are people actually horny in there?

1007
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Are people actually going in there to like, to like jack it?

1008
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You know, I mean, I see there's, I think, I think there's like tongue in cheek, like

1009
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
horny-ness, but like, there's not a lot of like, there's no role playing.

1010
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I see the NSFW posting in the big boo bodega, you know, for sure.

1011
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
For sure.

1012
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Obviously.

1013
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And that's good.

1014
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I encourage it.

1015
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Sure.

1016
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah, it's not so much of like a, like a sexual deviancy thing.

1017
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's just it, because the bot is based around you having a like breast size based around

1018
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
some number that just keeps going up.

1019
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
If you squeeze in the titty bar that is just, there's a lot of like, you know, it's just

1020
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
like endless war.

1021
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It's a video game and it's very easy.

1022
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And there's a lot of like.

1023
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It's, it's just like endless war.

1024
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah.

1025
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You just sort of like, there's, there's a framework through which conversations can begin.

1026
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And people are just really enjoying that.

1027
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And it's fun.

1028
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, pretty cool.

1029
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
When do we, when will our, when will our, the endless war dev team be receiving their

1030
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
royalties though?

1031
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We're going to, we're going to charge you for that milk.

1032
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
We're going to charge by the gallon.

1033
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'll just, you know, I'll just like allow you to like publicly execute red man or something

1034
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
like kill him off.

1035
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well, I mean, all right.

1036
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Okay.

1037
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm satisfied.

1038
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
This is all a ploy.

1039
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It was all just a ploy to be able to execute red man.

1040
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Gun girl does it all the time.

1041
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It's well, great fun.

1042
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Sure.

1043
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Sure.

1044
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Sure.

1045
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Um, somebody.

1046
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh, I think some, I don't remember who I'm sorry, but somebody requested for their vapors

1047
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
like sketch, right?

1048
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Sketch and signature tier or whatever.

1049
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Uh, I think someone asked me to draw big as in your, your, your character big.

1050
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, wow.

1051
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Uh, doing something or holding something.

1052
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I forget.

1053
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I didn't, I didn't get to it yet.

1054
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So I don't remember.

1055
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
But yeah, so I'm going to be stealing that one from, from you.

1056
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Cool.

1057
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Whoops.

1058
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No, that's all right.

1059
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
That's all right.

1060
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
People can draw big.

1061
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
In fact, I encourage it.

1062
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Um, I, I'm, I'm going like, I'm going like pretty all out.

1063
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I'm drawing like full like color, uh, like drawings in like the, the bottom of the, the

1064
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,000
uh, uh, forward page, uh, with like Copic markers that I use literally once a year

1065
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
for this, this exact purpose and no other.

1066
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I have like hundreds of dollars worth of Copic markers and this is the only thing I do with

1067
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
them, but it's worth it.

1068
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Um, it's great.

1069
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm a genius.

1070
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Someone asked me to draw slow King and I did it and I shaded it and I colored it and he's

1071
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
giving a thumbs up and it was like, yeah, that was the last thing I did before we started

1072
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
recording this episode.

1073
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Hmm.

1074
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Hmm.

1075
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Hmm.

1076
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Hmm.

1077
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
What are we talking about?

1078
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Uh, I don't know.

1079
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I interrupted to talk about something about like, uh, like, like, like, like, like Canada

1080
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and tits, you know, just the usual fare on the PCP.

1081
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Oh yeah.

1082
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I just, I just can't believe.

1083
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I just can't believe that like the tooth that like everyone's just getting like, maybe,

1084
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
maybe they are just going into crazy deficit.

1085
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I don't know, possibly, but like, maybe it's fine and doesn't matter and it's worth it.

1086
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Maybe it's still a good thing.

1087
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I have no idea.

1088
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
What was that?

1089
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
What was that fucking video Tom, you tweeted or mentioned, um, that was on Twitter about

1090
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
like how banking is like, doesn't make any sense.

1091
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh, it's all like, like everything is held up.

1092
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Everything is held up by everything else and there's no like foundation.

1093
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Hey, was it okay?

1094
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Deficit is like, is money or something?

1095
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh yeah.

1096
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1097
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Was it, was this video, was this video like, did it sort of look like, was it like a cartoon

1098
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
thing and like the main like metaphor of it was like 300?

1099
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Maybe.

1100
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I've seen like three videos talking about banks to a long time ago and one relatively recently.

1101
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
One I remember most is if you watch Zeitgeist 2, there's a whole section on banks and debt

1102
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and how fucked up it is.

1103
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I don't know how voraciously that was researched, but it paints a pretty grim picture.

1104
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Like how debt is currency and how everything cycles around and it's like.

1105
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Every dollar that you've ever owned is owed to somebody and that dollar has interest attached

1106
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
to it.

1107
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So if all the principle of the money goes away, there's still outstanding debt.

1108
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So there's more debt than there is money, so it can never be paid down.

1109
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And so foreclosures and home and you know, shit is inevitable.

1110
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It's part of the system.

1111
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And it's really, and then there's fractional reserve banking, which is super fucked.

1112
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Banks make money out of nothing.

1113
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
They're allowed to loan out 10 times the amount of money they actually have because there's

1114
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
never going to be, everyone's never going to collect all their money at the same time.

1115
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So they just create money out of thin air and add to the currency value and stuff because

1116
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
they're allowed to lend out more than they actually have.

1117
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It's super fucked.

1118
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And that's why like when markets crash, people like run to the banks to get all their money

1119
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and everybody withdraws at the same time and they don't have enough money to pay all the

1120
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
actual money that they have because they've loaned all of it out to other people.

1121
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And that's where like bad things happen.

1122
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Yeah, it's super fucked.

1123
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's too intelligent for me.

1124
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm saying it really badly right now.

1125
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So don't yell at me in the comments.

1126
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Oh, you forgot this obvious part you retard, but like it's a nightmare and it's scary and

1127
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I don't like it.

1128
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It was, it was enlightening because I never really thought about it on like the largest

1129
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,000
scale of how money has got out of hand and I don't think it doesn't seem to be a way

1130
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
to fix it so that bad things stop happening.

1131
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Exactly.

1132
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Like crashes will just eventually happen.

1133
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It seems like this seems like a great time to again plug a debt the first 5000 years by

1134
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:37,000
David Graber, an extremely interesting book that it, it taught, you know, it's about like

1135
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
it touches on the fact that like money is basically just debt notes.

1136
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Yes.

1137
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And like and like the myth that like before money, we had like a barter.

1138
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
They use like a barter system, which is like not really true.

1139
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And, and how like other cultures like pre money cultures like conceived of debt in like a

1140
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
different way and like like the introduction of like currency just completely like change

1141
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
the way we saw like human transactions and whatever.

1142
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Sad news though, the guy who wrote that book and a bunch of other really good books and

1143
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
he was like an awesome like, like, what's the word?

1144
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
What was the 1% protesters was like the Wall Street Occupy Wall Street.

1145
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Occupy Wall Street.

1146
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
He was like an Occupy Wall Street guy.

1147
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
He just died like a couple like a week or two ago at the age of only like 59 or something.

1148
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
David Graber, a based fucking dude and you know, probably could have lived and written

1149
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
a whole bunch more books, but no, he just died.

1150
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm not sure of what maybe COVID.

1151
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I don't think I'm not sure if they've said exactly what what happened to him, but he's gone.

1152
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah, it's a bummer.

1153
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
2020 hits keep on coming.

1154
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Hmm.

1155
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I feel a little weird bringing this up, but I feel like I want to do it.

1156
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I feel like I should do it.

1157
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I don't know if you saw a comment on our last episode of someone commenting to say that their

1158
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
their brother, who was a big fan of the PCP died.

1159
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, like a month like this month.

1160
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah, the really, really sad.

1161
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I don't know how to feel about it exactly.

1162
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I asked I asked them like if we would know the name and they said they gave a screen name

1163
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that might have been and I didn't recognize it.

1164
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But apparently this person was like a donor and a patron.

1165
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,000
So I feel like we might have like seen their name and like know maybe known of them at

1166
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
least a little bit.

1167
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yeah.

1168
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I don't know.

1169
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I thought about maybe like going through like Patreon records and like seeing if I could

1170
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
find the name or whatever.

1171
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah, I'd really like to know because it's like you never I mean you always know like

1172
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
statistically speaking blah blah blah amount of people die and like it is a large enough

1173
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
audience.

1174
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
How many subscribers of mine have died?

1175
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I don't know.

1176
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I like it's you know, it's a fact, but you never like ever think about it until it's like

1177
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
an individual is like shown to be, you know.

1178
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, there was.

1179
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's terrible.

1180
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I remember I think I have a memory and I don't know.

1181
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I could be imagining some or all of this, but I feel like I have a memory from like years

1182
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
ago so long ago in fact that I'm not even sure if this was like on a PCP video or it

1183
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
might have even been on a TBAP video.

1184
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But I feel like I remember someone commenting to say that like they something about them

1185
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
like a terminal condition and that like they only you know they weren't going to be alive

1186
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
for like a particularly long time.

1187
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I don't know if this rings a bell.

1188
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I feel like I remember that from a PCP episode, but I don't know how long ago it was.

1189
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It was a little while back, but no.

1190
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That definitely happened.

1191
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Okay, okay, cool.

1192
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Well, I don't know.

1193
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I wonder if this was the same part.

1194
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Well, it's cool that I'm not delusional.

1195
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I don't know.

1196
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I wonder if this was that person or unrelated.

1197
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I don't know.

1198
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
What a nightmare though.

1199
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
What a fucking...

1200
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Shout out to this anonymous fan, I guess.

1201
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Apparently talked about us enough that there was it their sister?

1202
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

1203
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Yeah, that their sister knew about us enough to search us up.

1204
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah.

1205
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And leave that comment.

1206
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I feel bad.

1207
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Obviously they liked the show and they liked us.

1208
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I hope that she is not listening to this and like feeling mortified that we're discussing it.

1209
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I apologize, but I don't know.

1210
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
God.

1211
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I felt like it was worth mentioning as a point of interest, if nothing else.

1212
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah.

1213
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I have thought about this.

1214
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I've thought about like someone in like, I don't know.

1215
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
There's like, you know, there's like 500 people in my Discord.

1216
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
There's like over a thousand people in the Endless War Discord.

1217
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
These are people that like, you know, that I see like talking and these are part of like a community.

1218
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And I've thought like, what if something like, there's enough people that it's not that impossible that like someone in there could just like get some, some kind of thing could happen.

1219
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Like they could, someone could have an accident.

1220
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Someone could develop some medical condition and like die.

1221
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And it would be like, I don't know.

1222
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I would go from like, oh, maybe this person used to post here and then like, oh, remember that person?

1223
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Oh yeah.

1224
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
They're dead.

1225
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Right.

1226
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And like, oh geez.

1227
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And I'm like, I don't know.

1228
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I get in the, I was thinking about this a while ago being like, I'm glad that that hadn't happened yet.

1229
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And I guess now it has.

1230
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But I guess it's inevitable.

1231
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I guess it's inevitable that it is, you know, this kind of thing eventually happens.

1232
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And I mean, I know people who've, do you guys know people who've died in real life?

1233
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Like people you like knew at like school or anything?

1234
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh, I've known, I've known a couple people.

1235
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah.

1236
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Not at school.

1237
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
And I mean, I mean, I've known people who have died and I've gone to their funeral.

1238
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah.

1239
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Actually, my brother, one of his friends died in a murder.

1240
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, which was like weird.

1241
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
He just heard about it one day, like after school had finished and they'd got, you know, gone to like college and stuff.

1242
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
He heard about his school friend.

1243
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I was like, oh shit.

1244
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That was a weird, like a very unusual circumstance.

1245
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
It wasn't, it wasn't like while they were in school together.

1246
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
No, no, no.

1247
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
His classmate was murdered.

1248
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Okay.

1249
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Still though.

1250
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I had, um, this is visit grim, but whatever.

1251
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I had a, I had a friend who in college who I heard years later had like just gotten married.

1252
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I think, I think they had just gotten married.

1253
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:34,000
They were like on there and he was on his like honeymoon to like the Bahamas or something with his like new wife.

1254
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And he drowned.

1255
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Jesus Christ.

1256
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Yeah.

1257
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Um, that was cool.

1258
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That wasn't cool, Ben.

1259
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
You can't say that on live TV.

1260
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
When I say that it's cool, I mean the opposite.

1261
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Obviously I'm being.

1262
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
You're being all flustered right now.

1263
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I'm being completely sincere.

1264
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Uh, I don't know.

1265
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I don't know.

1266
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It's, you know, what do you, what do you even say about something like that?

1267
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It's, it's too, it's too fucked up.

1268
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It's, I mean, death is a comes to us all and like all that stuff.

1269
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
No, we got it.

1270
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
We got to, we got to get myself.

1271
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I have thought myself about like various moments where it's like, what if I died and I, all of my friends online didn't know.

1272
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Dude, I think about that all the fucking time.

1273
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Like what, I haven't driven a will.

1274
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Like where, who would get my video games?

1275
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Like, like what, what, what would happen to all of my stuff?

1276
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
All the stuff, all the files on my computer.

1277
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Like would, would people look through them to find out what's going on?

1278
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
They're going to find my internet history.

1279
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
God, so screwed.

1280
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I mean, it's not like I'm worried cause I'd be dead.

1281
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But it's like, it's just like, what should I put like systems in place to do anything about that?

1282
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Or should I just let whatever happens happen?

1283
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
There's like people that I know that I talk to online, right?

1284
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But I'm not like super close with.

1285
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
They're like, oh, if I just like died, they'd never know.

1286
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
They just thought I turned into a dick.

1287
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
That's so fucked up to think about.

1288
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Hmm.

1289
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I don't know.

1290
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
That's not usually, when I think, when I think about dying, that's usually not the part that I'm preoccupied with.

1291
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I mean, that's, that's like after I have like a, you know, 45 minute existential crisis on the futility of life and like how nothing matters.

1292
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And I just kind of curl up in a ball and like really just like start thinking too harshly on like the inevitability of mortality.

1293
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
And then I guess we like think about like Deus Ex.

1294
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I'm like, please, please can we get robot body soon?

1295
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Please God, nanomachines now.

1296
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I want to be Senator Armstrong.

1297
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Please God.

1298
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And then I like have a tiny little glimmer of hope that maybe Elon can save us.

1299
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Maybe capitalism can serve a greater good.

1300
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Elon is, is, he's making a fucking moon base that him and his, that him and his pedophile friends or whatever.

1301
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I'm sorry, that's, it's not hashtag not all billionaires or whatever.

1302
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You know, they, they can escape and leave the rest of us to fucking die.

1303
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
That's the whole thing.

1304
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That's like the problem is they're like, oh, like if we ever get, I was having a conversation about this with somebody recently.

1305
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I don't remember who it was.

1306
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And I'm like, yeah, if we get transhumanism, it's going to like, you know, it's just going to make classism even worse.

1307
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Because then you're just going to have the, the immortal, like neo feudalists who just own the mortal populace and dangle the elixir of immortality over their heads to keep them in line.

1308
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And like only the top 1% will not know death.

1309
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And then the ruling class will never go away.

1310
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Hillary Clinton will never die.

1311
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Oh my God.

1312
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Hey, hey, Elon, why don't you elongate my lifespan, you dick?

1313
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Hey, why don't you elongate my dick as well while you're at it, please?

1314
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It will be just like Homestuck, where the trolls that are the ruling class live for thousands of years and the trolls on the lower humo spectrum, the slaves, they live much shorter lifespans and they die real quick.

1315
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Viewers, I just want you to-

1316
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It's already a little like that, but it could be a lot worse and it will be too.

1317
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It's already kind of a little like that through like, um, dynasties and, you know.

1318
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah, and also like, you know, health insurance, Lamal.

1319
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Oh wait, you're a Britbonger, you don't know.

1320
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You don't know about private health insurance.

1321
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
What's a hospital?

1322
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I don't know.

1323
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Nothing, don't worry about it.

1324
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I don't need them over there.

1325
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Viewers, I just want you to know every time someone mentions Homestuck on here, just imagine, uh, uh, Jay from Red Letter Media, like his reaction every time Mike mentions Star Trek, that's me.

1326
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
God, not again.

1327
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
It comes up all the time.

1328
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I have no idea what they're talking about.

1329
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I can see it now.

1330
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I can see him cursing his little chipmunk lips and looking right directly into the camera like, hmm.

1331
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
That's me every time for the last five years or however long we've been doing this podcast.

1332
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Mike believes in ghosts.

1333
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I had a fucking terrifying realization a few days ago when I realized I've watched every episode of Best of the Worst.

1334
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm like, oh, God, no.

1335
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
That's good though, those are fun.

1336
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
They're super fun, but like, it was like.

1337
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I have probably watched them multiple times.

1338
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I had a kick, I had a kick lately where I just put them on.

1339
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yeah, me too.

1340
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Like, lately it's been, lately it's been GDQ.

1341
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Before that it was like Red Letter Media and I just watched like everyone on autoplay.

1342
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And I just put them all on, but I've been watching them out of order.

1343
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Uh, and so when I realized there were none left.

1344
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I mean, why watch them in order?

1345
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I mean, yeah, I just kind of was, because they eventually had a playlist, but I'm like, at first I was like, oh, God, there's no more.

1346
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And then I was like, oh, God, how many hours of that have I watched?

1347
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
It was like the same feeling finishing Campaign 1 of Critical Role.

1348
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Like that was like 124 hour videos and I binged all of them.

1349
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Dude, I've got a big number for you.

1350
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:00,000
On Water Warcraft, you can do slash played to see how long you have played on that particular character.

1351
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
And on my main guy, because I was just doing stuff, I was like, I wonder how long it's been.

1352
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Um, so this is like total time logged in playing the game or, you know, just logged in 119 days.

1353
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And that is over a course of like 10 years.

1354
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I started playing in like 2009.

1355
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So more than 10 years.

1356
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So that's, that's still a long time though.

1357
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:31,000
119 days in on that character, not even just all the characters, just that one.

1358
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That's a big number.

1359
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's like, that's like the time that's like all the time you would be awake for like half a year.

1360
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Right?

1361
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

1362
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Because like half a year is like about, it's like 180 something days.

1363
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And then like, you know, you're awake for about two thirds of a day.

1364
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
So like two thirds of that would be about like 110, 120 hours.

1365
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So yeah, that's like the way you're waking life for like half a year or something.

1366
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You know, pretty good.

1367
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It's funny though, because it's like, it's a big number.

1368
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And I know I've played this game a lot and I've, you know, done a lot of grinding, a lot of achievements.

1369
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I've got over 9000 achievement points.

1370
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I remember what I, when I got the achievement for getting over 9000 achievement points.

1371
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Amazing.

1372
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And I'm like, damn, I've put a lot of stuff into this.

1373
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But you know what?

1374
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
My mind, I like, I like this.

1375
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I like this game.

1376
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
It's good.

1377
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:37,000
The only thing I may, maybe regret is the amount of money that the, you know, the months of game time I've spent.

1378
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But it's probably not that much.

1379
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It's like, I mean, what is it like $10 a month?

1380
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So yeah, something like that.

1381
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I mean, I used to, when I first started, I did like the discount for like multiple months.

1382
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Like I got like 12 months for less, like eight pounds a month or something.

1383
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It might, I don't know.

1384
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:04,000
In the past, it might have bothered me to be like, oh man, that's like, what, that's like $120 a year or whatever.

1385
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And like, oh no, but like, I don't know.

1386
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I spend like, I feel like,

1387
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I spend more than, I spend like probably like two or $300 on like just food and necessities a month anyway.

1388
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So like, what?

1389
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah.

1390
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah.

1391
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Like when you're, when you're a youngster, when you're a little boy, you get like pocket money, maybe.

1392
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And you think about like how much things cost you, like the first time, I will never forget this.

1393
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
But the first time I heard that a suit cost around a hundred pounds, at least.

1394
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I was like, you can't be, you've got to be fucking shitting me.

1395
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That's clothes.

1396
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Yeah.

1397
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
That's clothes.

1398
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
That's just clothes.

1399
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And it's just clothes.

1400
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
A hundred dollars is like, part is like half of like a, it's like a, like half of like a PlayStation 2.

1401
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Yeah.

1402
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
That's exactly the thing.

1403
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I was like, I knew the consoles because I like those.

1404
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah.

1405
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So like, but then you, you realize that there's a lot of money that goes around, goes, passes through your hands over time.

1406
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It's like really a monthly subscription to a video game.

1407
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Isn't that bad when you consider that some people have been, you know, subscribed to Netflix since it began.

1408
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I mean, like I've never done things like that.

1409
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I minimize the amount of like monthly subscription services and I groan whenever I think of one because I just don't like them.

1410
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I don't like the idea that, I don't know, you've got to make the most of, because that's what I would feel like is like, if I have a Netflix,

1411
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I've got to be watching stuff constantly.

1412
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Otherwise I'm not making as much, I'm not getting as much out of it for the amount of money I'm putting in.

1413
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So I like, I steer clear of stuff like that.

1414
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I don't buy triple A modern games.

1415
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I don't buy a lot of stuff in general.

1416
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's like, when I think of like the amount of money I spend on World of Warcraft is like, I don't spend a lot of money anyway.

1417
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So it's really, it's not a problem.

1418
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I mean, if you're getting something out of it, then it's not wasted money.

1419
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah, I guess.

1420
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Every, every time, this is, this is sort of related.

1421
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm just, I get so much satisfaction whenever I can find some way to like cut my costs.

1422
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Like when I, when I realized how much cheaper buying almond milk from Aldi or Costco is than buying it at Whole Foods,

1423
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I was like, this is a game changer.

1424
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
This is literally going to save me.

1425
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Aldi in general was a game changer for me.

1426
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Did I introduce you to Aldi?

1427
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I don't think so because there was, I knew it for a while.

1428
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I have introduced some people to Aldi.

1429
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But like we, we definitely had a moment on a podcast or in like a call.

1430
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
We were just like Aldi and we both Jonesed about it because it was great.

1431
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Well, I got an Aldi down the road.

1432
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Costco is actually better than Aldi, but it's kind of hard.

1433
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Well, yes, but the thing about Costco is you need a membership, but you can get around it if you use a service like Instacart,

1434
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
because then you can just have a shopper that has a membership go and shop there for you.

1435
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
So if you're, if you're, if you're shopping with something like that, then it's better than Aldi,

1436
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:59,000
because it's basically just like things in bulk for like lower net costs per item.

1437
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:08,000
But you know, you can't get just like, there are some things they don't have there and like you can't, you can't just get like a jar of peanut butter.

1438
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:15,000
You have to get like a pack of four, like large, you know, big tubs of it or whatever, like wrapped in foil or something.

1439
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But yeah, if you're, if for like stuff you don't need to buy in bulk, yeah, Costco is the, is the, is the best.

1440
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And yes, yes, yes, Kirk Kirkland brand, everything, everything Costco sells on their own is Kirkland brand and it's the cheapest stuff you can get.

1441
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Fuck yeah.

1442
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But, but yeah, when I realized that like switching from whole Whole Foods almond milk to Kirkland almond milk literally probably saves me like $60 a month.

1443
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah.

1444
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Or well, 30 to 50, I don't know.

1445
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The amount of money I saved on Red Bull, switching to Red Thunder from Aldi is.

1446
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Oh yeah.

1447
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Asked you a fucking nomicle.

1448
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Oh, well, yeah, that's, I mean, you know, I drink, I drink Bang, which is not, I drink Bang or like Rockstar, which is like, it's not as cheap as Red Thunder, but it's cheaper than Red Bull.

1449
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
That's the, that's the, that's the main thing.

1450
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I mean, I don't particularly like the taste of Red Bull, but in particular, I object to how much it cost, how it costs more for a smaller can.

1451
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
That's always been the ultimate insult of Red Bull.

1452
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But then like you can get, you can get four 12 ounce cans of Red Thunder, which is just as good as Red Bull for $329.

1453
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It's, it's less than a dollar can.

1454
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
You just, you just win.

1455
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
You just win.

1456
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I remember Red Thunder.

1457
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I've seen, I've seen that.

1458
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I think I bought it once and was like, lol.

1459
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
No, I'm, I'm committed.

1460
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I'm committed to the bit.

1461
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It's good.

1462
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It's worth it.

1463
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's so fucking cheap.

1464
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It's amazing.

1465
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Mmm.

1466
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Sometimes I'll be tempted to like just when I'm at a convenience store, like, oh, maybe I'll get a Red Bull.

1467
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm like, no, I can get four for the price of this can of Red Bull.

1468
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Get fucked.

1469
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah.

1470
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I, okay.

1471
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I have a, I have a problem.

1472
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Well, first let me tell you that I have good news and I have bad news.

1473
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The good news is that like I made some gummy worms earlier this week and they were like the best batch I've ever made.

1474
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
The consistency was like perfect.

1475
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I was like, this is, this is what all true warriors strive for.

1476
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Like this is the product.

1477
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
This is the product I have been striving for and I have achieved it.

1478
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I have, I have perfected the recipe.

1479
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I am like 100% happy with this.

1480
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And at like at the exact same time, um, they don't sell the stuff that I make them out of anymore.

1481
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It's just no longer available.

1482
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Did you say this last time?

1483
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Did I, did I say this last time?

1484
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I feel like you've told this story.

1485
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Did I say it on the, did I say it on the stream?

1486
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I actually, I don't know.

1487
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Yeah.

1488
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Maybe, you know, I might, I very, I very well might have said it on a previous episode is that they,

1489
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
the isomalto, isomalto ligus saccharides, the tapioca starch,

1490
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I've been looking, I like, I can still buy the syrup, but it's in like small amounts and it's not a good value compared to the powder.

1491
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
First I bought the syrup from a company called Fiber Yum.

1492
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And I, and then they were like, oh, the syrup's no longer available, but you can buy the powder.

1493
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And I'm like, well now I have to reformulate the recipe.

1494
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And now I have to like figure out how much powder to water to use and how much do we cook it down.

1495
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And oh, I have to, I have to buy a candy thermometer so that I can like cook it down the same amount every time,

1496
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
because I need to have a consistent, you know, thickness or whatever.

1497
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Fine.

1498
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And I did all that.

1499
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And I was like, okay, I jumped over that hurdle.

1500
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And now I've, it's better than ever.

1501
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I've perfected it.

1502
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
And now they're like, oh no, now we don't sell the powder anymore.

1503
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Nope.

1504
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Now you can only get the more expensive syrup.

1505
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Fuck you.

1506
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And I don't want to.

1507
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I don't want to do it.

1508
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I just, I just want, I just want a little stability.

1509
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
You know, I just want, I just want things to be normal.

1510
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I just want a normal, I just want a normal life of buying isolated tapioca starch

1511
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
and boiling it in a pot to make gummy worms.

1512
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
That's all, that's all I want to do.

1513
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Now I have to use this fucking other shit.

1514
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Fuck this shit derived fruit, uh, fructoligosaccharides derived from Jerusalem artichokes.

1515
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Like, are you fucking kidding me?

1516
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I didn't even know what that means.

1517
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Artichokes from Jerusalem, I assume.

1518
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Hold on.

1519
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I want, no, they're probably like, it's like an artichoke,

1520
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
but it's like actually just a potato.

1521
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Jerusalem artichoke.

1522
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yes, it's, it's, I'm right.

1523
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
It looks like, it looks like a cross between, it doesn't even look like an artichoke.

1524
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It looks like a cross between a potato and like ginger root.

1525
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Look, look at this shit.

1526
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Get, get ready.

1527
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
This is, this is what a Jerusalem artichoke looks like.

1528
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It looks like pigs in blankets.

1529
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It looks like, it looks like ginger.

1530
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It looks like, it looks like nothing.

1531
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It looks, I don't, not like an artichoke.

1532
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I don't like it.

1533
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Like roasted ham croissants.

1534
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Making me hungry.

1535
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Oh my God.

1536
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I cooked an incredible meal yesterday.

1537
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I took half a pack of bacon, chopped it up, fried it, threw in chopped Brussels sprouts,

1538
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and just seared it in a pan, just baked it in the, in the, in the bacon fat.

1539
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And that was it.

1540
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It was incredible.

1541
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Sounds pretty weird.

1542
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It was, it was life changing.

1543
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I love Brussels sprouts.

1544
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
How do you guys feel about Brussels sprouts?

1545
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You know, I used to be pretty down on them.

1546
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I've come around recently.

1547
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
They're pretty good.

1548
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
That's good.

1549
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I had like never had them before I lived in the south.

1550
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And then I tried some and they were, no, that's not true.

1551
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I had some at a restaurant one time.

1552
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I had some at a restaurant one time in Medford and I was like, these are really good,

1553
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
but I never see them on a menu and I don't know how these were prepared.

1554
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
So I never ate them again.

1555
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah.

1556
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I moved to Georgia and they eat them sometimes down there.

1557
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And I was like, these are good.

1558
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I should make these.

1559
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And now I do.

1560
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Brussels sprouts in the UK are like part of the traditional Christmas dinner with the

1561
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
turkey and the other things.

1562
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Really?

1563
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
It's one of the vegetables you have with it is Brussels sprouts.

1564
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I don't know why.

1565
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Tell me more, tell me more about the traditional British Christmas dinner.

1566
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Well, you got a turkey.

1567
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Some people do chicken, but turkey is the normal.

1568
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The traditional one.

1569
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You got the...

1570
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Because you guys don't do Thanksgiving.

1571
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So you don't get sick of turkey before Christmas.

1572
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
You're not having leftovers for like two weeks.

1573
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So you have the turkey.

1574
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:03,000
You have usually potatoes, carrots, peas, you know, just bunches of vegetables and

1575
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
particularly Brussels sprouts because for some reason Brussels sprouts are just not

1576
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
that common in everyday meals.

1577
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So they're like, oh, yes, the Brussels sprouts I associate with Christmas.

1578
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And I never liked them because they were cooked badly a few times and like boiled

1579
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
in a way that was just sort of rubbery.

1580
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And I'm like, I can't get through this.

1581
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You know, you know, much, much love to my parents, but honestly, they were both pretty

1582
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
bad at cooking.

1583
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And I learned to hate vegetables because they, my parents were just shit at cooking

1584
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
them and they would just boil them.

1585
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
They would just, they would just boil, they would just like boil spinach.

1586
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And like my experience of spinach was just that it was like a sort of nasty green

1587
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
like mush and like it's so bad.

1588
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I mean, you can boil things well.

1589
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I think some, some things.

1590
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I feel like I have enjoyed like roasted Brussels sprouts.

1591
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
But even when they're like well done, like properly done, cooked Brussels sprouts,

1592
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I just, I don't know, they're just too thick to get to the middle.

1593
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
The middle is like not as good.

1594
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
You got to cut them in half.

1595
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
You got to cut them, slice them.

1596
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
You got to cut them in half and cook them and cook them.

1597
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Yeah.

1598
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I mean, you can't just roast them whole because then yeah, you will never.

1599
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Well, not roast them whole, but like if they're, if they're like boiled, like the

1600
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
way that they should be like, oh, like dad cooks them all correct.

1601
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And like, yeah, there's a real good Brussels sprouts.

1602
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Delicious.

1603
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Everyone says I'm like, I don't get it.

1604
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I don't like the taste.

1605
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I don't, I feel like, I don't think I can't imagine a Brussels sprout tasting good boiled

1606
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
unless it were boiled in like stock or something.

1607
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I just, I can't imagine anything being good just like boiled in water.

1608
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Spinach is all right.

1609
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
No.

1610
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I like it.

1611
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It's not, it's not.

1612
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Well, it's sort of like it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a sloppy mush, not like not

1613
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
too mushy, but like so that you can cut it pretty easily.

1614
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And then you have something nice and crispy and salty to go with it, like a potato.

1615
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Then it's good.

1616
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
No.

1617
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You're simply, you're simply mistaken.

1618
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I'm sorry.

1619
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I like spinach.

1620
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I like eating it.

1621
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Any vegetable is good.

1622
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
You just have to like butter it.

1623
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
You just have to eat it raw.

1624
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
You just have to butter it?

1625
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
No.

1626
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
You just butter it or oil it and you add salt and pepper and you roast any of it.

1627
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I mean, that, that I agree with.

1628
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
And then literally any vegetable tastes good.

1629
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:43,000
That, that I agree with cause like, like one of my favorite things is like, it's like a

1630
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:53,000
roast of, you know, peppers, onions, fucking aubergine, courgette, like all these.

1631
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Do you know, do you know what we call aubergines?

1632
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Eggplants, I know.

1633
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Lol.

1634
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It's so weird when I, I don't know, that's, that one always catches me off guard.

1635
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And, and you know, various other things.

1636
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And then like sausages and you, and you cover it with like loads of olive oil and salt and

1637
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
pepper and you put it and you roast it in the oven.

1638
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And it's just sort of, it's delicious.

1639
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Actually it might be keto, maybe.

1640
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I don't know about vegetable keto ability.

1641
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Most, most vegetables are pretty keto, more or less.

1642
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It's just really like all of the great, you know, the oil and the fat of the sausages

1643
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
and then all the tasted, tasty vegetables.

1644
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But never Brussels sprouts.

1645
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I never put Brussels sprouts in that.

1646
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Christmas dinner here.

1647
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I mean, we don't, like we do turkey at Thanksgiving.

1648
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And so usually, sometimes you'll have turkey at Christmas, but usually not cause it's more

1649
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
of a Thanksgiving thing.

1650
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I think it's the most traditional thing would be a ham, like a Christmas ham is pretty,

1651
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
is pretty standard.

1652
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I don't know.

1653
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Christmas dinner is like, there's no like, there's no like set thing of what it is.

1654
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,000
It's just, you have a, you have a big dinner and it involves, it just, it's, you make a

1655
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
lot of stuff and you invite your family and then everyone brings some shit and you have

1656
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
a big feast.

1657
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
But there's not, there's not, Christmas ham.

1658
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And I guess some fruit, I don't know.

1659
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
People associate fruit cakes with Christmas, but I've literally never eaten one or seen

1660
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
one served at like a Christmas thing.

1661
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So I think that's like an old thing that has gone by the wayside.

1662
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Yeah.

1663
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
It's before they had good shit.

1664
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
They liked fruit cake.

1665
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I don't know.

1666
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I've always been kind of curious to try fruit cake cause everyone says how bad it is.

1667
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I mean, it's not that bad.

1668
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's just sort of like, when you're a kid and you're like, oh, cake, oh, I love cake.

1669
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Hmm.

1670
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Chocolate cake.

1671
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Then you get given fruit cake and you're like, gross fruit.

1672
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
That's not chocolate.

1673
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Oh, that's like cookies with raisins in it.

1674
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Like, yeah.

1675
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Yucky.

1676
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I see.

1677
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And then you just sort of like associate it being bad even though it's fine.

1678
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Right.

1679
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
If you go into fruit cake wanting fruit cake, you'll enjoy yourself.

1680
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I don't know.

1681
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I think I remember, I remember seeing in like a cartoon and it's like, oh, it's like brown

1682
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
and it has like little colored like bits in it.

1683
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
And like, what, what is it?

1684
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Like what, I guess it's fruit.

1685
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I don't know.

1686
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I saw it as a kid and I heard people say it was bad.

1687
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And I've always wondered, what's fruit cake like?

1688
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And I've just, I don't know.

1689
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I've never had the opportunity to try some.

1690
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Could you make a keto cake?

1691
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Is that possible?

1692
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I have done it.

1693
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Yeah.

1694
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You just have to use like a weird recipe.

1695
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
It's like almond flour.

1696
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Yeah.

1697
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Yeah.

1698
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Yeah.

1699
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
You use recipes that involve like almond flour and coconut flour and like heavy cream and

1700
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
stuff.

1701
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I have made, I have made keto brownies and I have made like a keto like vanilla cake.

1702
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's, they're pretty good.

1703
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Yeah.

1704
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
They can be, they can be pretty good sometimes.

1705
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I've got the, I've got the, I've been making, I've been making buffalo, I've been making

1706
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
my own buffalo wings lately.

1707
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I don't know.

1708
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I feel like I might have mentioned that before, but I've.

1709
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Yeah.

1710
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
I've mentioned that.

1711
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Yes.

1712
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yes.

1713
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Yes.

1714
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Yes.

1715
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Yes.

1716
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Okay.

1717
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I'm a son.

1718
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
What about gummy flay, like gummy, buffalo flavored gummy.

1719
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Buffalo, buffalo.

1720
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Frank's red hot flavored buffalo wings.

1721
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,560
Did I, did I tell, I hate to think that I'm repeating myself, but the latest batch of

1722
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:32,640
gummies that I made, I like burnt the syrup and it sort of tasted like, I didn't think

1723
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,360
this would happen with the isomaltooligosaccharides because like they're not sugar.

1724
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,560
They shouldn't behave like sugar does and yet they do.

1725
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,640
And I like heated them up too much and they got this kind of like slightly burnt sort

1726
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,600
of caramel taste to them.

1727
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,720
And so I made, I had, I happened to have some like cream soda flavoring.

1728
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:55,280
So I made cream soda flavored gummies with this like caramelized, the last of my, of

1729
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,560
my syrup and it was great.

1730
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:02,240
The consistency is, is perfect better than I ever could have dreamed.

1731
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:09,880
I, I'm also the second to last batch on like when, when I burned it and I, I made, I was

1732
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,600
making passion fruit, my favorite flavor, but it ended up having this weird kind of caramel

1733
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,840
flavor, which like doesn't quite go, but like it's fine.

1734
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,840
It's still good.

1735
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:22,320
And I made it and I put it in the molds and I was like, Oh no, it's not setting.

1736
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,240
It's not coming out as a worm.

1737
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,700
It's just, I have to scoop it out and eat it as goo like, okay, but it still tastes good.

1738
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:32,220
So I'll do it and I'll try putting it in the free and I'll put some of it in the freezer

1739
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,580
and see if it like hardens.

1740
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,580
Oh, it doesn't harden.

1741
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:35,580
It just stays as goo.

1742
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,160
Oh, how disappointing.

1743
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,820
But then I went back and I looked today and the ones, the ones that I had left in the

1744
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,500
fridge, they were just sitting there.

1745
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,960
They were just sitting there in the fridge.

1746
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,240
They weren't like freezing.

1747
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,240
I don't know.

1748
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,820
They shouldn't have solidified any more than they did.

1749
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:52,720
They should have been as set as they were going to be, but somehow over the like the

1750
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:57,500
day or two that they were in there, they set up and they like dried out or something.

1751
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,900
And they, and they were worms now.

1752
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,460
They're worms now and they're passion fruit and, and, and it's a miracle.

1753
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,900
It's a Christmas miracle.

1754
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,620
It all returns to the worms.

1755
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:14,620
I feel, I have had, I have had batches before that have not set up and have like just been

1756
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:18,420
goo and I've been like, oh damn, wasted over a recipe.

1757
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,900
And now this has changed everything.

1758
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:23,020
Now I'm like, maybe I just like judged too soon.

1759
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:28,260
Maybe all I needed to do was just leave those in the fridge for like two days and just wait

1760
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,820
and they would have become good because these ones have not only become, they went from

1761
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:35,860
being inedible to being not only good, but like the best.

1762
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:41,180
They have like the best and like softest and like most chewy and appealing gummy consistency

1763
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:44,060
of any batch I've made up until now.

1764
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,060
It's incredible.

1765
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,060
That's weird.

1766
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:49,460
The other, well, it might not be the only, that might not be the only factor because

1767
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:53,100
there's one other thing that I've changed, which is I switched from powdered gelatin

1768
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,900
to sheet gelatin.

1769
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:58,740
And sheet gelatin, it turns out is a million times better.

1770
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:05,900
Sheet gelatin is more expensive, but it is like a lot, it's a lot easier to deal with.

1771
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,460
You don't have to like, you don't have to like fuck around with it as much.

1772
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:15,380
And it doesn't stink up your house and make your, your kitchen smell like a glue factory,

1773
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,380
which is pretty nice.

1774
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:21,020
It doesn't smell like anything, which is exactly what I want my gelatin to smell like.

1775
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,060
It's another miracle.

1776
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,860
Of course it costs like $20 for like a package of it.

1777
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:28,900
I was about to say it's probably more expensive.

1778
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:29,900
It's kind of expensive.

1779
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:30,900
Yeah.

1780
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,900
Unfortunately.

1781
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:32,900
Unfortunate.

1782
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,900
Yeah.

1783
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:34,900
You have to buy it with EBT.

1784
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:39,700
It's not, no, I buy it on Amazon, but it's not, it's like too, it's like too specialized

1785
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:40,700
or something.

1786
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:42,660
Oh, fuck you, Jeff.

1787
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:47,980
It's pretty random, like what you can use the EBT on, like you should be able to use

1788
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:53,260
it on anything that's food and like that's not like pre-prepared food, which should be

1789
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,260
most things.

1790
01:29:54,260 --> 01:30:00,460
Like that, like that should include sheet gelatin, but I think just like some distributors

1791
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:02,180
just aren't set up to accept it.

1792
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:06,100
And so it's kind of just random who takes it and who doesn't.

1793
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,100
Oh well.

1794
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:08,100
Hmm.

1795
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,100
Fuck.

1796
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,100
Fuck.

1797
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:15,540
Dude, I'm like so close to finishing the 3D print right now.

1798
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:16,540
Just printing in the background.

1799
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:19,220
It'll probably be done before we're done with this podcast.

1800
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:22,500
I'm reprinting the one that I tweeted earlier.

1801
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,420
I took that 3D model, made a 3D print of it.

1802
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:30,340
It's super fucking cool, but it had like some issues, like the tail got a little fucked

1803
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:31,340
up.

1804
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:36,420
It was like a little zoomie print with a, with a drink and a little can of soda by a vending

1805
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,420
machine.

1806
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:40,220
Oh, this one with the, is that a zoomie with their hood up?

1807
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,220
Yeah.

1808
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,220
Hmm.

1809
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,220
So I did that.

1810
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:48,340
I draw Kaia did a fan art of a zoomie, like hanging out in like a hoodie, uh, drinking

1811
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:52,500
a soda, uh, like in January and it was fucking sick.

1812
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,220
I said to myself, back in January, I'm going to make a model based on the south because

1813
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,220
it's fucking lit.

1814
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:59,260
And I finally did it like this week.

1815
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:03,700
And then I projection painted their drawing onto 3D geometry to make the background 3D.

1816
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:07,860
I was going to say like who, like where did these textures come from?

1817
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:14,460
So this is, this is draw Kaia's like art as a texture on this environment.

1818
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,660
This looks great.

1819
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:18,060
This 3D thing here that I'm seeing.

1820
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:19,060
It was really cool.

1821
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:22,580
I was, I saw, I found a video on YouTube about projection painting and stuff and I had done

1822
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:26,500
it a little bit before because I had taken a bunch of photos of like a can of beer for

1823
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:31,380
Digi, like when he's doing, uh, how they marketed and projection painted it onto a cylinder.

1824
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:34,940
So it was like a can of soda that you could like spin or a can of beer you could spin

1825
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:37,460
around and like 3D and stuff.

1826
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:41,620
So I just kind of did a similar thing where you just kind of line up the reference drawing

1827
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:46,460
to the camera and then make geometry in the relative shape and then you project for view

1828
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,880
the graphic onto the geometry.

1829
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,460
And like, if you like turn it a little bit more than the camera is in the video, like

1830
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:56,100
it starts getting fucked up because it's just flat projected.

1831
01:31:56,100 --> 01:32:01,540
But for a little effect like this, it works great and it was sick and, uh, came out awesome.

1832
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:02,540
And then I was like, fuck it.

1833
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:03,860
I'm going to try and 3D print it.

1834
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:06,620
So I got a 3D print going, it's going to be real.

1835
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:11,020
If it's flat projected, I imagine like the opposite side of the vending machine just

1836
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:13,540
like doesn't have any texture on it.

1837
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:17,700
It's just like a smeared abomination of the other side because it just goes right through.

1838
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:23,260
Oh my God, I just had a brain blast guys.

1839
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,900
You should collab Tom.

1840
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:33,020
You should make a mo, like a 3D print, like inverse model of a zoomie and then Ben should

1841
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:38,020
use that as a mold to make a gummy a zoomie.

1842
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:43,480
You know, I, I was talking to, I mentioned the idea and I think I talked to Smirig a

1843
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:50,860
little bit about it, about, um, making like endless war gummies, which, um, you know,

1844
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:55,660
if I had, if I still had ready access to the fucking ingredients that I need, like this

1845
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:59,060
would, like I've, I feel like I've perfected the recipe now.

1846
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:00,060
This would be the time.

1847
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:03,180
It's like, hmm, I wonder if I should get some custom molds, mate, because I think Smirig

1848
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:10,020
said that she could was able to make like custom molds if I wanted some, maybe once

1849
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:15,420
I figure out the supply, supply issue, the slicer I use for 3D that lets you make molds.

1850
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:20,460
It just like inverts the geometry and it'll 3D print a mold that you can cast instead

1851
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:25,220
of just, but it would be like, wouldn't it be like a solid like plastic mold?

1852
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,220
I don't know how it works.

1853
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:27,220
I've never tried it before.

1854
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,940
I was just, I actually just found it yesterday, just looking through settings and cura.

1855
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,300
Which is like the slicer software.

1856
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,780
Could you 3D print like a soft silicon mold?

1857
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:41,340
Uh, if you use a soft material, like I think PETG is flexible.

1858
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:45,020
I've never printed flexible only printed PLA, which is like the baby, like easy stuff

1859
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:46,020
to print.

1860
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:49,420
I mean, it would need to be flexible and it would also need to be like food safe and

1861
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:51,700
not something that's going to like leech toxins.

1862
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:56,700
If like, you know, it's exposed to like a hot substance, like plastic, like plastic

1863
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:57,700
often does.

1864
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:02,300
I know some people do use certain materials that are food safe, but I don't know what

1865
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,300
they are.

1866
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,300
It's off my head, but it is possible.

1867
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:05,300
Yeah.

1868
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:06,300
It's never done it before.

1869
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,300
Okay.

1870
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,300
Okay.

1871
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,300
Interesting.

1872
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,300
There's options.

1873
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,300
Fascinating.

1874
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,300
Oh my God.

1875
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,300
Yeah.

1876
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,300
Yeah.

1877
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,300
It's pretty, it's pretty fucking cool.

1878
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,300
Oh, okay.

1879
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,100
I haven't, this is sort of related.

1880
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:24,300
I haven't posted this anywhere because I'm waiting to have it in hand, but I got, they

1881
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:26,980
made the slime coin.

1882
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:34,020
They made two like, like molds of the slime coin for the endless war pin thing.

1883
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,500
I had them print two versions.

1884
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:41,300
One was, I think I talked about the hard enamel versus soft enamel thing and how they were

1885
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:45,900
saying, they were saying that like, ooh, hard enamel might run together.

1886
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:49,260
The polishing process, that was just bullshit.

1887
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,540
I looked, I looked at the hard enamel version.

1888
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:52,540
It looks fine.

1889
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:54,060
There's no problems with the polishing.

1890
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,900
It was a waste of time.

1891
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,780
I wish they had not even troubled me with it.

1892
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,100
Wait, do you have images?

1893
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,100
Do you have pictures?

1894
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,100
Oh yeah.

1895
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,100
I do actually.

1896
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:04,100
I will see.

1897
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:07,060
And these are, neither of these is final.

1898
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,060
Oh fuck.

1899
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:09,060
Where did, where did I put it?

1900
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:10,620
I sent them to Munchie.

1901
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,620
Oh fuck.

1902
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:12,620
Okay.

1903
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,180
I'll have to go, I'll have to go get them from that.

1904
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,180
Okay.

1905
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:17,180
Here.

1906
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,780
Which, which one of these is the best?

1907
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:19,780
I don't know.

1908
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:24,620
I guess I'll try this one.

1909
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:30,300
There was the soft enamel, they're both with gold metal, because it was decided that gold

1910
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,700
metal is probably the best.

1911
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:38,700
The top one is soft enamel with like a darker green color, and the bottom one is hard enamel

1912
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,500
with a lighter green color.

1913
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:47,500
And I'm going to just wait to see them in person and decide like, which one of these

1914
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:48,500
is better.

1915
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:51,260
I mean, I think I like the look of the hard enamel, but as for the color, I'm undecided.

1916
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,740
That's a picture they sent you of what they look like.

1917
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:54,740
Yeah.

1918
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:57,220
I don't actually have them yet.

1919
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:00,900
This is, this is, they, they took a picture of them holding it and send it to me.

1920
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:06,220
I really wish they were over the same angle so I could see how the shine, yeah, like

1921
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:10,660
the top one looks shiny because of the way that's catching the light and the bottom one,

1922
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:16,500
it looks like it's dark, but if it were catching the light differently, it might not.

1923
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,500
I don't know.

1924
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:21,860
That's why I have to like, I can't decide until I have it in hand and can like hold

1925
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:25,980
it and turn it around and be like, hmm, fascinating.

1926
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,700
The top one does look really good though.

1927
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:30,860
I can't wait to hold that thing.

1928
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:37,860
There, there is, I don't know, there's, um, like all the bridges and bumps.

1929
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:38,860
There's three.

1930
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:44,940
I mean, the hard enamel is kind of, I don't know, my instinct is to see like, oh, hard

1931
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,980
enamel is just better.

1932
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:52,940
But like, there is a little bit of something kind of compelling about the like, the non-uniformity

1933
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:56,580
of the surface on the soft enamel one.

1934
01:36:56,580 --> 01:37:00,860
Almost like it's like, almost like the ridges are indeed filled with like liquid.

1935
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:01,860
You know what I'm saying?

1936
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:02,860
Yeah.

1937
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,420
The sort of like squished on there.

1938
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:09,900
I just feel like it would feel real fun to just rub your finger on it.

1939
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,900
Just hold it.

1940
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:11,900
Yeah.

1941
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:12,900
Yeah.

1942
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:13,900
I know what you mean.

1943
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:14,900
Yeah.

1944
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:15,900
The ridges.

1945
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:16,900
Yeah.

1946
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:29,060
I mean, it's, like I said, you can't see them from the same angle.

1947
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:33,060
So it's a, one, the top one just looks better in this image, but like.

1948
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:37,380
In this image, the top one definitely looks better, but it's too early to sell.

1949
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:38,380
Yeah.

1950
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:42,860
It's just sort of the, the gloopiness I think of the indent is sort of cool.

1951
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:43,860
Yeah.

1952
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:44,860
It is.

1953
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:50,380
It is, but I'm, hmm, they're, yeah, no, there's definitely something compelling.

1954
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:56,860
I'm actually really, I'm actually shocked that like, not only did none of like the

1955
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:01,860
circuitry lines like get like smushed together in the final product, there's a little bit

1956
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:06,300
of uneven unevenness in a couple of places, but like that was there in the like vector

1957
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,620
file as well.

1958
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:08,860
So like that's not their fault.

1959
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:13,380
I'm amazed at the degree to which not only did the lines not smushed together, but also

1960
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:20,660
the text is like not, the text is like perfect and like there's, there's parts in the text

1961
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:25,660
that like, like if you look at the very bottom on the end, like in the gap between the lines

1962
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:30,220
of the end in new Los Angeles city, there's a little like square.

1963
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:34,540
And I was sure that the little like square bit was going to get like mushed into the

1964
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:39,660
line because the gap between the square and the end itself is like minuscule, but no,

1965
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:43,780
it's completely distinct and it didn't get mushed together at all.

1966
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:46,980
The polishing didn't have any negative effects.

1967
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:51,140
I'm super happy with how it looks.

1968
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:58,220
Uh, yeah, I think I got the coin and I'm, I'm, I'm almost positive you did.

1969
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:03,260
I'm almost sure there's so many good pins, but the coin is like, the coin is like such

1970
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,740
a unique thing.

1971
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:06,900
Like you can't not have the coin.

1972
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:14,860
I like a long time ago, I talked about like, we're doing a Kickstarter to get the coin,

1973
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,500
to get the coin made.

1974
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,220
And then like later on, when I pitched the idea of the pin, the pin Kickstarter, I was

1975
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:24,820
like, hmm, what if we did the coin as part of it and it just seemed like a good time

1976
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:25,820
to do it.

1977
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:28,540
But like back then when I first thought, I was like, that would be so ridiculous.

1978
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:33,180
Like that would be, that would be like a crazy, a really crazy thing if we like had slime

1979
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:35,380
coin made in real life.

1980
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:37,900
And now we did it.

1981
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:42,260
It's just coming true and I just, I think that's so cool.

1982
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:47,300
I'm so excited to just like hold it and flip it and you know, try to try to pay for things

1983
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:53,460
with it in real life and then like act confused when, when people don't accept it.

1984
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,940
First thing you do, put it into a vending machine.

1985
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,340
Yeah.

1986
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:01,900
First thing I do is go to like a, go to like a restaurant and try and tip with it and say,

1987
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:08,020
look at the change to its put, push it across the table with a sly look on my face.

1988
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:09,020
Yeah.

1989
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:10,020
Okay.

1990
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,300
That's my slime coin news.

1991
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,300
It looks good.

1992
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:19,300
I was tempted to post it in the endless wars, like in the pin server, but I because neither

1993
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:22,980
of these is final and I haven't decided on like which version or which color I want to

1994
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:23,980
go with.

1995
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:26,420
I'm like, eh, why show these now?

1996
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:27,420
Why show these now?

1997
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:32,100
I'm in the show notes now so everyone can see them.

1998
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,100
People just argue.

1999
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:35,060
It would just, it would lead, I feel like it would lead to strife.

2000
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:37,060
I feel like it would lead to like a rift.

2001
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:40,860
It was like, there was a big, there was saying, we just talked about it on a public podcast

2002
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:42,140
for like, yeah, you're right.

2003
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:46,260
I fucked it up, but like there was a big rift of people who, between people who wanted

2004
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:52,360
like 1.5 inch diameter and two inch diameter and like, you know, these two groups could

2005
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:57,300
not be reconciled with, they just had fundamentally opposed worldviews and like there was,

2006
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:01,420
these coins, like 1.5 and 2.

2007
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:04,940
As a coward centrist, I went with 1.75.

2008
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:07,420
Uh, that's alright.

2009
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:12,380
It's, I, I, I bought a bunch of like other coins of various sizes.

2010
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,380
I bought some 1.5.

2011
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:14,380
Ah!

2012
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:15,380
Oh my God.

2013
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:16,380
Oh.

2014
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:17,380
Did you hear that?

2015
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,380
I did.

2016
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:19,380
I heard that.

2017
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:20,380
I knocked my microphone over.

2018
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:21,380
Lamal.

2019
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:22,380
Oh, no.

2020
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,460
I'm glad you can still hear me.

2021
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:26,420
I bought a bunch of other challenge coins of different sizes.

2022
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:31,820
I bought 1.5, 1.75 and 2 and I like held them and I looked at them and I tried flipping

2023
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:36,900
them and I showed them to Munchie and we discussed it.

2024
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:43,260
And I think we, we agree that like 1.75, like bigger is better, but flipability is good.

2025
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:51,260
And 1.75 is like two inches is slightly cumbersome to flip 1.75 is not particularly cumbersome

2026
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:54,780
to flip, but it's like almost as big.

2027
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:57,060
So we figured it was like the best of both worlds.

2028
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:59,380
So yeah, I went with that one.

2029
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,380
Ah.

2030
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:04,540
And now I have all these used, I have this one with like a bald eagle and an American

2031
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:10,740
flag on it and one with like a Roman soldier on it and one, one made up like an obviously

2032
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:18,540
inferior metal with like an objectively bad drawing of like a night Templar like kneeling.

2033
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:21,620
This thing is like a piece of shit and like whoever drew this was incompetent.

2034
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:24,140
I'm going to take a picture right now.

2035
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:26,900
Oh, you didn't like my drawing?

2036
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:29,220
No, you, you fool.

2037
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:30,220
You failed.

2038
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:31,220
No.

2039
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,220
Shit.

2040
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:34,380
This is probably, this is going to take me a second.

2041
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:43,460
So in a, in like two minutes, I will treat you to a picture of a, of a poorly drawn night

2042
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:49,180
saying, greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.

2043
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:51,180
One John for four.

2044
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:57,140
Does that mean like fucking dudes is better than going out in the world?

2045
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:03,380
And then on the back, there's a cross in a shield and it says, I can do all things through

2046
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:10,540
Christ who gives me strength, Philippians 413, 413, homestuck number.

2047
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,100
Oh, my phone just turned off.

2048
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,100
Okay.

2049
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:18,380
I'm going to show him the mouth in the show notes, maybe in the show notes, maybe.

2050
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,380
Okay.

2051
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,380
That's all I have to say about coins.

2052
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,380
In fact, that's all I have to say about anything.

2053
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:23,380
Yeah.

2054
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,380
Should we do voicemails?

2055
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:26,140
I guess we could do voicemails.

2056
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:30,300
I guess, I guess if that's still a thing we're doing, if, if we're all, if we're all ready

2057
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:35,940
to move on, we can, we can stop doing voicemails whenever you want.

2058
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:36,940
All right.

2059
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:37,940
Yeah.

2060
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:38,940
Let's, let's go.

2061
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:39,940
Let's, let's, oh my God.

2062
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:40,940
Oh my God.

2063
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:41,940
How many are there?

2064
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:42,940
Oh, is there a lot?

2065
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:44,780
No.

2066
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:45,780
There's a whole page full.

2067
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:46,780
At least 20.

2068
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:47,780
There's exactly one page of them.

2069
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:48,780
You know what?

2070
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:49,780
It's good.

2071
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:50,780
More for it.

2072
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:51,780
It's healthy.

2073
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:52,780
Okay.

2074
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:53,780
Keeps us strong.

2075
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,780
No, no.

2076
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:55,780
We're going to go lightning round.

2077
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:56,780
Okay.

2078
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:00,180
On the second page, the first one is from, is from best guy ever, if you can, if you

2079
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:01,180
can believe it.

2080
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:05,780
Didn't, oh, for some reason minus that one is played, but yeah.

2081
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,780
Okay.

2082
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:11,420
That one, yeah, it was played for me too, but I listened to the last episode and the

2083
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:13,340
last one we played was from prole jester.

2084
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:15,260
So best guy ever is the first one.

2085
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,500
So all right.

2086
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,500
Here we go.

2087
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,900
Uh, three, two, one, go.

2088
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:23,820
Hey guys, it's me, the best guy ever.

2089
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:26,740
Just want to say you're doing a great job.

2090
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:27,740
Bye.

2091
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:28,740
Wow.

2092
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,740
Heartwarming.

2093
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,740
He's on the podcast.

2094
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:34,500
You better watch it now.

2095
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:39,540
You better watch the entire podcast to see Nate wherever, wherever he is.

2096
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:44,020
I'm glad that he's, that he's looking down from heaven and he's glad and he's pleased

2097
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:46,020
with the job we're doing.

2098
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:47,020
Cool.

2099
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:55,220
Uh, next one is from every listener, three, two, one, go.

2100
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:58,020
One of you guys just going to end the podcast already.

2101
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:02,420
I mean, it's basically dead says you idiot.

2102
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:07,420
Every listener says that this is, I guess this is, I guess this is what everyone is

2103
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:08,420
saying.

2104
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:09,420
It's true.

2105
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:14,940
Every week, the comments are just, they're dumbfounded that we continue to do a podcast

2106
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:16,700
that isn't very difficult to do.

2107
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:20,740
More like they're dumb and unfounded in their opinions.

2108
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:26,500
It's almost like making this podcast is really not that much of a, of an ask and you could

2109
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:27,780
do it at any time.

2110
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:31,340
Well, you could do, you know, a couple of hours a week.

2111
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:32,340
So easy.

2112
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:34,340
Like why would we stop?

2113
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:36,500
Um, I don't, I don't know.

2114
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,500
Yeah.

2115
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,500
No, I can't, I can't imagine.

2116
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:43,380
I really, I really cannot think of any good reason not to just do the podcast.

2117
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:48,060
Well, it's what happens when you have a bunch of people who've built cult of personalities

2118
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:51,940
around themselves and then when they disappear, those people who are into that cult of personality

2119
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:55,180
exclusively are going to voice their disdain.

2120
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:56,180
It's true.

2121
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,180
It's true.

2122
01:45:57,180 --> 01:46:01,260
So, um, but, uh, you know, I mean, it's only so much.

2123
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:05,580
I was thinking about this a little bit and it's like, I could feel bad about this, but

2124
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:10,940
there's, there's nothing I can do about people who just want there to be someone else on

2125
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:12,780
the show that isn't here.

2126
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:14,060
Like I can't do anything about that.

2127
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:15,560
I'm not them.

2128
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:22,260
So like, yeah, I've been, it was really annoying to me for a while, but I think I've just,

2129
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:26,100
I think, I think maybe I let it get to me and I think I've made peace with it.

2130
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:33,540
And now I'm, I'm, I'm just like the podcast is what it is and the podcast has always been

2131
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:37,460
whoever wants to show up shows up and that's, and that's the show.

2132
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:39,380
And we just, we just do that.

2133
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:44,220
We work with whatever that ends up being and it is, and it is still that.

2134
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:48,580
And uh, you know, of course it has gone, it has gone through phases and this is just another

2135
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:54,820
phase in the natural life cycle, much like the, the pupa stage of an insect's life, you

2136
01:46:54,820 --> 01:46:58,620
know, before it forms into a beautiful chrysalis, right?

2137
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:03,780
We're in the, we're in the chrysalis phase right now, uh, and the butterflies is coming.

2138
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,380
Dude, dude, I love cream chrysalis.

2139
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:06,380
What a great villain.

2140
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:07,380
Um, uh.

2141
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,780
Until they ruined her when they brought her back.

2142
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,180
But before that, what a great villain.

2143
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:15,340
Hey, why did like the changelings become like good guys or something?

2144
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:16,340
I literally don't know.

2145
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,340
They turn into people.

2146
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,580
They like all turn like green and stuff.

2147
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:24,460
That there was, there was one changeling who was not like other changelings.

2148
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:26,500
He wasn't that, he's a shit.

2149
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:31,540
And so he met spike, he met spike and spike became friends when he's, and he's like, Hey,

2150
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:33,100
this changeling is okay.

2151
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,900
And everyone was like, okay.

2152
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:37,020
Um, then chrysalis is evil.

2153
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:42,420
And then the good changeling was like, no, spikes, cool, uh, ponies, they're nice.

2154
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:47,860
Um, maybe we shouldn't be evil and chrysalis was like, no, we're going to be evil still.

2155
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:54,780
Um, and some sort of magic happened and, uh, the good changeling, uh, instead of feeding

2156
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:58,100
on love, gave love or some bullshit.

2157
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:01,060
And he changed into a different character design.

2158
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:05,140
Isn't that just like, that's like, Hey, I'm a human.

2159
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:08,860
And you know, humans are shit because we like eat meat.

2160
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:11,060
And I don't believe in eating meat.

2161
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:14,100
I think that's like cruel and it's bad and changeling.

2162
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:18,660
So, so, so instead of consuming meat, I'm going to expel me.

2163
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:22,860
I'm going to like, I'm going to like puke me into out into the world.

2164
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,420
I'm just going to like carve chunks of meat off my body.

2165
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:27,740
Yeah, right?

2166
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:34,460
Like, like, okay, I, I get like not consuming love, but he, where does the love come from

2167
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:36,500
if he's just going to like spit it out?

2168
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:37,500
Oh, I guess.

2169
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,500
I don't know.

2170
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,900
Oh, he has to like give up.

2171
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:40,900
He has to be nice.

2172
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:41,940
He has to be a nice person.

2173
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:45,420
You know, I guess that actually makes, I guess he just probably just comes from his

2174
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:49,980
heart, the same place that like all love comes from, so stupid question.

2175
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:53,060
You know, wouldn't, wouldn't you say, though, that we all consume love?

2176
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:55,980
Like when we are loved, aren't we consuming love of other people?

2177
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:58,820
Aren't we all changelings deep down?

2178
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:04,380
There's a different, different ways like, like cool metaphor about the changelings love

2179
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:08,780
like manipulators or something like a relationship thing, but I've never thought about it.

2180
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:12,340
Did you ever read sideways stories from wayside school?

2181
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:14,380
Uh, no, but I've heard of it.

2182
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:16,660
I was too busy reading Animorphs.

2183
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:19,820
I read these a little bit before I got into Animorphs.

2184
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,260
These was like this elementary school.

2185
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:27,420
They're like, they're like funny stories about this like this wacky school with all this

2186
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:30,220
create all these crazy shit happens.

2187
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:40,020
Um, and, uh, I don't, there's one, there's one story I remember and it's about fuck.

2188
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:44,380
I don't remember like which of the kids is doing it or like whatever it's someone is

2189
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:51,060
going around just saying like, I love you to people and they're like, and everyone's

2190
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:53,140
like, Hey, that's great.

2191
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:54,980
Hey, I love love.

2192
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:57,060
Hey, this is awesome.

2193
01:49:57,060 --> 01:50:02,540
And then someone is like, I think it might be like the teacher tells one of the kids

2194
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:04,180
that like she loves him or something.

2195
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:08,740
And he's like, what about, and he's like, what about Mrs. Mr. The teacher's name is Mrs.

2196
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,740
Jules.

2197
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:13,180
And he's, and she tells this kid that she loves him and he's like, what about Mr. Jules?

2198
01:50:14,180 --> 01:50:18,660
And she's like, the thing about love is that it's, it's not like other things.

2199
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:23,060
It's the only kind of thing that when you give it, you end up with more of it than you

2200
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,560
started with.

2201
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,660
So I think maybe that's maybe that's the principle that these, um, that these, these good changes

2202
01:50:29,660 --> 01:50:30,660
are operating on.

2203
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:34,460
Like they, they thought they had to consume love to get it, but it turns out, turns out

2204
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:36,700
love is just like, it's just non-Newtonian like that.

2205
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:42,020
It doesn't obey the natural laws of arithmetic in the way you might expect.

2206
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:43,020
Mrs. Jules was right.

2207
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:46,020
Hashtag justice for Mrs. Jules.

2208
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:52,780
Uh, uh, okay, based, uh, next.

2209
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:59,460
Next one is called, uh, Sessho eight Nate, three, two, and it's short, which is, which

2210
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,460
is epic.

2211
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:01,460
Three, two, one.

2212
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:02,460
Go.

2213
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:05,620
Thanks to Ben Tom hippo for holding down podcast.

2214
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:06,620
Okay.

2215
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:07,620
Welcome.

2216
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:08,780
You're welcome.

2217
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:10,660
Was that Sessho saying that?

2218
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:12,020
After eating.

2219
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,020
I don't know.

2220
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:14,020
Okay.

2221
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:15,020
Okay.

2222
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:16,020
Hmm.

2223
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:23,020
The camera says that next one is Matt Damon, and you know, and you, yeah, you know that

2224
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:28,580
it's him because his email is real Matt underscore Damon at Hollywood dot mail.

2225
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:33,980
So, you know, that's thanks for joining us, uh, three, two, one.

2226
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:34,980
Go.

2227
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:45,540
He use his gingers again.

2228
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:52,580
Anat Odemur.

2229
01:51:52,580 --> 01:52:03,580
You know, son, he's my best friend.

2230
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:06,660
Goodbye, this old knucklehead.

2231
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:09,260
This ruins goodwill hunting for me.

2232
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:14,420
Uh, he's like studying for a new role.

2233
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:15,420
He's getting into character.

2234
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,940
He's method acting.

2235
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,100
He's a little too good.

2236
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:23,460
He's a little too effective at this.

2237
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:24,460
Hmm.

2238
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:29,260
Uh, ooh, I don't know.

2239
01:52:29,260 --> 01:52:31,140
I should stop watching movies.

2240
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:34,500
You start watching a movie.

2241
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:40,180
You think it's the movie advertised, but then, uh, you know, the samurai.

2242
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:45,260
You think you're watching the MGM Lion Roar at the beginning of a movie, but it's actually

2243
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:49,260
Oh, Ben no Sainto-san.

2244
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:54,340
Did I, did I talk last week about that movie I watched?

2245
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:57,980
The Virginia Woolf movie, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

2246
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:58,980
You did.

2247
01:52:58,980 --> 01:52:59,980
Yes.

2248
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:00,980
I haven't watched yet, but I did download it.

2249
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:02,980
I can't fucking remember.

2250
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:06,580
I fucking COVID, fucking lockdown.

2251
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:11,060
I can't remember like which week is which and whether like things happened last.

2252
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:12,060
It really is.

2253
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:16,380
I really am just like, hmm, what's new this week?

2254
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:17,380
What's old?

2255
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:19,380
Who knows?

2256
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:22,540
Next one is titled Very Unsuspiciously.

2257
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:29,980
You'll Never Catch Me, Chris Hansen, uh, three, two, one, yes, go.

2258
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:31,980
Hello.

2259
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:32,980
What's up?

2260
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:33,980
He's a samurai.

2261
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:34,980
He's everywhere.

2262
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:43,980
Ben no Sainto-san, have you been called by a Hollywood actor, a reatory?

2263
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:46,980
Haha, not a meto demo.

2264
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:49,980
Tozo ai, samurai-sama.

2265
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:52,980
Mastery of the Skies.

2266
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:55,980
Haha, fuck you.

2267
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:56,980
I'm so scared.

2268
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:57,980
Ben no Sainto-san.

2269
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:58,980
Anywhere.

2270
01:53:58,980 --> 01:53:59,980
In any time.

2271
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:03,980
Of samurai revenge scheme.

2272
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:05,980
We have a kidnap.

2273
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:08,980
Ben no Sainto-san, Garufarendo.

2274
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,980
Aristian-chan.

2275
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:13,980
Weston-chan-dura.

2276
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:14,980
No.

2277
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:21,980
You pay three million yen, or you never see Corisu-chan again.

2278
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:24,980
Zipuroto-thikan.

2279
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:27,980
But until next time, sayonara.

2280
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:31,980
I don't know if I'm willing to pay three million yen.

2281
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:35,980
Me and Chris are around a little bit of rocky territory lately.

2282
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:37,980
Yeah, you're at war right now.

2283
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:43,980
We, yeah, yeah, Mlachikam has officially gone to war with Quickville.

2284
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:53,980
And Chris has continued to deny that this is taking place in the alpha timeline, despite extensive documentation proving it to be the case.

2285
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:57,980
So I don't know if we're talking right now.

2286
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:00,980
How can you profit here from war without an enemy though?

2287
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:11,980
Maybe I'll just send a slime boy over there to be like a puppet dictator.

2288
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:14,980
Maybe they'll just send them to disguise themselves.

2289
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:21,980
Can't you just say as a dimensional prophet that this never happened in this timeline and that it just doesn't happen and you don't have to worry about it anymore?

2290
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:23,980
With this kidnapping?

2291
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:25,980
Yeah, this kidnapping just didn't happen in this timeline.

2292
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,980
I mean, ordinarily.

2293
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:29,980
Seems to work for Chris.

2294
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:33,980
This samurai's genjutsus are pretty powerful, I don't know if that's true.

2295
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:40,980
Hey, samurai-san, voice grail, I think. At this point, you've earned voice grail.

2296
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,980
No, I would rather not. I would rather keep him out.

2297
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,980
Tom, you will also agree with me so we can outnumber Ben.

2298
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:50,980
I don't know if you should do that.

2299
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,980
It's a good bit. It's a good bit. I like it.

2300
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,980
I love it every time.

2301
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:58,980
I like the accent and I like Ben's suffering. It's like a win-win for me.

2302
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:00,980
It's really scary.

2303
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:04,980
It's like you never know when he's going to strike and when he does, it's the best.

2304
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:10,980
But if he's in the voice grail, that'll mean he's close to me and he's within striking distance.

2305
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,980
I know, that sounds like fun times for all.

2306
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:17,980
Oh god, if only I could vote twice.

2307
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:22,980
If only we had mail-in voting here on the PCP so I could vote once by mail and once at the polls

2308
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:28,980
so I could lock this vote down, but I can't. I'm only one man.

2309
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:32,980
Have we done it? Is he grail?

2310
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:34,980
I think he's grail.

2311
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:41,980
Oh god, alright. Okay, well, this is fucking, this is going to be sick.

2312
01:56:42,980 --> 01:56:45,980
Alright, see you in hell, sensei.

2313
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:51,980
Next one is from Free the Pee-Pee. 3, 2, 1, go.

2314
01:56:51,980 --> 01:57:01,980
It's not enough to free the nipple, free the pee-pee and free the poo-poo, but what about the children? Fuck the children!

2315
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:05,980
Yeah, you know, sometimes I just want my junk outside of my trousers.

2316
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:07,980
Sometimes I just want to quality it.

2317
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:12,980
He's talking about junk, I think he's talking about pee-pee and poo-poo, I think he's just talking about fluid.

2318
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:15,980
I think he's just talking about excrement, yeah.

2319
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,980
Isn't that already free?

2320
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:21,980
Well, no, I hope not.

2321
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:27,980
It's the act of doing it that's banned, but if it's just on the side of the road, no one's going to go to jail.

2322
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:31,980
I think they just mean like the penis and the butthole.

2323
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:35,980
I think that's what they meant, but if we take them with their literal words.

2324
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:39,980
You shouldn't be allowed to shit in the street because it stinks.

2325
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:44,980
Pee-pee is urine and it is the penis.

2326
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:50,980
The poo-poo is the poo-poo, but it is not the butthole. Nobody calls the butthole the poo-poo.

2327
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:57,980
What about when you're keeping in line with the pee-pee terminology?

2328
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:03,980
I think that you've been had, I feel like this was a misdirect.

2329
01:58:03,980 --> 01:58:09,980
When I read it, I thought he meant the penis, but then you can't say pee-pee.

2330
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:13,980
He said pee-pee and poo-poo, he's talking about the pee-pee poo-poo, that's unambiguous.

2331
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:18,980
Ben, first of all, this is a terrible lightning round because we've had a huge discussion about every voicemail,

2332
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:22,980
but there are two more parts to this voicemail that might clarify our question right now.

2333
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:24,980
Maybe we should hold our questions to the end.

2334
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:28,980
I hear the nipple doesn't mean free the milk.

2335
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:35,980
Yeah, I know, but he said pee-pee and poo-poo.

2336
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:37,980
Alright, let's move to the next one.

2337
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:39,980
I'm just taking him out of his word.

2338
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,980
Next one, free the pee-pee part two.

2339
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,980
Three, two, one, go.

2340
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:46,980
But I don't want to see the pee-pee in public.

2341
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:52,980
Well, you know what, I don't like looking at black people, but I'm just fucking you with it.

2342
01:58:52,980 --> 01:58:54,980
It doesn't matter.

2343
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:56,980
Yikes.

2344
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:58,980
Oh, no.

2345
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:01,980
This guy has like marbles in his mouth.

2346
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:06,980
I didn't see the racism coming.

2347
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:07,980
Oh, dang.

2348
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:08,980
Oh, Jesus.

2349
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:11,980
He's here for a good-natured romp, and it just got dark really quick.

2350
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:15,980
He said clock the children, so he's a pedophile and a racist now.

2351
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:16,980
Oh, no.

2352
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:18,980
Are we going to go to part three?

2353
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:19,980
Are we really going to do that?

2354
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:20,980
We're really going.

2355
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:22,980
Maybe he can redeem himself.

2356
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:24,980
This is the anarchy that Ben has brought in.

2357
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:27,980
It's like that gift from community.

2358
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:34,980
It's like, I can tolerate racism and pedophilia, but I draw the line at wanting to free the pee-pee.

2359
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:37,980
Alright, free the pee-pee part three.

2360
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:38,980
That's the dramatic conclusion.

2361
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:40,980
Three, two, one, go.

2362
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:44,980
Like, you know everyone used to be naked just like all the time, right?

2363
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:50,980
Like, nobody's going to be fucking mentally scarred because they saw a naked person existing.

2364
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:54,980
Your brain is wired to already see naked people.

2365
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:56,980
Who fucking cares?

2366
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:00,980
I do know what you mean about the marbles in the mouth.

2367
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:04,980
Like, he sounds like the stereotype like nerd side character in a cartoon.

2368
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:06,980
Yeah.

2369
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:08,980
I'm not sure if he's doing a voice.

2370
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,980
I think he's doing a voice.

2371
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:13,980
I guess I'd feel a little bad if like, that's just how he sounds.

2372
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:17,980
And I'm like, he sounds impaired, lamal.

2373
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:24,980
But I don't know.

2374
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:26,980
There wasn't a punchline.

2375
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:27,980
He was just continuing the thing.

2376
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:28,980
Yeah.

2377
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:30,980
Just putting one in voicemail.

2378
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:34,980
Yeah, you could have said all this in one voicemail.

2379
02:00:34,980 --> 02:00:40,980
Hey, free the, free the, free the peepie, free the, free the black peepie.

2380
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:42,980
And don't fuck kids.

2381
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:43,980
Just that one.

2382
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:44,980
And don't fuck the children.

2383
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:47,980
Those are my, these are, so I, I'm with you on one out of three.

2384
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:52,980
Okay.

2385
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:54,980
Anything else to say about that?

2386
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:55,980
No, no, there really isn't.

2387
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:56,980
Excellent.

2388
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:57,980
All right.

2389
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:58,980
Good.

2390
02:00:58,980 --> 02:00:59,980
We're sorted.

2391
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:00,980
Next one.

2392
02:01:00,980 --> 02:01:01,980
Pancakes.

2393
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:05,980
I was wondering, what would you guys think of a tier list voting system?

2394
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:09,980
Let's say in this system, you're voting for president and there's three candidates.

2395
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:11,980
One that you think is great.

2396
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:13,980
One that you think is mediocre.

2397
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,980
The third one that you think is poo.

2398
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:20,980
So when it comes times the vote, you go to poll and there's like three slots.

2399
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:25,980
There's a primary, secondary, tertiary, and so on and so forth.

2400
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:33,980
So in the primary, put the one you really want secondary, the one you think is mediocre and tertiary, the one you think is shit, or if you don't like them, leave it blank.

2401
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:42,980
So when it comes to tally up the votes, they go from primary and the one you vote for primary, let's say you just, there's no way you could ever win.

2402
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:47,980
So then your vote would go down to your secondary and that's the one it would kind of go to.

2403
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:50,980
What do you think a system like this would do?

2404
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:57,980
What do you think a system like this would affect stuff like third party voting?

2405
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:03,980
Do you think people like Bernie Sanders would still be in the running if we had this system?

2406
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:08,980
Bernie Sanders would be president if we had this system and it would just be better.

2407
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:15,980
I'm wondering about like the, if there's three tiers then the third one is like I dislike as opposed to neutral.

2408
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:18,980
So like would that count as like an anti-vote?

2409
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:24,980
You guys have surely seen the CGP Grey video about like alternate voting systems, right?

2410
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:31,980
I feel like this is like that, but like that's like way more involved.

2411
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:34,980
Is it called first pass the post?

2412
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,980
No, that's the one we normally have.

2413
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:44,980
What's the one called that's like, yeah, you rank them and then it's like, okay, well, anyone that doesn't...

2414
02:02:44,980 --> 02:02:47,980
I forget the name of it all the time as well, but yes.

2415
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:51,980
It's like you combine like ones that are like that don't get enough of the votes.

2416
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,980
So single transferable vote, right?

2417
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:55,980
Yes.

2418
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:56,980
Single transferable votes.

2419
02:02:56,980 --> 02:02:57,980
I believe that's what it's called.

2420
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:03,980
You vote for your, you rank them, but then like if your favorite doesn't hit the threshold, then like your second vote, Deri, gets your vote.

2421
02:03:03,980 --> 02:03:13,980
Those votes go to their seconds and like similar candidates will gather like similar seconds.

2422
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:28,980
And it literally makes it makes like it makes third parties like not pointless like in American politics and like in most like party politics system and like sing first pass the post voting like third parties are a completely waste of time.

2423
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:33,980
Yeah, it's just it would never happen because it's fake anyway.

2424
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:42,980
The people in charge do not want it to be like that. They don't want to let third parties have a chance because then it would be like harder for them to just continue to gain control.

2425
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:48,980
The people of everybody who's in a position of power to make positive changes are the ones benefiting most from keeping it bad.

2426
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:51,980
So the only way to fix this is to murder everybody.

2427
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:57,980
Bernie would have made, I mean, I mean, Bernie would have probably, I'm sure he would have approved of something like this.

2428
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:03,980
I obviously like it would have taken like the it would have taken like bills through Congress and stuff to get like voting change like this.

2429
02:04:03,980 --> 02:04:06,980
But you know, I don't know.

2430
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:14,980
Some people would want a system like this. And it's just that it's some people would prefer this objectively better system.

2431
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:21,980
You know, I guess is my most optimistic take on that.

2432
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:24,980
Yeah, it's a shame. It's a shame that our system sucks.

2433
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:26,980
But what are you going to do?

2434
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:31,980
But next one is from vintage three, two, one, go.

2435
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:37,980
Hey, PCP. So last week was my first ever voicemail in the show.

2436
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:43,980
So this week is going to be my first, my first ever drunk voicemail into the show.

2437
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:44,980
Okay.

2438
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:49,980
So I'm randomly watching this YouTube video by this YouTuber called the right.

2439
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:51,980
Is he saying he's drunk right now?

2440
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:53,980
He has 875 K subscribers.

2441
02:04:53,980 --> 02:05:02,980
It's about YouTube channels that have recently been hacked and about 20 and a half minutes into the video.

2442
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:08,980
There's like a five second segment about the PCP getting hacked.

2443
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:13,980
And the first tweet he shows in like the.

2444
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:15,980
Yes, it's your tweet.

2445
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:23,980
PCP getting hacked is my fucking tweet complaining about the back getting hacked.

2446
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:31,980
My first exposure to anyone is a fucking tweet from me about some funny shit.

2447
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:36,980
The now imagine how we all feel.

2448
02:05:36,980 --> 02:05:43,980
Our entire career is going to start with the right opinion is talking about he's talking about like channels getting stolen.

2449
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:45,980
And he mentions this TBAP thing.

2450
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:49,980
It's like someone bought and then it's like, oh, I don't have it anymore.

2451
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:59,980
And he says that like he says that like TBAP was restored because it belonged to a group of creators who like had some some some cloud.

2452
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:04,980
Who were who were able to like, you know, get YouTube to get it back, which is a little bit true.

2453
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:09,980
It's you know, it still took us like a herculean effort to do it.

2454
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:17,980
But it is it is true that we do have some level of a platform which made it like possible at all, which is so that's true, I guess.

2455
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:20,980
But he yeah, he says it.

2456
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:23,980
He only he mentions TBAP mispronounces it.

2457
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:25,980
He says TBB AP.

2458
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:35,980
And then he says it belonged to a group of creators and he shows tweets from the PCP Twitter account, but he doesn't mention the procrastinators specifically, which is kind of a bummer.

2459
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:37,980
But I don't know.

2460
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:39,980
On my tweets, I saw a red man's face.

2461
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:40,980
That's right.

2462
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:41,980
He did.

2463
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:42,980
I remember that.

2464
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:43,980
I don't remember what it said.

2465
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:45,980
Yeah, it's on screen for not long enough.

2466
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:53,980
Yeah, he just showed like a couple of tweets, like two of the PCP and then like yours and like vintages and I don't know.

2467
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:59,980
It's funny that TBAP got like mentioned and the PCP didn't lol.

2468
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:00,980
Okay.

2469
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:04,980
Next one from vintage again.

2470
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:09,980
Hopefully drunker this time because I couldn't even tell you were drunk that first time was pathetic.

2471
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:11,980
Three, two, one, go.

2472
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:33,980
Okay, so I just send in some voicemail about the PCP hack being featured in some pretty decent sized video and I also I forgot to add to the voicemail already sent in that he shows a screenshot on a website where the PCP or actually specifically

2473
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:43,980
TBAP channel was sold on and someone bought someone named Tofifi bought the TBAP channel for $45.

2474
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:53,980
So I'm just curious how that makes you feel Ben or Nate ever comes back on the show again.

2475
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:55,980
You got a good deal.

2476
02:07:55,980 --> 02:07:56,980
Huh?

2477
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:57,980
You got a good deal.

2478
02:07:57,980 --> 02:08:00,980
That is 35 dollars for TBAP.

2479
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:03,980
TBAP has like 15,000 subscribers on it.

2480
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:09,980
Like it hasn't posted a video in like a year plus, but it's got 15,000 subscribers.

2481
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:13,980
Yeah, that's an incredible deal honestly.

2482
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:16,980
Like, damn, maybe I should buy a YouTube channel.

2483
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:18,980
Kickstart my career again.

2484
02:08:18,980 --> 02:08:20,980
You want me to sell you TBAP?

2485
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:21,980
No.

2486
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:24,980
Oh, well, okay.

2487
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:26,980
At this point, we would probably...

2488
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:36,980
I want to start with a channel with like 99,000 subscribers and then just like get the extra 1K and then get my plaque and then be like, I did it.

2489
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:45,980
Every month, when Nate does like the pay calculations, he includes like TBAP ad revenue and it's like one cent.

2490
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:50,980
So every month we're making like one to two cents off of like TBAP video ad revenue.

2491
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:55,980
I'm so glad I get like one sixth of a penny of TBAP money.

2492
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:56,980
No, it doesn't.

2493
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:57,980
No, no, no, no, no.

2494
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:58,980
That only goes to me and Nate actually.

2495
02:08:58,980 --> 02:08:59,980
Ah, well fuck both of you.

2496
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:00,980
Fuck you.

2497
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:03,980
Yeah, I get fucked, idiot.

2498
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:05,980
Disgusting.

2499
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:11,980
Next one is from Yuck, a penisqueef.

2500
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:13,980
Three, two, one, go.

2501
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:14,980
Konnichiwa.

2502
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:15,980
No.

2503
02:09:15,980 --> 02:09:17,980
It is a samurai.

2504
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:19,980
One more time.

2505
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:22,980
This is the fate you brought upon yourself.

2506
02:09:22,980 --> 02:09:23,980
It's not.

2507
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:25,980
Voice mail.

2508
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:29,980
One no guy, a fucking idiot.

2509
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:32,980
Say your sayonara.

2510
02:09:32,980 --> 02:09:36,980
No work in context I use.

2511
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:38,980
That is the joke.

2512
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:41,980
You're fucking retard.

2513
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:42,980
Okay.

2514
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:44,980
Until you next time.

2515
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:46,980
Sayonara.

2516
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:48,980
I, is it?

2517
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:49,980
Is that intentional?

2518
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:50,980
Is that the joke?

2519
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:51,980
I don't know.

2520
02:09:51,980 --> 02:09:58,980
I thought you could just say sayonara.

2521
02:09:58,980 --> 02:09:59,980
What was it?

2522
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:03,980
It's like sayonara is like when it's like goodbye, like for good or for a long time.

2523
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:04,980
For a long time.

2524
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:06,980
I'll see you in 20 years.

2525
02:10:06,980 --> 02:10:08,980
Sayonara, motherfucker.

2526
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:09,980
Right.

2527
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:11,980
Well, who fucking cares?

2528
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:13,980
Listen, you're a voice girl now.

2529
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:14,980
You're above such petty concerns.

2530
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:16,980
What other voicemails say about you?

2531
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:20,980
About your quote unquote, about your Japanese skills.

2532
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:25,980
Next one is from is Margar's realization.

2533
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:27,980
Three, two, one, go.

2534
02:10:27,980 --> 02:10:28,980
Margar here.

2535
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:31,980
It's worse than I thought.

2536
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:38,980
I was under the impression that Ben St was purposely targeting me for whatever reason.

2537
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:44,980
As a victim of this corrupt police state that we find ourselves within.

2538
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:45,980
I am.

2539
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:48,980
But the reality is far more trouble.

2540
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:49,980
No, it's not.

2541
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:54,980
Ben St is not the perpetrator of the victimization that I have suffered.

2542
02:10:54,980 --> 02:11:01,980
But is instead a byproduct of the very system we live within.

2543
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:08,980
I've fallen by the wayside and the system as if it were some love, crafty and horror

2544
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:13,980
is not malevolent towards me and like others like me.

2545
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:19,980
But is instead unaware of my suffering altogether.

2546
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:25,980
I thought that your harassment was the worst of it.

2547
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:33,980
But the realization that my existence may as well be irrelevant is somehow more terrible.

2548
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:35,980
I'm so glad Margar made it to seventh grade.

2549
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:39,980
This is this is just this is such it's such a cope such a cope.

2550
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:43,980
This guy he's just he's just wants to he just wants to

2551
02:11:43,980 --> 02:11:44,980
Oh, philosophy.

2552
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:49,980
He wants to wax philosophic about all these goons that are coming to his cell and kicking his ass all the time.

2553
02:11:49,980 --> 02:11:54,980
No, no, I'm there's no there's no there's nothing to be learned here.

2554
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:58,980
There's nothing to be gleaned about the system or systematic injustice.

2555
02:11:58,980 --> 02:11:59,980
I just I paid them.

2556
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:02,980
I said beat him up and they do it.

2557
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:04,980
And there's nothing more to it than that.

2558
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:07,980
No, you were right the first time you are being systematically targeted.

2559
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:17,980
The system is just I am a single lone wolf single bad apple malevolent actor working within the system to bring about bad outcomes.

2560
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:28,980
Don't so so rest assured rest assured the universe does know about your suffering and encourages it and by the universe I mean me.

2561
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:33,980
You just earned yourself a whole lot of goon visits with this voicemail.

2562
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:35,980
I'll tell you that much.

2563
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:36,980
Next up.

2564
02:12:36,980 --> 02:12:38,980
I'm excited for this one.

2565
02:12:38,980 --> 02:12:44,980
Best Ben bits slash s or something three, two, one, go.

2566
02:12:44,980 --> 02:12:54,980
Got to say one of my new favorite bits on the podcast is the Ben being racist bit or the Ben being misogynistic bit.

2567
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,980
It's honestly pretty funny.

2568
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:56,980
Keep it up.

2569
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:57,980
Okay.

2570
02:12:57,980 --> 02:12:58,980
I will.

2571
02:12:58,980 --> 02:12:59,980
Thanks.

2572
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:05,980
I'm glad you like it when I'm raised.

2573
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:07,980
Maybe I should rebrand.

2574
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:12,980
You know, you know, ever since I I've been trying out this new racism thing and I got to say it's paying dividends.

2575
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:14,980
Like my patreon is like skyrocketing.

2576
02:13:14,980 --> 02:13:16,980
Like the Koch brothers are calling me up.

2577
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:17,980
They want to give me a show.

2578
02:13:17,980 --> 02:13:25,980
It's like, damn, maybe there's something to all this after all this whole this whole racism, this whole misogyny thing.

2579
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:26,980
Hmm.

2580
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:27,980
I don't know.

2581
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:29,980
I don't know what I was so mad about before.

2582
02:13:29,980 --> 02:13:32,980
Now I can, I can see them see in the other side and it makes a lot of sense.

2583
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:36,980
Okay.

2584
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:37,980
That's it.

2585
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:38,980
Nothing to apologize for.

2586
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,980
Three, two, one, 29, three, two, one, go.

2587
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:42,980
Konnichiwa.

2588
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:44,980
Sessha wa somurai.

2589
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:45,980
Dekosa datai.

2590
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:47,980
I am not the samurai.

2591
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:49,980
But I do know a little bit about samurai.

2592
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:50,980
I live in Japan.

2593
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:52,980
I work in Japan at a Japanese company.

2594
02:13:52,980 --> 02:13:54,980
And I speak Japanese every day at work.

2595
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:57,980
And I'm calling to respond to vintage.

2596
02:13:57,980 --> 02:14:00,980
Now I'm not going to say he was completely wrong.

2597
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:05,980
He was saying that Sayonara is typically a long term or permanent goodbye.

2598
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:09,980
And that is what it typically is in everyday life.

2599
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:17,980
But someone I spoke with a very formal register compared to peasants and compared to Japanese people today.

2600
02:14:17,980 --> 02:14:22,980
And in a formal register, Sayonara is a regular goodbye.

2601
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:26,980
And it's the kind of goodbye that you would say to a teacher, for example.

2602
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:32,980
But honestly, I've never really used it in my life except as a long term goodbye.

2603
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:36,980
But if I were to do so, it would not be entirely wrong.

2604
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:39,980
So, Samurai is in the clear.

2605
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:41,980
He has my seal of approval.

2606
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:42,980
Wow.

2607
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:44,980
But he just, he just said it was a bit though.

2608
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:46,980
The samurai himself submitted it was a bit.

2609
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:48,980
No, I think that, I think that was.

2610
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:49,980
Many layers.

2611
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:50,980
I think that was cope.

2612
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:52,980
I don't think it was a bit.

2613
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:55,980
He could, if you just held out one more week, he could have been in the clear.

2614
02:14:55,980 --> 02:15:01,980
I think he, I think he, I think he had a knee jerk reaction.

2615
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:07,980
I think he just, I think he just pulled a, a, a, I was only pretending to be retarded.

2616
02:15:07,980 --> 02:15:08,980
Sort of.

2617
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:09,980
Sort of move there.

2618
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:10,980
That voice growl.

2619
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:11,980
That voice growl we just gave him.

2620
02:15:11,980 --> 02:15:12,980
Looks to be a little rusty.

2621
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:13,980
Shakey.

2622
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:14,980
A little chipped.

2623
02:15:14,980 --> 02:15:15,980
A little premature.

2624
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:16,980
The show's not over yet.

2625
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:17,980
Yeah, yeah.

2626
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:23,980
We could always like completely destroy anybody we, we so please.

2627
02:15:23,980 --> 02:15:25,980
At any moment.

2628
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:26,980
Of course.

2629
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:27,980
Obviously.

2630
02:15:27,980 --> 02:15:31,980
You could, you could find yourself in a Margar situation at the, at the drop of a hat.

2631
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:32,980
Okay.

2632
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:35,980
Next up, barefoot on the freeway.

2633
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:37,980
Three, two, one, go.

2634
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:38,980
Okay.

2635
02:15:38,980 --> 02:15:41,980
So I'm in a tunnel under freeway right now.

2636
02:15:41,980 --> 02:15:46,980
Unfortunately, maybe my brother is not here, the one who's in the car with me before.

2637
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:49,980
He's at college right now.

2638
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:56,980
But what I noticed is there's some graffiti around here and one of them says, I heart ghost bone.

2639
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:59,980
Your thoughts give.

2640
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:01,980
I heard ghost bone.

2641
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:04,980
Was it ghost bone or ghost boner?

2642
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:05,980
Ghost bone.

2643
02:16:05,980 --> 02:16:08,980
I assume both mean boner.

2644
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:13,980
Ghost bone sounds like it might be like someone's like DJ handle.

2645
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:14,980
That's the Lord of Ghosts.

2646
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:16,980
It's a fan of Lord of Ghosts, clearly.

2647
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:19,980
Oh, they just like getting boned.

2648
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:20,980
By the Lord of Ghosts.

2649
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:21,980
By log.

2650
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:22,980
Yeah.

2651
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:23,980
Okay.

2652
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:24,980
Sure.

2653
02:16:24,980 --> 02:16:27,980
You see, you see that in the seedier parts of Lockecom.

2654
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:30,980
I love ghost bone.

2655
02:16:30,980 --> 02:16:35,980
The less reputable brothels.

2656
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:38,980
Hey, we got another one though from barefoot on the freeway.

2657
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:40,980
Three, two, one, go.

2658
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:41,980
Okay.

2659
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:42,980
Let's see.

2660
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:44,980
There's a dinosaur.

2661
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:48,980
Uh, Sarah, Tim, Joey, Daniel, Wesley.

2662
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:51,980
We're here in 2013.

2663
02:16:51,980 --> 02:16:54,980
Pablo and Amber, we're here in 2017.

2664
02:16:54,980 --> 02:16:57,980
There's the hamburger helper.

2665
02:16:57,980 --> 02:17:04,980
Uh, I'm trying to find the thing I saw before.

2666
02:17:04,980 --> 02:17:11,980
Yeah, your local druggy, TikTok soldier camp, number one.

2667
02:17:11,980 --> 02:17:19,980
Uh, Rob White people, July with a licky tongue coming out of the, uh, the Y.

2668
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:25,980
I'd be peaking his little squinty face.

2669
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:26,980
All right.

2670
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:28,980
That's about all I see.

2671
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:33,980
There was an American flag, but there are stars in the American side.

2672
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:38,980
As you can see, they're deep.

2673
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:39,980
I like that.

2674
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:40,980
That's something about.

2675
02:17:40,980 --> 02:17:45,980
Well, something about that feels like you're walking around in a fallout like post-apocalypse.

2676
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:52,980
You find like a, uh, a recording of someone's voice, just talking to themselves.

2677
02:17:52,980 --> 02:17:56,980
I, um, you're like, huh, well, what do you know?

2678
02:17:56,980 --> 02:18:02,980
Someone used to be alive, walking around in like sewer pipes and looking at weird shit on the walls.

2679
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:05,980
I may have mentioned this before, but I'll say it again.

2680
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:07,980
There was a, there was some, some graffiti.

2681
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:16,980
There was some spray paint on a stop on the orange line on the Boston subway system on the orange line of the stop.

2682
02:18:16,980 --> 02:18:21,980
I think it was at Sullivan Square was the stop and waiting on the platform at Sullivan Square,

2683
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:24,980
which I used to use that when I lived in a different house.

2684
02:18:24,980 --> 02:18:32,980
Um, there was some, there was a painting of the power puff girls and it was pretty bad.

2685
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:34,980
Uh, but that's fine.

2686
02:18:34,980 --> 02:18:40,980
But what annoyed me about it was that they got the girl's personalities wrong and they drew blot, they drew, um,

2687
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:44,980
Buttercup smiling and, and bubbles looking like angry.

2688
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:49,980
And, and it's like, yeah, fake fan, like what were you thinking?

2689
02:18:49,980 --> 02:18:51,980
No, they're just doing, they're just doing inversion.

2690
02:18:51,980 --> 02:18:53,980
They're just doing like, what if they were different?

2691
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:54,980
What are they the opposite?

2692
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:55,980
They're all universe.

2693
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:56,980
Maybe.

2694
02:18:56,980 --> 02:18:57,980
I don't know.

2695
02:18:57,980 --> 02:18:58,980
I don't know.

2696
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:01,980
What if Buttercup was secretly like a tsundere?

2697
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:02,980
Like ha ha.

2698
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:04,980
I think she is.

2699
02:19:04,980 --> 02:19:05,980
Yeah.

2700
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:07,980
So, so there.

2701
02:19:07,980 --> 02:19:11,980
Bubbles is like, yeah, it's always the nice ones that are like,

2702
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:17,980
Bubbles does have that hardcore episode where she like got really mad and like beat the shit out of everybody

2703
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:20,980
and like had her hidden rage.

2704
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:21,980
Yeah.

2705
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:26,980
It's a common trope that the, the, the cute one is secretly evil and the evil one is secretly,

2706
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:29,980
well, the mean one is secretly nice.

2707
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:32,980
So what was these secrets?

2708
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:33,980
Um,

2709
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:34,980
Women be crazy.

2710
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:40,980
You got it because you got to have like, oh, you got to have set up a character and then subvert expectations.

2711
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:50,980
Okay, I guess, like, oh, I guess we'll have a character be different than you thought she was so predictable.

2712
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:52,980
You know, terrible.

2713
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:54,980
I hate, I hate fiction.

2714
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:57,980
Like predictable characters like that.

2715
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:58,980
It's all I want.

2716
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:04,980
If a character is what they are and they look like they are a thing and that's what they are, then that's also predictable.

2717
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:11,980
Writers next time surprise me by having the character be completely one dimensional exactly what they seem on the surface.

2718
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:13,980
Nothing more to them.

2719
02:20:13,980 --> 02:20:15,980
Get, get on it.

2720
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:20,980
Give me, where's, where's, where's my, where's the story for me for my taste?

2721
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:23,980
Um, anyway, next one from phallic person.

2722
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:25,980
Gear second.

2723
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:27,980
Three, two, one, go.

2724
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:29,980
Hey, I heard you had a big cock.

2725
02:20:29,980 --> 02:20:31,980
Nice.

2726
02:20:35,980 --> 02:20:38,980
We did say that again.

2727
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:40,980
It was better this time.

2728
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:42,980
He won up himself.

2729
02:20:42,980 --> 02:20:44,980
Voice grail, voice grail, I'm thinking.

2730
02:20:44,980 --> 02:20:48,980
Yeah, you know, we could only do one voice grail per episode.

2731
02:20:48,980 --> 02:20:50,980
I think we need to like get rid of Samurai.

2732
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:52,980
Samurai man, get out of here.

2733
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:54,980
This is where the voice grail is going.

2734
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:56,980
Oh, I don't know.

2735
02:20:56,980 --> 02:20:58,980
Oh, I've got, I don't know.

2736
02:20:58,980 --> 02:21:02,980
Has he, has he, I mean, I want to, I'm tempted because he complimented my cock.

2737
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:08,980
Um, I don't know, I might be a little corrupt of me.

2738
02:21:08,980 --> 02:21:10,980
That might be nepotism.

2739
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:12,980
What do we think?

2740
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:16,980
Um, okay.

2741
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:19,980
I like, I like it when they say that to me.

2742
02:21:19,980 --> 02:21:21,980
Voice grail.

2743
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:22,980
Okay.

2744
02:21:22,980 --> 02:21:23,980
Voice grail.

2745
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:24,980
Grail.

2746
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:25,980
Grail.

2747
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:26,980
Grail.

2748
02:21:26,980 --> 02:21:27,980
Fallic person.

2749
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:28,980
So close.

2750
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:29,980
So close.

2751
02:21:29,980 --> 02:21:31,980
Glad you like, glad you like my cock.

2752
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:33,980
Oh, are we taking Samurai out?

2753
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:34,980
Yeah, only one grail.

2754
02:21:34,980 --> 02:21:35,980
This is a new rule.

2755
02:21:35,980 --> 02:21:36,980
Only one grail.

2756
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:38,980
Just because it's really funny to do that.

2757
02:21:38,980 --> 02:21:39,980
Okay.

2758
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:40,980
Okay, cool.

2759
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:41,980
Just cause it's funny.

2760
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:42,980
Yeah.

2761
02:21:42,980 --> 02:21:43,980
Phew.

2762
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:44,980
Oh, I'm safe.

2763
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:45,980
I'm safe for another week.

2764
02:21:45,980 --> 02:21:47,980
Thank God, Fallic person.

2765
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:52,980
Uh, no, we just, we just angered the Samurai more to take something away from him.

2766
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:55,980
Uh, no, don't talk, let's not talk about him anymore.

2767
02:21:55,980 --> 02:21:57,980
Uh, uh, he's too scary.

2768
02:21:57,980 --> 02:22:03,980
Uh, next one is from, uh, is funny story three, two, one, go.

2769
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:06,980
Hello there, PCP funny story.

2770
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:12,980
I once dated a girl that worked at a radio station and she was on the prowl for potential guests.

2771
02:22:12,980 --> 02:22:20,980
Obviously she invited me cause I like, uh, wrote a little novella best of my mountain blade playthrough inspired by DJ's light novel.

2772
02:22:20,980 --> 02:22:22,980
The one he wrote in a day.

2773
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:27,980
The radio station was completely deserted except for me and her and it was really nice.

2774
02:22:27,980 --> 02:22:38,980
Then when the broadcast started, my brain completely farted and I ended up explaining the entire concept of light novels and Aromanga sensei live on national radio.

2775
02:22:38,980 --> 02:22:42,980
Ancest and Isekai's and everything in between.

2776
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:48,980
Needless to say, the girl backpedaled the fuck out of that conversation and our little stint didn't last much longer.

2777
02:22:48,980 --> 02:22:52,980
The whole mishap probably didn't help, huh?

2778
02:22:52,980 --> 02:23:02,980
So, uh, what other, do you have any sort of stories that, and like this?

2779
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:03,980
No.

2780
02:23:03,980 --> 02:23:11,980
With the production, like with the music in the background and like the sort of well spoken first part of it.

2781
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:14,980
I thought this was gonna not end like that.

2782
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:15,980
No.

2783
02:23:15,980 --> 02:23:19,980
Like redid his like fuck up on the radio on the voicemail.

2784
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:24,980
He really, he really, he really lost the thread at the end there.

2785
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:27,980
That was a funny story.

2786
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:32,980
Why would you talk about incest on a radio station?

2787
02:23:32,980 --> 02:23:38,980
Why did you, why did you have to talk about incest explaining the concept of light novels?

2788
02:23:38,980 --> 02:23:41,980
Yeah, why would you go to Aromanga sensei of all things?

2789
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:42,980
I don't get it.

2790
02:23:42,980 --> 02:23:44,980
Talking about Aromanga sensei and it's like, oh, what's that?

2791
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:51,980
Well, it's about this like love thing between a boy and his sister kind of, but here's the thing about incest in anime.

2792
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:53,980
I can see how it happens.

2793
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:56,980
I feel like this is the product of some like Digi related brain rot.

2794
02:23:56,980 --> 02:23:57,980
I don't know.

2795
02:23:57,980 --> 02:23:59,980
I feel like blaming Digi for this.

2796
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:04,980
He said he wrote his light novel because you read Digi's light novel.

2797
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:09,980
Yeah, but I, but I, and I feel like we can, I feel like there's correlation here.

2798
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:14,980
It's like if it's, if Digi's responsible for one of those things, he's probably responsible for the other.

2799
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:15,980
That seems fair.

2800
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:17,980
Yeah, for sure.

2801
02:24:17,980 --> 02:24:20,980
What was even the question at the end that has, has you had a story?

2802
02:24:20,980 --> 02:24:23,980
Have you done anything cringy on a date or something like that?

2803
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:30,980
Yeah, I guess been cringy on a date or embarrassed yourself on national radio.

2804
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:32,980
Well, he said he was dating this girl.

2805
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:33,980
Oh, I missed that part.

2806
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:35,980
I just ended the relationship.

2807
02:24:35,980 --> 02:24:36,980
Yeah.

2808
02:24:36,980 --> 02:24:38,980
Well, it didn't help.

2809
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:45,980
No, I've never embarrassed myself.

2810
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:51,980
I certainly have never like accidentally said some weird racist shit on a podcast or anything.

2811
02:24:54,980 --> 02:24:56,980
Never.

2812
02:24:56,980 --> 02:24:59,980
No, all the ladies want to date me actually.

2813
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:01,980
So get fucked, nerd.

2814
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:03,980
Same, but I always reject them.

2815
02:25:03,980 --> 02:25:04,980
I say no.

2816
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:05,980
I say no.

2817
02:25:05,980 --> 02:25:13,980
I say, you know, girls don't even know what light novels are and they've certainly never read Irumanga Sensei.

2818
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:15,980
So what's even the point?

2819
02:25:15,980 --> 02:25:16,980
Am I right?

2820
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:17,980
I'm right.

2821
02:25:17,980 --> 02:25:18,980
All right.

2822
02:25:18,980 --> 02:25:20,980
Next one from Zinthos.

2823
02:25:20,980 --> 02:25:23,980
Like Azorath Metrion Zinthos?

2824
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,980
Maybe.

2825
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:26,980
It's called About Balding.

2826
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:29,980
Three, two, one, go.

2827
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:30,980
Hey there.

2828
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:36,980
I think Nate once brought up that Ben is by far the closest one to going bald in the PCP.

2829
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:40,980
Do you think your personality will change at all when it all goes down?

2830
02:25:40,980 --> 02:25:45,980
I've been balding for the past four years and for the first two, it looked pretty all right.

2831
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:49,980
But recently it started looking terrible and I finally gone and shaved my head.

2832
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:51,980
At first it was really surreal, you know.

2833
02:25:51,980 --> 02:25:55,980
Suddenly half my wardrobe wore spaghetti sauce stained wife beaters.

2834
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:57,980
Potbelly basically grew on me overnight.

2835
02:25:57,980 --> 02:25:59,980
My musculature has been in the town outside of existence.

2836
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:01,980
Started to beat my wife, fuck my kids.

2837
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:03,980
But you know, still trying to be cool.

2838
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:05,980
It's not as bad as you might think it is, really.

2839
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,980
Eat your ass.

2840
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:08,980
Zinga.

2841
02:26:13,980 --> 02:26:16,980
My head is fucked.

2842
02:26:16,980 --> 02:26:17,980
I don't know.

2843
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:20,980
My head just looks like crap and it's bad.

2844
02:26:20,980 --> 02:26:23,980
My forehead is huge.

2845
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:25,980
I have like a...

2846
02:26:25,980 --> 02:26:27,980
Got a hold of this big idea.

2847
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:29,980
My hairline is kind of swept back.

2848
02:26:29,980 --> 02:26:30,980
I don't know.

2849
02:26:30,980 --> 02:26:33,980
I'm still not convinced that I'm going bald.

2850
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:36,980
But I just have like, I don't know.

2851
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:38,980
I feel like I kind of look like, I don't know.

2852
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:40,980
My head is huge.

2853
02:26:40,980 --> 02:26:43,980
My head is huge and shaped badly.

2854
02:26:43,980 --> 02:26:44,980
I don't know.

2855
02:26:44,980 --> 02:26:48,980
I probably will be bald and like, eventually.

2856
02:26:48,980 --> 02:26:49,980
I don't know how close I am.

2857
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:52,980
I'm probably getting there and I just can't see it.

2858
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:55,980
I mean, I know that I'm like going bald a bit.

2859
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:59,980
And then I look at my dad and he's like, he's got the same like pattern.

2860
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:03,980
But hair still grows on quite a lot of his head.

2861
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:06,980
It's really just like the front, like he's got the vegeta.

2862
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:11,980
Like it goes down in the middle and then goes really high up and then back down.

2863
02:27:11,980 --> 02:27:13,980
That's what I've got.

2864
02:27:13,980 --> 02:27:14,980
Yeah.

2865
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:17,980
I've kind of got a little bit of that, but like I hate it.

2866
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:18,980
Yeah.

2867
02:27:18,980 --> 02:27:19,980
Mine's like uneven.

2868
02:27:19,980 --> 02:27:20,980
I have like an uneven widow's peak.

2869
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:21,980
It's very strange.

2870
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:22,980
Mine is my hairstyle.

2871
02:27:22,980 --> 02:27:24,980
Mine is a little uneven.

2872
02:27:24,980 --> 02:27:28,980
Um, you know, a couple of my, oh man, this makes me like upset.

2873
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:31,980
But I'll say a couple of my uncles have the thing.

2874
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:34,980
Do you know, do you know what a St. Peter's Puff is?

2875
02:27:34,980 --> 02:27:35,980
No.

2876
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:40,980
It's when it's like the widow's peak, but you only have the front and like you're

2877
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:42,980
bald other than that.

2878
02:27:42,980 --> 02:27:44,980
You know what I mean?

2879
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:45,980
What?

2880
02:27:45,980 --> 02:27:48,980
Like you have like a widow's peak that just goes to nothing and it just, the

2881
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:49,980
hair just goes away.

2882
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:50,980
No.

2883
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:53,980
You've got like a four, you've got like a fringe, but then behind the fringe is

2884
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:54,980
nothing.

2885
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:58,980
It's like you're bald, but you sort of have a little tuft that grows like at the

2886
02:27:58,980 --> 02:28:01,980
front, like where the point of your widow's peak would be.

2887
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:02,980
Oh, okay.

2888
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:05,980
A couple of my uncles have a little bit of that going on.

2889
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:10,980
And I got to say, I am afraid that one day I will have that.

2890
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:11,980
Just save it, you coward.

2891
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:12,980
I mean, yeah.

2892
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:17,980
I mean, if, if I was at that point, it's like, I need, I might just get fucking

2893
02:28:17,980 --> 02:28:19,980
laser hair removal on my head at that point.

2894
02:28:19,980 --> 02:28:23,980
Cause like nothing is going, nothing is going to be worse than that.

2895
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:27,980
Like I will, there's no conceivable circumstance in which I would ever want to

2896
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:29,980
grow hair ever again.

2897
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:32,980
If I was, if I was rocking that.

2898
02:28:32,980 --> 02:28:33,980
Yeah.

2899
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:38,980
I mean, I have the biggest forehead.

2900
02:28:38,980 --> 02:28:41,980
So I guess that makes me the closest to going bald.

2901
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:50,980
You know, you know, fellas, I've been thinking about that estrogen, like, like

2902
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:52,980
unrelated to bolding.

2903
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:57,980
Although I think bolding is just makes everyone think, what if I was a woman

2904
02:28:57,980 --> 02:28:59,980
and I could have my hair still?

2905
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:01,980
That'd be good.

2906
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:05,980
So I like, whether or not I go on that would determine whether I actually go

2907
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:09,980
bald, but I feel like even if, like I decide against it and I'm like, I'll

2908
02:29:09,980 --> 02:29:11,980
just, you know, be whatever.

2909
02:29:11,980 --> 02:29:15,980
If I go bald, I think it'll be all right.

2910
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:18,980
I have like, like a face that's all right.

2911
02:29:18,980 --> 02:29:20,980
That's a, that's a, that's a good thing.

2912
02:29:20,980 --> 02:29:22,980
I can, I can wear a hat, you know?

2913
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:25,980
I mean, people, people can look good without hair.

2914
02:29:25,980 --> 02:29:29,980
It's just like 14 year olds will laugh at you and you just got to accept that.

2915
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:33,980
14 year old boys will say ha ha, because they're 14.

2916
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:34,980
I don't know.

2917
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:39,980
I, I, I shaved my head in college one time and I don't think it looked very good.

2918
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:44,980
I don't think it's really is a, I'm not convinced that it's a look I can rock.

2919
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:51,980
You need like the right, like physique underneath it.

2920
02:29:51,980 --> 02:29:55,980
Like, I mean, if you've got a weird shaped skull, whoops.

2921
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:58,980
But like most people have a normal skull, I assume.

2922
02:29:58,980 --> 02:30:02,980
But like, I feel like I'm, I'm saying what I'm saying is that I don't think

2923
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:09,980
my head is shaped right to look so, so great, you know, awesome, spectacular.

2924
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:13,980
Look, I don't know anything about the future.

2925
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:16,980
I don't know what, what would work or not.

2926
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:23,980
I just think people, people don't really think about it as much as the person who has the, the boldness.

2927
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:29,980
So it's just like, it's just like everything else in life and in appearance is like, it's whatever.

2928
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:36,980
The, I mean, objectively, it probably would affect my life almost not at all.

2929
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:40,980
But that doesn't stop me from like dreading it.

2930
02:30:40,980 --> 02:30:41,980
Same.

2931
02:30:41,980 --> 02:30:42,980
You know, yeah.

2932
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:43,980
I don't like it.

2933
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:48,980
Every time I like run my hand through my hair and there's like one or two full out and I'm like, you,

2934
02:30:48,980 --> 02:30:54,980
you motherfuckers, you fucking cowards, jumping ship like all the others.

2935
02:30:55,980 --> 02:30:56,980
Hmm.

2936
02:30:56,980 --> 02:30:57,980
Indeed.

2937
02:30:57,980 --> 02:30:58,980
Indeed.

2938
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:02,980
Okay.

2939
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:04,980
Anything, anything more to say about that?

2940
02:31:04,980 --> 02:31:05,980
No.

2941
02:31:05,980 --> 02:31:06,980
No.

2942
02:31:06,980 --> 02:31:07,980
All right.

2943
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:11,980
Next one up is cross Jaden animations porn ethicality.

2944
02:31:11,980 --> 02:31:14,980
Three, two, one, go.

2945
02:31:14,980 --> 02:31:18,980
Here's my take on Gibbs thing about whether or not porn of Jaden animations is okay or not.

2946
02:31:18,980 --> 02:31:21,980
So first of all, we can all agree that drawing porn of a real person,

2947
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:24,980
not an animated puppet isn't okay unless you have their consent.

2948
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:27,980
By the way, this is why I think that the game grumps porn is probably fine to my knowledge.

2949
02:31:27,980 --> 02:31:29,980
Dan and Aaron are fine with it.

2950
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:31,980
So drawing porn of them is a victimless act.

2951
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:33,980
But Jaden obviously hasn't given consent to rule 34 of her.

2952
02:31:33,980 --> 02:31:35,980
So it shouldn't be allowed, right?

2953
02:31:35,980 --> 02:31:41,980
Well, this gets into whether or not porn of her puppet can be considered porn of her because drawing pornography of fictional characters is completely okay.

2954
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:42,980
No consent required.

2955
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:48,980
But when an illustration is meant to represent a real person or even if that illustration is inspired by a real person,

2956
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:51,980
you start to get into a gray area of whether or not they can be considered real.

2957
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:56,980
On the side of the spectrum, closer to real people, you have characters like Mitsuaki Kano from Shirobako,

2958
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:58,980
who may as well literally be Hideo Keano.

2959
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:03,980
And on the side closer to fictional characters, you have someone like Grunkle Stan from Gravity Falls,

2960
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:08,980
who while being loosely based on Alex Hirsch's actual grandfather is obviously his own character,

2961
02:32:08,980 --> 02:32:12,980
not meant to be thought of as one and the same with the real life person who inspired his creation.

2962
02:32:12,980 --> 02:32:17,980
Obviously, it's up to the individual to decide where any particular character belongs on this spectrum.

2963
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:21,980
But I'd say that Jaden's puppet very clearly falls extremely close to the real person end.

2964
02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:26,980
This is because Jaden is speaking directly to the audience with the puppet being meant to represent her real self,

2965
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:32,980
seeing as she uses it to depict actual events that have taken place in her life and actual thoughts and feelings that she has.

2966
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:34,980
So the final verdict is no.

2967
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:37,980
Rule 34 of Jaden Animation's puppet is not okay.

2968
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:38,980
Don't do it.

2969
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:39,980
No.

2970
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:40,980
Bad.

2971
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:41,980
No kisses.

2972
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:42,980
No.

2973
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:43,980
For you.

2974
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:44,980
Die.

2975
02:32:45,980 --> 02:32:47,980
You know, all right.

2976
02:32:47,980 --> 02:33:03,980
I was thinking about this because it's like the thing with YouTube and parasocial relationships is that people, audiences,

2977
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:08,980
they see YouTubers, Twitch streamers, whatever, internet personalities,

2978
02:33:08,980 --> 02:33:15,980
they see them as cartoon characters that aren't real regardless of whether they have a cartoon avatar or not.

2979
02:33:15,980 --> 02:33:25,980
They think of people's lives in terms of arcs that happen and events and drama is like a TV show.

2980
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:28,980
They don't think of them as real people.

2981
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:33,980
If you look at comments on loads of really popular videos or even ours,

2982
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:39,980
they don't really think in terms of like these are people.

2983
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:46,980
They think of them in terms of this show of these people in it suck or is bad or like, you know what I mean?

2984
02:33:46,980 --> 02:33:54,980
There's a level of dehumanization going on across the board on these sort of platforms.

2985
02:33:54,980 --> 02:33:55,980
Yeah.

2986
02:33:55,980 --> 02:34:04,980
So I'm like, the porn is just an extension of that, I think, because they don't think about it being like a person that they need to ask for permission.

2987
02:34:04,980 --> 02:34:09,980
And also it has a cartoon avatar that has like a design that they can already use.

2988
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:10,980
Okay.

2989
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:15,980
But so what does that mean in terms of your conclusion about this?

2990
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:18,980
My conclusion is really just the same as before.

2991
02:34:18,980 --> 02:34:24,980
It's just sort of like realizing that it wasn't just about people who have cartoon avatars.

2992
02:34:24,980 --> 02:34:30,980
It's really just about people who live on like are presenting themselves on the Internet in some way.

2993
02:34:30,980 --> 02:34:39,980
The people will not like think in terms of like this is a person I need to respect or have empathy for.

2994
02:34:39,980 --> 02:34:46,980
This is a cartoon character who has like a TV show called drama that I like keeping up with

2995
02:34:46,980 --> 02:34:50,980
and seeing what happens in the next arc of Digibro or whatever.

2996
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:53,980
You know, like it's already stupid and bad.

2997
02:34:53,980 --> 02:35:02,980
I think that I disagree with this guy's like initial premise, which he seemed to just take for granted.

2998
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:06,980
The thing about like it's not okay to draw porn of real people.

2999
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:08,980
I don't know if I agree with that.

3000
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:11,980
I kind of think you're allowed to do whatever you want.

3001
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:15,980
I mean, I think you're allowed to do whatever you want, but I think it's...

3002
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:21,980
I don't know if I'm willing to be like, oh, you shouldn't do that.

3003
02:35:21,980 --> 02:35:22,980
Like why not?

3004
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:24,980
Yeah, this is the thing.

3005
02:35:24,980 --> 02:35:33,980
It's like, are you allowed to think of a person as they appear online as a character rather than a person?

3006
02:35:33,980 --> 02:35:38,980
Of course, like you're allowed to get like invested in drama and stuff.

3007
02:35:38,980 --> 02:35:40,980
No, you're being a little reductive.

3008
02:35:40,980 --> 02:35:44,980
I'm not saying, oh, well, it's not technically illegal.

3009
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:45,980
That's not what I'm saying.

3010
02:35:45,980 --> 02:35:47,980
No, I'm not arguing with you.

3011
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:54,980
I'm just sort of like making the connection that like the way we interact with Internet personalities,

3012
02:35:54,980 --> 02:36:06,980
porn included is already like non-personal and that is considered okay because like you think of the way celebrities are treated.

3013
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:14,980
And like you can think about it like an individual level like, oh, yeah, I guess it sucks that the paparazzi do those things to all those celebrities,

3014
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:16,980
but people love the stories.

3015
02:36:16,980 --> 02:36:18,980
They keep up with those things.

3016
02:36:18,980 --> 02:36:20,980
They don't really think of them as a person.

3017
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:22,980
They think of them as a show.

3018
02:36:22,980 --> 02:36:33,980
And so in that vein, it's okay, but like you can decide to not participate in the paparazzi in a metaphor sort of way.

3019
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:41,980
You can decide to not like play into that, like not watch drama videos, not draw porn of people.

3020
02:36:41,980 --> 02:36:44,980
I don't really understand what point you're making.

3021
02:36:44,980 --> 02:36:52,980
The point I'm making is that there isn't, you can't make a rule about this because it's just like humans don't act.

3022
02:36:52,980 --> 02:37:01,980
Like obviously you can't litigate it and I wouldn't want that litigated because it's impossible and also stupid to try to like make it illegal

3023
02:37:01,980 --> 02:37:09,980
for somebody to not see someone as a human because like you can't do that.

3024
02:37:09,980 --> 02:37:13,980
Like there's a lot of ways to explain this.

3025
02:37:13,980 --> 02:37:17,980
I'm explaining it badly.

3026
02:37:17,980 --> 02:37:28,980
I feel like you could, I feel like the act of drawing porn of someone and like forget about the cartoon avatars thing.

3027
02:37:28,980 --> 02:37:30,980
Like a real person.

3028
02:37:30,980 --> 02:37:37,980
I feel like the act of drawing, you could set about drawing porn of them in a way that is like harassment.

3029
02:37:37,980 --> 02:37:44,980
Like if you do that as like a, you do that and then you like distribute it like to like people they know or something.

3030
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:49,980
You spread this around as like an act of like, you know, to like embarrass them or something.

3031
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:57,980
Like I feel like you could do it in a way that is harassment, but like in that case, I think it's the harassment that is like what's unethical.

3032
02:37:57,980 --> 02:38:01,980
Not the act of like drawing another person.

3033
02:38:01,980 --> 02:38:06,980
In what is unambiguously like a work of fiction.

3034
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:16,980
It's not meant to be like a photo, like oh, it would be wrong to like deep fake a picture of someone having sex in some compromised position.

3035
02:38:16,980 --> 02:38:21,980
Like that would be wrong, but if it's a drawing you just made because you wanted to make it.

3036
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:26,980
I know, I don't think that's, not only do I think it's not wrong.

3037
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:28,980
Why would a deep fake be different?

3038
02:38:28,980 --> 02:38:31,980
Well, it would be different because that could be construed as reality.

3039
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:32,980
Right.

3040
02:38:32,980 --> 02:38:37,980
If, but if you're, if you're making a deep fake and you're calling it a deep fake and everyone knows it's a deep fake and it's just,

3041
02:38:37,980 --> 02:38:43,980
Well, I mean, there's a level to which like, no, if you're making it clear, no, no, no, shut up.

3042
02:38:43,980 --> 02:38:48,980
If you're making it clear that it's, if you're making it clear that it's not real, then no, I don't think it's wrong.

3043
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:49,980
Okay.

3044
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:55,980
I mean, the only problem there is that it's someone, it might be negligent because maybe the image could be released.

3045
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:57,980
Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.

3046
02:38:57,980 --> 02:39:06,980
Is that like a deep fake is, is what you have to understand that if it's posted without context, people would believe potentially.

3047
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:11,980
You have to, you have to accept some culpability of creating something that could be used like that.

3048
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:18,980
But anyway, my whole point was not to cast a judgment on the ethical, the ethical-ness of it.

3049
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:31,980
I was just sort of thinking about how it relates to everything and not like, if it's okay or not okay to draw porn of a internet personality.

3050
02:39:31,980 --> 02:39:41,980
It's also okay and or not okay to do all of the other things that we do associate with like dehumanizing an internet personality.

3051
02:39:41,980 --> 02:39:43,980
Yeah.

3052
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:45,980
That's my thought.

3053
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:58,980
Like if you don't think of them as a person already, like I, I guess like when it comes to like making a decision, individual is up to the individual.

3054
02:39:58,980 --> 02:40:02,980
Like I wouldn't like lord over people saying, oh, you can't do that.

3055
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:04,980
I wouldn't tell people not to do it.

3056
02:40:04,980 --> 02:40:09,980
I would, I would, I would, I would say cringe if I thought something was cringe what people were doing.

3057
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:14,980
But like there's no, there's no rule that I could stand by like for everything.

3058
02:40:14,980 --> 02:40:15,980
Dancing around the issue.

3059
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:17,980
I'm saying it, I'm not asking about rules.

3060
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:20,980
I'm, I'm, the question is, is it like wrong?

3061
02:40:20,980 --> 02:40:22,980
Is it like bad?

3062
02:40:22,980 --> 02:40:26,980
Well, I don't know what that means.

3063
02:40:26,980 --> 02:40:29,980
It literally just means like, I don't know.

3064
02:40:29,980 --> 02:40:31,980
Do you think it's bad?

3065
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:33,980
Do you think it's unethical?

3066
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:37,980
Do I think it's bad to draw porn of Jaden animations?

3067
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:40,980
Or people in general, but yeah, okay.

3068
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:44,980
Oh, as we can see Jaden animation specifically.

3069
02:40:47,980 --> 02:40:51,980
I think, I think I just don't know what would constitute bad.

3070
02:40:51,980 --> 02:40:56,980
Like if it is bad, what action do I take from that?

3071
02:40:56,980 --> 02:40:58,980
Like, I don't know.

3072
02:40:58,980 --> 02:41:06,980
I don't know what I believe about whether or not it's bad because I don't know what bad means or wrong means.

3073
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:07,980
Okay.

3074
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:10,980
Well, I mean, what, what do you think bad means?

3075
02:41:10,980 --> 02:41:15,980
What would it, what would it mean for something to be bad in, in this or any context?

3076
02:41:15,980 --> 02:41:19,980
Uh, I don't know.

3077
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:23,980
I think it would depend like it, like if something, I don't know.

3078
02:41:23,980 --> 02:41:25,980
What do you think make, what do you think makes something bad?

3079
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:29,980
Well, this is like huge, like, I don't know.

3080
02:41:29,980 --> 02:41:34,980
I can't answer what I think makes something bad because everything is bad in a different way.

3081
02:41:35,980 --> 02:41:37,980
That can't be true.

3082
02:41:37,980 --> 02:41:38,980
I don't know.

3083
02:41:38,980 --> 02:41:40,980
There must be some kind of unifying thing.

3084
02:41:40,980 --> 02:41:47,980
We're getting to like, like, there must be some unifying quality that two bad things share about that, that links them in their bad.

3085
02:41:47,980 --> 02:41:49,980
Well, I must be something similar.

3086
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:59,980
What I'm, what I'm struggling with right now is that I don't know how to say I don't like it in because that like something other than like more substantial than I don't like it means it's bad.

3087
02:41:59,980 --> 02:42:02,980
Because that does not answer the question in any way.

3088
02:42:02,980 --> 02:42:07,980
In my, in my opinion, saying it's bad and saying you don't like it are literally the same thing.

3089
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:11,980
Exactly. So like, how do I explain what I think is bad in a general sense?

3090
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:14,980
I don't understand how that could even happen with language.

3091
02:42:14,980 --> 02:42:17,980
Well, well, um, I don't know.

3092
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:28,980
I guess you would have to like reverse engineer what about a thing makes you not like it and then explain like, okay, why, why does this thing meet these criteria?

3093
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:34,980
Well, I mean, I think the goal, the goal would be to come up with some kind of rule that like,

3094
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:37,980
And that's why I was talking about rules, like you can't make rules.

3095
02:42:37,980 --> 02:42:40,980
No, but I'm not, I'm not, I'm not talking about like a law.

3096
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:42,980
I'm talking about like an ethical rule that's like, ah, okay.

3097
02:42:42,980 --> 02:42:44,980
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

3098
02:42:44,980 --> 02:42:51,980
I'm not talking about laws and talking about like systems that you use to determine whether or not something is good or bad.

3099
02:42:51,980 --> 02:43:03,980
Like a rough definition for bad, like empirically, I feel like willfully and intentionally making someone else uncomfortable, you know, are going against their wishes.

3100
02:43:03,980 --> 02:43:07,980
You know, because if it has to be willful, you're doing it on purpose has to be intentional.

3101
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:18,980
I don't know. I don't, I, I, I think, I don't think, I don't think people are always entitled to have their wishes abided by.

3102
02:43:18,980 --> 02:43:29,980
No, because like there, there are times where like, things, things will happen circumstantially, you know, like you can do, you can do something unintentionally causing someone discomfort and that's not wrong.

3103
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:37,980
That's just kind of like circumstantial, you know, like if we're both trying to get a job, and I get the job and you don't, and you feel bad about it, I didn't do something wrong.

3104
02:43:37,980 --> 02:43:46,980
That was a circumstance, you know, but if like, I fucking slashed your tires so you couldn't get to the interview and I got the job, well, then I did something wrong.

3105
02:43:46,980 --> 02:44:00,980
Yeah, um, okay, but like, this, this, say, alright, we'll take the job interview, like, this person, this other person would probably want you not to apply for the job because it would like create competition for them.

3106
02:44:00,980 --> 02:44:07,980
And like, it would make it less likely that they would get the job, but like, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't apply for it just because they don't want you to.

3107
02:44:07,980 --> 02:44:15,980
Like, you are, you are deliberately going against their wishes and making them and like causing them discomfort by doing it, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

3108
02:44:15,980 --> 02:44:20,980
So I don't know. I don't know if that, I don't know if that rule does it for me.

3109
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:29,980
I feel like the thing I said earlier that you can't define like a system that works with everything. That's why I said it depends.

3110
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:30,980
Sure.

3111
02:44:30,980 --> 02:44:46,980
Sure. But like, with specifically the Jaden animations pornography thing, I think what like what I said last time where I went to the guys Twitter, and they were like, they were being an asshole about it.

3112
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:55,980
And saying they don't give a shit what she thinks they're going to do it. Fuck you haters who don't you are like preaching to me about it.

3113
02:44:55,980 --> 02:44:59,980
And I was like, that's a shitty attitude. I don't like it.

3114
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:00,980
Yeah.

3115
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:03,980
That's that's that's really it.

3116
02:45:03,980 --> 02:45:05,980
Okay.

3117
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:13,980
I don't know. I don't know if all of the people doing Jaden animations porn are doing it with a shitty attitude, but I don't I didn't like the tone of that guy.

3118
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:14,980
Sure.

3119
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:18,980
Okay, well, I just thought that would be interesting to deep dive a little bit on.

3120
02:45:18,980 --> 02:45:24,980
Yeah, I mean, there's a real big philosophical like addition to that conversation, like what is bad?

3121
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:25,980
What is good and bad?

3122
02:45:25,980 --> 02:45:28,980
I love that. I love that kind of shit.

3123
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:30,980
I mean, I got a little flustered.

3124
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:42,980
I mean, yeah, we won't we're not going to answer it because like, you know, people have been trying to like define like what is good since like the ancient Greeks and before and like we haven't we haven't done it.

3125
02:45:42,980 --> 02:45:48,980
So, okay, that's fine. That's fine. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun to talk about my opinion.

3126
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:49,980
Yeah.

3127
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:55,980
Yeah, I think I think that it is bad and I don't like it are the exact same statement.

3128
02:45:55,980 --> 02:45:56,980
Yep.

3129
02:45:56,980 --> 02:46:00,980
Yeah, I think I don't know.

3130
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:01,980
Whatever. Okay.

3131
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:02,980
I think all right.

3132
02:46:02,980 --> 02:46:04,980
Fuck it. Hey, fuck this.

3133
02:46:04,980 --> 02:46:08,980
You know, let's listen to the next voicemail from shallow thoughts.

3134
02:46:08,980 --> 02:46:09,980
Last one.

3135
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:12,980
Three, two, one, go.

3136
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:20,980
Hey, just wanted to say I do miss the other PCP members, but things aren't as bad as everyone in the comments.

3137
02:46:20,980 --> 02:46:21,980
Make it out to be.

3138
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:22,980
You guys are doing great.

3139
02:46:22,980 --> 02:46:23,980
The comments is so shit.

3140
02:46:23,980 --> 02:46:25,980
And yeah, fuck the comments.

3141
02:46:25,980 --> 02:46:31,980
Fuck comment sections are all powered to aren't putting voicemails in the speak pipe so they can go to hell.

3142
02:46:31,980 --> 02:46:32,980
That's right.

3143
02:46:32,980 --> 02:46:33,980
Later.

3144
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:34,980
That's right.

3145
02:46:34,980 --> 02:46:44,980
If they really wanted to make their opinion known, they would have the courage, they would have the stones to make a voicemail, to make a voicemail saying no Nate, no watch.

3146
02:46:44,980 --> 02:46:45,980
See you next week.

3147
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:46,980
Yeah.

3148
02:46:46,980 --> 02:46:48,980
Oh man, the podcast is dying.

3149
02:46:48,980 --> 02:46:52,980
Can't believe this podcast is still going with only three people on it.

3150
02:46:53,980 --> 02:46:55,980
Like they know that we play all the voicemails.

3151
02:46:55,980 --> 02:46:57,980
Why aren't they doing it?

3152
02:46:57,980 --> 02:46:58,980
It's true.

3153
02:46:58,980 --> 02:46:59,980
It's truly cow.

3154
02:46:59,980 --> 02:47:01,980
It's the lot of them.

3155
02:47:01,980 --> 02:47:07,980
Um, no, um, I'm, I'm just, I'm fine with it.

3156
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:14,980
I've, I've, I've like, I've reached Nirvana and I'm like, there's nothing, there's literally nothing wrong with a podcast.

3157
02:47:14,980 --> 02:47:17,980
That's like me, Tom Gibb.

3158
02:47:17,980 --> 02:47:18,980
That's great.

3159
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:19,980
That's great.

3160
02:47:19,980 --> 02:47:22,980
And I'm have absolutely no problem showing up.

3161
02:47:22,980 --> 02:47:25,980
And I'm, and I'm, and I'm actually grateful for the opportunity.

3162
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:26,980
Dev.

3163
02:47:26,980 --> 02:47:27,980
Dev.

3164
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:28,980
Dev.

3165
02:47:28,980 --> 02:47:34,980
Hey guys, thanks for being, thanks for being here with me on this episode of the procrastinators podcast.

3166
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:36,980
I appreciate it.

3167
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:38,980
I'm talking to you two, Tom.

3168
02:47:38,980 --> 02:47:40,980
Oh, not the audience.

3169
02:47:40,980 --> 02:47:42,980
I thought we were wrapping up.

3170
02:47:42,980 --> 02:47:46,980
Well, I was kind of, I was kind of doing both at the same time.

3171
02:47:46,980 --> 02:47:48,980
The audience and the co-hosts.

3172
02:47:48,980 --> 02:47:49,980
Yes.

3173
02:47:49,980 --> 02:47:51,980
It's always, it's always a pleasure.

3174
02:47:51,980 --> 02:47:53,980
It's always a good old time.

3175
02:47:53,980 --> 02:47:59,980
Do we, do we have anything else we want to get out there into the world before we wrap up?

3176
02:47:59,980 --> 02:48:04,980
Go to the big booby mommy milkers discord, link in the description.

3177
02:48:04,980 --> 02:48:05,980
Yes.

3178
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:06,980
Yes.

3179
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:09,980
And enlist boober and jiggle.

3180
02:48:09,980 --> 02:48:12,980
I still, I still can't decide.

3181
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:17,980
I haven't, I haven't made up my mind between, between big boober and mommy milker.

3182
02:48:17,980 --> 02:48:24,980
But as I said in the, in the server, I like the, I like the name mommy milker better than big boober.

3183
02:48:24,980 --> 02:48:30,980
Big boober sounds like, sounds like booger and that's gross.

3184
02:48:30,980 --> 02:48:34,980
But, but I like jiggle is so much better than squirt.

3185
02:48:34,980 --> 02:48:35,980
The jiggle command is better.

3186
02:48:35,980 --> 02:48:41,980
So I'm like, there's just two, two sides with like, they both have their pros and cons.

3187
02:48:41,980 --> 02:48:45,980
And I just can't, I can't just pick a side.

3188
02:48:45,980 --> 02:48:56,980
You're gonna have to, you're gonna have to choose, you're gonna have to choose one, one of these days because default position is like flat freak.

3189
02:48:56,980 --> 02:48:58,980
You're like into flat chests.

3190
02:48:58,980 --> 02:49:02,980
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna start this, the stay flat revolution.

3191
02:49:02,980 --> 02:49:05,980
No, no, stay flats can get fucked.

3192
02:49:05,980 --> 02:49:08,980
They can get flattened by us.

3193
02:49:08,980 --> 02:49:11,980
Are you going to add smothering?

3194
02:49:11,980 --> 02:49:20,980
Um, I mean, it's, it's up to Doon Coon because she's doing all the coding, but it'll be cool.

3195
02:49:20,980 --> 02:49:24,980
A lot of things would be cool, but a lot of things would also be work.

3196
02:49:24,980 --> 02:49:26,980
Hey, you should add slime.

3197
02:49:26,980 --> 02:49:29,980
No, no, you should put some slime in there.

3198
02:49:29,980 --> 02:49:31,980
Like why not, right?

3199
02:49:31,980 --> 02:49:33,980
No, I think that's terrible.

3200
02:49:33,980 --> 02:49:37,980
What if like slime girl, what if like slime girls had big booby mommy milkers?

3201
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:40,980
I mean, they do.

3202
02:49:40,980 --> 02:49:41,980
Yeah.

3203
02:49:41,980 --> 02:49:42,980
Hmm.

3204
02:49:42,980 --> 02:49:43,980
I don't know.

3205
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:45,980
I just thought that was interesting.

3206
02:49:45,980 --> 02:49:52,980
Um, did you know that, did you know that people die in car accidents all the time, even with big booby mommy milkers?

3207
02:49:52,980 --> 02:49:54,980
I just thought that was interesting.

3208
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:58,980
They don't actually work as airbags is the unfortunate thing.

3209
02:49:58,980 --> 02:50:00,980
Uh, terrible.

3210
02:50:00,980 --> 02:50:01,980
Unfortunate.

3211
02:50:01,980 --> 02:50:02,980
What are you even good for?

3212
02:50:02,980 --> 02:50:03,980
God damn.

3213
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:04,980
Tragic.

3214
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:05,980
Uh, okay.

3215
02:50:05,980 --> 02:50:09,980
Well, uh, fucking, uh, patreon.com.

3216
02:50:09,980 --> 02:50:10,980
The procrastinators.

3217
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:12,980
Slash the procrastinators.

3218
02:50:12,980 --> 02:50:14,980
Uh, speak pipe, send us a voicemail.

3219
02:50:14,980 --> 02:50:21,980
Tell us how you're not, how, tell how you don't watch the show anymore because it's too low energy at the, at the.

3220
02:50:21,980 --> 02:50:22,980
PCP voicemail.

3221
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:23,980
Speakplate.com.

3222
02:50:23,980 --> 02:50:24,980
PCP voicemail.

3223
02:50:24,980 --> 02:50:27,980
Um, join the fucking Minecraft server.

3224
02:50:27,980 --> 02:50:30,980
Uh, PCP Minecraft server.

3225
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:33,980
When was the next stream?

3226
02:50:33,980 --> 02:50:35,980
I guess this will be out.

3227
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:38,980
I said I, I said I was going to do it on Tuesday.

3228
02:50:38,980 --> 02:50:39,980
I might.

3229
02:50:39,980 --> 02:50:41,980
That will have happened already.

3230
02:50:41,980 --> 02:50:45,980
Yeah, I might delay till Wednesday, but I will be either Tuesday or Wednesday today this week.

3231
02:50:45,980 --> 02:50:51,980
So we will have done another one and I'll probably do another one this weekend because I don't know why not.

3232
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:53,980
I've been, I've been enjoying them.

3233
02:50:53,980 --> 02:50:58,980
Oh, I think, I think let me just, let me just look at the, the, the dates.

3234
02:50:58,980 --> 02:51:01,980
This is going to come out on the 18th.

3235
02:51:01,980 --> 02:51:06,980
Um, I'm going away for a bit on the 21st or the 20th.

3236
02:51:06,980 --> 02:51:10,980
So I probably won't be on the next PCP and I'll be gone for like two weeks.

3237
02:51:10,980 --> 02:51:11,980
Oh, why?

3238
02:51:11,980 --> 02:51:12,980
Where are you going?

3239
02:51:12,980 --> 02:51:14,980
Just a little dog holiday.

3240
02:51:14,980 --> 02:51:26,980
We're going to, we're going to go, we're going to take the dog on holiday and go to a secluded house family, family secluded house with a dog so we can run around.

3241
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:29,980
Um, just as a change of, change of pace for everyone.

3242
02:51:29,980 --> 02:51:30,980
I see.

3243
02:51:30,980 --> 02:51:31,980
Okay.

3244
02:51:31,980 --> 02:51:34,980
Um, well, oh no, oh no, we're going to, we're going to go even lower energy.

3245
02:51:34,980 --> 02:51:36,980
I'm going to be, I'm going to be stuck with me.

3246
02:51:36,980 --> 02:51:37,980
It's just going to be me and Tom.

3247
02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:38,980
Oh my God.

3248
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:39,980
No.

3249
02:51:39,980 --> 02:51:42,980
Are we going to get, are we going to get like a Tom solo cast?

3250
02:51:42,980 --> 02:51:43,980
That's what I want to know.

3251
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:44,980
Maybe someday.

3252
02:51:44,980 --> 02:51:45,980
We almost did.

3253
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:47,980
We almost did that one time.

3254
02:51:47,980 --> 02:51:48,980
Did we?

3255
02:51:48,980 --> 02:51:49,980
When?

3256
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:50,980
And then get on.

3257
02:51:50,980 --> 02:51:51,980
Yes, that's true.

3258
02:51:51,980 --> 02:51:52,980
I was a little late.

3259
02:51:52,980 --> 02:51:53,980
