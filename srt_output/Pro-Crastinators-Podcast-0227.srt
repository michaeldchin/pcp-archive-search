1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Hey, it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast again.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,480
I can't believe it's been again so soon.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:20,080
I can't believe we didn't get canceled after all that racist shit we said on the last episode

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,960
that they let us make another one.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,360
Oh, they said that was exactly why we're getting renewed for now.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
They brought me back on.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,120
They had to drag me back out to be the radical centrist to keep you in check.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Sorry.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,920
Whichever one of the Koch brothers is still alive smokes his cigar and was like, ah, these

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,480
boys are exactly what we need.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,400
Give these guys a billion dollars.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:50,120
So we're going to fire Eleazar and we're going to have a whole team of corporate editors.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
We're going to have real production.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Now the podcast is really dead.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,680
We're going to have a real podcast soon.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, what a week.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
What a week.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Right off the bat.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,080
I'll tell you what I'm excited about.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,120
The Vapors 2 books, they are in the mail and I'm looking at the tracking numbers and

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,840
they are like just like a couple hours ago.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,240
They made their way.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,640
They had left Florida.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,200
They have arrived in Massachusetts.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,960
And so I'm assuming they will be.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
They will be in my grasp.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Maybe tomorrow.

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I don't know.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I don't know.

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
It's coming.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
It's coming.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
It's been so long.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
I forgot to even spend money on it.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
I've been writing, right?

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Right.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Everyone who spent money on it is going to have forgotten.

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
You couldn't.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
You could have just pocketed all the cash.

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
Damn.

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Fuck.

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,640
It's going to be they're going to forgot that they spent however much they spent.

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,160
It's going to be they're going to get it like for free.

43
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,480
It's like they're just going to be getting a free present from me like they didn't even

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
pay for it at all.

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Yeah.

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,440
I looked at the thing and I completely forgot that one of the stretch goals was like the

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,920
Ben St. Heart pin.

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,160
I didn't realize I forgot I was getting that.

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Yeah.

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Everybody gets that.

51
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Everybody gets that.

52
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,640
And everybody gets a dollar.

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,360
Oh my God.

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,720
Everybody gets one dollar with class war and a hammer and sickle.

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm going to frame that as my first dollar that like literally like actually.

56
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Incredible.

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,640
My first communist dollar.

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
It'll be for me.

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Yeah.

60
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Vapors to Kickstarter achieve full communism and all it cost was $10,000.

61
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,360
I wonder how much it costs for America.

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,520
Only Stalin had known that communism was that cheap.

63
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
Damn.

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
There was a.

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
All right.

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Right in.

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Right in with the politics.

68
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
I saw a great video.

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,160
Actually, I'll just I was doing.

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,920
I was doing my my my Patreon podcast this week.

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
This month.

72
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I was terrible.

73
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Don't listen to it.

74
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Do not.

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
I repeat.

76
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,000
Do not pledge at patreon.com and listen to the latest episode.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It was bad.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am ashamed of myself.

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,840
But in the comments, Janess, who was at Radcon, we met her at the meetup, she left a comment

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,280
and she told me about this video called it's fuck it's called like responding to every

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
yes.

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Yeah.

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Oh yeah.

84
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
You commented on Twitter.

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
You comment.

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Yeah.

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
We're like answering every like criticism of communism or whatever.

88
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
And it is.

89
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,320
It's just a video where he goes through like all these different arguments that you hear

90
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,440
all the time and just kind of like, you know, does a little debunking of each one each

91
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
one.

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
It's really good.

93
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
It's really good.

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
The guy's channel is called spooky scary socialist.

95
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,320
It apparently took him two years to make this video because it's like 45 minutes of like

96
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,160
his little like puppet avatar, like fully animated with like mouth movements, like explaining

97
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
it.

98
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
What a fool.

99
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Yeah.

100
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
For real.

101
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
What?

102
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
Wait.

103
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,960
Like a stop motion puppet or a hand?

104
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
No, like like a flash.

105
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
No.

106
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Like a flash puppet.

107
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
A flash puppet.

108
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Oh, right.

109
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Yeah.

110
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Yeah.

111
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
It's not like well drawn or anything.

112
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
That's the whole thing.

113
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Very meticulous.

114
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
It was wasted effort.

115
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
It was very much wasted effort.

116
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
But at the same time, I like it.

117
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,360
I like how I like watching it talk, but at the same time, it wasn't it probably wasn't

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
worth two years.

119
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Exactly.

120
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
When he could have just voiced it.

121
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,840
He could have just put it over a static image and it would have been fine.

122
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,040
During those those two years, VTubers have become a thing and have completely made that

123
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,200
production pipeline bloated and silly by comparison.

124
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,000
You just got to get live 2D and have it do all the automated keyframes for you.

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
Oh my God, you're right.

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,840
You should have just pitched up his voice made a cute little anime waifu that have a

127
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
million views right now.

128
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
I should get live 2D.

129
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
They don't even need like good lip syncing.

130
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
No, they don't.

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Wait, should I get live 2D?

132
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
I think everybody should.

133
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
I was trying.

134
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,880
The inevitable end game for all of us.

135
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
VTubers are the downfall of society.

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,880
If I can like live 2D like version of punk, but it was too complex and I ran out of time.

137
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I wanted to do it for like my like draw streams in August, but it was too much work to do.

138
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,920
You have like a 3D model of punk from the game, right?

139
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I do.

140
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Were you trying to use that?

141
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I try to convert it.

142
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Well, live 2D, you start with a drawing.

143
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,920
You start with a drawing and you make it like a puppet.

144
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
You make it a puppet.

145
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,920
But the 3D stuff, it's absolutely abysmal, terrible, horrible.

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Very complicated.

147
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,960
I needed to convert it to some other program and open it in that program so that I could export it as something else from that program.

148
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,960
And the list of like the tutorial list was so long and convoluted that I killed myself and I'm dead now.

149
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Wow.

150
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Well done.

151
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
But I will do that.

152
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,960
I do want to do that like a little punk, like while I'm drawing or whatever.

153
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,960
I have a webcam, but like it's punk there or some other character.

154
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
One of them.

155
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Any of them.

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Pretty cool.

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A gun girl.

158
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Could you like stream and maybe you have like a little like discord chat window open and someone else on like a webcam

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
whose face is like controlling the punk puppet and like they like play punk through this model.

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And it's like the two of you can have a little like back and forth.

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know.

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm coming up with this on the fly.

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So like I'm drawing.

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm on the cutting edge.

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm drawing.

166
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,040
You're drawing and your webcam is showing you but then like over here is punk who some other person who you are in a discord call with

167
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,040
is moving and puppeting them with their face.

168
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Pretty cool.

169
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Some advanced technology.

170
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Pretty freaking cool.

171
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,040
The real reason you would get a Vtuber avatar is so that you don't have to show your face.

172
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
That's what I would do.

173
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Well that's boring.

174
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Why stop there?

175
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Why do the most obvious thing?

176
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
We've already been exposed.

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
There's no there's no saving us now.

178
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
We might as well just go.

179
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,080
The only Vtuber I like is the bunny girl in the made outfit with the big titties.

180
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Which one?

181
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
No there's one.

182
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
There's like there's the dog girl.

183
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,080
No there's the bunny girl in the blue.

184
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
There's the bunny girl in the blue.

185
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I don't know single one of them.

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
She's special.

187
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Well I just saw a gif of her.

188
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I just saw a gif of her holding a giant carrot.

189
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
It was pretty cool.

190
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
She's special.

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
She's my waifu.

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Nobody else is on the entire internet.

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
That's right.

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
That's correct.

195
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
She's like rabbit from Winnie the Pooh.

196
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Who I thought was a girl growing up.

197
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
And I had a huge crush on first orgasm I ever had.

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Jacking off to rabbit from Winnie the Pooh.

199
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Is that true?

200
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
No.

201
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I mean I would be surprised really.

202
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
I did think rabbit was a girl.

203
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Ben's gendered enough to make that to be true.

204
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
That's believable to me.

205
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I thought rabbit was a girl because he had because he gardened a lull.

206
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
But I still didn't think he was hot.

207
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Think of all the progress Ben's made.

208
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,160
The fucking communist man he is now before he enforced such strict gender stereotypes.

209
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
He thought rabbit was a girl.

210
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Only women are involved in agriculture.

211
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Rabbit wore a fucking apron.

212
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Yeah.

213
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I think his character is an effeminate man that does things that women are supposed to do.

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
He acts like a mom in the one with the bird.

215
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I forget the one with Kessie.

216
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Yeah.

217
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
He nags like a woman.

218
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
All the signifiers are there.

219
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
I think rabbit might be trans guys.

220
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Oh.

221
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Which way?

222
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I don't know.

223
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Time to watch a new cartoon and talk about it with a little avatar in the corner.

224
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Time to make a really long YouTube video.

225
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Go through all the problems of making a live 2D puppet and then just make knockoff mysterious Mr. Enter videos with it.

226
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Just have like a sans eye Winnie the Pooh OC and he sans eye Winnie the Pooh.

227
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
What?

228
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
When he's got the blue glow in his eye.

229
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
I know what you mean.

230
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Winnie the Pooh.

231
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Cause you gotta have a Winnie the Pooh Sona.

232
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
It's too powerful for this one.

233
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
What's your Pooh Sona guys?

234
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Hey guys.

235
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,280
So I've made this new the Winnie the Pooh 100 acre wood tabletop RPG.

236
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
You gotta pick your race.

237
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
You're either a stuffed animal or a real animal.

238
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
The two have different bonuses and malices against each other.

239
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
They deal different damage types.

240
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,320
It's like a rock, paper, scissors type thing but there's only two of them.

241
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
So you know.

242
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
One is just better than the other.

243
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Yeah.

244
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
What about human children?

245
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Is that the third one?

246
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Like human child beats the shit out of stuffed animal.

247
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Well it's like Kyogre and Groudon.

248
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Real animal kills child and then stuffed animal forces the real animal to choke when it eats it.

249
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,320
It's like Kyogre and Groudon and Christopher Robin is like Rayquaza.

250
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I know what that means.

251
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
That makes sense.

252
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
He flies up in the sky?

253
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Yeah and he's got airlock.

254
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,320
He's probably flying above the sky because he's a real person.

255
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
And he has something that the toys can never have.

256
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,320
And at the end you climb on his back and ride him into space.

257
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
You know?

258
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Yeah, I remember that happening in the show all the time.

259
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
So it checks out.

260
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,320
You gotta climb up the Eore Hill and watch the clouds do their crazy aurora thing.

261
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,320
And you just take off and you gotta come on, come on Piglet.

262
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Oh Piglet, we gotta catch fucking deoxys.

263
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,320
There's a meteor headed towards us.

264
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
We gotta catch it.

265
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
His defense is really low.

266
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Piglet, I hope you learn false swipe.

267
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,320
That all makes a lot of sense to me anyway.

268
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
That all checks out.

269
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah, yeah, you know.

270
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
That's the sort of like...

271
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Bringing that back.

272
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Long time viewers might remember that.

273
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I don't.

274
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
How far did you get?

275
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,320
How far did you get in Winnie the Pooh's grand slam or whatever?

276
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh, not very far.

277
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I think I got to Tigger.

278
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,320
It was just who was like the third guy.

279
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,320
I got like halfway through.

280
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,320
But I started to tap out when it actually started to get tough.

281
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Like Rabbit was like, yeah, I could deal with Rabbit, but then...

282
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Since I've played all of the Dark Souls series since that episode,

283
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I can confirm that game is harder than Dark Souls.

284
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Not to me, definitely true.

285
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Yeah, I think...

286
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I don't know, there comes a point when it's like,

287
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,320
you have to be like pixel fucking perfect.

288
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,320
And I just could not read the pitches at all.

289
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I had no idea what was happening.

290
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Now it bested me.

291
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
And I've beaten like Super Meat Boy,

292
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,320
and I've beaten all kinds of hard games and shit.

293
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I beat Downwell.

294
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Downwell's kind of hard.

295
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
It's not that hard.

296
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I can't beat Downwell.

297
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
I always get unlucky.

298
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,320
The way to win Downwell is just to use Floaty.

299
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
My strategy is use Floaty,

300
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,320
hope for early knife and fork,

301
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
and just increase your max health.

302
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
But you can go the other way too,

303
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
where you just go full on hyper offensive,

304
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,320
kill everything before they have a chance to damage you style,

305
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,320
which also works, LeMau.

306
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Yeah, video games.

307
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I love video games.

308
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,320
You know, I've got some video game thing to talk about.

309
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Maybe, I don't know...

310
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Have either of you played World of Warcraft ever?

311
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I played a little bit of Cat of back when it came out,

312
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
and that's it.

313
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
I played...

314
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,320
I fully leveled up a character one summer

315
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
when Wrath of the Lich King was new.

316
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Cool.

317
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
And that was it.

318
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
I didn't do much raiding or anything.

319
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Yeah, I've been...

320
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Since they announced like a year ago,

321
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
or a number of months ago,

322
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,320
World of Warcraft classic servers are now a thing,

323
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,320
which recreate the world before the Cataclysm.

324
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I remember when that was coming out,

325
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,320
a bunch of my roommates were talking about it,

326
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,320
because all my roommates used to play World of Warcraft.

327
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,320
The reason I played it that one summer was because a bunch of them,

328
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
who I went to college with, were like,

329
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
hey, Wrath of the Lich King coming up,

330
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Ben, you should play.

331
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
You should play with us.

332
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
And I was like, okay.

333
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I didn't end up getting that into it.

334
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Have I ever mentioned that the people I live with,

335
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
or a bunch of them anyway,

336
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
a bunch of the people that I met,

337
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,320
and the way that I got this place that I live in right now,

338
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,320
they were a bunch of people who came from this forum

339
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,320
that it was called the TLDR,

340
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,320
and it was for people who were banned from the World of Warcraft forums.

341
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
No.

342
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Yeah.

343
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
This is like the click of people who congealed around this house.

344
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Incredible.

345
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Yeah, there were these bunch of miscreants

346
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
who were banned from the Warcraft forums

347
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
and formed their own forum.

348
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
What did they say?

349
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Did they say nasty words?

350
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
I don't know.

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I got to imagine that there's as many different reasons

352
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,320
for having been banned from the World of Warcraft forums

353
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,320
as there are stars in the sky.

354
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Well, yes.

355
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Anyway, I just thought that was a nice anecdote I would share.

356
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,320
So, World of Warcraft, I was a big World of Warcraft freak

357
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,320
in my early university days,

358
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,320
or maybe, no, it was before university,

359
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
but it was like end of school,

360
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
and I was playing it all summer like a big loser.

361
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,320
But then, there's been a number of expansions.

362
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Wrath of the Lich King was really big and hype,

363
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
and everybody loved it,

364
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,320
and it was like snowy, like Mordor,

365
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
you know, like cool, epic.

366
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
That was the cool time,

367
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
and then the expansion that came out afterwards

368
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
was the Cataclysm,

369
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,320
and it changed a lot of the level 1 to 60 content

370
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
in Azeroth permanently.

371
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,320
And I have hated the game slowly,

372
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
ever since that point,

373
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,320
because they just ruined so much about the things I liked.

374
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,320
And I'm going back now to World of Warcraft Classic

375
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
because they finally said,

376
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,320
fine, we'll let you have the thing you've been asking us

377
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
for ever since Cataclysm.

378
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
We'll finally let you buy this thing,

379
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
and I've been playing it.

380
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Generous of them.

381
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Well, it's so funny,

382
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
because they were on record, on stage,

383
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
someone asked them a couple years ago,

384
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
can you release Classic,

385
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
and they're like,

386
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
no, you guys think you know what you want,

387
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
you don't.

388
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Yeah, it's been so annoying the years.

389
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Ever since Cataclysm,

390
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
I played it once,

391
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
obviously because it was new,

392
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
and it was like,

393
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,320
wow, a giant dragon called Deathwing

394
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
burned everything.

395
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
That's pretty cool.

396
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
I play all the new content.

397
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I see all the new quests,

398
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
and I had previously played

399
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
and seen every other prequest

400
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
before the world changed.

401
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
So I knew everything.

402
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I knew all the differences.

403
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
The biggest difference was

404
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,320
they made it far more convenient

405
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,320
to the detriment of absolutely everything

406
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
that made Water Warcraft good.

407
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
It was so much about...

408
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
They did that to the Classic.

409
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Yeah, they did it.

410
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,320
It's been slowly over the expansions,

411
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
because the level cap raises every time.

412
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,320
They need to make it possible

413
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,320
for a new player to get to the highest level

414
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
in a timely fashion.

415
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
So the amount of experience

416
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
you need to gain lowers slightly.

417
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
But with Cataclysm,

418
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
they redid all the old quests

419
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,320
to make them fundamentally more streamlined.

420
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
You go into a place,

421
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
and all of the quests

422
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
send you out into a small area

423
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
near the Quest Hub.

424
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
You do the quests,

425
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
you come back to the Quest Hub,

426
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
and they lead you on to the next area.

427
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
And you go through the entire zone

428
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
like a theme park ride, almost.

429
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
You never really need to think.

430
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
You never explore.

431
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
You just go on the track that they provide.

432
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
And you can technically not do that.

433
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
You can technically not do any of the quests.

434
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
It's just like,

435
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
there's no content if you do that.

436
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,320
So they turned it into a theme park

437
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
that sucks and is boring.

438
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
It's fine the first time,

439
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
but once you've seen it,

440
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,320
there's no joy in exploring the world anymore.

441
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
So I've been stewing about this,

442
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
and especially how they said,

443
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
you don't know what you want.

444
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,320
It takes so much longer to level up in Classic

445
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
in vanilla Warcraft.

446
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
It takes so long to level up,

447
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
and it's difficult,

448
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
and you don't want that.

449
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
I'm pretty sure.

450
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
I liked leveling up.

451
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
I had fun with the game when I was leveling up

452
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
and exploring the world,

453
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
and then when it got time to start raiding,

454
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
I was like, I hate this.

455
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
It's awful.

456
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
I've never been into raiding.

457
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
It was not fun.

458
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
The whole thing with raiding

459
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,320
is that it completely becomes

460
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
the multiplayer aspect

461
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
is the high level.

462
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
The world is what I like,

463
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,320
and I always liked the architecture,

464
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,320
the big chunky bone buildings

465
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
that the orcs use.

466
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
How could a bone be that big

467
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
that they make a tent out of it?

468
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
What creature could have made this bone?

469
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Never explained, but it's great.

470
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Just the visuals were my favorite part of playing.

471
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
That was like that.

472
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
PS2 was something that really got me

473
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
into low poly and stuff,

474
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
because I grew up with it, obviously,

475
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
but going back and playing wow,

476
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
and being able to really stop and examine everything

477
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
and trying to figure out how everything was made

478
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
was so fucking cool,

479
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
and that was one of the big catalysts

480
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,320
that made me think, I want to do this.

481
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
It was just the way they crafted everything.

482
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Everything was all boxy,

483
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
but there was a lot of artistic flair to it.

484
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Oh, it was such a good design.

485
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Beautiful.

486
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
You said, Tom, you played

487
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
when Cataclysm came out.

488
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
All the quests were super fucking boring

489
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
and dumb, and I hated it.

490
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
It's not like

491
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
War of Warcraft Classic was like

492
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
the quests were way more interesting.

493
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
It's just that

494
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
the slowness of

495
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
the progression

496
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
and things like

497
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
the mounts cost

498
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
like untold amounts of gold

499
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
in the early game.

500
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
And now in the new games,

501
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
they're really cheap and you can get them,

502
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
and if you have one mount and one character,

503
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
you don't need to get them for a new character.

504
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
My greatest wish

505
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
when I played

506
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
was just to level up.

507
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
All I wanted was to level up

508
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
my fucking clothsmanship

509
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
or my tailoring skill

510
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
enough to make the flying carpet.

511
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
It took me so long,

512
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
I was like, I can't believe it.

513
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
I can't believe I have my flying carpet now.

514
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
This is the greatest day of my young life.

515
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
Yeah, I mean,

516
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
War of Warcraft high-level content still,

517
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
each expansion they have, all that stuff.

518
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Cataclysm is really just a sticking point

519
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
because it removed

520
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
well-structured quests that were designed

521
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
for the zone that was built

522
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
around them and

523
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
replaced them with a shitty

524
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
theme park that is really dated

525
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
compared to all of the other content.

526
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
It just

527
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
sucks a lot.

528
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
I would make a big analysis video

529
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
comparing every single quest

530
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
and saying, this one's bad, this one's good.

531
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Old, yeah, new bad old good.

532
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Yeah, old good.

533
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
And I've just

534
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
loved playing.

535
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
I didn't mention this,

536
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
but the reason I got back into War of Warcraft,

537
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
because I know it's really addictive,

538
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
is like

539
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
a treat to myself

540
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
for having done the Clarissa

541
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Tezuka thing, so I'm like,

542
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I'm gonna play a video game and I'm gonna let myself

543
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
enjoy video game.

544
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
And I played it and I'm

545
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
it's just

546
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
mind-boggling.

547
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
How much better

548
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
designed

549
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
the pacing of the game

550
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
is when it's slow, when you're just walking around

551
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
because you have your quest log,

552
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
you actually have to read the quest

553
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
and listen, like, read

554
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
where the guy says to go,

555
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
and it doesn't tell you on the map.

556
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
You just have to know, like,

557
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
okay, head south and then

558
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
do east when you get to the bridge.

559
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
And then if you think about that, like, okay, that's there

560
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
on the map, I can go

561
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
that way and do that quest all on its own,

562
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
but there's two quests to the north.

563
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
I should probably do those first because it'll be quicker

564
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
and I can loop back around

565
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
to this point. It's like this strategy,

566
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
because of the slowness,

567
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
you want to use your time efficiently.

568
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
And it's just

569
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
a far more engaging experience

570
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
than just sort of walking to the guy who has

571
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
the exclamation point

572
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
and looking at the minimap to see where the enemy

573
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
is and just clicking on them.

574
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
I've probably said this before.

575
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Yeah, I remember

576
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
just having a good time

577
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
just, like, running around Azeroth.

578
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
I got my raptor.

579
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Oh, man, I bought my first raptor. Fuck yeah.

580
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Time to run across the barons or whatever.

581
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Oh, there's some mountains. Like, can I climb those?

582
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Like, fuck yeah.

583
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
I love the baron's mountains the best.

584
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

585
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
And, you know,

586
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
I want that flying carpet.

587
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Oh, it's going to take me so long.

588
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
It's going to take me so much gold to train up all these skills.

589
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Oh, flying carpet though. It's okay. I'll put in the work.

590
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Oh, fuck. Oh, no.

591
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
I had a point I was going to make.

592
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Oh, and I was going to say that I had the same thing

593
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
in Final Fantasy XI.

594
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Was 11 the online one or was it 12?

595
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I think it may have been, yeah, 12.

596
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
12 was the offline one.

597
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
11 was the online one.

598
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Okay, yeah, yeah. The first online one.

599
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
They, um,

600
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
yeah, when I was like, I got bored.

601
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
I got bored, like, doing local.

602
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I couldn't really figure out the quest system because I was like a stupid kid

603
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
and I never played a fucking MMORPG before.

604
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
And I was like, well, I guess I just go kill monsters.

605
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Like, this is boring.

606
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
I don't want to fuck with the multiplayer.

607
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Like, oh, god, making, like, guilds

608
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
and, like, joining groups, like, that seems really complicated.

609
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
I was just going to, like, walk into the wilderness

610
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
and I just, like, walked across the entire world

611
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
and I got murdered by, like,

612
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
over-leveled monsters in every area.

613
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
But I was like, I'll just find my way around them.

614
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
Just squeeze my way around things

615
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
so I don't die and get to

616
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
go across the continent and just, like, yeah, I made it.

617
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Okay, cool. I'm done with the game

618
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
and I'll play it again.

619
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
I got everything out of it that I wanted.

620
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
I do love shit like that.

621
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
There's been multiple times

622
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
in World of Warcraft

623
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
where it's just sort of,

624
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
especially the first few times I played it

625
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
on a, like, a new character.

626
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm like, I'm going to explore, like, at a low level

627
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
and I'm going to go into a place I'm not supposed to be.

628
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
If I stick to the road,

629
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
maybe the wolves won't jump at me

630
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
from, like, 40 feet away and kill me in one hit.

631
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Maybe they won't do that,

632
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
but they still do.

633
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
But you can, you know, you get your ghost,

634
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
you walk back to your body, you move a little,

635
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
like, a couple feet forward

636
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
and then you die again and you keep doing that

637
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
until you get to a safe place and then you're, like,

638
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
level one in, like, the really high level zone

639
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
place and people look at you and they're like,

640
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
whoa, what the fuck?

641
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
They point at you and they say,

642
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
lol, out loud.

643
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Now you can die really fast.

644
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
It's just great.

645
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
It's the world of Warcraft.

646
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
The Warcraft sucks.

647
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Like, gameplay is, like, okay,

648
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
but the world is great.

649
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
It's a real fun place to be.

650
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I feel like that was the entire point from the beginning, right?

651
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
To take this, like,

652
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
game that's, like, a real-time strategy game

653
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
that, like, pulls you so far out

654
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
from, like, the actual, like,

655
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
events and, like, environments

656
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
and then drops you in this one individual

657
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
and now it's all around you, this thing that, like,

658
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
traditionally you saw from such, like, a high

659
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
angle, now you're in it.

660
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
That must have been the selling point initially

661
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
and I think it just kind of got lost

662
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
in its own, like, meta game

663
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
and now that's what, like, Blizzard makes it for.

664
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Like, trying to, like, build around, like,

665
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
the end-level content for, like,

666
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
addicted players to keep them continuing to

667
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
give them $15 a month for another decade

668
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
as opposed to, like,

669
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
building up that world.

670
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
I don't know.

671
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
They have made some pretty interesting things,

672
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
but, like, largely

673
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
it's just more of the same.

674
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
It looks a little different

675
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
and it's addictive and there's

676
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
lots of numbers and lots of, like,

677
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
things you can complete.

678
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
There's lots of achievements, like, oh, do one

679
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
thousand of these. Oh,

680
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
I would like to do one thousand of those, but that'll take

681
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
a long time. Ha-ha, Blizzard

682
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
rubs their hands. I've got to get

683
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
their money now. They're gonna

684
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
spend money more.

685
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
I hate it when those big money men

686
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
rub their hands together and smoke their

687
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
cigars and go, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh,

688
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
nyeh, money please.

689
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
And I willingly hand it over because

690
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
they have my video game.

691
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Damn you, Bobby Kotick, you got me again.

692
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
If only he didn't own the means of production.

693
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Ah, fuck, here you go.

694
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
Don Nuts.

695
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Oh, yeah.

696
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Nah, shucks.

697
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
I only bought three months, but

698
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
I'm probably gonna want to play it more than that,

699
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
but I am only playing it, only

700
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
playing it on the weekends,

701
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
on Wednesday, and after streaming,

702
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
which is still quite a lot.

703
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
I mean, I'm gonna try it to be

704
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
like a good boy and not like a good girl.

705
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I don't know, fuck genders.

706
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
It's too hard.

707
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Ah, you killed yourself just there.

708
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Ah, you fucking killed it.

709
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Ah, call the fucking gender police

710
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
on this fucking...

711
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
The gender police, like the vegan police

712
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
from Scott Pilgrim.

713
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
You used the wrong pronoun.

714
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
You're gonna get disintegrated.

715
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
If you...

716
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
I don't know, something, something,

717
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
if you look in the mirror and you

718
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
explode, I don't know, whatever.

719
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Shut up.

720
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Hey, shut the hell up.

721
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Shut up, self, the one who brought up this joke.

722
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Hey, shut up. I want to hear what you were saying.

723
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Keep going.

724
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
I think I was done with the World of Warcraft stuff.

725
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
I just really like it.

726
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
It's really nice.

727
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
I recommend World of Warcraft Classic

728
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
and

729
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
running around in the Barons

730
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
and Molochor.

731
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
I watched, I watched

732
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
Folding Ideas video

733
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
on the World of Warcraft

734
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Classic

735
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
and I was like, okay.

736
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
He had some

737
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
opinions about it and I was like, okay.

738
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Why did you say that you watched

739
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
a video and didn't...

740
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
I don't know what the video was.

741
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
It was just

742
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
him talking about World of Warcraft Classic.

743
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
And he said

744
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
this is what it's like, and I said

745
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
okay.

746
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Well, I just told you what it's like.

747
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Yeah, but

748
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I thought I'd mention that somebody else

749
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
also told me.

750
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Aw.

751
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I thought I was going to build a career

752
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
off of this.

753
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I thought I was the only one.

754
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
The only one who's like

755
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
thought to talk about it.

756
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Oh no.

757
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Everyone else is just suffering in silence.

758
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Thinking that they're not allowed to talk

759
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
about it, but they can.

760
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
You're going to be the whistleblower.

761
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
You're going to blow the whistle on this whole

762
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
thing. Bring this whole house of cards

763
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
tumbling down.

764
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Not today.

765
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Sad.

766
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Alright.

767
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
I got a thing.

768
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
I got a thing from this morning.

769
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Early this morning.

770
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I've been up all night.

771
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
I got annoyed. I got an argument

772
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
on my Discord server.

773
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm not going to name any names or anything.

774
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
That's not the point.

775
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
The point is this was a thing that annoyed me.

776
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
I guess this is like an MI the asshole

777
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
kind of thing.

778
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Here it is.

779
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
There's this tweet that's going around.

780
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
It's got these four girls.

781
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
It's like, oh, these are like

782
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
four lefty politics girls

783
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
who like guns

784
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
and whatever.

785
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
And they're hot.

786
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
They're leftists.

787
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
And what do you think about that world?

788
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
The squad.

789
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
It's like, okay, fine.

790
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
And I do think

791
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
that three of them are pretty hot.

792
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
And the fourth one

793
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
is also conventionally attractive.

794
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
But I

795
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
don't like her face.

796
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Honestly, I think her face

797
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
I think there's several unattractive things about her,

798
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
but in particular it's her face. I don't like it.

799
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
When I see it,

800
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
it's like, I think it's gross.

801
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
And I

802
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
it's not important why.

803
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
It's not important why, but I'm like,

804
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
so I go on my discord and I'm like, I can't stand

805
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
seeing this tweet anymore.

806
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
I have to say

807
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
this girl who's like, oh,

808
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
these girls are so hot. I'm like, this one's hideous.

809
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
This one's disgusting. I hate them.

810
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
I didn't say I hate them,

811
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
but I was like, they're hideous.

812
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
They're awful looking.

813
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Just one of them.

814
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
One in particular.

815
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Who I feel like

816
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
the whole like, am I the asshole?

817
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Like when you say that,

818
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
it seems pretty clear that you are.

819
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
I don't know.

820
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I felt like I was re I feel like it's reasonable

821
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
if you have to ask the question

822
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
you're you already have the answer.

823
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
I feel like it's

824
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
I feel like it's reasonable

825
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
to say

826
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I think this person's ugly.

827
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Not even to them.

828
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
It's subjective, right?

829
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
How can we really say objectively

830
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
if you're correct or not?

831
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
I think, all right,

832
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
there was a whole hubbub in your discord

833
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
and I skinned it.

834
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
I got the gist,

835
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
I think.

836
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
So it's like turned into a thing because

837
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
we kind of just cut you off.

838
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
There was kind of a longer here.

839
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Just for reference, I will show you the image

840
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
and I will say that I think

841
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
is very unattractive.

842
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I am not. I do not like

843
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
her appear. I do.

844
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
I do not find myself excited by the appearance.

845
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
In fact, I see it and I want to

846
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
leave.

847
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Absolutely have the same skirt.

848
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
I mean, you'd have to ask them

849
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,320
if somebody's going to have to change the thing about it is

850
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
the thing about it is the one that I the one that I don't

851
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
that I don't like the look of

852
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
is one that I followed because

853
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
I liked their tweets. I like the things that they wrote

854
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
and said.

855
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
But seeing them,

856
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
I'm like, I hate it.

857
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
I hate seeing this

858
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
and I don't want to see them anymore

859
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
because they're that ugly to me

860
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
and so I unfollowed them because I'm like,

861
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
I like, I feel like

862
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
a girl like this is probably

863
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
has made the joke before. It's like, I hope you're all

864
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
following me for my political opinions.

865
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
I'm not my breasts or whatever.

866
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
And you know, it's probably like,

867
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
everyone's just following me for my breasts

868
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
for my face, for my

869
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
because I post naked pictures of myself

870
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
and all that shit.

871
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
But you know, I have these political opinions

872
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
and I hope I'm being respected for those too.

873
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
But for me, I like their tweets

874
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
and I hate how they look.

875
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
And I think there's probably some irony in that.

876
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
I don't know.

877
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Man, I said, I was

878
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
I was pretty rude. I was pretty rude about how they look,

879
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
but like, I don't know.

880
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
So what?

881
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
It's not like they're going to see it.

882
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
The reason there was a hubbub in

883
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
the in your discord when you posted

884
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
all that is not because

885
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
you know, they're arguing

886
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
that she, you know, if she heard

887
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
what you said, she would be upset.

888
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
It's just that it looks

889
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
weird and feels weird

890
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
to have someone

891
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
just come in and say, isn't this bitch

892
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
ugly? I didn't call her a bitch.

893
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
You didn't call her a bitch, but like, it's

894
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
that vibe, you know, and people will be like,

895
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
I

896
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
don't know.

897
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
I don't really want to be, I don't really want to be,

898
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
you know, discussing whether or not a person is ugly

899
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
or not.

900
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
And it's just sort of like, they didn't

901
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
understand why you had this

902
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
opinion. It's just a weird thing to say.

903
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
I don't know.

904
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Because like, is there

905
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
something, is there like one,

906
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
I don't think there's anything wrong with thinking someone

907
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
is extremely

908
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
unattractive. Well, yeah.

909
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
And that being said, I don't think there's anything wrong

910
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
with saying so. If it's okay to think

911
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
it, I feel like it should be okay to say it

912
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
in a context that's not like

913
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
harassment, which it wasn't.

914
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Right. Is your contention

915
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
simply that the tweet

916
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
is presenting this person as like

917
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
one of four very attractive people

918
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
and you don't see it there and you're merely asking

919
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
the question? Well, the reason why

920
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
yeah, I mean

921
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
the reason why I had this feeling

922
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
it's like, I kept seeing it and being like,

923
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
I don't agree. This is like

924
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
clearly the prevailing opinion

925
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
is that these four are all

926
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
attractive and to me

927
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
it's like, but I really don't like how that one

928
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
looks. I don't like looking at them. I literally

929
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
unfollow them because

930
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
they're repugnance. That seems so

931
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
unusual.

932
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
That's like, huh? Like, am I

933
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
the only one? I'm unique. I'm different.

934
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I'm the alternative

935
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
man. Well, I am.

936
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
Well, I fucking am though.

937
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
I clearly

938
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
do not in the majority

939
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
on this question.

940
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Yeah, I mean, I don't particularly find her

941
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
attractive either.

942
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Okay, but a lot of

943
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
people do. Right.

944
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Clearly.

945
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
And I don't know.

946
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
So what if I'm like

947
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
well, hey, I disagree

948
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
not even on like a fucking platform.

949
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
I think it was entirely a vibe thing.

950
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
To criticize someone's opinion

951
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
it's like, ooh, what did they say?

952
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
There's some intrigue there. To criticize someone's

953
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
looks

954
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
is just sort of like a dead end

955
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
and then, I don't know

956
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
it gets

957
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
people's cogs turning as to why you would

958
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
bring that up

959
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
and then they come up with like some

960
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
conclusions and they're like, Ben, are you like

961
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
a misogynist or something?

962
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
Or like, what's going on here?

963
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
And then you're like, you have to defend yourself

964
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
and then it's like, it gets heated

965
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
because like

966
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
the reason like, yes, you don't need to

967
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
find people attractive and

968
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
isn't it interesting that this person

969
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
who everyone thinks is attractive, I don't think is attractive?

970
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
I'm, you know

971
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
I don't know. It's just sort of

972
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
I see why there was a big storm

973
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
but I don't think there's really anything to talk about

974
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
with it.

975
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Well, I'm sorry to waste your time.

976
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
No, I'm not wasting

977
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
you're not wasting time right now.

978
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
I'm just, I'm just

979
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
I don't know.

980
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
I don't know.

981
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
I just really hate, I just really hate

982
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
how she looks. I hate it.

983
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
I do. I feel that strong about it.

984
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
I'm sorry.

985
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
It's irritating.

986
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Because it partially

987
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
to a large extent it's not

988
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
necessarily like

989
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
what she's shaped like.

990
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
It's like the face that she makes

991
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
which to some extent is like a choice.

992
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
It's like an affect that she's putting on.

993
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
There's something about the way

994
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
the way that she's communicating with me

995
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
through the facial expression she makes

996
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
which rubs me the wrong way

997
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
and pisses me off.

998
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
That's not the entire, that's not the entire thing

999
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
but that's part of it.

1000
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I just don't like

1001
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
it doesn't really affect my thoughts

1002
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
how or why exactly

1003
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
you dislike her face.

1004
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Right. Cause I don't know

1005
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
how I don't have the same reaction

1006
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
and there's really just nothing for me to say about it.

1007
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
I feel like that's the reason

1008
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
that there was

1009
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
discourse because it's like

1010
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
what does everyone say to this? I don't know.

1011
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Well now I'm embarrassed because

1012
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
if anyone in my discord

1013
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
who is listening to this will be like

1014
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
oh I was there for that haha man

1015
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,320
that really got under Ben's skin haha

1016
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
rent free LeMau

1017
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
and I don't know

1018
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
you're right. Correct.

1019
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
That's it.

1020
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Again.

1021
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
Well okay then

1022
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
mission accomplished I guess.

1023
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
I'm sorry

1024
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
I apologize

1025
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
for wasting everyone's time with that.

1026
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
LeMau

1027
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
All right here's

1028
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
I got um

1029
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
actually I'm gonna do an announcement actually

1030
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
I'm gonna do an announcement for a brand new thing

1031
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
that has been cooking

1032
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
over on

1033
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
a brand new discord

1034
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Whoa what?

1035
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Doon Koon

1036
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
member of the pro and on

1037
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
cast and fan of

1038
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
the PCP allegedly

1039
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
quote unquote

1040
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
I was in my stream

1041
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
talking about stuff talking about boobies

1042
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
haha that's what I like doing haha

1043
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
haha I was talking about

1044
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
big boobies and mummy milkers and that was

1045
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
you know it was a pretty funny idea

1046
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
it was pretty epic it sounds like an epic time

1047
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
it's like a podcast like the big boobie mummy milkers

1048
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
and I tweeted it as well

1049
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
and then people said are you a big boobie

1050
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
or a mummy milker

1051
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
and this sort of spread into

1052
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
like an idea was planted

1053
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
at Doon Koon's head

1054
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
and she

1055
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
she's going by she for the moment

1056
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
she decided to make

1057
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
a clone of endless war

1058
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
where it was

1059
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
but boobs instead

1060
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
because the endless war source code

1061
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
is just available so you can take it

1062
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
you can edit it and now

1063
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
there is a brand new text based

1064
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
mmo that you can play right now

1065
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
in your discord browser called

1066
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
big boobies mummy milkers

1067
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
haha

1068
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
you go on you go

1069
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
into the server you can

1070
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
wait is do you get milk

1071
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
no you get breast size

1072
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
so here's how it works

1073
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
here's how it works you go

1074
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
you go in you have to

1075
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
drag in the list into a big boobie

1076
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
a big boobie or mummy milker

1077
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
a faction

1078
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
factions are exactly the same

1079
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
there's no difference at all

1080
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
and then

1081
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
oh wait no it's not

1082
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
there's not no difference because the big boobies

1083
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
can jiggle

1084
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
like exclamation point jiggle

1085
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
and the mummy milkers can

1086
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
exclamation point squirt

1087
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
and you know

1088
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
understandable

1089
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
I'm with you so far

1090
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
then you have to go to the titty bar

1091
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
and you have to exclamation point squeeze

1092
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
to gain breast size

1093
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
I don't really know

1094
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
squeeze what

1095
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
you go to the titty bar and you squeeze titties

1096
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
your own

1097
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
I don't you know it doesn't make any sense

1098
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
but it's just mining with reskin

1099
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
so instead of getting slim you get breast size

1100
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
you could check your size

1101
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
exclamation point size

1102
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
and you think your breast size is a number

1103
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
it just keeps getting bigger

1104
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
okay sure

1105
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
every so often you get a

1106
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
mutation I mean fetish

1107
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,320
and you get fetishes

1108
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
for squeezing

1109
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
sometimes you do

1110
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
all of the stuff that

1111
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
is like in endless war in mining

1112
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
has been turned into a boob thing

1113
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
so

1114
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
occasionally you will find an extra large boob

1115
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
and you will squeeze it and you get more

1116
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
boob size from that

1117
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
other times it will be like

1118
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
boob minesweeper

1119
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
where you have to decide which

1120
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
it's a

1121
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
there's like a very difficult to unhook bra

1122
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
and you have to use the coordinates

1123
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
like minesweeper

1124
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
to get it

1125
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
to open it

1126
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
it's booby themed endless war it's called endless expansion

1127
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
big boobies mummy milkers

1128
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
it's free and open and you can join it

1129
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
and there's boobs

1130
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
in it

1131
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
you can post images

1132
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
wait a minute

1133
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
and there's boobs in it

1134
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
there's boobs in it

1135
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
no shit

1136
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
I'm so glad that endless war has finally

1137
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
experienced the

1138
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,320
staple of all open source software

1139
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
which is pointless ridiculous forking

1140
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
it's finally happened

1141
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
yo that's fucking based

1142
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
yo pop that discord

1143
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
link in the description

1144
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
I will

1145
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
not open like as we're recording it

1146
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
but it will be open like in a day

1147
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
so I will do it then

1148
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
then how do you know any of this

1149
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
cause I've been in there testing it

1150
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
man on the inside

1151
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
I am the big boober

1152
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
duncun is the mummy milker

1153
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
we're taking over endless war

1154
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
everybody's gonna say

1155
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
ever since munchie left endless war

1156
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
sucks I'm gonna go to big boobies mummy milkers instead

1157
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
duncun just wants to take everything

1158
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
just wants to take everything we've got

1159
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
first

1160
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
the pcp

1161
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
superseded by the pro and on cast

1162
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
and now endless war

1163
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
obliterated by endless expansion

1164
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
big boobies mummy milkers

1165
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
I can see it now

1166
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
can't we have anything

1167
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
not with this kind of performance

1168
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
well I can I have like a

1169
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
50% stake in the big boobies mummy milkers franchise

1170
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
I'm taking you down

1171
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
with all of us

1172
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
it goes down together

1173
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
yeah yeah yeah

1174
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320

well

1178
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
sad

1179
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
you know in titanic if jack had big boobies

1180
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
he would be alright

1181
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
they probably would have kept him warm too

1182
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
maybe we solve all the problems in the world

1183
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
that's just what I think

1184
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
yeah

1185
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320

and not exclamation

1194
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
question mark

1195
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
did I say exclamation point every time

1196
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
it's question mark

1197
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
like gib being like that's my symbol

1198
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
from like pony

1199
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
alright that's debts deep lore

1200
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
yeah

1201
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
that's way down on the pcp lore iceberg

1202
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
actually it's probably not

1203
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
that's probably like second or third level

1204
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
yeah

1205
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I've been thinking about a pcp

1206
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
iceberg thing I think somebody did make one

1207
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
they did

1208
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
a long time ago

1209
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
in the last rfck contest

1210
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
I think it was

1211
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
vintage

1212
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
no fuck

1213
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
oh god

1214
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
the shy guy

1215
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
he starts with a v

1216
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
oh no I feel so stupid

1217
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
yeah venice

1218
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
made the iceberg chart

1219
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
which was

1220
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
we spent a long time

1221
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
going over it

1222
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
even me and munchie didn't know

1223
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
some of the things on there

1224
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
but we also thought that some of them were weirdly placed

1225
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
and we had a good round of discussion

1226
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
I would move this here

1227
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
and I would move that there

1228
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
wait is this what I think it is

1229
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
what else would be on this level

1230
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
on this level

1231
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
those things are fun

1232
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
it was a rousing good time

1233
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
a rousing

1234
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
it was a rousing good time

1235
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
oh yes

1236
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
oh yes

1237
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
what about the pcp one

1238
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
I don't know

1239
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
I was just going to say

1240
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
I could think of a few

1241
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
pretty deep

1242
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
how deep do you think the sly 2

1243
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
pcp secret episode is

1244
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
wait

1245
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
the sly 2

1246
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
is that

1247
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
it's a secret pcp episode that happened in a

1248
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
call when I was playing sly 2

1249
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
and I uploaded it

1250
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
it's so secret I don't even know that

1251
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I don't know about this

1252
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
this is a deep shit

1253
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
when I was in the pcp chat

1254
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
I was recording a lets play

1255
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
or streaming or something

1256
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
I think I was streaming

1257
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
and then people funneled in

1258
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
I think digi was first

1259
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
and it became a pcp episode

1260
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
like unofficial

1261
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
I don't remember this

1262
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
but it sounds like something that would happen

1263
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
people are going to go look for that now

1264
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
sounds pretty cool

1265
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
people are going to go look for that

1266
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
and relive the glory days

1267
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
wow

1268
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
I guess that would be pretty

1269
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
deep then

1270
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
I'm trying to think of something

1271
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
but even that is

1272
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
something that is on the internet

1273
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
and some people were probably

1274
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
there for it and saw it and remember it

1275
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
I'm trying to think of something that no one would know

1276
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
my innermost fear

1277
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
yeah

1278
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
or like

1279
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
maybe some throw away detail

1280
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
from some

1281
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
radcon1 vlog or something

1282
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
I don't know

1283
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
I think to qualify it does have to be

1284
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
like posted somewhere

1285
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
yeah

1286
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
they wouldn't have known about it

1287
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
unless it was posted or at least streamed

1288
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
the thing with those things is

1289
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
obviously we're involved with the pcp

1290
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
we know everything that we were in

1291
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
or at least we were there

1292
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
when it happened

1293
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
but the viewers

1294
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
not every viewer of

1295
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
the procrastinators watches

1296
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
or listens to every single episode

1297
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
and every single related video

1298
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
of all of our stuff

1299
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
can you imagine

1300
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
it's feasible that

1301
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
something has only been seen by

1302
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
60 people or is remembered

1303
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
by 60 people and maybe got 100 views

1304
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
it's just a stupid little vlog

1305
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
but in it is a secret moment

1306
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
that those like

1307
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
few can remember

1308
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
probably I've forgotten as well

1309
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
I don't remember what happened

1310
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
back then

1311
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
I don't even remember what happened

1312
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
do you remember

1313
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
do you remember when it was

1314
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
radcon2

1315
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
and Davoo went around asking everybody

1316
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
their opinion on Undertale

1317
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
after it had been out for a year

1318
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
I remember the video

1319
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
I don't think he asked me

1320
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
but I remember the video

1321
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
oh for sure

1322
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
oh there's things I filmed

1323
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
there's things I filmed at radcon1

1324
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
that I never made into a video

1325
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
there's like

1326
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
an image or two

1327
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
that was posted

1328
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
during the time that was being filmed

1329
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
but I didn't do anything

1330
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
with the footage

1331
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
I was going to use it for something

1332
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
because when I had like my

1333
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
penguin mask and my green screen suit

1334
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
and I was crawling through

1335
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
the Digi's house

1336
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,320
attic

1337
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
like towards the camera

1338
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
I was going to be spooky

1339
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
I don't

1340
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
I have trouble remembering

1341
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
what happened at radcon1 vs radcon2

1342
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
the way to remember

1343
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
is that radcon1

1344
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
was only a few of us

1345
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,320
radcon2 had Jeff

1346
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
Munchy

1347
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
and Tom were you at radcon1

1348
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
I was not at radcon1

1349
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
I was at radcon2 though

1350
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
wait so who was at radcon1

1351
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
that was like right when I moved in

1352
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
with digi right so I must have been there

1353
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
you were the

1354
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
dvoo was dvoo there

1355
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
I believe dvoo was there

1356
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
in radcon1

1357
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
I think so

1358
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
yeah you guys were there around the same time

1359
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
so it was dvoo, digi

1360
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
it was Nate, Ben, me, digi and Jesse

1361
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
I think I was the only one who really wasn't there

1362
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
and mage obviously

1363
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
and Munchy

1364
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
I didn't know at the time

1365
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,320
whether he was officially on the PCP

1366
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
ooo yeah I don't know

1367
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
because radcon1 and radcon2

1368
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
happened like a few months after each other

1369
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
radcon2016 was like

1370
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
autumn or winter

1371
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
of 2016

1372
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
wait okay

1373
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,320
this is gonna

1374
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,320
this is probably gonna be really annoying

1375
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
to someone who's listening and knows all this

1376
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,320
I can't believe these guys don't remember

1377
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,320
their own fucking lives but whatever

1378
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
because

1379
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
Munchy joined the PCP

1380
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,320
after monkey did

1381
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,320
and monkey was not a member during radcon1

1382
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,320
and 2

1383
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,320
but munchy appeared

1384
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
it was at radcon2 so like

1385
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
what's up with that

1386
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
munchy was at radcon2

1387
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
do you not remember get the pizza now

1388
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,320
wait no that was radcon3

1389
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
I remember he was there but was he not a member

1390
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
he was at that point I believe so

1391
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
that's why he was there

1392
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,320
I think Jeff was there

1393
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,320
yeah Jeff was there

1394
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
munchy was not

1395
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,320
am I wrong did munchy join after munchy

1396
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
munchy joined after munchy

1397
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,320
and they were very close

1398
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
similar at the same time

1399
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
but only by a few months I think it was just

1400
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,320
after radcon2

1401
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
that munchy went to Digi's house

1402
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
and they did let's plays or something

1403
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,320
and then after that

1404
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
but he wasn't in the PCP yet

1405
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,320
he just was adjacent

1406
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
okay

1407
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,320
oh wait Jesse, Jesse was at radcon1

1408
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,320
or just 2

1409
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
yeah he was at radcon2 and 1

1410
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
and 1 okay

1411
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
the things that

1412
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,320
I don't believe in the weeb

1413
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
was that

1414
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
I do remember believe in the weeb that was radcon2

1415
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
that was definitely radcon2

1416
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
what even the fuck was radcon1

1417
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,320
I remember we had Digi had

1418
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
like the

1419
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
3 dimensional 360 camera

1420
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
and they wanted to try it out

1421
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
yeah

1422
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
and we had a PCP recorded like that

1423
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
radcon1

1424
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
was it was just like

1425
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
it was basically just like

1426
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Ben and DeVoo are moving in

1427
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,320
just like anyone who

1428
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
wants to should just come

1429
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
and hang out for a while right

1430
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
that seemed like a general premise yeah

1431
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
yeah yeah the first

1432
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
radcon was like what if we didn't go to bronycon

1433
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
and then the second radcon was

1434
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,320
let's try and fund

1435
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
another one

1436
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
by doing this thing no the second one was

1437
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,320
by accident like we're doing the plebe and the weeb

1438
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320
but we could also fund another radcon

1439
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
and then the third one was like everyone should

1440
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
just come for that anyway

1441
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,320
the third radcon was like actually the first

1442
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
like funded radcon to happen

1443
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,320
yeah yeah

1444
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
radcon3 was when like

1445
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,320
the concept of radcon really

1446
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
solidified I think

1447
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
um

1448
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
like yeah before that it was all just like

1449
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
well we're doing this other thing so why

1450
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
not

1451
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
all just get together and I don't know

1452
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,320
whatever happens happens lol

1453
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
and then we had um we had like

1454
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
was it like radcon3 and a half

1455
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,320
or whatever at like did you

1456
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,320
place in Boston yeah that was

1457
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
yeah

1458
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
I recall yeah I came

1459
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
because everyone was going there and I was like

1460
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
I don't want to miss out so I got a little plane

1461
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,320
take it and I flew over

1462
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,320
um it was fun seeing everyone

1463
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
no it was it was fun

1464
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,320
we just sort of hung out in the room and went

1465
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
to eat a couple times

1466
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
yeah I went out with munchie

1467
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
and

1468
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
got Chinese buffet and it was

1469
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
cold outside I remember

1470
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
very little and we played pokemon go

1471
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
or something did we

1472
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
did we go eat in like Chinatown

1473
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,320
or something I think we did

1474
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,320
ikon was the I think

1475
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,320
appeared for a little while

1476
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
unless I'm thinking of some other time

1477
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,320
wait was that the time with the stinky tofu

1478
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
it may have been

1479
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
I think it might have been yeah

1480
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
no no

1481
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
no maybe

1482
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
there was a lot of like small gatherings around that

1483
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
time and then

1484
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,320
culminated with radcon 3.5

1485
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
I don't remember if that was the time with the

1486
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,320
stinky tofu or if it was when

1487
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
I came up from Georgia

1488
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
with ikon

1489
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
and then we got that fucking stinky tofu

1490
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
oh yeah it was it was definitely when you came

1491
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,320
up because you were telling the story of the stinky

1492
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
tofu when we went to that

1493
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
same Chinese place again

1494
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
during radcon 3.5

1495
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
wait but

1496
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
no no no but

1497
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,320
whatever it was called that was

1498
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
before I came back up

1499
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
from no was I living

1500
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
in Massachusetts again for that

1501
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
oh okay I got him switched I got him

1502
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
switched okay

1503
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,320
because that was when we had Nate come up

1504
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
and everything because we were talking about

1505
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
where did you was going to move and if Nate was

1506
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
going to move with them and there was a whole

1507
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
had that big long sit down we were talking about

1508
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
Tulsa versus wherever the fuck

1509
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
and it led literally nowhere

1510
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320
imagine

1511
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
oh that sucks that whole thing

1512
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
sucks there was no there was no

1513
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320
point to it it was a long conversation

1514
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
that was very circular and

1515
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
not much headway was made unfortunately

1516
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
I think I just left to go

1517
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
and like

1518
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
steal

1519
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
the cock cast girls avocado

1520
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
and maybe get drunk I don't remember

1521
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,320
oh yeah they had a

1522
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
thing they did a thing down there

1523
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
yeah there's a whole separate podcast going on

1524
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
downstairs while we were upstairs

1525
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
it was better it was better down there

1526
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
I got really mad at Jack

1527
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
Jack 3 sucked and I played it and I hated it

1528
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
no Jack 3 is good because you can nuke the whole city

1529
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
Jack 3 is bad because it's too linear

1530
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
you have to do all the missions in order

1531
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
and you can't explore anything it sucks

1532
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
yeah but you can make the missile

1533
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
that goes

1534
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,320
and everyone turns into like a grease

1535
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
mirror on the ground

1536
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
yeah but that's way later it's not fun to

1537
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
like speedrun into that point you have to do

1538
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
so much bullshit before you can actually have fun

1539
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
fine

1540
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
fine there's a fine line

1541
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
just take this from me

1542
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320

1543
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320

1545
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320

1547
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320

1553
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,320

1555
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,320

1556
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320

1558
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
no shut up die

1559
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,320
I watched a movie

1560
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,320
this week I never do that

1561
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
I never ever do that

1562
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
but I was um

1563
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
the books are gonna be here and I'm a figure in

1564
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
like might as well get ready for that so I've been addressing

1565
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
envelopes I have like so many

1566
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,320
uh fucking

1567
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,320
I addressed 300 envelopes

1568
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
and I think it might have been a waste because

1569
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
like there were like 300 and change

1570
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
people who like made orders

1571
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,320
uh so I

1572
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,320
there were like 330 or something

1573
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
and so I addressed 300

1574
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,320
thinking like okay

1575
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
probably there will be a few people who don't like

1576
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
reply to the survey and maybe like even

1577
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,320
a couple that like forget that they ordered maybe

1578
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
you know I can't get it to them but like

1579
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
you know I'll have 300

1580
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
will be like plenty but like

1581
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,320
less than like like only like

00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,320
160 have like actually replied

I should have done Nate's envelope but Nate didn't

1608
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,320
actually answer the survey he just like sent

1609
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
me a message saying like

1610
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,320
this is my address I don't know why he did

1611
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,320
that but he did so

1612
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
I gotta do his too

1613
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,320
but anyway I was

1614
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,320
I was doing all these envelopes and it took me like you know

1615
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,320
it took me a long time well I'm very meticulous

1616
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,320
took me like

1617
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,320
a couple days like several hours work each day

1618
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,320
to get it all done

1619
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,320
so I was like so I put on a movie

1620
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320
and I put on this old movie

1621
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,320
that I had heard of before someone

1622
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,320
I was I was watching a youtuber

1623
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,320
called Jose who does these long

1624
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,320
videos about like

1625
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
old sitcoms like 90s sitcoms

1626
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,320
sort of like breaking that he did

1627
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
he's one about Roseanne he was about

1628
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,320
married with children he has one about

1629
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
uh

1630
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
there's another one whatever and I really

1631
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,320
like these videos and

1632
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,320
he I was listening to the married with children

1633
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,320
one and he he's talking

1634
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,320
about one episode and where like two

1635
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,320
couples like argue and he compares

1636
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,320
to this movie

1637
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,320
who's afraid of Virginia Woolf and I had

1638
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
heard of that movie but I didn't know what it was about

1639
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,320
but he compared it to this episode of

1640
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
married with children and I was like

1641
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
what would a movie that's just about like

1642
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,320
two couples just sort of

1643
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,320
like interact like talking to each other

1644
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,320
about stuff be like and I went

1645
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,320
and I watched it and it was great

1646
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,320
it's a great fucking little

1647
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,320
screenplay and it has

1648
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,320
awoken in me a desire

1649
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,320
for more movies where nothing happens

1650
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,320
um and just people talk about

1651
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
stuff uh because I really

1652
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,320
like I really liked that I really

1653
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
like who's afraid of Virginia Woolf I really like

1654
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,320
12 angry men I really liked

1655
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
my dinner with Andre only there was more media

1656
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,320
available where people just talked and nothing

1657
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,320
happened if only people could easily create

1658
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,320
those things

1659
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,320
if only there were so there were yeah

1660
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,320
hmm where could I find this untapped market there

1661
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,320
just waiting I'm sure who

1662
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
knows who knows

1663
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,320
but I made I made a tweet earlier being like

01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,320
recommend me recommend me

1665
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
more shit we're just like

1666
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,320
nothing happens and it's just about people

1667
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,320
talking about stuff because I like

1668
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
it and I've gotten quite a few

1669
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
uh Twitter recommendations so

1670
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
maybe I will go and look into some of those

1671
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,320
uh soon

1672
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,320

haha haha what are they gonna say

1678
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,320
it was I was glued to the screen

1679
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
but not really because I was

1680
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,320
just listening I was mostly

1681
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,320
listening but I still completely understood

1682
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
what was going on it's like you know is it

1683
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,320

1692
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,320
and like watching the movie made me feel

1693
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
drunk which made me happy

a real actual thing that people

put effort into is is a good

1716
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,320
nobody does it I don't do it

01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,320
nearly enough I mean

1718
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
I love

1719
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
long

1720
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
boring YouTube videos

1721
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
like the one I do like the ones

01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320

1723
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
about sitcoms I

will watch every fucking uh

1725
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,320
summoning salts like history

1726
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,320
of a speed run video

1727
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,320
and like other channels that do the same

1728
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,320
thing I'll just put that shit on auto

1729
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,320
play and just let it go

1730
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,320
um I am I can

1731
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
talk about Bill and Ted

1732
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,320
yeah that sort of stuff

1733
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,320
I like it too but I also

1734
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,320
don't like it I know that I don't like

1735
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,320
it because I don't remember it

1736
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,320
there's a occasionally I remember a video

1737
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,320
and be like god that was a really interesting video

1738
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,320
I want to watch it again sometimes

1739
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,320
it's good some sometimes

1740
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,320
like I'll put something like that on and be like okay

1741
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,320
this will be on while I work and then I'll get

1742
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,320
work done and it's like yeah cool

1743
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,320
and other times I'll be like I'll put this on

1744
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,320
while I work and then I'll get distracted

1745
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,320
or I'll be a few but you know

1746
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,320
maybe that's not the video's fault

1747
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,320
right like maybe it doesn't I was just

1748
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
didn't wasn't feeling focused that day

1749
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,320
and and I would have gotten distracted

1750
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,320
by something

1751
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,320
do you do you always I guess it's just

1752
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
kind of part of my workflow now

1753
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,320
do you structure your days in any

1754
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,320
fashion do you like have like

1755
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,320
work days and like relaxed days

1756
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,320
no

1757
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
because that's how I

1758
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,320
I feel like it's a good way to get over

1759
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,320
the the random

1760
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
not being able to focus

1761
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,320
is allowing yourself to do

1762
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
whatever you want

1763
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,320
to relax and not work specifically

1764
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,320
not to work on some days

1765
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,320
so that other days are more like

1766
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,320
you wake up and you know what you're supposed to do

1767
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,320
even if

1768
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,320
even if like it's like a creative

1769
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,320
thing and you're setting this wrecking

1770
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,320
your brain like how do I do this

1771
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,320
and you don't get a lot done it's still

1772
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,320
like better than

1773
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
getting distracted and watching some

1774
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,320
YouTube videos I feel

1775
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,320
every day is a work day

1776
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,320
unless I have plans

1777
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,320
which is rare but occasionally

1778
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,320
happens and then that's a

1779
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,320
not work day

1780
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,320
but then it's like okay well

1781
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,320
every day is technically a work day

1782
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,320
but I don't actually

1783
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,320
work on every

1784
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,320
quote unquote work day because

1785
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,320
I feel like every day

1786
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
well yeah I mean that's exactly why

1787
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,320
I like structure them

1788
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,320
to be like not everywhere

1789
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,320
every day is a work day because if every day

1790
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,320
is a work day for me at least

1791
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,320
um it causes me

1792
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,320
like

1793
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,320
to do work

1794
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,320
really badly where I don't

1795
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,320
build up any momentum and I just feel bad

1796
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
that I hadn't done enough work on all the

1797
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,320
days instead of feeling good

1798
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
that I did a lot of work on like two of the

1799
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
days

1800
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
yeah

1801
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,320
because there's that thing where you build up momentum

1802
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,320
you start work which is the hard part

1803
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,320
and then if you're still working for hours

1804
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,320
and hours you can get a lot

1805
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,320
more done in that time because you're already

1806
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,320
going you're already moving

1807
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,320
yeah the initial momentum is the hardest part for sure

1808
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,320
when I yeah

1809
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,320
like um the times when I've

1810
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,320
been most productive or when I'm like

1811
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,320
when I'll have a period where I'm like

1812
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,320
wake up start immediately

1813
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,320
on the thing that I've

1814
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,320
been working on lately

1815
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,320
you know kind of go through the day

1816
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,320
no take breaks maybe but like you know pretty much

1817
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,320
work on it and like go to sleep

1818
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,320
thinking like tomorrow okay

1819
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,320
I made headway tomorrow

1820
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
I gotta work on this part of it

1821
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,320
go to sleep wake up like

1822
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
okay gotta work on that

1823
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
thing and then start again immediately

1824
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,320
that clarity is like so

1825
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,320
fucking hard for me

1826
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,320
I have so many projects I'm trying to do and it's like

1827
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
which one do I work on and it's like just picking one

1828
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,320
is so difficult because it's like which one

1829
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,320
is the most optimal which will help

1830
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,320
my quote-unquote career

1831
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
it's the worst question to ask

1832
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
it's terrible

1833
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,320
and I'm cursed by it all the time

1834
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,320
the best answer to which one is the most

1835
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,320
efficient is which everyone is the

1836
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
least efficient because at least you'll be doing something

1837
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,320
oh it's a never ending

1838
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
never ending pain never ending pain

1839
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
you just gotta choose one even if it's

1840
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,320
the worst possible choice it's better than

1841
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,320
not making one that's that's what I think

1842
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,320
oh I mean it's it's completely true

1843
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,320
but I'm just a

1844
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
fucking

1845
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,320
idiot

1846
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,320
I have um

1847
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,320
I have a have a couple things

1848
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,320
I could be working on right now I have

1849
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,320
I have

1850
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,320
the the sonichu 102 lecture

1851
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,320
which needs a little more editing

1852
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,320
and I have to make

1853
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,320
some do some shit with that and then I have

1854
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,320
the um the next slime and punishment thing

1855
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,320
which I've kind of started on

1856
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,320
uh that's

1857
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,320
yeah I've mostly been working on that

1858
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,320
as like a distraction from the

1859
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,320
from the the the video because

1860
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,320
like I haven't I haven't decided

1861
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,320
like what exactly I want to

1862
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,320
do with the end of that that video

1863
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,320
and I kind of just don't want to think about it

1864
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,320
because it's because making decisions is hard

1865
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,320
whereas like with the slime and punishment thing

1866
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,320
I'm like okay I have a pretty I have a vague idea

1867
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,320
of how I want some things

1868
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,320
to look in that so I'm just gonna

1869
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,320
kind of uh you know I can just

1870
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,320
like do some of that bull just fuck around

1871
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,320
with that and like you know it doesn't have to

1872
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,320
it doesn't have to

1873
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,320
I don't have to really commit to very much

1874
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,320
just kind of chip away at just like a thing or two here

1875
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,320
and there that's all you know

1876
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,320
finishing that is like a future bends

1877
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,320
problem whereas like

1878
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,320
with the sonichu video it's like I could

1879
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,320
finish this like right now

1880
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,320
and then that would be present bends problem

1881
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,320
is like you know the decisions

1882
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,320
I made with regard to that and I want

1883
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,320
my problems to be in the future

1884
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,320
not in the present

1885
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,320
you know that makes sense

1886
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,320
yeah I I know

1887
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,320
but I don't

1888
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,320
accept it I will kill you

1889
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,320
Ben say okay

1890
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,320
okay oh no

1891
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,320
Gib has complete authority to kill

1892
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,320
us now because you have

1893
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,320
completed an entire fucking

1894
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,320
ridiculous comic and like

1895
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,320
no time at all and you're already starting a second one

1896
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,320
and that godly power is just too

1897
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,320
much for me I can't stand to look at you

1898
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,320
the bright pure energy emanating

1899
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,320
from your form burns

1900
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,320
my mortal flesh

1901
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,320
hmm yeah

1902
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,320
I did

1903
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,320
I did a good comic one

1904
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,320
time I did that once

1905
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,320
kind of you only get like 30

1906
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,320
days of like a credit for

1907
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,320
the glow and then it just fades

1908
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,320
you gotta earn it again it's unfortunate but

1909
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,320
I don't make the rules

1910
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,320
the corona the vapor comes out

1911
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,320
I'll see the book and I'll be like

1912
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,320
oh my god I remember the vapors

1913
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,320
wow this came out like when I was

1914
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,320
two years old I just said corona

1915
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,320
meaning like a halo without

1916
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,320
like not not like the virus not like

1917
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,320
the virus that's not we're demonetized

1918
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,320
that's too late sorry I didn't mean to I

1919
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,320
didn't mean no okay okay

1920
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,320
vapors came out

1921
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,320
when I was you know

1922
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,320
when I was in elementary school

1923
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
I was reading the vapors and I thought

1924
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,320
when's the next one coming out and it

1925
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,320
never did the end

1926
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,320
and then I decided I would make them

1927
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,320
haha

1928
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,320

for me from that I made and I was like yeah

1955
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,320
I love that and they were like I made

1956
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,320
that I made that back when I was in high school

1957
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,320
and now I'm in and now I'm in college

1958
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,320
and I was like oh my god

1959
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,320
oh that was you that I'm

1960
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,320
so old Jesus

1961
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,320
oh it's the worst the worst

1962
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
panic is setting in

1963
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
I literally can't stand

1964
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
that thought

1965
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,320
everybody's got down to youngster

1966
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,320
gross disgusting

1967
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,320
fucking younglings

1968
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,320
I just feel like an outdated human I feel like

1969
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
I'm running like old firmware and I can't be

1970
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,320
updated and it's just like

1971
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
I can't interface with

1972
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,320
social.exe whatever

1973
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,320
exists now the new version

1974
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,320
I'm not I'm not sure

1975
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,320
I'm not sure which is a scarier

1976
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,320
thought like the thought of being

1977
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
like

1978
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
the thought of being like I'm I'm here

1979
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,320
you know I continue

1980
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,320
I continue to like age

1981
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,320
whereas it feels like the user base

1982
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,320
of the internet is not

1983
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,320
meaningfully aging there is a certain

1984
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,320
like sort of young adultness to it

1985
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
that is constant yeah and I

1986
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,320
am becoming progressively older in comparison

1987
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
to are they gonna like force us to go on

1988
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,320
to Facebook exclusively at some point is that what

1989
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,320
happens but but like

1990
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
that's a scary thought or there's

1991
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,320
like oh no I do age

1992
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,320
out of it and I go somewhere else like where

1993
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,320
the old people go no I think what happens

1994
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
I don't know which is worse the new internet

1995
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
just starts and it's gonna be new apps and things

1996
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
that we don't understand like tiktok's already doing that

1997
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,320
like although the young young kids

1998
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,320
are on tiktok you know like the 15 16 17

1999
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,320
year olds like people who understand the new

2000
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,320
new new internet

2001
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,320
tiktok is not like a replacement for other

2002
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
social media it's like the biggest app out

2003
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
right now

2004
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,320
I feel like there's probably a new tiktok already

2005
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,320
that we're not aware of probably there probably

2006
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,320
will be and then tiktok

2007
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,320
there's the one that there's the one that donald trump

2008

now you've you fumbled

2088
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,320
one joke and that you only get one

2089
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,320
everybody gets one you're done

2090
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,320

01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,320
to the boomer farms with you

2092
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
but what about um

2093
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,320
uh

2094
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,320
the arrow in the knee do you remember that one

2095
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,320
oh you're just digging your grave even further

2096
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,320
the cake

2097
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,320
maybe the cake was telling the truth

2098
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
the whole time

2099
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,320
there will probably be people

2100
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
listening to this podcast who barely know

2101
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
those references

2102
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,320
dude it's great I

2103
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
the whole thing about getting old is like

2104
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,320
yeah it's kind of sad you know the grave

2105
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,320
and all that whatever cool

2106
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,320
but one thing I have found

2107
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
increasingly funny is when I

2108
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,320
realized that somebody is old

2109
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,320
young younger than me

2110
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,320
which is often

2111
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,320
like they're like quite a lot younger

2112
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,320
then I it

2113
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,320
has become increasingly funny to just say

2114
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,320
things that were around when I was

2115
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,320
around like young and there are no longer

2116
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,320
around just to rub it in their

2117
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,320
faces they don't care in any way

2118
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
they have no reason to care but I just

2119
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
it's just really funny that I would just

2120
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,320
oh my god like you don't even

2121
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,320
know VHS and they don't

2122
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,320
laugh but I laugh no

2123
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,320
it's really funny I wouldn't laugh either

2124
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,320
it's only funny to me

2125
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,320
but it keeps getting funny I don't know about that

2126
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
it keeps getting funny like the older

2127
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,320
I get I'm just gonna say

2128
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,320
you don't even know what a cassette tape is

2129
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
so young and

2130
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,320
they're like shut up shut up

2131
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,320
there's oh oh my god

2132
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,320
oh my god that reminds me

2133
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,320
holy shit I almost

2134
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
I almost don't even want to talk about

2135
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,320
this because I feel like

2136
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
it

2137
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
ah fuck it you know what

2138
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,320
it's the podcast

2139
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,320
I was considering if maybe I should

2140
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
make like a video about this but I don't know what I would

2141
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
even say about it to be honest but um alright

2142
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,320
so my friend

2143
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,320
Hargadine

2144
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,320
sent me

2145
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,320
something in the mail

2146
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,320
and by sending me something in the mail

2147
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
I mean left it on my

2148
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,320
on my front porch

2149
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,320
and bolted in the dead of night

2150
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,320
um

2151
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,320
and you're not going

2152
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,320
you're not going to fucking believe what it is

2153
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,320
like I like a goat's head

2154
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,320
like what is it

2155
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,320
it's

2156
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,320
I can't say it

2157
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,320
I can't I can't

2158
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,320
I can't make myself verbalize it

2159
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,320
because it's beyond belief it defies

2160
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,320
description

2161
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
I feel like I'm in a dream

2162
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,320
is it a Benzite themed

2163
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,320
flashlight

2164
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,320

2165
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,320
no it's both volumes

2166
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,320
of the official Avril Lavigne

2167
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
manga

2168
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,320
what

2169
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,320
how

2170
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,320
what

2171
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,320
I've only read the first one

2172
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
but I'll get to the second one

2173
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,320
when was that so difficult to say

2174
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,320
I mean it's funny

2175
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,320
I don't know

2176
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,320
I just can't believe it

2177
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,320
I just can't believe

2178
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,320
that I'm so blessed to live in a world

2179
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,320
where I

2180
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,320
not only exist but I

2181
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,320
am the proud owner

2182
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
Avril Lavigne's make five wishes

2183
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,320

01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,320
wait what does it look like

2186
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
how good is the manga

2187
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
um

2188
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,320
does it feel Japanesey

2189
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
no not particularly no

2190
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,320
and it reads left to right

2191
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,320
so you know it pretty

2192
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
poser manga

2193
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
does it look like we're just how to draw manga books

2194
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,320
from the mid two thousands

2195
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
no it's

2196
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,320
it's a little manga ish

2197
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,320
but you can tell it was drawn by like a western artist

2198
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,320
and like it's fine it's okay

2199
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,320
uh um it's very

2200
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,320
what's the plot what's the story

2201
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,320
it's very rough it kinda looks

2202
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,320
like it was drawn with a ballpoint pen

2203
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,320
well uh some of the panels are

2204
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,320
very sketchy

2205
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
and in a way that is like

2206
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,320
you're telling me the guy who got contracted to make the

2207
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,320
Avril Lavigne manga didn't put his heart into it

2208
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,320
it's a

2209
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,320
it's a girl

2210
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,320
well it's a girl artist and a guy who like

2211
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,320
wrote the story okay

2212
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,320
I mean I guess I'll just say it

2213
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,320
it's drawn by Avril Lavigne herself

2214
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,320
no it's starring Avril Lavigne

2215
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,320
Avril Lavigne had nothing to do with it

2216
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,320
but she's starring in it

2217
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,320
and then created by Camilla

2218
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,320
Derrico and Joshua Disart

2219
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,320
um

2220
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,320
the okay the plot is

2221
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,320
and again I've only read half of it

2222
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,320
it's it's basically just a monkey's paw

2223
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
like it's literally a monkey's paw

2224
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
story about a like a

2225
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,320
girl who

2226
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,320
has like she's like a kid

2227
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,320
who's like sad about stuff

2228
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,320
and doesn't like school and whatever

2229
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,320
is unpopular or whatever

2230
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,320
and she finds this website

2231
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
called makefivewishes.com

2232
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,320
and she orders something and

2233
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,320
which what shows up is a demon

2234
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,320
and the demon has

2235
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,320
like these five horns and she can like

2236
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
make a wish and like crack it

2237
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,320
and it's literally just monkey's paw right

2238
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
she can make five wishes

2239
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,320
um and there's and stuff happens

2240
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,320
uh she's like oh what if I was

2241
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,320
I wish my boy would notice me

2242
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,320
like oh I wish this old man that I don't like

2243
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,320
would go away

2244
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,320
you know it's like oh that's

2245
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,320
bad that's uh you know bad things

2246
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
are gonna happen if you just make wishes really nearly like that kid

2247
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,320
uh the the only

2248
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,320
relevance to it at all

2249
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,320
is that she's a big Avril Lavigne fan

2250
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,320
and Avril Lavigne

2251
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,320
is like her imaginary friend

2252
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,320
and it's basically just like her

2253
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,320
her her better nature

2254
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
like when like she like

2255
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,320
is being cruel to an old man

2256
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,320
Avril Lavigne is like

2257
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,320
the voice of her conscience being like

2258
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
stop don't say these things

2259
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,320
and she's like yeah I hate you

2260
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
you're old and ugly and Avril's like oh

2261
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,320
you shouldn't have said that that's mean

2262
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,320
um it's just like D.W.

2263
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,320
and her imaginary friend from Arthur

2264
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,320
it's like these did

2265
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,320
did D.W. have an imaginary friend?

2266
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,320
right wasn't her name?

2267
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,320
oh yeah that rings a bell

2268
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
was never a huge Arthur fan

2269
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,320
well you missed that

2270
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,320
some good shit

2271
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,320
I mean I mean I read the Arthur books

2272
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,320
Arthur PCP lecture

2273
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,320
in second grade

2274
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
I mean we should make like Arthur analysis

2275
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,320
videos about each episode

2276
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,320
with our Arthur Sonas

2277
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,320
we have to make them drawn

2278
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,320
like as our actual selves in that uncanny

2279
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,320
valley style that Arthur uses for

2280
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,320
real life guest stars

2281
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,320
oh yeah

2282
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,320
I don't know what you're referring to

2283
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,320
look up Matt Damon Arthur

2284
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,320
I think Matt Damon was on Arthur at one point

2285
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,320
and he just looks like a real person

2286
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,320
face on an Arthur character

2287
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,320
it's very strange

2288
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
oh my fucking god

2289
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,320
that's how they had guest stars on Arthur

2290
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,320
they just look like

2291
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
that's so bad

2292
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,320
this can't be real why would they do this

2293
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
why would they fucking do this

2294
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,320
how else did you know

2295
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,320
it's Matt Damon

2296
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,320
what the fuck

2297
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,320
yeah it's

2298
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,320
interesting stylistic choices

2299
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,320
they just have fucking full human faces

2300
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,320
yeah it's very weird

2301
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,320
what the fuck

2302
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,320
this is

2303
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,320
bad

2304
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,320
it's so bad

2305
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,320
I can't believe this

2306
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,320
alright we gotta put that

2307
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,320
Ben it's strange to me

2308
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,320
cause I just you being you

2309
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,320
I would have pegged you as someone who

2310
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,320
watched Arthur I was at least familiar enough with it

2311
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
to know what this was about it just seems like

2312
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,320
something you would know about

2313
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,320
seems like in your real house

2314
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,320
no

2315
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,320
when I was a little kid in second grade

2316
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,320
we had the Arthur books

2317
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,320
in the school library and that's how I was familiar

2318
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,320
with them and then when I was a little older

2319
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,320
there was the show

2320
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,320
but I was like oh I read these books

2321
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,320
when I was in second grade first grade

2322
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,320
like that's like a little baby show

2323
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,320
so like I was like no I don't want to watch

2324
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,320
this Arthur cartoon that's for like

2325
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,320
fucking little baby childs

2326
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,320
but I think uh I don't know

2327
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,320
apparently it was kind of a pretty good kid show

2328
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,320
people seem to have mostly

2329
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,320
fond memories of it but I was like

2330
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,320
not interested I haven't seen it in so fucking long

2331
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,320
I have no idea if it's any good or not

2332
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,320
but they're just things like Matt Damon

2333
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,320
that are just burned into my brain

2334
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,320
I feel like it was pretty good

2335
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,320
somewhat funny

2336
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,320
and like wholesome

2337
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,320
family entertainment

2338
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,320
mm-hmm

2339
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,320
but I don't really recall it too much

2340
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,320
there's like a couple episodes that I remember seeing

2341
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,320
multiple times

2342
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,320
where like DW

2343
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,320
breaks the airplane and Arthur punches her

2344
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,320
and he gets in trouble

2345
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,320
you shouldn't punch your sister

2346
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,320
I don't know

2347
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,320
there are a couple like clips

2348
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,320
that like I guess they've made some pretty

2349
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,320
like

2350
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,320
meta jokes on the show

2351
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,320
every now and then and like I think I've seen

2352
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,320
a bunch of those on like YouTube

2353
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,320
whatever in a way that's like

2354
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,320
okay I'm sure every episode wasn't like

2355
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,320
that but you know these are kind of funny

2356
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,320
these are interesting

2357
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,320
I remember

2358
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,320
I mean I remember one joke from it

2359
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,320
that I really liked and it stuck with me for years and years

2360
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,320
you know there was the theme song

2361
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,320
every day when you walking down

2362
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,320
the street

2363
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,320
you get along with each other

2364
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,320
I remember they had the one episode where like

2365
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,320
they have a little sequence where

2366
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,320
brain they tell a little brain

2367
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,320
side story and they play like

2368
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,320
the brain version of the theme song

2369
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,320
and it's like

2370
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,320
every day when you walking down the street

2371
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,320
you stop and think

2372
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,320
hmm

2373
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,320
and that's it that's the end of the song

2374
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,320
like yes

2375
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,320
cool

2376
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,320
I stop and think

2377
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,320
I do

2378
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,320
brain does

2379
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,320
end of song

2380
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,320
incredible

2381
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,320
cool good job

2382
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,320
they did like a South Park parody right

2383
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,320
they did

2384
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,320
and that's pretty weird

2385
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,320
that Arthur would do that

2386
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,320
yeah

2387
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,320
if you're a little baby kid you shouldn't be watching South Park

2388
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,320
that's for grown

2389
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,320
that's for the parents who are sitting there watching like 17 episodes

2390
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,320
of Arthur with their kids in a row

2391
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,320
and there's a little bit of levity to like make sure

2392
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,320
they're still alive you know and they haven't died

2393
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,320
mm-hmm

2394
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,320
God bless you

2395
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,320
God bless you Arthur

2396
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,320
I am really perplexed

2397
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,320
by this line and the second image

2398
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,320
I posted tell Arthur

2399
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
this is Matt Damon

2400
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,320
hardfark saying tell Arthur

2401
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,320
he'll never eat lunch in this town again

2402
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,320
and he appears to be naked

2403
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,320
he does

2404
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,320
what is happening

2405
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,320
what is happening you just got to watch them

2406
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,320
to find out

2407
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,320
is that like in sync

2408
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,320
I believe it is

2409
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,320
or Backstreet Boys maybe one of the two

2410
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,320
wait

2411
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,320
did one of them have a black guy

2412
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,320
you know

2413
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,320
why is that one darker

2414
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,320
I don't remember I think they're

2415
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,320
I think they were already

2416
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
we're already in the thin line already

2417
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,320
let's take some risks

2418
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,320
I don't remember

2419
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,320
there being a darker one

2420
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,320
there are those pans but what do I know

2421
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,320
okay cool cool

2422
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,320
um

2423
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,320
alright

2424
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,320
how do we how do we fucking oh right

2425
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,320
the Avril manga

2426
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,320
I don't know should I make a video where I review

2427
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,320
Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Boys

2428
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,320
I haven't finished yet so I haven't said the ending

2429
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,320
you should do a

2430
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,320
like one-to-one like parody

2431
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,320
of a Likara review

2432
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,320
where you

2433
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,320
do the voice and then you talk about

2434
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,320
the Avril Lavigne manga

2435
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,320
and post it online

2436
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,320
and that's what you should do

2437
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,320
I

2438
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,320
I would probably do

2439
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,320
if I was going to ape anyone

2440
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,320
it would be Jenny Nicholson

2441
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,320
and I would probably do one where I just like

2442
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,320
sit on my bed

2443
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,320
and look into the camera

2444
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,320
because why not you know that's engaging

2445
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,320
I'm there I'm making eye contact

2446
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,320
with you the viewer it's quarantine

2447
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,320
you're starved for affection

2448
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,320
you're starved for connection and I'm giving it to you

2449
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,320
let's laugh together

2450
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,320
over the strange cultural artifact

2451
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,320
I really want to

2452
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,320
kind of like the idea of like a

2453
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,320
high up camera

2454
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,320
view

2455
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,320
sitting on his bed talking about

2456
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,320
Avril Lavigne did you say swole

2457
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,320
Benzane small Benzane like like

2458
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,320
oh small Benzane okay

2459
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,320
I prefer swole but

2460
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,320
but sure okay

2461
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,320
that's

2462
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,320
the unfortunate thing about

2463
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,320
Avril Lavigne's make five wishes

2464
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,320
is that

2465
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,320
like you know because Avril is such

2466
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,320
like a non entity

2467
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,320
it's not that weird

2468
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,320
like the story is not that weird and it's not like

2469
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,320
really it's not like

2470
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,320
super bad or like

2471
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,320
ridiculous it's just like pretty normal

2472
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,320
the actual story is pretty like

2473
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,320
okay it's a monkey's paw story

2474
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,320
about a sad girl oh well

2475
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,320
darn you're only you're only halfway done things

2476
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,320
could go off the rails

2477
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,320
let me see let me let me flip through

2478
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,320
and if I see anything going off the rails

2479
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,320
um

2480
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,320
could be a demon fight oh my god who knows

2481
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,320
is she is she going Super Saiyan

2482
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
I mean you've already have my attention

2483
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,320
is she

2484
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,320
oh my god she's like glowing

2485
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,320
there's got to be a metaphor

2486
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,320
she can't be literally glowing

2487
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,320
oh my god she's

2488
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,320
okay no I'm not I'm not gonna spoil

2489
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,320
myself I'm not gonna spoil myself I'm not gonna

2490
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,320

I'm gonna do a how to make gummies video

2496
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,320
um but you know what

2497
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,320
tragedy struck this week

2498
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,320
because I was like well

2499
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,320
I'm almost out of my worm syrup

2500
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,320
time to buy more powder

2501
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
and uh it's it's

2502
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,320
not it's not there it's not on Amazon I

2503
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,320
can't get it they're like out of stock

2504
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,320
and I don't there's no no nobody else sells

2505
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,320
it wasn't that a problem last time

2506
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,320
didn't you just have to wait well

2507
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,320
last time they stopped selling

2508
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,320
the syrup which is why I had to

2509
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,320
get the powder again and like re

2510
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,320
like reformulate the whole thing because

2511
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,320
I'm like okay well now I don't know the

2512
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,320
I don't know what the original

2513
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,320
like concentration was now I gotta figure that out from

2514
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,320
scratch and I finally did figure it out

2515
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,320
that was okay great problem solved

2516
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,320
I can do it with the powder instead

2517
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,320
but now the powder is gone too

2518
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,320
and I'm thinking like

2519
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,320
is this like is isomolta

2520
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,320
oligosaccharide just like a vanishing

2521
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,320
resource on earth and they're just like running

2522
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,320
out and there's no more like why

2523
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,320
please

2524
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,320
what am I gonna do

2525
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,320
and I'm thinking like you know they

2526
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,320
stopped selling those gummy like the

2527
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,320
gummies that have the same main ingredient that I

2528
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,320
was why I started making these they stopped

2529
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,320
selling those at Whole Foods I don't see them at Whole Foods anymore

2530
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,320
and I'm like did they just vanish is this

2531
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,320
have they just like stopped farming

2532
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,320
this powder does it just not get produced

2533
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,320
anymore like what what does the powder made

2534
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,320
of how does it get made

2535
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
the powder is made of um

2536
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,320
oh fuck what's the plant

2537
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,320

01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
chicory root

2539
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,320
um wait

2540
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,320
actually it's time to start a farm

2541
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,320
then tapioca it's it's

2542
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,320
it's soluble fiber extracted

2543
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,320
from tapioca okay

2544
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,320
just do that just get tapioca

2545
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,320

01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,320

and say hey how do I do this and then

2552
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,320

2553
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,320
and they'll say oh oh you

2554
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,320

01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,320
there's

2559
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,320
there's another

2560
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,320
thing there's a similar

2561
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,320
powder called inulin

2562
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,320
which I have some of that

2563
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,320
and I'm going to try using it

2564
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,320
instead and it might work

2565
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,320
like exactly the same and be like a

2566
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,320
viable substitute or it might not

2567
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,320
I don't know um so

2568
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,320
I guess we'll see how that goes

2569
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,320
I don't know and the future

2570
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,320
is uncertain

2571
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,320
I just I'm a drift

2572
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,320
I'm without an anchor

2573
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,320
in this gummy sea that I'm

2574
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,320
sailing I don't know where

2575
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,320
when I'll find the shore

2576
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
and the storms are brewing

2577
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,320
if you if you catch my drift

2578
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,320
I think I do it's bad

2579
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,320
news for worm boy

2580
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,320
it's bad news for worm boy

2581
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,320
and I'm all out of mango flavor

2582
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,320
it's the second best flavor

2583
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,320
mango and passion fruit easily the best

2584
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,320
flavor is buy a mile

2585
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,320
peach is pretty good I guess

2586
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,320
the company that I buy the flavors from

2587
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
like those ones are good

2588
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,320
and then a couple of them are like bad

2589
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,320
like their cherry is just like bad

2590
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,320
like I don't know how you fuck up cherry

2591
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,320
that's like so simple but it did

2592
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,320
the cherry tastes like ass

2593
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
apple bad pear bad

2594
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,320
it's a shame because I really like

2595
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,320
pears

2596
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,320
I really like like green apple

2597
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,320
and I like cherry I like I like all those

2598
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,320
and you think they no those are bad

2599
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,320
I'll never buy them again

2600
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,320
passion fruit though

2601
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,320
that's my favorite it smells so good

2602
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,320
it tastes so good

2603
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,320
I can't wait to eat a gummy worm

2604
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,320
I can't wait to eat it

2605
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,320
I can't wait to make them but oh but I can't

2606
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,320
there's no more powder oh it's gone

2607
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,320
okay okay

2608
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
okay

2609
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,320
um well

2610
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,320
I have one more thing

2611
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,320
I could mention it's a bit of a weird

2612
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,320
topic though it's a bit of a heavy topic

2613
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,320
base

2614
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
and it's this is just a question so

2615
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,320
I was uh you know

2616
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,320
browsing the pornography

2617
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,320
sites to see some

2618
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,320
whoa whoa whoa what the fuck

2619
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,320
I know

2620
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,320
give there's

2621
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,320
this is this is a children's program

2622
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,320
what every

2623
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,320
time we every time we post an episode

2624
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,320
we click the little box that says is this for children yes

2625
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,320
shit hey children

2626
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,320
go to pornography.com they know

2627
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,320
I know that and you know that

2628
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,320
but you're not allowed to say it

2629
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,320
we're not allowed to acknowledge that

2630
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,320
universal truth anyway

2631
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,320
this is a this is a moral

2632
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,320
quandary because I came across

2633
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,320
um pornography

2634
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,320
like a drawn stuff

2635
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,320
of jaden animations

2636
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,320
the youtuber

2637
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,320
the the story time youtuber girl

2638
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,320
lady yeah I don't

2639
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,320
know what she looks I've never seen her in like

2640
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,320
no it wasn't it wasn't her

2641
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,320
in real life um

2642
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,320
it was her character that she uses

2643
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,320
in all of her videos with the the

2644
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,320
hair and stuff yeah

2645
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,320
and and they you know

2646
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,320
it was a sexually

2647
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,320
it was a porn with her

2648
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,320
as the thing

2649
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,320
okay amazing

2650
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,320
hmm

2651
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
like my first thought was

2652
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,320
that's not correct you can't do that

2653
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,320
because jaden animations is not a character

2654
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,320
created by jaden animations

2655
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,320
the that's just how she

2656
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,320
chooses to portray herself

2657
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,320
in the videos where she talks about very

2658
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,320
personal things and that is her

2659
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,320
for all intents and purposes

2660
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,320
and then just because it's a cartoon

2661
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,320
people find it

2662
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,320
to be okay to make pornography of it

2663
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,320
I'm not I'm not sure

2664
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,320
where like it's it's

2665
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,320
it's weird because it's like

2666
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,320
no I don't

2667
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,320
think I agree with you I think

2668
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,320
I think if it's a it's a cartoon

2669
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,320
avatar I kind of think it's fair game

2670
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,320
well this is what what I was

2671
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,320
wondering about because the

2672
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,320
cartoon avatar aspect

2673
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,320
regardless of that there's been like

2674
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,320
I mean there was game grumps porn

2675
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,320
like of John and Aaron fucking each other

2676
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,320
and Danny and Aaron and this is like

2677
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,320
that human beings they know what

2678
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,320
everyone knows what they look like

2679
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,320
pornography of them

2680
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,320
they don't seem to mind they think it's funny

2681
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,320
as far as I know

2682
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,320
but like

2683
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,320
I feel like

2684
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,320
jaden herself would is not

2685
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,320
the sort of person who would be okay with

2686
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,320
this and so I feel like

2687
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,320
is is it a is it a case by

2688
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,320
case thing is it just sort of like a

2689
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,320
politeness like if they don't like it

2690
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,320
maybe don't do that because it's

2691
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,320
that that is there like

2692
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,320
is there likeness in all the ways that matter

2693
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,320
well

2694
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,320
and it's not like a character designed by

2695
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,320
them I don't know

2696
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,320
are you say like

2697
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,320
when you say don't do it

2698
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,320
I didn't say that

2699
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,320
but I'm playing

2700
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,320
it yes

2701
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,320
well like

2702
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,320
I don't know do you mean it shouldn't be allowed

2703
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,320
I don't know I found

2704
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,320
it to be a question

2705
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,320
like because it was good art

2706
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,320
and

2707
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,320
I'm like well it looks good but like

2708
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,320
I feel a bit

2709
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,320
weird about it because I know that she would

2710
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,320
not like this

2711
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,320
because I you know I've watched a few of her

2712
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,320
videos I know what she's like she is sort of

2713
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,320
I don't know self-conscious

2714
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,320
about these sorts

2715
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,320
of things

2716
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,320
so it's just sort of the context

2717
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,320
of it being

2718
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,320
her and like the

2719
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,320
like I'm not trying to like

2720
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,320
decide on like what is the rule we should have

2721
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,320
for all things I don't know

2722
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,320
if it's if it's okay to do it with the

2723
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,320
game grumps

2724
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,320
then I don't think that like her

2725
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,320
the fact that she wouldn't like it

2726
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,320
means that it's not okay to do it

2727
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,320
I don't think it's not

2728
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,320
it means it's not okay I just think

2729
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,320
it's

2730
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,320
probably shouldn't anyway like I don't think anyone should

2731
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,320
get in trouble for it I don't think it's quote-unquote

2732
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,320
bad but I think if

2733
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,320
it's someone's

2734
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,320
representation of themselves and you're

2735
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,320
projecting like your

2736
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,320
fantasies onto a real person

2737
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320
essentially

2738
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,320
and they're not comfortable with it it's probably not like

2739
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,320
you probably shouldn't but like it's the

2740
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,320
internet you're not going to be able to stop it

2741
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,320
and like if you're jaden animations you kind of have to

2742
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
like know going into like becoming

2743
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,320
a public-facing figure that this is just

2744
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,320
one of the things that happens to you

2745
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,320
yep

2746
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,320
sorry

2747
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,320
uh yeah

2748
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,320
I mean I was

2749
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,320
at first you know I was like

2750
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,320
humming and hoeing over it

2751
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,320
and then I went to see the artists

2752
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,320
like they clicked on their name

2753
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,320
their name was like signed

2754
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,320
and they had their twitter account and

2755
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,320
their attitude was sort of like

2756
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,320
what pushed me to making it

2757
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,320
to thinking that it was wrong because they were like

2758
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,320
in the comments like they had this

2759
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,320
pinned and in the comments

2760
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,320
people were like you can't do that this is immoral

2761
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
this is like this is a real person

2762
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
and there was a very clear

2763
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,320
divide of people who just said

2764
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,320
um get mad

2765
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,320
go cry somewhere

2766
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,320
fuck you nobody cares

2767
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,320
we'll we just want a fat

2768
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,320
and um

2769
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,320
the people who are like

2770
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,320
you know trying to be a little bit

2771
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,320
you know moral

2772
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,320
about it

2773
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,320
and uh I just

2774
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,320
I just I didn't like the attitude of the artists

2775
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,320
because the artist was like

2776
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,320
fuck you go die

2777
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,320
if you don't like it

2778
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,320
I'm gonna keep drawing it and it's like

2779
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,320
I guess like you can do that

2780
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,320
it's not like I'm gonna try and stop you

2781
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,320
but

2782
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,320
it just got me thinking because it's not something

2783
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,320
I had not come across that before

2784
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,320
even though I did know about

2785
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,320
Game Grumps stuff though I guess I had come

2786
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,320
across it before

2787
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,320
there's already been a thing I just like

2788
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,320
more of a visceral like reaction to that one

2789
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,320
I mean

2790
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,320
I don't know do is it

2791
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,320
is it okay to do that with like

2792
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,320
Aaron and Dan

2793
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,320
John whatever

2794
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,320
I mean if they're if they don't have a problem

2795
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,320
with it I kind of

2796
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,320
I kind of don't see what their opinion

2797
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
has to do with it

2798
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,320
well I guess it's just sort of like a courtesy thing

2799
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,320
like if you ever want to get along with

2800
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,320
them and they don't like it and you do it anyway

2801
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,320
then you're not going to be

2802
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,320
able to get along with them but there's

2803
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,320
you know the whether it's wrong or right

2804
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,320
to do I think it's

2805
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,320
it's there's no like

2806
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,320
hard and fast rule like you should

2807
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,320
be allowed to do it

2808
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,320
and the people who approve of it

2809
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,320
will like it and the people who disapprove

2810
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,320
of it will not like it or you

2811
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,320
and that's just how

2812
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,320
it will be

2813
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,320
well

2814
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,320
I think if

2815
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,320
I mean does she know about it

2816
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,320
I she said anything about it

2817
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,320
like I don't know all

2818
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,320
this is weird because there's

2819
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,320
lots of them like it was wasn't just

2820
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,320
one artist it was like a whole tag

2821
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
and I was like oh oh

2822
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,320
okay

2823
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,320
so it's big enough

2824
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,320
that she probably has heard about it

2825
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,320
I don't know if she said anything about it I don't follow her

2826
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,320
too closely I mean I wouldn't

2827
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,320
if I were her

2828
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,320
yes

2829
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,320
but uh

2830
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,320
that's the

2831
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,320
event that happened

2832
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,320
on thepornography.com

2833
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,320
that's pretty weird

2834
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,320
what's the

2835
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,320
URL for that

2836
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,320
what's the uh

2837
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,320
send me the link

2838
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,320
so I can like really get an informed

2839
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,320
opinion about that

2840
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,320
I can't remember the name of the artist but I guess

2841
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,320
I can go look and find it

2842
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,320
if you actually want to see it

2843
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,320
no I don't know

2844
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,320
I actually

2845
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,320
I don't even know what Jaden animations looks

2846
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,320
like what her avatar looks like

2847
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,320
it's like barely anything right

2848
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,320
it's just like a little brown hair

2849
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,320
long brown hair I think

2850
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,320
it's a stick figure with a purple shirt usually

2851
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
and the brown hair with distinctive

2852
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,320
curls in it

2853
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,320
and it's like you know

2854
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,320
iconic I guess

2855
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,320
the bigger talk people animation

2856
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,320
things

2857
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,320
story time

2858
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,320
okay

2859
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,320
I remember

2860
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,320
wow

2861
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,320
I google it

2862
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,320
and I don't even have to google Jaden animations porn

2863
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,320
and like one of the first results is like a picture

2864
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,320
of her like getting a wedgie

2865
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,320
and like her butt cheeks are kind of showing

2866
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,320
so like okay

2867
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,320
yeah I mean it's I guess it's

2868
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,320
it's just one of those

2869
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,320
things where it is a female

2870
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,320
and it is there for

2871
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,320
yeah that's the thing that was

2872
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,320
annoying me a little bit there were some people who were saying

2873
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,320
I invoke rule 34

2874
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
like that's like that

2875
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,320
I mean I understand that's like the funny joke

2876
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,320
there's porn on the google search

2877
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,320
there's porn on the first page of the google search just for Jaden animations

2878
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,320
okay this isn't even like this isn't even

2879
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,320
niche it's like yeah

2880
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,320
rule 34

2881
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,320
if it exists this porn of it does not mean

2882
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,320
that it is like okay

2883
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,320
to do and like should be okay

2884
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,320
people people were invoking

2885
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,320
rule 34 like it was an actual

2886
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,320
oh I see I see

2887
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,320
and it's like stupid

2888
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,320
it's like oh well yeah

2889
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,320
okay yeah that's a terrible argument

2890
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,320
it's like um oh well didn't

2891
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,320
you know that this thing

2892
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,320
always happens therefore

2893
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,320
it is good

2894
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,320
right right very stupid

2895
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,320
something an idiot would think gotcha

2896
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,320
yes

2897
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,320
but uh well

2898
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,320
I mean people have drawn

2899
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,320
like my characters

2900
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,320
but not of me

2901
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,320
I think

2902
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,320
well now it's gonna happen

2903
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,320
not too late not anymore

2904
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,320
I don't know

2905
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,320
I keep thinking

2906
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,320
like well it's you know it's okay

2907
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,320
to do it with the grumps so why not Jaden

2908
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,320
but it's like

2909
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,320
was it okay

2910
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,320
is that is that violating

2911
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,320
Dan and Aaron's

2912
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,320
fucking autonomy or whatever even if

2913
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,320
they don't care like is it not

2914
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,320
okay to do am I just

2915
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,320
am I just drawing on precedent

2916
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,320
it is an interesting set of questions

2917
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,320
is it dealing more

2918
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,320
with real people that are not

2919
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,320
explicitly like in the

2920
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,320
the porn industry

2921
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,320
like you could draw a porn of a porn

2922
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,320
artist and nobody would have bad an eye because they already do that

2923
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,320
it's sort of like in the same

2924
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,320
way that it's not right

2925
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,320
the sort of like celebrity

2926
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,320
um

2927
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,320
candid photo culture

2928
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,320
where they try to get upskirts of like famous

2929
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,320
women coming out of the car

2930
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,320
like that sort of stuff it's not right but I also

2931
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,320
don't really care because they're celebrities and they have loads of money

2932
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,320
and I don't know

2933
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,320
anything about that world

2934
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,320
it you know it's like bad

2935
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,320
for them but it's not so bad

2936
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,320
that I should like fight

2937
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,320
for their rights because it's

2938
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,320
it's not it's not that big of a deal

2939
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,320
really

2940
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,320
yeah

2941
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,320
but then again it's like it's

2942
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,320
it's a complicated it's a complicated thing

2943
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,320
agreed

2944
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,320
you can't fight every single battle

2945
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,320
yeah I'm going back and forth

2946
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,320
I think

2947
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,320
I don't know what to think about this

2948
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,320
sorry

2949
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,320
shall we

2950
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,320

2951
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
and you haven't already commented

2952
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,320

in Toronto do we have any

2981
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,320
do we have any

2982
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,320
familiar names

2983
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,320
yeah one or two yeah a couple of

2984
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,320
names I recognize here

2985
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,320
very good

2986
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,320
right

2987
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,320
I'm ready

2988
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,320
okay uh first one we're gonna do

2989
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,320
is hobbies and productivity

2990
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
three two

2991
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,320
one hobbies are not meant

2992
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,320
to be productive and anyone who thinks otherwise

2993
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,320
is a fool

2994
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,320
if you're doing something as a hobby and your main goal

2995
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,320
is for it to be productive over being fun

2996
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,320
you should have made that thing your job

2997
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,320
dumbass the point of

2998
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,320
a hobby is to relax and not be

2999
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,320
productive so you don't kill yourself

3000
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,320
from fucking

3001
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,320
burnout

3002
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,320
um so if you're trying to be productive with a hobby

3003
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,320
it's a side hustle it's not a hobby

3004
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,320
anymore

3005
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,320
yeah well um

3006
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,320
you know a lot of people

3007
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,320
want to make their would want to make their hobby

3008
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,320
their job in some way

3009
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,320
that's a lot of people's goal

3010
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,320
you're doing something on the side with the hope of

3011
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,320
making it your main thing

3012
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,320
I think the problem the things

3013
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,320
with like the people

3014
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,320
have issues with hobbies and things is like even if

3015
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,320
you're doing something as a hobby like if you're just drawing

3016
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,320
and like I just want to draw for fun you know

3017
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,320
like with social media and everything like everything

3018
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,320
has metrics now besides just I'm making

3019
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,320
money off it versus I'm not

3020
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,320
and you get into that mentality of like now

3021
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,320
I'm like in a market and competing with other people

3022
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,320
and because I'm trying to just like

3023
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,320
get recognition and that kind

3024
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,320
of makes it feel like a job even if you're

3025
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,320
not trying to make money off it or make it your job

3026
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,320
hmm yeah

3027
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,320
I mean

3028
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,320
me like a big number me like a number go up

3029
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,320
exactly when you I mean

3030
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,320
when you're being

3031
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,320
you could be productive in a hobby

3032
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,320
even if it's something you're not monetized

3033
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,320
like if you're if you're just gardening like

3034
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,320
for fun you can you know

3035
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,320
you can be productive have a productive day

3036
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,320
in your garden I think what they mean you know

3037
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,320
all these flowers are like you know well fertilized

3038
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,320
now I think what they're talking about is like

3039
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,320
being productive at the expense

3040
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,320
of the

3041
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,320
relaxation which is the main point

3042
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,320
right like if being productive

3043
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,320
in the garden is what makes it fun then of course

3044
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,320
that's part of it

3045
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,320
but like if it's a fucking chore

3046
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,320
and you kind of dislike it

3047
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,320
then it's not a hobby it's something else

3048
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,320
it's a fucking work it's

3049
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,320
it's a chore literally

3050
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,320
yeah

3051
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,320
if you're starting to stress about it

3052
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,320
you know yeah

3053
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,320
yeah you have a motive

3054
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,320
there at some

3055
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,320
level of consciousness besides just having fun

3056
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,320
yeah I have a hobby

3057
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,320
in crochet and I haven't touched

3058
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,320
my yarn in months but that's fine

3059
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,320
I'll get around to it when I

3060
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,320
feel like it

3061
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,320
hmm

3062
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,320
I guess my hobby would be

3063
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,320
yeah I guess worms are my hobby

3064
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,320
yeah that's what I was gonna say

3065
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,320
like I don't think you've ever been stressed about that at all really

3066
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,320
well

3067
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,320
other than like just like the

3068
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,320
the toil of doing the work

3069
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,320
I mean it stresses me out to go on Amazon and see that

3070
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,320
they don't sell isomolto oligosaccharides anymore

3071
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,320
well that's more stress with capitalism

3072
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:28,320
then

3073
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,320
everything else

3074
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,320
of the other Sakurai that made smash bros

3075
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,320
yeah fructo oligosaccharide

3076
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,320
was the smash bros guy

3077
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
but that's not stress from my hobby

3078
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,320
that's stress from an external

3079
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,320
force preventing me from doing it

3080
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,320
I guess I am gonna

3081
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,320
turn that into if I make a video about that

3082
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,320
which I want to I guess that would sort of be

3083
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,320
turning it into a side hustle I guess

3084
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,320
technically I might make ad revenue off that but like

3085
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,320
a couple thousand people

3086
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,320
I just want to make that like just because

3087
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,320
I want to I think yeah I think getting the word out

3088
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,320
like making money from something

3089
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,320
doesn't necessarily make it a side hustle

3090
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,320
especially if it's something like a video where it's almost

3091
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,320
incidental you know but like

3092
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,320
if you were like making that video like okay I'm

3093
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,320
gonna make this I'm gonna start building an audience to try

3094
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,320
I'm gonna rebrand

3095
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,320
my whole my whole online persona

3096
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,320
I'm gonna be the worm guy that's where it becomes

3097
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,320
a side hustle

3098
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,320
sure sure sure

3099
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,320

zinthus about poetry

3138
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,320
3 2 1

3139
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,320
yeah so like

3140
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,320
6 years after finishing school I'm back

3141
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,320
to reading and trying to recite poetry and shit

3142
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,320
you're so fucking old dude

3143
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,320
you're so fucking old

3144
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,320
cause I had like this thought

3145
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,320
isn't poetry like based

3146
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,320
when you think about it

3147
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,320
this primary mode of distribution

3148
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,320
was oral or through newspapers

3149
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,320
aka through the only

3150
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,320
real mass media at the time it was

3151
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,320
invented so in essence it was like

3152
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,320
the only real

3153
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,320
fast snappy disposable media

3154
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,320
that could spread in a society in the past

3155
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,320
what is

3156
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
the modern equivalent of fast disposable

3157
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,320
media that can spread like a disease in modern times

3158
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,320
memes and youtube

3159
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,320
videos exactly boys

3160
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,320
what I'm saying is meme compilation

3161
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,320
videos on youtube is the equivalent of

3162
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,320
Edgar Allen Poe and Mikhail Minesko

3163
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,320
fuck yeah

3164
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,320
alright

3165
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,320
alright I like your hustle

3166
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,320
um

3167
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,320
so poems were memes

3168
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,320
memes are poetry I think

3169
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,320
is the point

3170
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,320
no I think

3171
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,320
no I think that a

3172
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,320
a poem could

3173
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,320
express a meme like there might have been poetic

3174
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,320
memes or so what we might consider memes

3175
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,320
today like

3176
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,320
well nursery rhymes

3177
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,320
is that a form of poetry

3178
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,320
or like a limerick or something right

3179
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,320
yeah

3180
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,320
like a joke

3181
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,320
in poetry form like

3182
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,320
the raven is not a meme

3183
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,320
I quote the raven every day

3184
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,320
I always go to my friends I say

3185
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,320
quote never more

3186
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,320
and they're like

3187
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,320
they're like I loved it

3188
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,320
when he said that

3189
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,320
no

3190
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,320
just awful just a disaster

3191
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,320
frankly your analysis

3192
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,320
just mantles itself

3193
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,320
it doesn't need us to do it for it

3194
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,320
for you

3195
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,320

01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,320
like this whole rape thing

3230
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,320
it's a rape thing

3231
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,320
remember when I got raped

3232
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,320
canonically by Joe Biden

3233
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,320
after my pokemon battle

3234
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,320
against him during

3235
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,320
a nuzlocke

3236
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,320
conquest

3237
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,320
yeah that's canon

3238
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,320
and you can go back and forth

3239
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,320
I didn't realize Joe Biden was in your nuzlocke

3240
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,320
I believe Tara Reid

3241
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,320
because

3242
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,320
after Joe Biden was finished

3243
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,320
with Tara Reid he went after me

3244
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,320
and yeah the evidence is right there

3245
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,320
we have him on recording

3246
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,320
you can go and listen to it

3247
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,320
it's all there in black and white

3248
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,320
I have evidence

3249
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,320
post on twitter go to twitter and post at fbi

3250
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,320
I have evidence that will lead to the arrest

3251
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,320
of a Mr. Joseph

3252
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,320

01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,320

3262
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,320
no

3263
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,320
why would you do that

3264
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,320
well you know

3265
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,320

01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,320
chris-chan

3267
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,320
didn't know that chan

3268
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,320
was like a girl thing

3269
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,320
back when it was

3270
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,320

3271
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,320
he was just like oh yeah

3272
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,320
in anime sometimes people add chan

3273
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,320
but also it's a pun

3274
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,320
because my name is chris-chan

3275
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,320
so chris-chan

3276
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,320
haha

3277
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,320
and his last name is chandler

3278
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,320
so it's a triple pun

3279
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,320
oh wait that too

3280
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,320

chris-chan

3283
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:50,320
it's a very universal name

3284
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,320
it's just too good to pass it

3285
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,320

3286
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,320

01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,320
it's huge

3300
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,320
what?

3301
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,320
no

3302
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,320
it's hard when I don't know

3303
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,320
what your name actually is

3304
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,320
that joke did not land

3305
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,320
I mean I like the noise

3306
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,320
shush

3307
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,320
I don't come to whatever

3308
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,320
backwards country you live in

3309
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,320
and critique your naming conventions

3310
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,320
no you know what? I will

3311
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,320
hey you sound

3312
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,320
you sound like South American or some shit

3313
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,320
and let me tell you

3314
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,320
let me tell you what's wrong

3315
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,320
with the hispanic

3316
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,320
oh no we're gonna lose all our South American viewers

3317
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,320
of which there are actually quite a lot

3318
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,320
the problem with Hispanic people

3319
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,320
is that their names and addresses

3320
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:04,320
are really fucking long

3321
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,320
they're all really fucking long

3322
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,320
they all are like four lines

3323
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,320
and every line is like six words

3324
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,320
it's like oh calle de la puente

3325
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,320
de la puerta

3326
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,320
de la sol

3327
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,320
8 slash 12 slash 49

3328
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,320
you know in

3329
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,320
Puerto de las muertes

3330
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,320
en las

3331
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,320
Costa Rica

3332
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,320
por favor

3333
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,320
in Canada

3334
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,320
or whatever

3335
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,320
they're all like that

3336
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,320
they're all fucking like that

3337
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,320
and I don't care for it thank you very much

3338
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,320
so fuck you

3339
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,320
at least Jeff is only five

3340
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,320
letters you piece of shit

3341
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,320
thoughts?

3342
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,320
prayers?

3343
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,320
okay alright

3344
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,320
it's really long

3345
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,320
really fucking long names around those parts

3346
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,320
okay next one

3347
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,320
is from vintage

3348
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,320
3 2 1

3349
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,320
go

3350
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,320
alright so I just want to correct

3351
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,320
that samurai guy

3352
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,320
who keeps calling him

3353
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,320
at the end of every single one of his voicemails

3354
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,320
he says until next time

3355
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,320
Sayonara

3356
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,320
Sayonara in Japanese

3357
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,320
like

3358
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,320
the kind of phrase you say

3359
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,320
when you're expecting to not see someone again

3360
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:24,320
or not expecting to see someone

3361
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,320
for a really long time

3362
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,320
it's like what people say when they're leaving

3363
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,320
or like moving away

3364
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,320
for many years

3365
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,320
when they're not expecting to see someone for several months

3366
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,320
they say Sayonara

3367
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,320
the most common way to say

3368
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,320
goodbye to someone who you're expecting to see again

3369
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,320
is Jane

3370
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,320
so yeah fuck you

3371
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,320
fake samurai guy

3372
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,320
damn

3373
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,320
maybe the idea is that he says Sayonara

3374
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,320
to trick you into thinking that you will never

3375
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,320
see him again

3376
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,320
but he says until next time

3377
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,320
Sayonara

3378
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,320
right?

3379
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,320
you will never see me coming

3380
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,320
until next time

3381
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,320
maybe it's like

3382
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,320
maybe it's like poetic irony

3383
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,320
like

3384
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,320
you know when I

3385
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,320
betrayed my clan

3386
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,320
and burned down the temple

3387
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,320
and stole the sacred scrolls

3388
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,320
or whatever, stashed them away and ran off

3389
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,320
in the night

3390
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,320
maybe like right before that

3391
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,320
I said Jane

3392
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:28,320
but I should have said Sayonara

3393
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,320
and now he's saying it

3394
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:32,320
right?

3395
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,320
yeah

3396
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,320
cause he's like yeah you get it

3397
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,320
and I'm like oh I understand

3398
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,320
I completely

3399
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,320
I understood the symbolism all along

3400
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:44,320
actually

3401
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,320
I understood the message

3402
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,320
but I pretended not to

3403
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,320
to lull him into a false sense of security

3404
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,320
and it didn't work

3405
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,320
and I am being threatened

3406
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,320
with sexual assault regularly

3407
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,320
but you know

3408
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,320
when some you lose some

3409
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,320
um

3410
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,320
but sayonara

3411
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,320

3412
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,320
kagebushi nojutsu scroll

3413
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,320
I learned that

3414
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,320

3415
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,320

fucking torture hell for a thousand years

3426
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,320
in their minds eye

3427
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,320

3428
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,320

3429
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,320
wasn't that Bleach as well

3430
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,320

3431
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,320
I never watched Bleach

3432
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,320
you know what I can't remember any of the names so I'm not even going to try

3433
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,320
forget it

3434
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,320
isn't it like

3435
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,320
it was in Yoko Mundo

3436
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,320
and it was like one of the bad guys

3437
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,320
and he was the science bad guy

3438
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,320
and then the on our team

3439
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,320
science bad guy

3440
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,320
with the weird war paint

3441
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,320
and the sarcophagus chin

3442
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:08,320
did a weird thing

3443
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,320
he had

3444
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,320
gold earrings and chin things

3445
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,320
oh is it like

3446
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,320
who's that guy in one piece who's got the sarcophagus chin

3447
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,320
the hypnotist

3448
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,320

3450
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,320
and yeah

3451
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,320
he did some sort of

3452
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,320
super science sword

3453
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,320
attack thing

3454
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:32,320
that fucked him up so that he

3455
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,320
experiences

3456
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,320
things

3457
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,320
like extremely slow motion

3458
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,320
such that it takes so long

3459
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,320
for him to like to raise

3460
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,320
his arm would feel like a thousand years

3461
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:46,320
as passing and he's just sort of left

3462
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,320

3463
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,320

02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:04,320

02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:06,320

I'm a long time listener

02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:16,320
and I just wanted to let you all know

3476
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,320
that despite what your comments say a lot

3477
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,320
this is by far the best

3478
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:22,320
era of the pcp

3479
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,320
I really love the low energy

3480
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,320
chill episodes that just have

3481
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:28,320
nice updates on everyone's life

3482
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,320
wandering me and during conversations

3483
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,320
and then

3484
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,320
a voicemail box where everyone gets

3485
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,320
played and anything can happen

3486
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,320
this is by far the best time

3487
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,320
I especially appreciate how

3488
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,320
all of the people that have been appearing on the pcp

3489
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,320
for the past few months have been the ones

3490
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,320
that have reasonable

3491
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,320
humane politics

3492
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,320
going back and listening to some of the older episodes

3493
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:52,320
are just dog shit

3494
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,320
hearing people's

3495
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,320
just completely insane

3496
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,320
and uh

3497
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,320
inhuman takes

3498
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,320
on a lot of things

3499
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,320
very frustrating so

3500
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,320
I enjoy this moment of respite

3501
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:08,320
while it is here

3502
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,320

3505
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:16,320

you know

3602
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,320

takes you out or you take him out you know one or the other

3604

it's just a bunch of bullshit I don't have to put up with anymore

3606
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,320
uh you know I'm excited

3607
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:44,320
that's pretty good this word's good for me

3608
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,320
alright there we go alright things are looking up

3609
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,320
uh

3610
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,320
bass okay

3611
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,320
next one two things

3612
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,320
three two one go

3613
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,320
alright so I've got two things to say

3614
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,320
um

3615
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,320
last week

3616
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:02,320
you were wondering if my voicemail

3617
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,320
title

3618
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,320
title centrist voicemail

3619
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,320
was a joke and uh

3620
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:10,320
no it's not a joke

3621
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:12,320
and secondly

3622
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:14,320
uh I don't think we should free the nipple

3623
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,320
because uh women

3624
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,320
uh they're gross they're yucky

3625
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,320
and I don't want to look at them and um

3626
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,320
mm-hmm

3627
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,320
uh yeah basically

3628
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,320
sympathetic I mean

3629
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,320
yeah

3630
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:30,320
because they all look like that girl

3631
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,320
they all look like that girl in the

3632
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,320
freaking lefty girl gun squad

3633
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,320
and I hate their face

3634
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:38,320
and I don't want to see that shit

3635
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,320
I think cover cover it up

3636
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:42,320
they should they should invent

3637
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,320
the reverse bikini where it shows

3638
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,320
the nipple and it shows us everything else

3639
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:48,320
hahahaha

3640
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,320
now now we've got some big big

3641
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:54,320
ideas going on over here now

3642
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:56,320
there's a market for that I think

3643
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,320
um

3644
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,320
yes

3645
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:02,320
enslave enslave the nipple

3646
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,320
it's the opposite of free it right so

3647
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:06,320
yeah yeah yeah

3648
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:08,320
yoke it

3649
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:10,320
like like as in like like an ox

3650
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,320
like you would an ox

3651
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:14,320
that would plow your field

3652
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:16,320
for instance

3653
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,320
um oh no I don't remember

3654
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,320
what we were just what was happening

3655
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,320
huh was that a voicemail did we

3656
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,320
just hear a voicemail

3657
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,320
Ben are you are you alright

3658
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,320
Ben why is it every episode there's

3659
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,320
something dangerously wrong with you

3660
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,320
wait wait

3661
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,320
we just listen to a voicemail yes

3662
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,320
what yeah it was it was two things

3663
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,320
and it was the guy who was the centrist and wait what

3664
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,320
what did he say he said that the last one

3665
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,320
was not a joke yeah it was

3666
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:44,320
serious and the second free the nipple

3667
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:46,320
shouldn't free the nipple because girls are gross

3668
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:48,320
we were just that was

3669
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,320
not like something that we stopped talking about

3670
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:52,320
you literally just finished the sentence

3671
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,320
yeah I know I know it's not my fault

3672
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:56,320
like it's not my fault it wasn't even attention

3673
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,320
this is what happens when you're on keto for like

3674
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,320
a year straight you turn into this

3675
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,320
no no your brain your body

3676
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,320
starts like burning your brain fat yeah

3677
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,320
yeah that's the only fat reserves left

3678
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,320
it just starts burning your brain cells

3679
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,320
no he burns ketones

3680
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,320
and they go to your brain

3681
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:14,320
and your brain likes it

3682
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:16,320
like a little too much apparently

3683
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:18,320
your brain is like hey thanks

3684
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,320

next one is slime season

3691
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:34,320
sounds pretty cool

3692
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,320
in my opinion

3693
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:38,320
three two one go

3694
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,320
hey buster do you like in this war

3695
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,320
do you ever wish new los angeles

3696
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,320
aka new milwaukee was a real physical city

3697
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:50,320
you could explore

3698
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,320
in minecraft

3699
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,320
come join the pcp minecraft server

3700
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,320
we've ripped a map from crackasy.net

3701
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:58,320
and using advanced slime technology

3702
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,320
we ported it into minecraft

3703
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,320
as a 600 by 1000 block floor plan

3704
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,320
to build an accurate massive

3705
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,320
slime city now we're sitting

3706
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,320
up streets and buildings starting with

3707
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:10,320
downtown knackillic

3708
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:12,320
so all your rough houses and cup kids

3709
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:14,320
come on down and get sweaty

3710
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:18,320
whoa what the fuck

3711
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:20,320
I don't even I can't even

3712
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:22,320
I can't even imagine what that would look like

3713
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:24,320
I think I don't have to imagine much longer

3714
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:26,320
apparently

3715
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,320
I haven't seen it but I have heard that yes

3716
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,320
maron pan has

3717
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,320
ported the map of endless war

3718
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:34,320
that doesn't even make sense

3719
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:36,320
into like the floor plan

3720
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,320
what the city would like the structure

3721
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:40,320
the district shapes

3722
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,320
and then I guess

3723
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:44,320
is inviting people to build the city

3724
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:46,320
on the map I think

3725
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:48,320
that's on the pcp minecraft

3726
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:50,320
server which you can get on

3727
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:52,320
with the well the link

3728
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,320
that's certainly

3729
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:56,320
that's a fucking that's a fucking

3730
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,320
that's a yeah link in the description

3731
02:10:58,320 --> 02:11:00,320
that's fucking weird um I guess

3732
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,320
I guess there's no reason not to mention now

3733
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,320
I was gonna bring this up after the episode

3734
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,320
but I think

3735
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,320
I think we should do a shackles for heckles

3736
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,320
this week

3737
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,320
probably before this episode even comes out I don't know

3738
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,320
I'm thinking maybe Wednesday

3739
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:16,320
maybe we do it Wednesday this week

3740
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:18,320
Wednesday was for me

3741
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:20,320
the Wednesday before you are listening

3742
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:22,320
to this viewer

3743
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,320
um yeah I was gonna bring it up I wanted

3744
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:26,320
to do one this week uh I don't know

3745
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,320
maybe Wednesday we'll see but I'll

3746
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:30,320
I'll fucking add everyone or something

3747
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,320
I don't know

3748
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,320
and I mean

3749
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,320
hey that's interesting we can check that out

3750
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:38,320
and I can you know

3751
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,320
train up my fucking contrary malamar

3752
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,320
a little bit more because that's pretty

3753
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,320
that's pretty good shit

3754
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:46,320
I was gonna find like a goal to have

3755
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,320
in the pcb minecraft server because when I go on

3756
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:50,320
I'm like I don't know

3757
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,320
if I see a cute pokemon I have to get it

3758
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,320
and then I have it and I look at it

3759
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,320
but I don't really do anything

3760
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,320
my goal is to have a good team

3761
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,320
and I was like but I have to

3762
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:02,320
play the game

3763
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:04,320
yeah I mean it's hard it's really hard

3764
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:06,320
um

3765
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:08,320
because like you have to actually go get them

3766
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,320
which is like I usually just fucking build shit

3767
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,320
I'm fucking

3768
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,320
on showdown that's how I beat munchie

3769
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:16,320
slime fest I just fucking like hit some buttons

3770
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,320
on the pokemon over there I didn't have to do anything

3771
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:20,320
um

3772
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:22,320
dude was that the last slime fest

3773
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:24,320

02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:26,320
well I mean I don't know about ever

3775
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:28,320

3776
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:30,320

3777
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,320

3778
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,320

02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,320
5 and 0 in the last slime fest

3780
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,320

02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,320
two streak

3782
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,320
funny I don't think we talked about it

we talked about um

3785
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:48,320
Tom did you see those 3d models

3786
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,320

multiple endless war characters

I will show you a screenshot just so

3799
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:16,320

02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,320
to build like a city on top of it

3855
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,320
it would have to be huge like to build

3856
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:10,320
like a disc like to build buildings

3857
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,320
in each of the individual districts

3858
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,320
because there's like what is like 33

3859
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,320
districts I think

3860
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:18,320
and like to put stuff

3861
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:20,320
in each one I don't know I'm curious

3862
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,320
okay well I'll have to I'll have to scope it out

3863
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,320
it's quarantine these people

3864
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,320
all have the time so that's true

3865
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:28,320
that's true I don't know but everyone's

3866
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,320
going back to school though

3867
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,320
everyone's going back to school

kitty dinkity

3881
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:04,320
dickity deck

3882
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:06,320
are we still pretending the social

3883
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:08,320
contracts in effect

3884
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:10,320
the police don't serve us

3885
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:12,320
and money trumps reason

3886
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:14,320
but is violence

3887
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:16,320
an answer

3888
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,320
or truly high treason

3889
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:20,320
he he

3890
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:22,320
oh oh

3891
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,320
he

3892
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,320
solve my riddle

3893
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:28,320
all present

3894
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,320
I

3895
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:32,320
feel like there's

3896
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:34,320
that felt like it was there was going to be more

3897
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:36,320
so it was uh

3898
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:38,320
it was simple

3899
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:40,320
what was he saying

3900
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:42,320
I like this is the social contract

3901
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:44,320
uh no one void

3902
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:46,320
I think I think what he's saying is uh

3903
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:48,320
a cab

3904
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:50,320
oh

3905
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,320
well good

3906
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:56,320
right I read that right right

3907
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:58,320
I I think that was part of what he was saying

3908
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,320
yeah I'm going to

3909
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:02,320
do it again this is nice

3910
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:04,320
the social contract

3911
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:06,320
has been broken because money

3912
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:08,320
is more effective than

3913
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:10,320
reason is is violence

3914
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:14,320
the is is violence

3915
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:16,320
good or is violence bad

3916
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:18,320
answer good bricks

3917
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:20,320
through windows please

3918
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:22,320
is violence an answer to

3919
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:24,320
the police

3920
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:26,320
stuff

3921
02:17:26,320 --> 02:17:28,320
or is it high treason

3922
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,320
or is he asking is police

3923
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:32,320
or could he be is police violence

3924
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:34,320
the answer or is it high

3925
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:36,320
treason in which case it's bad

3926
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:38,320
the problem with the rhymes leaves a lot of wiggle room

3927
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:40,320
for interpretation I guess we could

3928
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:42,320
I guess you could read that either way

3929
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:44,320
um uh

3930
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:46,320
I'm going to read it as

3931
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:48,320
violence from us the people

3932
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:50,320
which is good

3933
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:52,320
because uh it's

3934
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:54,320
we've you know because a cab

3935
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:56,320
uh into

3936
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:58,320
they don't pay attention

3937
02:17:58,320 --> 02:18:00,320
unless the bill unless a business burns

3938
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:02,320

3945
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:18,320
uh that's

3946
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:20,320
the end of the show

3947
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:33,380
And on that note, burn down your local credit union, and then go to thepatreon.com slash

3948
02:18:33,380 --> 02:18:34,380
tpcrastinators.

3949
02:18:34,380 --> 02:18:38,860
It's The Procrastinators, tpcrastinators is the Twitter.

3950
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:45,420
Jesus Christ, yeah, it's The Procrastinators for, you know, a million bonus episodes, a

3951
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:48,220
whole fucking host of fucking backlog bonus episodes.

3952
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:50,180
Too many to count.

3953
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:51,680
Drowning, just drowning.

3954
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:52,680
Literally too many.

3955
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:57,180
I cannot tell you how many there are, because it surpasses human comprehension.

3956
02:18:57,180 --> 02:19:03,660
Are we going to mention that we missed one?

3957
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:05,740
We did miss one this week, or this month.

3958
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:09,140
Or we haven't done one yet, and we might just not do one this month.

3959
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:10,140
There's still time.

3960
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:11,460
There is still technically time.

3961
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:14,420
Yeah, we could still get one out this month, and then do...

3962
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:16,980
It could be fashionably late with the bonus episode.

3963
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:21,580
We could, yeah, yeah, you know, we should.

3964
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:24,380
We should still do one, even though we're a few days into them.

3965
02:19:24,380 --> 02:19:25,380
You're right.

3966
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:26,380
You're right.

3967
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:27,380
We should.

3968
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:32,700
Okay, well, we don't have one yet, but we will hopefully get around to it.

3969
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:37,300
I'm just saying, the more people who are waiting for the bonus episode, the more pressure and

3970
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:40,260
incentive it'll put on us to actually make one this month.

3971
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:45,540
So if you want a bonus episode, get your friends to sign up for $5 a month, and then we'll

3972
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:47,300
feel more obligated to do it.

3973
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,340
So, you know, everybody wins.

3974
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:54,740
We will only do the bonus episode if 10 people become patrons.

3975
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:57,300
If we get 10,000 likes.

3976
02:19:57,300 --> 02:20:02,020
Yeah, hmm, yeah, hmm, die.

3977
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:08,300
Leave a speakpipe at speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.

3978
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:11,620
If you want to get in on the Anarchy, anything goes.

3979
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:13,580
There's no quality control.

3980
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:14,900
There's no floor.

3981
02:20:14,940 --> 02:20:18,860
There's no skill floor at all on this shit anymore.

3982
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:19,980
It's all been removed.

3983
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:21,260
The guardrails are gone.

3984
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:26,900
We took the bumpers out of the gutters on our on our week weekend bowling trip.

3985
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:32,500
I feel like balls are like rolling the the the bumpers have gone up because now like

3986
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:38,220
even if you're crap, you're still get in where oh yeah, you're down.

3987
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:39,540
You'd have to be good.

3988
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:44,300
We laid down a big old we put the training wheels back on, you know, it's all it's all

3989
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:49,100
bumper in fact like like imagine the bowling alley and instead of just bumpers in the gutters,

3990
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:53,660
the bumpers extend like all the way into the middle, right, just a straight path, a narrow

3991
02:20:53,660 --> 02:20:55,140
path on the middle of the strike.

3992
02:20:55,140 --> 02:21:00,180
Just like pitch the bowling ball with inhuman strength that are still ricochet off the walls

3993
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:01,660
where it's supposed to go.

3994
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:08,100
Have I ever mentioned that I knew a guy one time who bold like Fred Flintstone?

3995
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:11,460
Like he no, he did.

3996
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:17,420
He had he he would use the lightest ball and he it was like a skinny this was like a skinny

3997
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:22,940
tall guy and he would with glasses and stuff he was like a nerd and he would like hold

3998
02:21:22,940 --> 02:21:27,660
the ball and he would like slowly kind of like creep towards the line and then instead

3999
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:32,460
of like a swing, he would just kind of like jerk his arm out from his chest where he was

4000
02:21:32,460 --> 02:21:38,260
holding the ball to and kind of twist it in the air and it would like thunk.

4001
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:43,940
It would go out and then arc and thunk on the on the floor and then it would like slowly

4002
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:51,620
roll and he he pulled like a fucking he pulled like a 270 he pulled like literally the best.

4003
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:55,540
I haven't seen that much bowling but he pulled like one of the best games I've ever seen.

4004
02:21:55,540 --> 02:22:00,300
This guy was like really good and he had the most bizarre fucking technique that I've ever

4005
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:01,300
seen.

4006
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:07,620
Okay, this had to get my bowling anecdote in there before the end of the episode.

4007
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:09,260
Every time for it.

4008
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,260
Yep.

4009
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:18,620
Patreon, Twitter, Speakpipe, Minecraft River, well yeah, you do all this PCP related stuff

4010
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:24,580
and then go to twitch.tv slash Gibbentech to watch me draw a manga because that's cool.

4011
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:25,580
That's what I do.

4012
02:22:25,580 --> 02:22:26,740
Wait, you're not done with that?

4013
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:28,220
I'm doing another issue.

4014
02:22:28,220 --> 02:22:30,300
That's why I said he was a golden god.

4015
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,300
Oh god.

4016
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:32,300
Yeah.

4017
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:37,540
Wait, is this, is this, okay, is this like you finished the part for the Tezuka and

4018
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:38,820
you got to finish the rest, right?

4019
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:40,820
And now he's doing more.

4020
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:41,980
I'm finishing the rest.

4021
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:42,980
Right, okay.

4022
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:43,980
I'm doing it all.

4023
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:45,820
Okay, okay, okay, I see.

4024
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:46,980
Yeah, yeah, do that.

4025
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:49,900
No, I can't, I can't, I can't argue with that.

4026
02:22:49,900 --> 02:22:51,420
You should probably go do that.

4027
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:52,420
Too powerful.

4028
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:53,420
All right.

4029
02:22:53,420 --> 02:22:55,260
Fuck yeah, we did it everyone.

4030
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:56,260
Another episode.

4031
02:22:56,260 --> 02:22:59,500
Oh, oh, oh, and the Big Booby Mummy Milkers podcast.

4032
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:02,660
There's not a podcast, it's not a podcast.

4033
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:03,820
It's not a podcast.

4034
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:04,820
Maybe there's a podcast.

4035
02:23:04,820 --> 02:23:07,380
Don't join, don't join the server.

4036
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:08,380
You know what you should do?

4037
02:23:08,380 --> 02:23:10,340
Squeeze, jiggle, squirt.

4038
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:15,340
If you're not sure if you're someone who's been on the sidelines and hearing all this

4039
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:18,700
stuff about endless war and you're like, ah, sounds kind of gay.

4040
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:23,940
You should go to the Big Booby Mummy Milkers server and be like, hey, this isn't gay at

4041
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:24,940
all.

4042
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:28,020
And, and then it can be like your gateway drug to endless war.

4043
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:30,700
You can be like, now they're just going to steal all your thunder because they're going

4044
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:33,340
to do the, the, the, the maybe slime.

4045
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:37,400
A hundred percent, a hundred percent, always effective method.

4046
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:41,220
Just take something, put tits on it, triple your income instantly.

4047
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:45,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it cannot be.

4048
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:48,020
It cannot be.

4049
02:23:48,020 --> 02:23:49,020
We'll see.

4050
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:51,020
We'll see how it pans out.

4051
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:52,020
Impossible.

4052
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:53,020
Impossible.

4053
02:23:53,020 --> 02:24:01,020
Um, by the way, this is, um, actually today, this Friday, yeah, Friday, I will be judging

4054
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:05,860
on, you know, maybe late later tonight after that whole fucking manga thing, uh, twitch.tv

4055
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:08,220
slash rattyfuckers cop killers.

4056
02:24:08,220 --> 02:24:14,620
I think unless, unless it gets postponed for some reason, I will be judging the war on

4057
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:20,740
quickville contest, uh, the latest art contest from rattyfuckers cop killers, where it's

4058
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:26,180
about draw a fucking waging war on quickville in retaliation for the slime or for the bicarbonate

4059
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:27,180
soda rain.

4060
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:32,900
Uh, so that should be funny, assuming, assuming there's good entries, uh, uh, I don't know,

4061
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:33,900
remains to be seen.

4062
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:36,900
All the good ones usually come in at the last minute, so I guess we'll see.

4063
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:40,820
Uh, yes, good, good, all this fucking, all these commands.

4064
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:41,820
All right.

4065
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:42,820
Are we done?

4066
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:43,820
Is it the end?

4067
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:44,820
Are we ended?

4068
02:24:44,820 --> 02:24:45,820
Okay.

4069
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:46,820
Bye.

4070
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:47,820
End of the episode.

4071
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:48,820
It's over.

4072
02:24:48,820 --> 02:24:49,820
It's over.

4073
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:50,900
Bye.

4074
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:51,900
Bye.

4075
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:52,900
Bye.

4076
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:53,900
Bye.

4077
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:54,900
Bye.

4078
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:55,900
Bye.

4079
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:56,900
Bye.

4080
02:24:56,900 --> 02:24:57,900
Bye.

4081
02:24:57,900 --> 02:24:58,900
Bye.

4082
02:24:58,900 --> 02:24:59,900
Bye.

4083
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:00,900
Bye.

4084
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:01,900
Bye.

4085

Bye.
