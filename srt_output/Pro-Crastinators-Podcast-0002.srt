00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Hello, and welcome to the second episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. PCP, happy

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,400
to have you with us. I'm the best guy ever. Guy with my team of esteemed internet individuals.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:21,520
Everybody, let's hear who you are. I'm Ben Saint, and I draw comics. Go be my patron.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,960
Patreon.com slash Ben Saint. Next! I'm Digibro. I make the anime videos. You know the ones.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:41,960
I'm Hippocrit. I make the video games. No, I don't. I make the reviews of them, and there they are on the screen. I'm forcing somebody to edit.

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,960
I'm not doing that shit. Jesse, who are you?

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,960
I'm Endless Jess. I'm a piece of shit, and I suck cocks.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Tom?

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm Tommy Oliver, and I run a channel reviewing art gear, and I'm going to start a comic or the thing someday. Someday.

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Looking forward to that, Mage.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,960
No, no, no. Go ahead.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,960
No, shut up, Ben. Mage.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,960
Fine, fine. I will.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:23,960
I am Mage, a little Rora Mage, and I have no idea what I'm doing right now. I think I'm doing animatic stuff things. Also, let's play Undertale. I should get on that sometime. Yeah, that's me.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
And D'Voo?

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Other than Mage, we're all the exact same person, so it doesn't matter. I also analyze video games.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,960
You heard it, folks. D'Voo doesn't matter. All right.

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:48,960
So today's topic is we are going to be delving into that nebulous topic, dear to most of our hearts, waifus. What are they? What is their function? Do they exist? Can we reunite with them by drinking bleach?

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
These are the questions we're going to delve into here.

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:04,960
So if you'll indulge me, I'd like to read the Urban Dictionary definition of waifu, so that we have a baseline to start with, because defining waifu is going to be essential for this whole thing.

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,960
It's pretty much going to be the entire subject of the podcast, because we're never going to come to an agreement.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,960
I think we'll probably all end up in a pretty same mindset about the whole thing. It's just an issue of how we use the word.

23
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:32,960
I want to say, I can't remember the name of it, but I saw a Wikipedia article on some psychological principle where the intensity of an opinion is inversely proportional to the importance of the topic at hand.

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Interesting.

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Are you making a commentary on the topic of this podcast?

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm saying that because of that principle, this topic should get very heated indeed.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Okay, so here we go.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Waifu, a term coined by Otaku and Weaboo alike for their 2D significant others, predominantly anime and video game characters.

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,960
A waifu, in contrast to a harem, is the love between one man and his one and only waifu.

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:11,960
You treat your waifu with the utmost respect and courtesy, and most refuse to even fap to their beloved, seeing the act as an insult to the non-existent woman they have committed themselves to.

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,960
A spin-off term, husbando, followed for fujoshi who feel similarly toward male characters exist.

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I don't think anybody should have actual definitions.

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
I have multiple issues with that definition already.

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,960
I agree. First of all, there is nothing more sacred than the act of fapping to your waifu. That is the unification ritual.

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,960
You light your candles, you play some music, you play some toto, and it's a romantic important thing.

36
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,960
I want to add to that a little history context.

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:51,960
This is just how I understand it, and it seems to be the common opinion among the internet of how the term waifu came into existence.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Is this going to be boring?

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
No, it's not school.

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,960
In the anime series Azumanga Daio, there's a character, one of the teachers, who's like this weird creepy pedophile guy,

41
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,960
and he turns out at one point to have a beautiful wife, and no one sees it coming.

42
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,960
And he says, in English, my wife, but of course Japanese pronunciation.

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I just watched that before we started.

44
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,960
My waifu, and that is commonly considered to be the origin of the term waifu.

45
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,960
That show aired in 2001, so I'm willing to believe it.

46
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I don't think the term's older than that show.

47
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I think you're right, I think you're right.

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
It was a glorious day for all of us.

49
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Is that what you're telling me?

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Well, they thought he was a pedophile, but then you turned out to have a wife and a daughter, but you guess he could still be a pedophile.

51
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
I think he was still a creepy pedophile.

52
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
Well, in anime, the lines are blurred, you know, but...

53
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
They definitely are.

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
And we'll get into that, this whole thing.

55
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Well, okay, I guess maybe we should each describe the way that we think of the term waifu,

56
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,960
and maybe just throw out our personal opinion on the term.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Before we go any further, I just want to make one last note.

58
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Tom, if you could nudge your audio volume up a little bit, or sit a little closer to the mic, it would be great.

59
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Yeah, I suppose that's true, it's a little quiet.

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Okay, why don't we just go around and everybody can say what they think a waifu is,

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,960
because it's definitely not going to be exactly the same as what it is here.

62
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
I guess I'll start.

63
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:24,960
So to me, I view a waifu as, really, it's just my favorite female character from the show that I feel attracted to.

64
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,960
So I kind of have a loose rule of like picking one waifu per show, which is, I mean, I pretty much just made that up.

65
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,960
I don't think anyone else has this rule, but to me, that's what a waifu is.

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,960
And a link at the bottom, I've got, if you look at my channel banner, it's me with most of my top waifus are up there.

67
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
You know, the best from each of some of my favorite shows.

68
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,960
And I've got a whole tier list of waifus that I'll link in the description of this video if you want to go peruse it.

69
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Jesus date.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Yeah, you know, I made it for fun.

71
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,960
I made it kind of because I wanted my channel banner to be that.

72
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Why do I feel like this video is secretly you wanting to promote your waifu?

73
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I do want to promote my waifus.

74
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
I'm glad I'm not the only one picking up on this.

75
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Not so subtle agenda.

76
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,960
You know, you're right, you're absolutely right.

77
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
That's what it is.

78
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Go look at my channel banner.

79
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
It's the best.

80
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Shout out to Tom's girlfriend, Cotton Candy.

81
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Cotton Candy says, I forget the full, Cotton Candy draws, yeah.

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Cotton Candy draws, drew my art.

83
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
It's fantastic, love it.

84
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Okay, so anyway, that's me.

85
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Who wants to go next?

86
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
I will go.

87
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Okay.

88
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Now, all right, I think.

89
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Ben is the one on the other side of the fence here.

90
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm not a person who has waifus.

91
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Right.

92
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Or subscribes to the idea that one should have a waifu.

93
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I mean, so I'm just going by what I hear.

94
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I think my impression is that the formal definition of a waifu is a fictional, probably 2D character who, you know, is your surrogate girlfriend.

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Or whatever.

96
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Yeah.

97
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
No, no, you're a literal girlfriend.

98
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Sure.

99
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:14,960
But in common usage, it's used hyperbolically just to do any character that you have a crush on or even just one that you like.

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Right, that's what I use it.

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
But that's too wishy-washy.

102
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:28,960
I'm going to be coming at it from the perspective that a waifu is a female or a character that you are dedicated to in some kind of romantic way.

103
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Sure, okay, yeah.

104
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
And that's it.

105
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I don't know.

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Well, like the fine dedicated, like...

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Well, I mean, a lot of these people really like this whole description where you...

108
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Like, I have like 50 posters of Asuka in my room.

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I don't believe that I'm actually married to her.

110
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Well, that might mean that she's not your textbook waifu, you know?

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,960
It's not that you believe anything about her.

112
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
It's that you view her and you like...

113
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
It's about your mindset regarding her.

114
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Well, I sort of...

115
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Well, I see it exactly like how Nate described it.

116
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I don't believe in this weird, like, autistic devotion.

117
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
You can only have one...

118
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
I watch something or I play a game or I watch a show and it's like,

119
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
well, she's the best girl in this show.

120
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
She's my waifu.

121
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,960
I guess we use the term synonymously with best girl.

122
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Another term.

123
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah, well, that's the thing, though.

124
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,960
And I don't necessarily feel this way, but to play Devil's Advocate a little bit,

125
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:29,960
I kind of feel like the term waifu for it to have meaning should be more than just best girl,

126
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
because we already have best girl to describe best girl.

127
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
That's true.

128
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
You know, if you watch a show and...

129
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,960
You know, because I've had plenty of times where I watch a show

130
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
and there's not any one girl who I would consider to be like,

131
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
oh, man, I really love this girl.

132
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm gonna think about her when this show is over, you know?

133
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah.

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,960
But, like, she is the best one in the show.

135
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,960
And then I think calling her my waifu would feel like way overextending like what she is.

136
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
She's just the best girl in the show.

137
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
She's not my...

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I've spent a lot of my time in waifu threads on A.

139
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
And as a result of that...

140
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
There's a lot of arguing in waifu threads on A.

141
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
There sure is.

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
But a lot of camaraderie as well.

143
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Yeah.

144
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
But...

145
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
That just describes A to me.

146
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,960
A lot of arguing, but a lot of camaraderie as well.

147
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Those are great threads, you can find that.

148
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,960
But just the definition in those spaces where I spent most of my life discussing anime,

149
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,960
because not a lot of people around me loved anime the same way I did when I was growing up,

150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,960
just the term took on that connotation sort of...

151
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Like, it was used jokingly a lot of the time,

152
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,960
but that really sort of sunk into my understanding of what it meant.

153
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Like, I use the term way more as a joke than I've ever used it in a serious way,

154
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,960
just as a matter of those with the circles I tread in, and that's how the word was used.

155
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,960
So, you know, what makes the definition of a word accurate?

156
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Is it the way that most people use it, or the way the dictionary says it?

157
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Shouldn't we continue getting everyone's tattles?

158
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
You're absolutely right.

159
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
You're absolutely right.

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
I don't think we heard of Major or Davoo or Hippos.

161
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Okay, you're right.

162
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Whoever wants to go next, let's hear it.

163
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Okay.

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Tom, you go.

165
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm just gonna give a shit.

166
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
I was gonna wait until everyone knows.

167
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
You're just being polite.

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Yeah.

169
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Okay, Tom's going.

170
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,960
I think I'm pretty similar to Ben in the fact that I don't really, like, focus too much on waifus.

171
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Like, I'm sitting here right now thinking, like, do we even have a waifu?

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I don't even know.

173
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Oh, no, for shame.

174
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Like, what about rarity?

175
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Like, I don't even think that would be considered a waifu.

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Just, like, again, like, best girl, sort of, in that context.

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Yeah, okay.

178
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I don't know.

179
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,960
I don't think any of us use it, like, as seriously as some...

180
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I think you have to be a pretty messed up person to look at it strictly in that most rigid...

181
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Well, the whole thing is that there's a total...

182
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I don't necessarily agree with that.

183
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Yeah.

184
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Without that, though.

185
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Like, you can get, like, games in Japan where, like, they have, like, AR cards for the 3DS

186
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
where you can go to actual locations to get...

187
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Well, yeah, like, like, Love Plus.

188
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
You guys have ever seen Love Plus?

189
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

190
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Yeah.

191
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
You know a guy married his Love Plus guy.

192
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Oh, I know.

193
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I know.

194
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
He's my hero.

195
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
So, I mean...

196
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Tom, turn your mic up, goddammit.

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Is it still fucked up?

198
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I turned it up.

199
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,960
I feel like I'm talking to someone who's standing, like, on the complete opposite end of, like,

200
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,960
a large room and it's talking at a normal volume.

201
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
That's true.

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
It's talking into a pillow.

203
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Well, while he's suggesting that...

204
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,460
Let me put forward the suggestion that maybe, since none of us have, you know, the stringent

205
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,960
definition of a waifu.

206
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah.

207
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
That's only...

208
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Okay, go on.

209
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,100
And it's generally agreed, it seems, that, like, if you use it too loosely, it just becomes

210
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,960
synonymous with best girl.

211
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Yeah.

212
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,960
So, maybe there's some, like, middle ground between these two.

213
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Yeah.

214
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
It's definitely...

215
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Well, I don't know.

216
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,960
We just have to specify when we're talking about any given point, which we're talking about.

217
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,960
For what it's worth, me and Jesse haven't actually shared our stance on what a waifu is.

218
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
We've just responded to you guys' stances.

219
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Okay, well, if you want to, you know...

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Well, I don't...

221
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Okay.

222
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,960
So, to me, a waifu is, like...

223
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Like I said, it shouldn't...

224
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Like, to me, best girl is, like, a way exaggeration if you call it a waifu.

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Like, to me, a waifu has to be someone who is, like, specially appeals to me.

226
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Like, there doesn't have to be one, or it doesn't have to be some, like, weird devotion thing.

227
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
But, like...

228
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:22,960
To me, the whole point of saying that someone's a waifu is that they are, like, specifically appealing to me.

229
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Like, it's a character who, you know, who goes beyond just being, like, a character I like,

230
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,960
more so that they're a character that I'm, like, you know, attracted to, not even necessarily, like, in a sexual way,

231
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
but more in, like, a...

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Like, if this was a real person, then she'd be someone who I'd have a crush on, you know?

233
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Or something to that effect.

234
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
I very much agree with that.

235
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,960
That's a good articulation of basically how I feel about it.

236
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Yeah.

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Well, it sounds like you should...

238
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,960
You're talking about the elder-tier-tier on my waifu tier list.

239
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Everyone go check it out.

240
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
It's, uh...

241
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
That's the thing, like...

242
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm just plugging that.

243
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,960
This is fucking stupid.

244
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
You're stupid!

245
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Everyone loved my waifus.

246
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Appreciate that.

247
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Yeah.

248
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Like, I think, uh, you know, to me, like, I can usually tell a waifu pretty quickly because

249
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,960
it's more like an aesthetic and personality thing than it is, like, I love the character

250
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
for being a good character.

251
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:28,960
You know, like, if I had said, say, Yukino Miyazawa from Karekano, like, is a great character,

252
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
but not my type at all.

253
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Like, I could never see myself, you know, dating her or something like that.

254
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,360
She is one of my favorite characters in fiction in terms of, like, how she's written and how

255
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
her character develops.

256
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:48,760
But, like, then I've got, you know, Tsukiyomi Sensei from Index, who is a fucking side character

257
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,960
who has nothing to do with the plot, but, like, she's just this, like, 38-year-old alcoholic,

258
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,960
smoking, uh, tiny, like, 38-inch tall, pink-haired monster.

259
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Uh, and I just love her, you know?

260
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Like, it's just a matter of, like, I look at her and I'm like, yeah, she's the best.

261
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
And that's more waifu to me.

262
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Like, I don't give a fuck about her character.

263
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I care about her more as, like, something, like, something in my head, you know, something

264
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,960
like beyond the pages of the show.

265
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,960
It's, you know, the version of her that I've imagined is the one that I like, and that's

266
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
more waifu to me.

267
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:36,960
So, like, a character who appeals to you specifically in a, like, romantic or sexual or that kind

268
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
of way?

269
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Yeah.

270
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,960
I don't know if it has to be sexual or romantic so much as it is that it's, like, something,

271
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,960
like, it's you appreciate them more than their place in the work.

272
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,960
And I ask you something, is it necessarily a prerequisite?

273
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm not sure if you stand by this, but it seemed like it was in there somewhere.

274
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,960
That, like, you think that they'd be necessarily compatible with you if they were real.

275
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Because my top waifu of all time, you know, by my standard is Nico Robin from One Piece.

276
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,960
And she is like a, I mean, when you meet her, she's a 28-year-old assassin who's, like, worked

277
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,960
all over the world, like, killing people and has been chased by the government her whole

278
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
life.

279
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I don't really think we have a lot to talk about.

280
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I don't think there's much, you know, like, relatability there.

281
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,960
It's just, I appreciate the character so much and find her so attractive.

282
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,960
I think in life, you often find yourself having a crush on a girl and being in love with her

283
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
in spite of the fact that, you know, you could never be together.

284
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,960
You know, that she would never be into you, that you would never have a thing, you know.

285
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Some of my waifus are ones who very much, I'm like, like, for instance, the girl from,

286
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I can't understand what my husband is saying.

287
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Like, the main appeal of that show to me is that the main character is so much like me

288
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,960
and the main in his wife is, like, the, like, everything I would ever want out of a girlfriend.

289
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Any girl that you marry will probably become exactly like her, even if she's a start out

290
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
that way.

291
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,960
She is what I would want to marry and that's, like, why the show is intriguing to me because

292
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,960
it's like I'm watching what would be the ideal relationship for me.

293
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,960
In my mind, I don't know if it would really be like that, but, you know, in my mind,

294
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,960
she's the perfect waifu, but, like, but another character who I consider a waifu is

295
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Sunamori Akane from PsychoPass and that's more of, like, an admiration thing where, like,

296
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,960
I don't really think we'd be compatible, but I'd love to live in a world where we were,

297
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,960
you know, like, because I admire her personality and her ethics and the way she carries herself

298
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,960
and everything and, like, you know, I think if I lived in that world, I would be, like,

299
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,960
her dumbass Hangeron guy, you know, the guy who follows her around and wishes he could

300
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,960
get with her, but can't actually approach her.

301
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Let's get Mage and Hippo's...

302
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Yeah, let's do that.

303
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Entivus.

304
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Entivus.

305
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
You first.

306
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Mage.

307
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Well, me?

308
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Yeah.

309
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Okay, no, Gibbon first.

310
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
He's already talking.

311
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Yeah.

312
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,960
My waifu is inherently silly to me, so I'd never really use it in a serious sense, but

313
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,960
I do embrace a lot of silly things and just roll with it.

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Like, I don't know, that's just something about the wa...

315
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Fuck it.

316
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
So who's your waifu?

317
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
So just get to the good part, Hippo.

318
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Who's your waifu?

319
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,960
They all seem to be similar sort of characters, the sort of borderline tsundere, the bitches

320
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
usually.

321
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,960
The bitches, there's Riska from Homestuck, there's Undyne from Undertale, Pacifica Northwest,

322
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Diamond Tiara, some other ones.

323
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Oh, I didn't know you liked Pacifica that much.

324
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Yeah, she's cute.

325
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I like her, she's underage, but you know what?

326
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,960
I'm willing to wait a couple years.

327
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
All bets are off.

328
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Yeah, you're willing to wait.

329
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
He's a good man, folks.

330
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Get out there and date him.

331
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:06,960
The thing that was going around my head was, I don't know whether that is actually like,

332
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
I like that character all the time in fiction.

333
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I always gravitate to all that character.

334
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I don't know whether that character is something I would actually like in real life, or that

335
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,960
wouldn't be good for me in real life, but I...

336
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,960
To be around a Diamond Tiara might be a total pain and suck in general, but the potential

337
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,960
of breaking through, and that's the appeal of the Tsunere, like getting to the gooey

338
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
deray in the center, the crispy delicious part, that's what you look for.

339
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
It turns romance into a sport.

340
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Yeah, right.

341
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Like you're trying to win at romance with a girl, and it provides a challenge.

342
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,960
It's like the Dark Souls of romances.

343
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Yeah, someone should draw a picture of that.

344
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
And I like Dark Souls.

345
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
He sure does.

346
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
All right, Mage, if you're done, give.

347
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Let's hear Dark Souls' waifu, HIPAA.

348
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Oh, Maiden Estrella?

349
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I forget.

350
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,960
The one of the spider ladies, the big one.

351
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
No, the one...

352
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
The sad one, the fair lady?

353
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Yes, fair lady.

354
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
What a great choice.

355
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Fair lady's fucking hot.

356
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Yeah, she is hot.

357
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Maiden Estrella's best girl, though.

358
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,960
Okay, Mage, let's hear what you have to say.

359
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Okay, well, first off, I'd like to say that I use the term waifu for male characters most

360
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,960
of the time because Husbando is a bother to say, and waifu just sounds cuter.

361
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I agree.

362
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I don't usually...

363
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Well, I never use it super seriously, but I use it on certain characters that may not

364
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,960
necessarily be my favorite or I think the best written characters in the show, but I just

365
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,960
sometimes...

366
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
A character really resonates with you.

367
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,960
I want to see more of them, or I really like the way the fans just interpret it.

368
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
It's kind of hard to explain.

369
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,960
They're on a different level than just the best character.

370
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,960
For instance, let's say in Undertale, my favorite character is Metaton, but I consider Papyrus

371
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,960
my waifu because he's just adorable.

372
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Okay, cool, cool.

373
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
How did you feel when he rejected you?

374
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I was sad.

375
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Sounds appropriate.

376
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Friend zone.

377
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,960
I've made it all the way to the friend zone in just one day.

378
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
All right.

379
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
That was a great line.

380
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Yes, I love Papyrus.

381
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
I love Papyrus.

382
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,960
He's just such a precious cinnamon roll.

383
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Agreed.

384
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Yeah, I don't necessarily shoot myself or...

385
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I wouldn't want to see fanart of myself with my wife or anything.

386
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I don't do it in that sort of way.

387
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,960
I like them as a character and I want to be just on a different tier than just the best

388
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
character.

389
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
It's my favorite character.

390
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Do you feel any sensation of wish that you could be with them at all?

391
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,960
I mean, I kind of feel that because mine are all hot sluts.

392
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Obviously, that's what I'm into.

393
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
I wish they existed.

394
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
How fucking dare you say that about Nico Robin?

395
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Well, I use the term in the most endearing way possible.

396
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Nico Robin is in no way a slut.

397
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
She's a pure waifu.

398
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Even though she literally says the line, I am 16, I will do anything.

399
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
She says that, but not a slut.

400
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
She's pure.

401
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Maybe I'm sorry I bulldozed you.

402
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
That's fine.

403
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,960
To answer your question though, no, I don't think so.

404
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,960
A lot of the characters that I really like, they're really...

405
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
You don't want to get boned by Papyrus?

406
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
No!

407
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
No!

408
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Nailed it!

409
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Goddamn!

410
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Oh, god.

411
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Oh, god.

412
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
It's all over now.

413
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Don't die on his chest.

414
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Oh, no.

415
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
No, no.

416
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
It's like...

417
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
No, I lost my train of thought.

418
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Go join me.

419
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
That must be how Papyrus feels around Saiyans.

420
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Oh, yeah, there we go.

421
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
I remember it.

422
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I like them.

423
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
They're very interesting characters and they're interesting to sort of watch and not really

424
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
interact with if it's a game or something.

425
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
But I think they would be very tiring.

426
00:21:50,960 --> 00:22:02,960
At least a lot of the first people I would call waifus, they would be very tiring and

427
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,960
just taxing in a relationship that probably not...

428
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
I mean, I'm already in a happy relationship, so I'm good.

429
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Well, right.

430
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
But, you know, this is all speculatory.

431
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Yeah, yeah.

432
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
I wouldn't probably know.

433
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I don't see myself with my waifus that if that...

434
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Okay, that's interesting.

435
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,960
I guess the moral of this podcast is that we all pretty much agree and none of us take

436
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
it that seriously.

437
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
And I guess that's it.

438
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
That's true.

439
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Wait, wait, wait.

440
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Hang on.

441
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
We haven't heard from Davoo yet.

442
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Davoo, bring this home.

443
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Bring this home, guy.

444
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
He's gone.

445
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
He's dead.

446
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Any fictional female character who I love.

447
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Okay.

448
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
So he agrees with all of us, basically, in our definition.

449
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Am I just like a whole second or so delayed?

450
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I guess a little bit.

451
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Wait, am I just delayed or something?

452
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
I guess everyone's delayed.

453
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Yes.

454
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Any fictional female character who I love.

455
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Okay.

456
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I use as a measurement for how I think about women in real life.

457
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,960
I'd be like, there's certain characters that excel at certain things and then I will evaluate

458
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,960
any woman who I know in real life and go, does she hold up as well as that in real life?

459
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
That's an interesting standard.

460
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
That is a tool with which I can help.

461
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
That's a dangerous mindset.

462
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,960
My second favorite wife, who is no-no from Die Buster.

463
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Okay.

464
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,960
She is an ancient super weapon in outer space.

465
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Can any woman live up to that standard?

466
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
No.

467
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
These women, man.

468
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
These fucking 3D women.

469
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
They're shit.

470
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I'm talking about individual aspects here.

471
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,960
I need an ancient God weapon who can save the galaxy as my wife.

472
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
That's what I need.

473
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
I'm talking about individual aspects here.

474
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Right.

475
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Okay.

476
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm glad that you agree.

477
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,960
I want to say that I'm really surprised to hear just how roundly and how basically all

478
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,960
of us don't even really see waifus romantically.

479
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
I thought that was the definition of a clone.

480
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
I see mine pretty romantically.

481
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Well, in a sexual way.

482
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
To me, it's just like, yeah.

483
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,960
It's definitely, I don't see it as necessarily having anything to do with sexual attraction

484
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,960
or covetous romance or anything like that.

485
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,460
Like, to me, it's just a character that I relate to a lot or really like or respond to,

486
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,960
but it also still has to be a girl because I ain't no queer.

487
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Of course.

488
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
But it's, yeah.

489
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,460
I mean, it's like, don't get me wrong.

490
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,960
I'm sure I have fapped to all of my waifus countless times.

491
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Yeah, don't get me wrong.

492
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I'm very attracted to all my waifus.

493
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,960
It's not that there's no sexual attraction, but here's, I was thinking about this just

494
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
a moment ago.

495
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
It's an incidental attraction.

496
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm attracted to them because of the fact that I relate to them as characters anyways.

497
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,960
There's plenty of, because I would fapped to almost any character.

498
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
They don't have to be someone who would be my waifus.

499
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Right, of course not.

500
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Of course.

501
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
Sometimes the people you hate the most are the most satisfying.

502
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,960
It's just an extra layer of like the characters that you like.

503
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Yes.

504
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Yeah.

505
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,560
I was thinking about the fact, well, when Mage said that she wouldn't necessarily want

506
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,960
like fan art of her with her waifus, and I was thinking about how me and-

507
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Yeah, our Channel Banners.

508
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Yeah.

509
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,960
All three of us have like, you know, waifu pictures, and it started with Hippo.

510
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,960
He commissioned an artist to draw himself surrounded by his three waifus, and they're

511
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,960
just kind of like, because it's like pony version of him, and they're just kind of like

512
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
petting him, right?

513
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Yeah.

514
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
And it's mostly just really cute and saccharine.

515
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,960
And then like, I got mine done, and it's me hanging out with my waifus in a bar just

516
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
getting drunk.

517
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah.

518
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
And yours, you know-

519
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Mine is god worship, basically.

520
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Yours has some implied like, you know, like, maybe, I don't know, necessarily sexuality,

521
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,960
but it's more like you own them or like you just have, like, here is what I have access

522
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
to.

523
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
They're basically being treated like commodities in that picture.

524
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Well, I do, I do definitely own my waifus.

525
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,960
If anyone else shares them a waifu with me, then they do not count as their-

526
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Now, hang on.

527
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
She's only mine.

528
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,960
That's an interesting topic, did you, the way that we clearly, you know, think about them

529
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,960
in at least slightly different ways or represent our relationship to them.

530
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
There's not the differences that were interesting to me so much as the similarity that none of

531
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
them are romantic or sexual.

532
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
That's true.

533
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,960
It's all just us with our waifus, like, surrounded by them.

534
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Right.

535
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,960
And it's less of like, like, it doesn't feel like any of us are implying that we actually

536
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
ship ourselves with our waifus.

537
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
It's more like we want to.

538
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Yeah.

539
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,960
We're portraying ourselves in a situation in which we're surrounded on all sides by

540
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
women that we love.

541
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Right.

542
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
And you know, each of them in a different way conveys the sort of thing that we kind

543
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
of want to get from them.

544
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Like Gibbons is kind of showing like he wants comfort from them or like, you know, you know,

545
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
that sort of thing.

546
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,960
See, I have an unfinished drawing that has been sitting on my desktop for like a month.

547
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Oh, yeah.

548
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Yeah.

549
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
That Gibbon requested from me.

550
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,960
And it's him with Marceline, Vriska, and Undyne.

551
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Yeah.

552
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
And he specifically asked for them, well-

553
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Are they bullying him?

554
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
They're belittling me.

555
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
I know it.

556
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
I know it.

557
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
But eventually, like, as I was making it, we eventually decided on, okay, we'll depict

558
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
them all, like, bullying him.

559
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,960
But the way I did it, like, wasn't mean enough and he said it wasn't mean enough.

560
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
That's very interesting.

561
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
That's very interesting.

562
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Now, are you like-

563
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Are you like-

564
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,960
I've got to say, we're running a lot about Gibbon right now.

565
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Yep.

566
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Are you sexually into, like, like, are you a masochist or do you just think it's funny?

567
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
I think it's funny.

568
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
I don't actually know whether I'm into that.

569
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
I just thought it was because, like, I'm-

570
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Right.

571
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Because, like, they all represent, like, something that I want to be.

572
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
I want to be really confident and cool like them.

573
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,960
But they're also women, so I like them sexually.

574
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
Uh-huh.

575
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
So it's like, they're my wife who's for that reason.

576
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
But yeah, the idea of them-

577
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
That sounds basically like how I feel about Akane from-

578
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Like, I'm imagining, like, if I was there with them, that's what they would be doing to me anyway.

579
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
Like, so.

580
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Okay.

581
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,960
But you know, positive thinking is important, you know?

582
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,960
No, but I don't know, I thought it was funny.

583
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Well, I'm sure it is funny.

584
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm sure it is funny.

585
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
It's just interesting to know.

586
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,960
I just think it's interesting that none of us, that, like, we easily could if we wanted

587
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,960
to have an artist draw us, you know, like, in a romantic situation with a character.

588
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
Of course.

589
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Or, you know, a sexual situation with a character.

590
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,960
And all of us instead wanted just, like, yeah, just surround-

591
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Like, it's like the image itself is suggesting that it's not that serious.

592
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Of course, yeah.

593
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,960
It's just like, here's some anime characters I like, and ha ha, my avatars with them, you know?

594
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Right, yep, yep.

595
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
It almost seems like there's-

596
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I really could draw myself with any character I want because I have the power, but-

597
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
You do like to?

598
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
No, I could.

599
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
She could.

600
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Oh, right, right.

601
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,960
It's like, but yeah, I'm one of the people who doesn't have the-

602
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Yeah, and I think that shows our over-prevailing attitude.

603
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
So, in a way, I feel like-

604
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,960
It almost seems kind of, like, childish and lame to me to want to draw yourself fucking

605
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
a character that you like.

606
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Yeah, I sort of agree on that front.

607
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Well, fucking is one thing, and then there's, like, you, like, talking to them and blushing

608
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
or something.

609
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Yeah, that's-

610
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Yeah.

611
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
When I see someone draw their-

612
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
I think I'd rather have the fucking, personally.

613
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,960
When I see someone draw their OC, like, yeah, like, flirting with a character, it's really

614
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
bizarre.

615
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Yeah, yeah.

616
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
I'm not into it.

617
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Like, having a real relationship with them, that's-

618
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Like, that's kind of what I was, like, I wouldn't be-

619
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,960
I've been flirting with them, but like, I didn't like-

620
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,960
I like the idea, like, when you break the characters, like, what they're like in order

621
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
to make them-

622
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

623
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
That's a good point.

624
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,960
So, in reality, they would, like, toss me around and laugh at me.

625
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I wonder if that makes us, if that, like-

626
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Cause on the one hand, I'm thinking that, okay, obviously we're all coming to the same

627
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
conclusion because we're all pretty normal.

628
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,960
None of us are, like, really psychologically fringe people who would literally be talking

629
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,960
to their computer monitor and, like, having fucking tulpas of our characters and shit

630
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
like that.

631
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Like, tulpas?

632
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Oh, tell her what a tulpa is, Digi.

633
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,960
A tulpa is where you-

634
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,960
The tulpa majora is a part of a woman's anatomy.

635
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,960
The best way to describe a tulpa is, like, the adult advanced version of an imaginary

636
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
friend.

637
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,960
It's where you construct a character to the point that you believe that they are real

638
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,960
and you interact with them as though they were not a part of your own psyche.

639
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I think the key to making this podcast good is that we all need to get a lot more honest.

640
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
At least a lot more.

641
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm afraid to get honest.

642
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
I have demons in my brain.

643
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,960
I just want to say that I learned what a tulpa was.

644
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,960
I think I came to learn about it through your, like, hypnosis video.

645
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Yeah, my hypnosis video.

646
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I think I did too.

647
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Yeah, because I made that video, and that's how I learned about tulpas, was that I made

648
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,960
the hypnosis video and I got a ton of comments about them.

649
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
And I was like, what the fuck are tulpas?

650
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,960
And then I did a bunch of research on it, and I was like, oh.

651
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,960
And I mean, I think they're really interesting as a concept.

652
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,960
The problem is, because I even went out of my way to, like, try to do a tulpa thing.

653
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,960
And I was just like, I can't because I'm too connected to reality.

654
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Did you?

655
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Yeah, yeah.

656
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
It's so clearly not a real thing that can happen, you know?

657
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,960
People believe in them in the way that they say, be careful when making a tulpa, because

658
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
if you make your tulpa too strong-

659
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Oh, no.

660
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
You might never be able to get rid of it.

661
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
No.

662
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,960
So be absolutely sure you want this character in your brain before you commit yourself to

663
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
it.

664
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
My attempt at making a tulpa went like this.

665
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,960
I thought, I tried to imagine a character, and then the conversation I had with the character

666
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
went like this.

667
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Basically, I imagined you, therefore, the only knowledge you can possibly have is knowledge

668
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
which I already have.

669
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
All right, all right.

670
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,960
They said, like, oh, well, you know, that's not necessarily, like, what if that wasn't

671
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,960
the case, if I had knowledge that you didn't have, would that not make me real?

672
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
You know?

673
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,960
And I was like, well, I mean, it's, like, if you can prove that, you know, but it's not

674
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
provable.

675
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,960
That reminds me of, this is off topic, but I was just at, like, a family party for, like,

676
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Thanksgiving, and I was talking to my cousin and, like, catching up and stuff, and he was

677
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,960
telling me about how he was doing acid one day.

678
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Yeah.

679
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,960
He was talking to a water bottle, and he was, like, and he started asking the water bottle,

680
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,960
like, what to do in his life and, like, to find some direction, and the water bottle started

681
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,960
giving him advice, but then he had this moment of clarity, like, wait a minute.

682
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,960
If the water bottle's only talking to me because I'm high on drugs, then that means the answers

683
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,960
are inside me all along.

684
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Yeah, that's pretty much the end.

685
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
That's it.

686
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
And then he got, like, he gained, like, confidence, and, like, he, like, went on and he got a new

687
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
job and stuff.

688
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Wow.

689
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
That's pretty cool.

690
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
So what do you tell me?

691
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
What do you tell me is that tulpas are real?

692
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Is that what you're telling me?

693
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Okay.

694
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,960
I think the majority of people who do the tulpa thing and post about how real it is, I think

695
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
they're posting that so that they can convince themselves more.

696
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I think that's a major component of it.

697
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Being in a community that reinforces your crazy belief is definitely helpful to keep

698
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
it alive.

699
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
I think the number of insane people online is a small percentage, and the people who

700
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
wish they were insane online is a much larger percentage.

701
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
Yes.

702
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
What's the distinction there?

703
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
You know, it's a fine line.

704
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
No, there's definitely a line.

705
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,960
So a tulpa is imagining sentience on an inanimate object, something like that?

706
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
No, it doesn't have to be an object.

707
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,960
A tulpa is just something, like, you imagine that a character you create in your head,

708
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,960
you are acting as though they are real and that they exist in the world, but you're the

709
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
only one who can see them and communicate with them.

710
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Oh, is it kind of like the Tumblr head buddy thing?

711
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Well, yes, yes.

712
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Well, it's kind of like a headmate.

713
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,960
A headmate is something that you, like, don't, that you just have, whereas a tulpa is something

714
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
you consciously create.

715
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Is that like the symbiote for men in black?

716
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
I probably, I don't remember.

717
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Okay, now hang on, we're getting a little bit off topic.

718
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,960
I want to ask you something related more to the core issue here is, so are there people

719
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
who do waifu tulpas as in specifically?

720
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Yes, absolutely.

721
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,960
They take a character from a series and then you've met them, really.

722
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Oh, yeah.

723
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
There's a guy on the giant Twilight Sparkle doll.

724
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Yeah, that guy.

725
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
That was who I was going to bring up.

726
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,960
90% of the people at BronyCon had waifu tulpas.

727
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
I absolutely believe that.

728
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Okay.

729
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Because it is the greatest achievement in the history of autism.

730
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
I want to ask a question, though.

731
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,960
How do you justify to yourself that if you have a tulpa, how do you reconcile that it

732
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,960
is the character from the show, even though you just made it up in your head?

733
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,960
How do you say that, okay, this is that person, not just a phony recreation I made.

734
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
By not thinking about that.

735
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Okay.

736
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
That's the thing.

737
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
This is the first problem I have.

738
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,960
I think the issue here is that we are all very analytically-minded people.

739
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,960
The sort of person who makes a tulpa would not think that far.

740
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
You're probably right.

741
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
They have more important things, quote, unquote, to worry about.

742
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
That's what I meant.

743
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
They go on a date with their tulpa.

744
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
I don't have time for this.

745
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,960
That's what I meant when I was implying that the issue here is that we're all pretty normal.

746
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,960
None of us are very insane in that particular way.

747
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,960
So what you're saying is none of us are qualified to answer this question?

748
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Well, I don't think any of us are- I think in order to do the job that most of us do,

749
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,960
we have to be pretty rational thinkers who are capable of empathizing with a broad range

750
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,960
of people and understanding a general normal psychology to even be able to communicate

751
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,960
with people through our videos unless people were watching us because we're insane.

752
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I think our job description requires being insane but understanding it.

753
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Yeah, maybe that.

754
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,960
I just want to say that CWC is on record as having had conversations with Sanichu and

755
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Rosachu in which he biased him what to do.

756
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Interesting.

757
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,960
When he went into Mary Lee Walsh's office and was berated for soliciting girlfriends with

758
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,960
a sign on campus, he mentally retreated from the scenario in real life to converse with

759
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,960
Sanichu and Rosachu who reassured him that he was doing the right thing and that Mary Lee

760
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Walsh was a villain and the rest is history.

761
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Have I told you, Ben, my theory that I think Christa Westerchandler is the main character

762
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,960
of humanity and when the rapture comes, we'll be judged based on how he was treated in his

763
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,960
life.

764
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
So frankly, I'm getting pretty worried.

765
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
I'm getting very worried.

766
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,960
We've earned this house down, man.

767
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Oh shit, no!

768
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Before we go too far down the CWC road, and we're probably around halfway through this

769
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,960
podcast, so I wanted to bring up a historical fact about waifus.

770
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Another fun history lesson in waifus.

771
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Cool.

772
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,960
We all are familiar with the anime director Hayao Miyazaki, the guy who is very staunchly

773
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,960
against Otaku culture and all modern anime.

774
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,960
However, in the 1960s when he was a teenager, there was a film that came out, I don't remember

775
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,960
the name of it right now, but it's one of the first big influential anime films to be

776
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
released.

777
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,460
And he said that he saw it in theaters like 16 times.

778
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,960
He kept going to see it because he was captivated by the main girl and he phrased it like this.

779
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,960
He said, she was like a girlfriend for me at a time when I didn't have a girlfriend.

780
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Oh shit.

781
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
What a fucking hypocrite.

782
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,960
And he literally was inspired to make anime based on that movie, so he literally, when

783
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,360
he was a teenager, had no girlfriend, had a waifu from a movie, went to see it over and

784
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,960
over again to date his waifu and then was inspired to create anime.

785
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,160
That is a fantastic segue into the question I was going to ask next, which is, okay, all

786
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,720
of us have our relationship with waifus and we don't take it very seriously, but can you

787
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,200
have one and it be a healthy part of your life and could you see yourself theoretically

788
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
doing it?

789
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
What?

790
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,960
And more importantly, is it acceptable behavior and not acceptable, but can it be constructive?

791
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Can it be constructive?

792
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,320
I can strongly feel that all of the greatest waifus that I've had and held dear in my heart

793
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,200
in my life have made me a better man and a better person.

794
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
I agree.

795
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
I don't.

796
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
Okay.

797
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Well, I agree in the sense that-

798
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
I think that's gay as hell.

799
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
I think-

800
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,000
The story, I mean personally, the story of Nico Robin is something that's really, really

801
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,960
touched me in my life and I think made me reevaluate life in quite a few ways.

802
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,160
And I mean Robin is an extension of that story, she's a piece of it and I don't think she's

803
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,480
real or anything, but she affected me in the same way that that story did.

804
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,460
So in that, that's how I view her now in my head is the existence and the branching network

805
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,120
of what that character did to me.

806
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,720
So in that way, she definitely affected my life and I think made me a better person overall.

807
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
I don't think that's the same as her waifu.

808
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Yeah.

809
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,360
Yeah, that's to say a good character in fiction changed you.

810
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,800
I'm going to go down this road.

811
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,440
I think I probably know the most about the subject of waifus, having read like countless

812
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,320
articles from people who do have like more serious waifus.

813
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,440
I know, Nate has a year list, so.

814
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Yeah, that's true.

815
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
That's true.

816
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,680
I would check it out.

817
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,000
You know, again, there was that guy who married his Love Live game.

818
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,920
For those who don't, not Love Live, but Love Plus, the Nintendo DSI game.

819
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,320
Now, keep in mind, you know, this character, there's only two characters that you can date

820
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
in Love Plus.

821
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
I thought there were three, but whatever.

822
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,960
One of them, well, there might be three.

823
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,800
One of them is the really popular one, who like a lot of people consider their waifu.

824
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,720
She's like the tomboy character and this guy decided he wanted to marry that character.

825
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,800
Now what's interesting about that to me is that the character exists beyond in everyone's

826
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
DS.

827
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Right.

828
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:32,360
But he actually left Japan to go to like a backwater country where this would be illegal

829
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,480
and he had a whole ceremony and married his DS character.

830
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,920
Did he marry the character?

831
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,360
The character, the character.

832
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:49,640
I mean, it's really hard to say because the character is just a fucking piece of code.

833
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,560
How can you marry someone without their consent?

834
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,400
I've wondered all these questions many times.

835
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah, that's a very...

836
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,120
I mean, in the game, she does say she loves you, so is that consent to marriage?

837
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
I'm not sure, man.

838
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,760
I really don't know, but like, you know, with a lot of people that I've talked to who

839
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,440
like do have waifu stuff, like generally, I think the state of mind you have to be in

840
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,520
to have a waifu is probably a state of mind where your life is not in the best condition.

841
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I agree.

842
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,000
I think if you were in a healthy mind state and lifestyle, then this would not be something

843
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,560
that happens to you.

844
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,640
And like, because there have been times when I was younger where I like wanted to have

845
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,360
the waifu and have that like, you know, talking to my computer thing, like I wanted to be

846
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:41,520
crazy, like DeVu said, there's a lot of people on the internet like wish they were insane.

847
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,720
Because in a way, it seemed to me, looking in from the outside, like it's an escape.

848
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,080
It's a way to make things better.

849
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,920
You know, you're sitting around thinking my life sucks, I want a girlfriend, and what

850
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,480
if I could just...

851
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,760
What if I could just immerse myself in this narrative where I do have a girlfriend, you

852
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
know?

853
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,040
And the problem is that the attempt to do that, for me at least, just is like, I'm not

854
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
crazy.

855
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:13,320
I can't convince myself I'm crazy, you know, like I can't convince myself that I can do

856
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
this, you know?

857
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,880
Like, I know I'm saying crazy, which sounds like an insulting word, but like this is me

858
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,440
coming from a place of admiration for people who can do this, you know?

859
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,840
Like when I see people who like, who post like them, you know, sharing like a cake with

860
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,960
their waifu on her birthday, you know, they'll have the picture up and they have the cake

861
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,240
in front of their monitor and stuff.

862
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm always like, man, I wish I cared about anything that much.

863
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Now, hang on.

864
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,820
Okay, I want to play devil's advocate to that point a little bit and say, isn't it possible

865
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,640
to be of the mindset where you know that the character isn't real, but you choose to dedicate

866
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,240
yourself to them just to, you know, recreate that feeling of having someone special in

867
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,480
your life, maybe because you're really lonely or, you know, for whatever reason you want

868
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,520
to, and, and, you know, by having that action that you're taking, it's giving you a sense

869
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
of fulfillment.

870
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,240
And I mean, if you want to use the theories of like multiverse where like your character

871
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,880
exists somewhere out there, you know, in some other, if you, if you really do believe like

872
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:19,480
we realize that you're being invented, if you actually like realize that you're being

873
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,080
like strange by doing this, but doing it anyway, I don't know how many people actually do that.

874
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,240
And I guess that's, there's nothing wrong with that.

875
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
I don't even want to attach the word strange to it.

876
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,080
I personally don't do this at all, but it is, you know, different from normal.

877
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,480
Okay, I'm going to say, I think it could be a good thing, but you have to literally be

878
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,840
able to like, because you have to be able to convince yourself, right?

879
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,880
Like I said, I've been at it with the mindset of it sounds like a good thing, but I can't,

880
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,400
I cannot convince myself to have that kind of relationship with the character because

881
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,240
I am, I am too sure that she's not, that it's just not a thing.

882
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,720
You know, like in my mind, it could never be possible.

883
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,720
So like convincing myself that, that I'm talking to this character or something, it's, it's

884
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
just impossible.

885
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,720
I bet even for the insane people, it's probably life.

886
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
Well, it's like age.

887
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Okay.

888
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Well, all right.

889
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,320
I think Dave wanted to say something when Gabe was speaking, but because Dave was a bit

890
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
delayed.

891
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,760
So let's give a moment for Dave.

892
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I think.

893
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Oh, thank you very much.

894
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,120
I think even sane people, probably most of them, it's like lucid dreaming in the way

895
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,280
Maddox describes it anyway, where, yeah, I can do anything, but it's the same as just

896
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
imagination.

897
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,800
So they might imagine themselves actually having sex with their, their fictional character,

898
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,000
but it probably doesn't feel better than just tapping and thinking about it.

899
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,320
I mean, I've, I've imagined myself having sex with all my wife foods.

900
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,560
I just, I don't think that's the same as like, you know, I don't, I don't think that's the

901
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,960
same as like having a waifu.

902
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
Like, right.

903
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,320
So the question is, does this level of insanity add a greater level of pleasure and satisfaction?

904
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,920
You guys have thrown around the word insanity like it's like it's yesterday's core.

905
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Okay.

906
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
Um, immersion.

907
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,240
Does that level of immersion add a greater level of satisfaction and pleasure or does

908
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,960
it merely subtract self-awareness?

909
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,000
Well, unfortunately, none of us are really qualified to speak on that, but I'd be more

910
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,840
than willing to believe that if you really believe it, it does make it a better experience

911
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
for you.

912
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,120
I mean, it's speculated on that all day, but, but frankly, I mean, I, I could see it almost

913
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,480
like, like you guys are talking about thinking that you have a relationship, but I almost

914
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,000
view it similar to like prayer.

915
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,080
I mean, I don't believe in God.

916
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
He doesn't exist.

917
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
Get over it.

918
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,360
Um, but so like, how is it, how can it be the same thing?

919
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,360
Wait, what if God is my waifu?

920
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,920
That's, that's, that's what I'm saying.

921
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,920
God is your waifu.

922
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,240
I'm just podcasting on God as a girl.

923
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,840
All I'm saying is another person I spoke to in the Brony community who we actually managed

924
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:49,000
to end up having on the pub crawl once for some reason, but it was a guy who, um, who

925
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,880
was trying to marry Twilight Sparkle.

926
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:58,040
And he had this elaborate, like, you know, idea of the character in his head and he would

927
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,800
talk about like there, how they had a life together and how she was the best thing in

928
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,440
his life and like they were getting married and she, you know, it was, it was clearly

929
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:12,080
a sexual relationship, but here's where it was, uh, interesting because yeah, this guy,

930
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,320
like he sort of got like, you know, his shit kicked in by the internet because of the fact

931
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,800
that, um, there was some artist who was drawing pictures of himself fucking Twilight, right?

932
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,440
Self insert, uh, you know, porn, um, and the guy who, you know, thinks he's marrying Twilight

933
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,960
goes into this dude's comments and goes on like a huge tirade about how, you know, Twilight

934
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,200
is his waifu and he doesn't, he, he's like, you know, pissed off that this guy is drawing

935
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,200
himself.

936
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Yeah.

937
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Slandering is why you remember.

938
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Yeah.

939
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,240
Um, by the time I talked to this guy, cause I asked him about it and he was saying like,

940
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,360
you know, he sort of came to the conclusion in the long run that, you know, other people's

941
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,920
Twilight's aren't the real one, but his is.

942
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,920
Sure.

943
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Okay.

944
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
Right.

945
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
I mean, that's the, that's the illusion you have to have for yourself.

946
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Yeah.

947
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,480
I mean, he legitimately believes that the Twilight he's marrying is the Twilight from the show.

948
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,760
Is she, is she the one represented in the show?

949
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
The other ones are changelings.

950
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Yes.

951
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,800
Okay.

952
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,800
The show is his waifu.

953
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
The changelings.

954
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Who, who did it just hear cackling?

955
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Who was cackling?

956
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
That was debatable.

957
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,800
Awesome.

958
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Awesome.

959
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Yeah.

960
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
His, his is the real one.

961
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,800
Yeah.

962
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,680
All the other ones are, are false, uh, and, and, and like, but he, he had gotten self-assurance

963
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
in that mindset.

964
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,720
Like he was like, yeah, now that I know, now that I feel that way, I am, I'm comfortable

965
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,200
and he, he really, like on the one hand, he made it out like, you know, like his relationship

966
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,520
with Twilight was like, like what, what was holding his life together.

967
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:46,520
But at the same time, it felt like this has to come crashing down because I imagine that

968
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
you go ahead.

969
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,440
Well, I wanted to say like a while ago, I think it's sort of like a bit of a devilish

970
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,080
sword in a way I can see how people can find comfort in believing that they're true and

971
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,120
going through the motions of pretending to have one.

972
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,120
Yeah.

973
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,280
And like it's not necessarily unnatural.

974
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,400
I mean, we, we used to play pretend as children, didn't we?

975
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
Right.

976
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Right.

977
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,040
You know, if people, adults can still channel that imagination, then, you know, all good

978
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,040
for them.

979
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,520
But at the same time, when they're locking themselves in in this comfort box, they're

980
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,280
kind of locking themselves out of the rest of the world.

981
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
So, right.

982
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
That's a good point.

983
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
Yeah.

984
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,400
I think that, I think that even the most, even legitimately insane, I know you guys take

985
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,720
so much issue with that word.

986
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
I do.

987
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,800
Even legitimately troubled and, and, you know, people that don't see reality, even the most

988
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,440
insane among the must have moments of lucidity wherein they kind of can step back and look

989
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,800
and say, oh my God, it's all, it's all a lot.

990
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Oh my God.

991
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
I'm not sure that I would agree with that.

992
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,360
I don't really know what insanity really is like, but, but I mean, I wanted to say the

993
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,200
whole reason I brought up the whole God thing was because I think your waifu life.

994
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,000
It's just that they don't post those thoughts on their tumblers.

995
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Right.

996
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay.

997
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So they only post the time of like how happy they are with their waifu.

998
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,960
Like other times when they might be like having self-doubt and like it's, it's not real.

999
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
It's not real.

1000
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Yeah.

1001
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
I'm crazy.

1002
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,960
They probably don't publicize that.

1003
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Right.

1004
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Okay.

1005
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Okay.

1006
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:15,120
I'm making a case though for, for it being similar to prayer in that you are, it's sort

1007
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,040
of a state of meditation where you're, you're, you're reflecting on this, you know, you

1008
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,360
do these acts, you put the cake in front of your computer screen or whatever and it gives

1009
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,840
you some solace, some peace in this topsy turvy world in which we live.

1010
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,120
You know, is it, I don't, I've suddenly, Ben has suddenly made me realize why I failed

1011
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,720
at this when I, when I wanted to, when I wanted to be crazy because yeah, it does take like

1012
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,440
constant self-affirmation and I feel like to me the failure was more interesting.

1013
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,200
Like the fact that I couldn't do it, that was the part I would have written about and

1014
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,200
have written about.

1015
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,440
Like I, I tried to be crazy and I failed like and it's upsetting.

1016
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,760
I wish I was crazy.

1017
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,200
Like I've written that post before rather than the one about how everything's fine.

1018
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:06,880
And you know, yeah, I think, again, I'm, I'm taking this down to like we, we are all,

1019
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,600
I said we are normal earlier, but really we're all very analytically minded.

1020
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,520
Like more so than normal people.

1021
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,680
And I think there's always a degree of delusion.

1022
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,800
Now you brought up God earlier and like, you know, like the majority of people in this

1023
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:28,120
world have deluded themselves into believing in a religion that is just some shit somebody

1024
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,760
made up, but it makes it easier, it makes it easier to live their life.

1025
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,720
You know, like that's why the reason people, the reason people get attached to religion

1026
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,640
and DeVu was just saying this the other day as someone who is from a very religious household

1027
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,600
and community that to him, it seems like it's mostly like for comfort and denial.

1028
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,720
Well, and they can't, in the case of my family, I think it's like, it's for, it's like people

1029
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,880
who if you can't deal with alcohol, alcohol is now bad.

1030
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,520
If you can't deal with this, that is now a bad thing.

1031
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,640
You know, that's the way that they frame it.

1032
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,880
And I think there's a big difference between believing in at least the kind of Christianity

1033
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,880
that I know of.

1034
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,360
It's more like a story.

1035
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,160
It's more like a narrative that perfectly, well, not perfectly, but tries to perfectly

1036
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,800
make sense with the reality that currently exists.

1037
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,320
It's like trying to retroactively impose a different story.

1038
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,320
You're not trying to say that the sights and sounds and sensations are different than what

1039
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
they actually are.

1040
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,240
You're just trying to recontextualize them.

1041
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,840
That's a big difference between that and people who think that their twilight plushie

1042
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,440
is talking back to them.

1043
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Yeah, that's true.

1044
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:42,240
But I still think that like it comes from a place of needing an escape from the world,

1045
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:48,520
of not being able to reconcile what you believe the world should be with what the world is.

1046
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:58,560
And I think that as an analytically minded person, to all of us, part of what makes the

1047
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,360
world interesting is its flaws.

1048
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,720
And looking at, we're sort of staring into the abyss.

1049
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,160
It's kind of our job is to look at things and be critical of them.

1050
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,040
There's a lot of people who, whenever you get that comment that's like, why can't you

1051
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,040
just enjoy things?

1052
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,000
Why do you have to think about it this way?

1053
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,960
It's like, well, I don't have more value in a world that's just enjoyable all the time

1054
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,120
than I do in a world that is what it is.

1055
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,680
When I'm far more interested with the reality than what I wish that it was.

1056
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,880
When I write erotic fiction, we're talking about white food, Jesse.

1057
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,880
Hold on.

1058
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,880
The Voo's trying to talk about erotic fiction.

1059
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,480
We have half an hour.

1060
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,320
I thought we were talking about the girls we like, and we're talking about...

1061
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,320
This is all relevant.

1062
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,960
But the Voo just started saying something about erotic fiction and I want to hear about it.

1063
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,680
When I write it for myself, a lot of the times, it'll just end with the main character being...

1064
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1065
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,880
Where can I read your erotic fiction?

1066
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Let's get some links going in the description.

1067
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,720
You have to boost your page free onto me, all right?

1068
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,720
Now...

1069
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,720
Rekt.

1070
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,760
That'll be a tear.

1071
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,080
So, a lot of the time, I end...

1072
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,360
When I do finish them, the self-insert main character ends up totally destroyed for his

1073
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,520
actions and punished.

1074
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,120
And when I first went through puberty, half of my fantasies ended up badly as I was logically

1075
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,120
thinking them through.

1076
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
It was like, well, wait, no, he would totally...

1077
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,640
Is that because you're self-punishing for, you know, having lust in your heart?

1078
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,960
No, it's just me trying to think about the logical conclusion of what would happen here.

1079
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,720
I would start fapping and then I'd think about the logic of it, like, wait, no, no, I've

1080
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,400
got to spend another five minutes so that before this can make sense.

1081
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,440
Because if it doesn't make any sense in my mind, then it doesn't work and I can't enjoy

1082
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,440
it.

1083
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,440
So, yeah.

1084
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,440
That's the...

1085
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
Okay, so hyperanalytical.

1086
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,560
What would destroy them?

1087
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,400
What would destroy your main characters in the end?

1088
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,920
Is it treating them like real people?

1089
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,640
Like, if you were with them, this would happen and this would happen and it wouldn't work

1090
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,640
out?

1091
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,160
No, no, I want to know specifically what caused their downfall.

1092
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,160
Oh, yeah.

1093
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,160
Jesus.

1094
00:52:52,160 --> 00:53:00,160
I can summarize a censored version of a story I conceived of, and I wanted to even draw

1095
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,520
it all, but I'm a terrible artist.

1096
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,720
So basically, there's this guy who's me, basically, with a different name, and he finds out about

1097
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:12,760
this academy that happens to be a thing that he is really attracted to, but it's not something

1098
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,920
that people think is a thing you can be attracted to.

1099
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,480
All right, come on, let's truncate this a little bit.

1100
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,120
And so then he signs up there and he enjoys it, but no one else knows he knows it, but

1101
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,440
then eventually they realize that some people like it and so they shut down the whole academy

1102
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,440
and it's probably his fault and he's sad.

1103
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
That would be the conclusion of it.

1104
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,480
Why did it shut down?

1105
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,720
Because he enjoyed it?

1106
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,560
Because they realized that he was into it.

1107
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,440
That they realized that some people were into it, they didn't know who, and that made

1108
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,520
it too messed up and weird, so they cancelled the whole thing and no one got to have the

1109
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,520
academy anymore.

1110
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,160
Well, why do they shut down schools because people like them?

1111
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
You know what?

1112
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,560
Wait, I don't think we need to actually break down all the logic of just fucking fan fiction.

1113
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,560
That's fair.

1114
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,560
Okay, okay.

1115
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:00,960
I just wanted to understand what sort of downfall and self-destruction we were talking about.

1116
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Yeah.

1117
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Okay.

1118
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Yeah.

1119
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,960
So, all right, fuck it.

1120
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Who's your fucking waifus?

1121
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,960
Top waifus?

1122
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,200
I was gonna say we end on that, but let's just do it now.

1123
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,200
You go first, Angie.

1124
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Well, we're at, like, we're already an hour deep, so...

1125
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
Well, 50 minutes is 10 minutes, that's a sixth of our runtime.

1126
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,720
Nah, I've been only going for like 40 minutes since the actual start.

1127
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,200
I see 55.

1128
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,200
It's like, it's been like 50 minutes or so.

1129
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,200
On my audacity.

1130
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
Okay, let's go.

1131
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I'm going first.

1132
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,640
You can look at my channel banner and see all my waifus, but my number one will always

1133
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,480
be Nico Robin from One Piece.

1134
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,480
All right, fair enough.

1135
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,480
Yep.

1136
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,880
Yeah, I've also got some of mine in my channel banner too, though not all of them.

1137
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,480
I've, again, been really into, I can't understand what my husband is saying, just because the

1138
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,880
character is so literally what I want out of a waifus.

1139
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,880
That's like a season two.

1140
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Yeah.

1141
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Oh, I gotta watch that.

1142
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:54,120
That is the character in all of fiction who I've looked at and been like, oh my god, this

1143
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,680
is actually someone I'd want to marry.

1144
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,440
Not just someone I'm attracted to for this or that reason, but her personality and the

1145
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
way she acts.

1146
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,680
I'm like, huh, like if this was a real girl and I was in a relationship with her, I think

1147
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,000
I'd actually be happy with it.

1148
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:18,520
Aside from that, I just generally like, I like small girls who are usually sort of lolly,

1149
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,240
but not actually lolly.

1150
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,240
Like they're actually older.

1151
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,720
The thousand year old dragon little girl.

1152
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,720
Yeah.

1153
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,640
Or just like Komoi sensei, who again is like 40-ish, but she, you know, looks like a kid

1154
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:40,680
or a recent waifu that I just discovered from Blazblue is Coco Noe, who's like this.

1155
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:46,600
She's this little, you know, she's not even really just a really small woman, you know,

1156
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,200
but she's got pink hair.

1157
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,640
She's got glasses.

1158
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,520
She's got a lollipop in her mouth, which just kind of looks like a cigarette.

1159
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,520
So good enough.

1160
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,520
She's got cat ears.

1161
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,520
She drinks.

1162
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,520
She eats a lot.

1163
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,440
She's also into, I don't know why, but whenever there's like a girl character who eats constantly,

1164
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,440
I always think that's great.

1165
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,120
You know, she looks like the others now that I think about it.

1166
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,120
She eats a lot.

1167
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,120
She rides a scooter.

1168
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,720
One of her attacks has her ride a scooter and she's like deadpan and kind of like snarky

1169
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,720
and she's a scientist.

1170
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,600
I didn't realize this is going to be describing all our best attributes of our waifus.

1171
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:23,840
I'm just saying, she's like, this woman represents like every single like thing that I, like,

1172
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,560
other than being like, it has to be either blonde or pink hair.

1173
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,600
But other than that, like she has everything I could want out of a waifu.

1174
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,000
So, so I think she's like, do not apply.

1175
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah.

1176
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,160
I think, I think if it's like going by just like aesthetic waifuness, like I just like

1177
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,000
this character because they meet this, this and this criteria on like a checklist, Coco

1178
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,360
Noe would be like the ultimate waifu for me.

1179
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,840
Um, but yeah, so continuing to whoever wants it.

1180
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
Okay.

1181
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,840
Jesse, how about you?

1182
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
Oh boy.

1183
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,560
Well, I, I jotted down some names just so that I could keep track of them.

1184
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,560
There's so many.

1185
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,240
These are the waifus that I remembered instantly jumped right to my mind.

1186
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,920
Tifa, Marceline, Tally, Raven, Fluttershy, Oscomisato, Noodle, and Helga, G, Pataki.

1187
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,920
And that's, that's, that's all of them that matter.

1188
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,920
All right.

1189
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,920
Cool.

1190
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,920
And, uh, I don't know.

1191
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,440
There's not really like a common thread.

1192
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,440
I mean, I could tell you why I like each of them individually, but I can't really look

1193
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,480
at the whole of them and be like, well, this is what I value in a woman.

1194
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,920
I think it goes a bit deeper than that.

1195
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,920
I'm like you.

1196
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Mine are pretty.

1197
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,480
Pretty, pretty eclectic.

1198
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
Eclectic.

1199
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,480
Yeah.

1200
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,480
That's a good word for it.

1201
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,440
They're all beautiful in their own way.

1202
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,080
Mine have such a clear logical through line that I think anybody could figure out what

1203
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,080
I like.

1204
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,960
And most of it applies to real women as well.

1205
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,960
So.

1206
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,960
Sure.

1207
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Sure.

1208
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Filthy 3D pigs.

1209
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,560
Uh, how about Ben?

1210
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,560
You got anyone you want to?

1211
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,680
You know, I'm in try, I'm trying to think of characters and there's lots, there's lots

1212
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,360
of female characters are I like, and there's lots of female characters that embody traits

1213
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,640
that I find attractive.

1214
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,640
Yeah.

1215
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,920
But I can't really, I don't, yeah, I can't really think of anyone who I'm like, oh, I

1216
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,920
wish I, you know, I would date her or like she represents, you know, my ideal woman or

1217
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
anything like that.

1218
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,920
Just close your eyes.

1219
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,960
What about Haruko from Pooley Cooley?

1220
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,280
We were both pretty into her.

1221
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,680
No, she's cool, but I'm not that attracted to her.

1222
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Yeah.

1223
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Right.

1224
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:27,080
Uh, if you, I mean, the, if you read in my comic, if you read the, the first chapter,

1225
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:32,760
the girl on the beanbag was designed with like what I find like visually attractive

1226
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
in mind.

1227
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
So I guess that you could look to this.

1228
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:42,000
So just literally Susie from Game Grumps, whatever she looks like, um, but yeah, and

1229
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,720
she doesn't have, she doesn't have any personality or anything.

1230
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,720
So it doesn't really.

1231
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,720
Yeah.

1232
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:53,720
She has, she has like no, I would totally date my Mimi from FLCL because she's broken

1233
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,280
and terrible and I love that.

1234
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,560
I would rather date Nina Mori from FLCL.

1235
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,640
Nina Mori, Nina Mori is the best Nina Mori is just kind of a child.

1236
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
That's a good, that's a good point.

1237
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,640
She's a child to you.

1238
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,640
She's a woman to me.

1239
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,640
Did you?

1240
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
I am a big fan of broken and terrible.

1241
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
Yeah.

1242
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,280
That's something that's definitely something I look for in a character.

1243
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,440
I like, I like it when a, when a girl is broken and terrible in just such a way that

1244
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,440
it's not quite your problem, but you can make it your problem.

1245
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,120
Dude, that's exactly what Nina Mori is.

1246
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,760
And she has that, oh God, which is wearing those, those pajamas with now to holy shit.

1247
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,680
That's the sexiest scene in all of the animation.

1248
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,680
Okay.

1249
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,280
I, I did in fact, as a child because like it's funny, I have a much harder time finding

1250
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,560
it attractive now because I cannot like, not me dog, they're very like, well, the characters

1251
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,960
in that show are just very young to me.

1252
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,320
We're like part of the narrative.

1253
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,560
I feel like I am them when I watch it.

1254
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,560
I don't know.

1255
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,200
I mean, I, I, when I was younger, I kind of didn't understand FLCL as much.

1256
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,840
So like, I think I only really understood it at an age where I couldn't relate to it

1257
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,840
as much.

1258
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
Yeah.

1259
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,640
But like when I was young, that Nina Mori scene was like, oh my God, this is the, I literally

1260
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,120
did for years call that the hottest scene in animation, just the way the pajamas don't

1261
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,800
quite fit her and everything, but when I think about like lollies and stuff, I kind of think

1262
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,600
of like this quote from what it's like Tuesdays with Morty or something.

1263
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,480
It's some book about an old guy and he gives the speech about how like he's, he, how he's

1264
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,840
every age and like he enjoys like putting himself in the position of like any age in

1265
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,240
his whole life when it's appropriate.

1266
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,920
I appreciate like, like, uh, Nia from Gernloggan or, or Nina Mori who are like, when it comes

1267
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,520
to anime, like I had a friend who was saying like, you know, like, I don't think it's weird

1268
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,520
to be attracted to because most anime characters are high school age and he's like, it's not

1269
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,880
really weird to be attracted to high schoolers because I remember that when I was in high

1270
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,640
school, I was attracted to these girls.

1271
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,000
Right.

1272
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,760
I totally agree.

1273
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,320
I mean, your tastes can change, but you can also put yourself into that mindset and like,

1274
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,000
yeah, I don't know.

1275
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,120
I find it harder to be attracted to anime characters who actually act their age.

1276
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,520
But if I can like, it depends if, if they're characters who like, you know, who, who like

1277
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,560
are younger, but they act like adults, then in my mind, it's like they're not like, you

1278
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,160
know, the numbers, right?

1279
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,800
I mean, they're fucking drawing.

1280
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,600
So however they act is going to dictate, you know, best waifu Angelica pickles.

1281
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:13,480
I know she's three years old, but when I'm watching the show, I feel like I'm Tommy.

1282
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,560
I feel like I'm one.

1283
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,480
So she's a woman.

1284
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Get the fuck out of here.

1285
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,200
That's what that's what all grown up was for.

1286
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,520
So that we could finally fuck her.

1287
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,960
That was the goal.

1288
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,360
All grown up when she became when she became 11.

1289
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,800
So we could finally play ball.

1290
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:31,960
Shall we?

1291
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,640
Shall we move on to the next person?

1292
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:33,960
Yeah.

1293
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,880
Who wants to go next?

1294
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:35,960
Me.

1295
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,200
My.

1296
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:44,120
Who does one of my favorite girls from from this year was this was the main character

1297
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,680
of a game called Mecha Nika.

1298
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,880
Her name is Nika, not to be confused with some comic called Nika.

1299
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:55,440
I love her because she goes out of her way to be as spiteful as I can be.

1300
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,920
And her rationalization for hating things is as in depth and insane as it is with me.

1301
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,920
So I find that extremely relatable.

1302
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,360
I don't think a relationship with her would work at all.

1303
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,520
But I find that very captivating personally.

1304
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,080
Number two is Maya Fey from the Phoenix Wright games, because I think she is

1305
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,800
ultimate in what I'd want from maturity from a woman, because she goes through so

1306
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,360
many terrible things, but she always acts like it's not getting to her.

1307
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,720
And she's really funny and fun to be around all the time.

1308
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,400
And the number one woman is Adeline from the Kirby games.

1309
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,120
That one from the Nintendo 64.

1310
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,040
Haven't even played it.

1311
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:31,680
Oh, dude, what?

1312
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,960
OK, that's just random as all.

1313
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,560
I only know her from fan art and from watching Digibro playing it.

1314
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,320
From my Let's Play.

1315
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,360
Yeah, like literally commented on like one of the first episodes of the

1316
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,720
Kirby 64 Let's Play, like, oh, my God, how have I never seen this character before?

1317
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,600
I would love with her over the next few days.

1318
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,440
Like he was commenting about being deeper and deeper down the ramp.

1319
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,680
How do you spell her name?

1320
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,440
I still can't remember.

1321
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,280
But OK, ADELINE.

1322
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,960
Wait, I didn't say that again.

1323
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,840
Addeline.

1324
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,880
Just so I had a line.

1325
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,800
OK, OK, super passionate about drawing and she will go to an ultimate

1326
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,120
dimension just to study and she will go along and like not talk much.

1327
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,000
So I could probably just talk to her constantly and she would just smile

1328
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,840
and listen and stuff and that'd be great.

1329
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,280
And this fan art is pretty cute.

1330
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,960
She just seems so passionate about what she does.

1331
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,560
And she's so good that she can make her paintings come to life.

1332
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,760
Being passionate is a very attractive quality.

1333
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,320
When she gets corrupted by a demon in the beginning, she draws something

1334
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,840
that's censored out so she could probably draw porn.

1335
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,120
Oh, dude, you know, that was a dick.

1336
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,000
Yeah. And and she has a really great tomboyish

1337
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,960
effect with being short haired, but she's got a skirt which conflicts with that.

1338
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,240
And that's adorable. So yeah.

1339
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,080
OK, I actually don't agree that being passionate is an attractive quality.

1340
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,960
That's because you want your women to have no personality.

1341
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,680
We established that I would kind of feel I would be I would be annoyed

1342
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,920
by a girl who wanted me to be into whatever she was into.

1343
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,560
I would rather one. No, I mean, no, no, no, no, no, it's not how it works.

1344
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,320
I was just willing to go along with whatever.

1345
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,640
Someone with a path in life for the mission.

1346
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:12,320
Yeah, I think I find passion attractive, not out of wanting them to be into.

1347
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,840
Like I don't want necessarily that they're into what I'm into or I'm into what they're into.

1348
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,840
Yeah.

1349
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:22,480
Like I do find it annoying if if a girl was like, you have to be into this

1350
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,440
because I'm into this. Of course.

1351
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,520
What I do like, however, is that I think the the people who can best

1352
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,480
understand passionate people are other passionate people.

1353
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,480
Totally, totally.

1354
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,760
Where like the last girlfriend I had, she did did not understand art at all.

1355
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,560
No understanding of artists, the artistic process or passion.

1356
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,960
She had no drive for anything, no passion.

1357
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,320
Yeah, it's going to get frustrating.

1358
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,880
Really, really difficult to communicate why I would want to do certain things

1359
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,840
or feel certain ways about things.

1360
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,680
It was impossible for her to understand.

1361
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,520
And it's pretty bad when you're trying to do something and this person demands

1362
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,680
your time for whatever reason.

1363
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,320
And then you're like, no, I have to do this.

1364
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:57,960
This is my thing.

1365
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,320
I think if I dated another artist, we would both spend a lot of time

1366
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,040
dedicating ourselves to our art.

1367
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,320
And to me, the ideal relationship is not one where you're fucking on each

1368
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,400
other's nuts all the time.

1369
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,800
It's more one where you both are sort of Jesus fucking loud as motorcycle.

1370
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,000
You're both sort of doing your own thing and and progressing in life

1371
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,360
and having this like narrative.

1372
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,440
But you're also supporting each other on the side and just sort of,

1373
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,840
you know, having each other around, not so much that your life is based

1374
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,160
on the other person, but that each of you has your own life that just happens

1375
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,840
to be connected, you know, which I think is how all of our friendships are.

1376
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,240
You know, pretty much that's exactly how it is.

1377
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,200
Probably nobody else will agree with.

1378
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,560
But if I had, I think in a girlfriend, I would actually prefer her

1379
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:45,120
not to understand me and to just sort of be kind of mystified by me.

1380
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,920
Well, then why do you hate women so much?

1381
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,720
I think you would.

1382
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,400
I think you want that until you have it because that's exactly what I had.

1383
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,720
My my ex-girlfriend was very mystified with everything I did.

1384
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,600
And very like intrigued.

1385
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:03,440
But the lack of understanding of why I do anything I do became a huge hurdle

1386
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,720
where it's like she cannot understand why it would take me an amount of time.

1387
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Like this is how she would always phrase it about videos coming out.

1388
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,440
She said, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't exist until it shows up

1389
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,960
in front of me, you know?

1390
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,680
Well, that's how the viewership is like.

1391
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,280
So she's a total viewer as opposed to a creator herself.

1392
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,560
Right. No, she's never made anything in her life.

1393
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,120
She has no creative spark whatsoever.

1394
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:32,240
And I think it was so difficult for her to comprehend how or why I would make things

1395
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,280
or like what the process was or where I came from when I was doing it.

1396
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,600
She had no comprehension.

1397
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,200
I can't even be friends with someone with no artistic spark.

1398
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:39,680
Like everyone.

1399
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,800
Yeah, I fucking hate people with no artistic spark.

1400
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,760
Fuck them.

1401
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,200
Did you and I have had this conversation before where I sort of view

1402
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,520
non-creative people as not human?

1403
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,040
I would agree with that completely.

1404
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,080
I'd say that's an essential part of being human, having a creative drive.

1405
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,840
Absolutely. Yeah.

1406
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,840
All right, made sure your wife is.

1407
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,760
Oh, gosh, I have many.

1408
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,800
But if you care to share it, I'll say a few.

1409
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,600
Well, Papyrus is already stated.

1410
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,960
Adorable cinnamon roll, precious innocent.

1411
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,040
All right.

1412
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,400
He's just so adorable.

1413
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,080
Anywho, moving on.

1414
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,560
His googly eyes.

1415
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,160
And his and his passion.

1416
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,480
Real quick, what what kind of voice do you think Papyrus should have?

1417
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,760
Because it's not like they're arguing about this.

1418
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,960
No, he does not have a skeletal voice.

1419
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,360
Wait, wait, let her answer. Damn it.

1420
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,840
I want to hear her opinion.

1421
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,400
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were asking.

1422
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,200
No, I want Major's opinion.

1423
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,120
Oh, I've already heard your fucking.

1424
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,720
Yeah, we argued about this.

1425
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,000
That's why I want her input.

1426
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,200
I honestly, I don't mind either.

1427
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,160
Either the first time I heard someone voice Papyrus,

1428
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:57,320
they had like this rather lowish sort of voice.

1429
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,480
I they were sort of making one character.

1430
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,080
I wish I knew what character it was from from movies.

1431
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:05,280
But anyway, so they had a low voice for him.

1432
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,760
And I think it fit pretty well.

1433
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:12,160
But then I heard someone try something similar to a Skeletor.

1434
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,880
And that also fit pretty well.

1435
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,960
I was like, oh, OK, that does work for the Skeletor.

1436
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,960
We have got to have a podcast discussion about the God awful voices

1437
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,120
that everyone has for Undertale characters.

1438
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,600
All the fan art, all the Undertale fan stuff is shit.

1439
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,440
It makes me sick for my stomach.

1440
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,320
I like the same thing. Not yours, mate.

1441
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,520
I like this great.

1442
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,880
I like the same thing.

1443
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,040
You like the stupid Skeletor.

1444
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,200
OK, no, wait, no.

1445
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,200
That's true.

1446
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:43,560
I think that he clearly has a Skeletor voice.

1447
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,160
I mean, come on, it's obvious.

1448
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,200
That doesn't necessarily mean that I prefer it.

1449
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,400
The fact that he says, yeah, yeah, it makes a Skeletor to me.

1450
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:56,480
But also, yes, I think it's meant to be sort of obnoxious.

1451
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,320
He does speak in all capitals and like the text noise he makes when he speaks.

1452
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,200
And he does have a very sort of that high

1453
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,800
falutin, like, yeah, kind of personality.

1454
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,880
This isn't the Papyrus Voice Podcast.

1455
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,120
This is the Papyrus Voice Podcast.

1456
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,840
I want to talk about video games.

1457
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,680
We're done with that.

1458
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,800
Let's just continue with the wife.

1459
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,560
Go on, Mage.

1460
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,520
Let's name some others.

1461
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,880
OK, so from assassination classroom, Karma, if anyone knows that, Redhead.

1462
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,560
Redhead, Psycho.

1463
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,040
Oh, the bed.

1464
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,120
Yeah, OK, OK.

1465
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,920
Super smart, full of himself, guy that's really good at everything.

1466
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,960
Basically Sasuke.

1467
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,320
The last episode I saw was the one where he shows up.

1468
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,640
Oh, yeah, we should continue watching that.

1469
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,280
But anyway, he's he's he's he's good.

1470
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,080
He's a good character.

1471
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,080
I like him a lot.

1472
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,440
He's such a little shit.

1473
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,640
Anyone else near and dear to your heart?

1474
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,640
Jenos from One Punch Man.

1475
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,240
He he he's he's such a good wife.

1476
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,360
He's a good fuckboy.

1477
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,320
There's no doubt about it.

1478
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:56,600
He's pretty Moe in the way that he completely fails and everything.

1479
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,840
Yeah, in spite of being amazing.

1480
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,640
It's endearing, though.

1481
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,440
It's quite endearing about that.

1482
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,040
I like it.

1483
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,880
Precious.

1484
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,600
And he's like the way he's devoted his sensei to the borderline creepy.

1485
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,000
It's just hilarious.

1486
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,160
I really I really need to watch the anime.

1487
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:10,760
You sure do.

1488
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,400
It's great.

1489
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,720
I don't have watched it yet.

1490
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,080
I've read I've read the manga.

1491
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:14,920
Well, I did too.

1492
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,760
But I and at first I thought it was whatever.

1493
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,400
Who cares what I think?

1494
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:17,840
Let's move on.

1495
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,640
Tom, white foods.

1496
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,440
What do you got for us?

1497
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,160
Um, I've been thinking about this the entire time because I don't I mean,

1498
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,880
I guess like like rarity seems like the obvious answer.

1499
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,880
But like so much of my like rarity bias that I put out there was like

1500
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,960
influenced by the audience like observing that I had it.

1501
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,800
So I would like I say magnify it for the sake of entertainment

1502
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,160
and then it just kind of spiraled out of control.

1503
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,320
But I think I guess the character, I would say, definitely became like

1504
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,080
waifu tier status was probably Tali from Mass Effect.

1505
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:47,920
I really liked her.

1506
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,800
I sure that's a good one.

1507
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,120
Oh, she is definitely.

1508
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,800
I'm surprised I wasn't on Jesse's waifu.

1509
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,600
It was on my list.

1510
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,040
I said it.

1511
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:53,520
It was.

1512
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,200
Yeah, I'm stealing your wife.

1513
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,880
So Tali was fucking awesome.

1514
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,600
Now, the great thing is when we can all come together and appreciate truly top tier.

1515
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,400
Yeah, I think we all have a couple that we share amongst ourselves.

1516
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,000
Yeah.

1517
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,400
Yeah.

1518
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,800
You know, I don't know if anyone shares any of mine.

1519
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:08,720
I don't know.

1520
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,240
I don't want to share any of mine.

1521
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,520
I think I think mine are from two obscure of shows.

1522
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,480
I don't think I'd be able to deal with women who smoke.

1523
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,680
I just don't think I'd be able to deal with that's true.

1524
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,520
I don't care for did you like smoking girls, though, for whatever reason?

1525
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,040
Yeah, I do.

1526
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,440
I do.

1527
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,560
I think it's fucking cool.

1528
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,240
That's why I do think the girl doing a locked room.

1529
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,160
And my husband is saying is very like attractive, but I don't know.

1530
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,360
I'm just I guess I'm just not into the.

1531
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,400
I think I could probably pull some waifus that I that I would share with people

1532
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,320
if I went like beyond the like top five ones that I like always think about,

1533
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,880
you know, like like Kiruno, your favorite girl of all time from everyone's favorite.

1534
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,480
You know, it was not a waifu or emo.

1535
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,560
She's just the best show.

1536
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,080
She's just my favorite main in a fighting game.

1537
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,840
I'd like to change all my waifus to just her because she is the best.

1538
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,680
Hey, guys, I have an idea about how we can, you know, speaking of male waifus,

1539
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,720
I think I know how we can become male waifus for a lot of women and gay men.

1540
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,120
How's that?

1541
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,920
In this podcast is by talking like, like, like, like potentially

1542
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:13,640
flirtedly to to mage so that any women who can put themselves.

1543
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,440
OK, right.

1544
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,440
And on that note, thanks for watching, everybody.

1545
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,160
That's the way we need this podcast for this waifus date.

1546
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,120
We haven't even gotten to him yet.

1547
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,840
Oh, I'm sorry. Good. Good. Please.

1548
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,520
Friska is my favorite because she's the Walter White of Homestuck.

1549
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,440
She did nothing wrong.

1550
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:36,840
And anybody who thinks she did is a doesn't understand.

1551
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,760
Yeah, I love how this is.

1552
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,720
Making a statement both about both stories, like both Walter White and

1553
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,880
yeah, you're doing that.

1554
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,560
They did nothing wrong.

1555
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:53,960
Friska is Friska's way, way less morally ambiguous than Walter White.

1556
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,560
Walter White did way worse.

1557
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,200
Now, now see just a minute here.

1558
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,000
He certainly did not.

1559
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,480
Walter was right.

1560
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,160
Who else you got?

1561
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,360
Let's not get into this.

1562
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,560
There's basically just any character that starts off as a bitch

1563
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,040
and sometimes just ends as a bitch and is a female.

1564
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,560
That's Kira, though. You've described Kira, though.

1565
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,120
OK, maybe I like that.

1566
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,920
I don't think he'd like.

1567
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,720
I don't think she's the right kind of bitch.

1568
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,480
Well, they have to be.

1569
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,400
She fits this criteria.

1570
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,640
You just specified they have to be sort of.

1571
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,440
Basically, everything that I'm not.

1572
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,600
They have to actually be cool.

1573
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,560
They have to be confident and arrogant.

1574
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,400
Kira knows a model.

1575
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,360
She's super cool.

1576
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,240
She loves video games.

1577
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,400
So she loses out on the like actual, like, OK,

1578
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,920
compare her to fucking Friska.

1579
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,520
Like Friska is actually cool.

1580
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,880
Like she does cool things in the narrative.

1581
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,440
She's no Kira, though. She's no Kira, though.

1582
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,280
She's the best.

1583
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:42,720
Didn't she?

1584
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,960
Didn't Friska get like one of the like the biggest

1585
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,320
wham moments in the story?

1586
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,960
It was like she executed a plan

1587
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,120
and like someone achieved God tier as a result.

1588
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,160
And it was like, well, she achieved God tier, but she was a little too cool

1589
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,080
by that point.

1590
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,800
Here's the thing about bitches and going back to analytical logic.

1591
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,720
You know, people who are jerks ignore ninety nine point nine percent of the world.

1592
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,600
You like women who would give attention,

1593
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,440
bitchy attention to certain guys doesn't make sense.

1594
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,760
So my fantasy of a bitch would be one who somehow needs some skill that I have.

1595
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,480
Need some like she needs you to teach her like she hates you,

1596
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,240
but she has to keep you around because of a skill you have.

1597
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,000
Or that I mean, that doesn't make sense that she just can't.

1598
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,840
So she just basically have basically.

1599
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,320
She's a nymphomaniac and you have the greatest dick in the world.

1600
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,520
And she cannot settle for anything less.

1601
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,280
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1602
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,400
Hang on. What do you just described of holding out a resource

1603
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,480
to make a woman have a relationship with you?

1604
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,560
That's what they call rape.

1605
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,240
And that's the whole patriarchy.

1606
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,320
I don't want to hear any more.

1607
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,600
It is very coercive.

1608
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,080
More like she like hates the world,

1609
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,040
but she has to make YouTube videos, proclaiming it.

1610
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,240
And she needs someone to edit them.

1611
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,760
And so, you know, like they don't like rapist.

1612
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,600
And she can only only pick you.

1613
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,080
So are you saying that if Digi was a girl, he'd be your waifu?

1614
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,720
Nice. Yeah.

1615
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,440
What did the Describe?

1616
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,160
Isn't that like, uh, Kirino?

1617
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,720
I don't know. It's all Kirino.

1618
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,720
She's the best waifu.

1619
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,160
We can all agree on that.

1620
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,440
OK. And on that, it feels like we've run out of steam.

1621
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,720
Let's wrap this thing up.

1622
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,880
Anyone got any last minute things to say they want to say about waifus?

1623
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,160
Because that's what this was about.

1624
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,000
Waifus, have we come to a consensus?

1625
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,560
Akane is my waifu.

1626
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,520
I just want to say, fellas, don't make tulpas of your waifus.

1627
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,040
Please.

1628
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,600
I'm going to go and make a tulpa right now.

1629
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,920
That's a risky game.

1630
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,880
What if you can't get rid of it?

1631
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,520
If you're thinking about making a tulpa of your waifu,

1632
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,720
bear in mind that everything she thinks is actually things you're thinking

1633
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,400
and you're really fucking yourself.

1634
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,120
Yeah, you're wrong.

1635
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,640
Even if you can, even if you can somehow summon the force of will

1636
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,040
to un-tulpa yourself, that's murder.

1637
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,880
That's true.

1638
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,840
That's true.

1639
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,000
You're losing that game coming and going.

1640
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,360
You can create life you're responsible for.

1641
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,080
No matter how real or fake it is.

1642
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:00,960
Amen.

1643
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,600
Amen.

1644
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,080
All right.

1645
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,160
Well, thanks for watching, everybody.

1646
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,120
That's it for this week.

1647
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,160
If you've got any topics you want to suggest,

1648
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,800
put them in the comments down below and we'll add them to our topic list.

1649
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,880
All right, everybody.

1650
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:12,600
Say goodbye.

1651
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,440
Say goodbye.

1652
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,440
Bye.

1653
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,440
Goodbye.

1654
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,960
