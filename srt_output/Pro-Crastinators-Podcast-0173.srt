00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm the best guy ever, and we're joined today by Hippo Gibbontake.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Boy, howdy, bitches.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ah, Munchy.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You know, some shows have theme songs that have cute little jingle catchphrases,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and we just have Nate saying hello in the exact same tone of voice every single time.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't know how we do it.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Munchy, we have a theme song.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We have an opening jingle.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Or something right?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's not memorable at all, it doesn't even count.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I mean, who would remember that?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I remember that it's like guitar strums.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Munchy, literally everyone remembers the theme song that I made like four years ago.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Not that one.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I mean, that's true.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's our outro now.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's our outro song.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is that the outro?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't even watch it.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, we use this as the outro song.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Listen to the PCP once in a while.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, that's Ben, and also Jesse.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yep, that's me.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tom's here.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I come before all of you, a changed man.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah?

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, boy.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Tell me.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How's that?

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Tell me more.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're going to get into it later, I guess.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, cancel.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Tom's kicked.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't want it.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you have an adamantium spine now, like bullseye?

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Did you finally?

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
God, I wish.

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
God, I wish.

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I was hoping for that.

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, let me just say that first of all, last week was the Pony episode, and everybody

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
loved it and especially loved my story about the roller coaster.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So, if you haven't heard that, go listen to it.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You know, I'm thinking about bringing back the Highlights channel just for that story.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Razorback?

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Diamondback.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Diamondback.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Everyone, praise me, praise me.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I appreciate that.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You know, I always think about that.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Like, oh man, we should cut out the good parts and upload them on their own.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean, we definitely should.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And then I think about how we have that Highlights channel, but then I think about like, no,

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
if I'm cutting out my good parts, I'm putting them on my channel.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Fuck those guys.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I mean, that's the problem.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Anything said on the podcast is the intellectual property of all of us.

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Communism in the PCP.

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh my God.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No.

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Communism, that's capitalism.

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's the same way you-

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wait, no, no, no.

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If we-

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Immediately.

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We're immediately into this.

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why?

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If we all-

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Shut up.

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Shut the fuck up.

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm just saying the definition, if we all mutually own the means of production, that's capitalism.

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I mean communism.

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, you slipped up.

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's the same line you dropped on me when you took my hilarious, I'm just being cool

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
joke and put it on a t-shirt and tried to reap the fucking benefits of it.

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, it was on the show.

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's my intellectual property.

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, guess what?

81
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now we all own it.

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So there you go.

83
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, that's-

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We don't.

85
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm gonna sell a better version of the shirt someday.

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, I've got a small announcement and that today, August 18th, the day we're recording,

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
is my dog Sessho's second birthday.

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's his birthday today.

89
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh my god.

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And he's two years old and he's sweet.

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Time to put it down.

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I just came-

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now how is his diet coming?

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because he was just so unbelievably chunky and just like honestly fat.

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Like honestly-

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's not fat.

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Use the word fat.

98
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Obeseven.

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like a sausage dog.

100
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know about obese.

101
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's fucked up of you to say.

102
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He's not obese.

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He was double his size.

104
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He was double his specie size.

105
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We all know that BMI is a terrible indicator.

106
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You need to use more advanced metrics to determine dog obesity.

107
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You need to use skin fold calipers.

108
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And measure the waist and things of that nature.

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why is it considered wrong for a dog to be fat?

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They don't have to do anything.

112
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They don't have a job.

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They can be as fucking obese as they want.

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I mean if they're fat enough, they'll fucking die.

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I want my dog to be fat.

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They'll fucking die.

117
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That means he's well fed.

118
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It means no.

119
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No.

120
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know what?

122
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm convinced.

123
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Here's, I guess, here's a progress pic.

124
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Give it a second.

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's uploading.

126
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He's, you know...

127
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh my goodness.

128
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Lay on his side.

129
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Emotionless.

130
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Emotionless.

131
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Progress might not be the word I would use in this.

132
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you sure that's not a picture of a dog corpse?

133
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Listen, I want it to be known.

134
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That name.

135
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You think of Nate in your mind.

136
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He lifts.

137
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He runs.

138
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's a fitness sort of guy.

139
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
His dog, the fattest dog on earth.

140
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's built like a faucet.

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's not his fault.

142
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Nate, I just have to assume that he gets kibble.

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just lines in every one of his pockets and he's just,

144
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
oh, Seshaw, just come over here

145
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and then just fucking pour his kibble down his throat

146
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
as hard and fast as he can.

147
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's his birthday.

148
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're not allowed to fat shame him on his birthday.

149
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's doing everything right.

150
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Can you even pick him up?

151
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We were, he is kind of hard to pick up.

152
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He has a,

153
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Are you saying it's a two man job?

154
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a two man job to lift.

155
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You have a system of police when you need to get him off.

156
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We just went to PetSmart.

157
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We got him his birthday toy.

158
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We got him some birthday treats.

159
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then we went straight to the dog park.

160
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We were there hanging out for a while.

161
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We just left.

162
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

163
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He's sniffing.

164
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He's hanging out with the other boys.

165
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's going around having a good time.

166
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And I'm going to go pick up Michelle and him later

167
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
after he's had his fill.

168
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's just the best little boy.

169
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He's doing so great out there.

170
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Pick them both up from dog and girlfriend kindergarten.

171
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's thriving.

172
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He is thriving.

173
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Dog parks are girlfriend kindergarten.

174
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Can we get some dog emotes in the chat for Secho's birthday, please?

175
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you.

176
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But I just want to let you all guys all know,

177
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
as I'm sure you'll remember from our famous episode on Furries,

178
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
there was that one fur suitor of a kangaroo

179
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that had the giant, giant stomach.

180
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to get like a really shitty thumbnail to show you guys,

181
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
but then a living fall will be able to show like a real image in the show notes.

182
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But just take a look at like this.

183
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I think this is the perfect representation of what Secho will become

184
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
if he were turning into a fursuit.

185
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, this is just like...

186
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, no.

187
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's not right.

188
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That looks like an ancient like Roman torture device.

189
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Like you put someone in there and you boil it

190
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and you make it and they burn.

191
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, dude.

192
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know what I mean?

193
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So inside there, like there's a human inside there, right?

194
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But like the belly is some sort of like bomb.

195
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I remember like...

196
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, so the iron ball or something.

197
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not sure if it was this one,

198
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but there are many suits like this as I'm sure you can imagine.

199
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's extremely arousing like 90% of the population.

200
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And so I made an edit of one of them where it's two robs

201
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
on either side of them from the subspace emissary

202
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and they're pulling apart the giant subspace bomb that is his stomach.

203
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that's what I was imagining.

204
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's disgusting.

205
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, suiting in that count as vor,

206
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
like he's big and fat and there's a person inside there.

207
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is that...

208
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know, dude.

209
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Was it deleted?

210
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Did someone delete it?

211
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why was it deleted?

212
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No.

213
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh my God.

214
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In the gross disgusting audio links.

215
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh no one can make fun of my fucking dog.

216
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh no one can know the truth.

217
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have a fucking force feeding him four.

218
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
All my dog can be able to eat me one day.

219
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I watched this movie many times.

220
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just watched again the other day,

221
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the movie Seven, directed by David Fincher

222
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman,

223
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
great detective, weird psycho story.

224
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And the guy, the bad guy kills people

225
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
based on the Seven Deadly Sins

226
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
because he's trying to, whatever, correct society or whatever.

227
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And the first one they'll find...

228
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's the edgiest movie I've ever seen in my life

229
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and I absolutely love it.

230
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I watch it all the time.

231
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's so good.

232
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I am Jesus Christ and Satan in one body.

233
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And the first kill they find is a super fat guy

234
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
who, there was a gun to his head

235
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and he was forced to continuously eat spaghetti

236
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
until his stomach exploded.

237
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
His skull shut and just kept feeding me.

238
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He fed me.

239
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He fed me.

240
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Pretty much.

241
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's pretty much how it went down.

242
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's what you're going to do to your dog

243
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
on his third birthday.

244
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, no, what's the rationale behind that?

245
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, I'm going to force this person to eat more,

246
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
like, obviously, eating more to get him more fat.

247
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, well, I'll tell you why.

248
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Like, most of you are just making the problem, really.

249
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No, no, no, no.

250
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, the guy was already incredibly fat.

251
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sure.

252
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The bad guy was aware that he thinks that, you know,

253
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Gluttony's a sin.

254
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He doesn't like this big fat guy.

255
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Did he also, like...

256
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So he comes to his...

257
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Aside from being fat,

258
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
did he, like, do anything else that was bad?

259
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No.

260
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
His crime was simply being really fat.

261
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why that guy?

262
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's correct.

263
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, there's lots of really fat people.

264
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And this man would kill them, I assume.

265
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's one of those where the villain thinks he's deep

266
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and that he's not just a crazy asshole idiot.

267
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Like, another thing he does is he goes to, like,

268
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
a model's house and he cuts off her nose

269
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
so she'll be horribly disfigured.

270
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But he, like, he bandages her so she won't die.

271
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And in the one hand, he gives her a telephone

272
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to call for help.

273
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And in the other hand,

274
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
he gives her a bottle of sleeping pills.

275
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So she can choose to kill herself

276
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
so that she won't have to deal with being scarred forever.

277
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Or she could call the cops and live,

278
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but she'll be disfigured and she kills herself.

279
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because society's fucked up, man.

280
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's so fucked up.

281
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's about, like, so superficial.

282
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Every time I watch that movie, I just really...

283
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I hate John Doe so much.

284
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He's such a hypocrite.

285
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And, like, I guess that's the point.

286
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because, like, the whole movie, you know, he's trying to be deep.

287
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Like, he thinks, like, oh, it's your fault I'm killing you

288
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
because everyone is so bad.

289
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's why they have to...

290
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But, like, I...

291
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Not to spoil it, but his final victim

292
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
totally did nothing wrong at all.

293
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

294
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He is willing to kill innocents.

295
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He is.

296
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And that's not exactly what I do.

297
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And, like, he makes up some...

298
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He makes up some flimsy...

299
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's not the coolest thing.

300
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He makes up some flimsy justification

301
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
for how it could fit his stupid guidelines

302
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and his dumb gimmick.

303
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And he's like, oh, no, because you'll be so mad

304
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
that I killed a totally unisted person

305
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that you'll be Wrath.

306
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And the kill will be the true villain.

308
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
His final one.

309
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And that's, like, yeah, makes no sense.

310
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're just an idiot.

311
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Let's...

312
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's spoil it a little...

313
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, spoilers the next, like, minute or whatever.

314
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So, the point of the movie is

315
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
he eventually...

316
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He creates Wrath out of his actions

317
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
out of one of the two police officers,

318
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
which is Brad Pitt, who's, like, investigating this guy.

319
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He turns him into Wrath

320
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
as his final masterpiece of the final sin.

321
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And he, John Doe, is Envy,

322
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
who envies the cop in his simple life.

323
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And he kills his wife and chops off her head

324
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and as it delivered, like, to their final, like, showdown place.

325
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And it's gonna...

326
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So it's still has to trick him into becoming a murderer,

327
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
which he succeeds at,

328
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
because society, man, what?

329
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's kind of...

330
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's what?

331
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is that even a society problem?

332
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't know about that one.

333
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't know about that one.

334
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I hate how Morgan Freeman is, like,

335
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
trying to stop him from shooting John Doe,

336
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
because it's like, oh, don't do it.

337
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't do it.

338
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You'll fulfill his prophecy.

339
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You'll play right into his hands.

340
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who cares? He's gonna be fucking dead.

341
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It doesn't matter.

342
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
His prophecy is fucking stupid.

343
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's that old JRP trope of,

344
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
if you kill the bad guy, you're as bad as him.

345
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're automatically as bad as the bad guy.

346
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The only thing that I wish had been different

347
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
is that before Brad Pitt shot him,

348
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
he leaned in close and said,

349
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you know this is fucking stupid, right?

350
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This makes no sense and your plan is wrong

351
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and didn't shot him.

352
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I fucking love that movie.

353
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I watch it all the time.

354
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Like, just so you know,

355
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm gonna kill you,

356
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
but I don't feel like I'm wrath.

357
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't feel like you succeeded.

358
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I think you're a failure. Goodbye. Bam.

359
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, that's why he should have let the courts take care of it.

360
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He should have let society deal with this guy.

361
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's what Morgan Freeman's saying.

362
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Morgan Freeman's disgusting.

363
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He doesn't deserve my taxpayer money

364
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to pay for his trial. Fuck him.

365
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, that's...

366
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, he probably would have got off

367
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
in an insanity play anyway.

368
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't even think Brad...

369
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What would Brad Pitt have even been convicted of?

370
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I mean, he did kill a man

371
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
who was not...

372
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, but like in circumstances,

373
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
he would have got off with a slap.

374
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He's a cop. Come on.

375
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He did just kill his wife.

376
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think if your wife's severed head is in a box,

377
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think they put you in court

378
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and they're like,

379
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
okay, we can all see why you did that.

380
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He'd have gotten like six months of community service.

381
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You know what he'd probably fucking get?

382
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Remember in that other Samuel Jackson movie,

383
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
A Time to Kill when he kills those two guys

384
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
who raped and mutilated his daughter?

385
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is that the one?

386
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes, he deserves to die and I hope they burn in hell.

387
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, and even though he literally did it,

388
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
everyone knows they did jury nullification

389
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and just said, no, innocent.

390
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He gets to go free.

391
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You know Brad Pitt's going to get that shit.

392
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No one's going to convict this guy

393
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
of killing like a serial killer who doesn't kill the wife.

394
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He's going to get like a month of mandatory

395
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
emotional counseling or something.

396
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When you respond in,

397
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
in like some sort of like code in your DNA,

398
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
there's some sort of like constant tornado

399
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
of trash and filth just all around you,

400
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
constantly blowing and picks up speed.

401
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And that's weird old like movies from the 2000s

402
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
that you're just bringing up the PCP.

403
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It was last samurai.

404
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now it's seven.

405
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's going to be some,

406
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
it's going to be fucking,

407
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
how the Grinch did Christmas.

408
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I watched a lot of starring Jim Carrey next.

409
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

410
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I watched a lot of movies.

411
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What can I say?

412
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know, the Grinch,

413
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the Jim Carrey Grinch is a great film.

414
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's so good.

415
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's so good.

416
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm so interested in it.

417
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's revisionist history and that it wasn't good.

418
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm so sick of people.

419
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Was it actually good?

420
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's actually kind of good, yeah.

421
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's great.

422
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
People have always pretended that it's not good

423
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and I don't know why.

424
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Me and Ben watched it.

425
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's leagues better than the cartoon.

426
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We watched it like last time I was here

427
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
like a couple of months ago.

428
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I expected it to be like kind of like boring

429
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
just like another kid's movie

430
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
because I remember it being really funny.

431
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I wanted to watch it

432
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
because I thought it was going to be really funny

433
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and it was.

434
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And it was just incredible

435
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
because Jim Carrey as the Grinch

436
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is the best like typed cast person

437
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
like in the world.

438
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Like it is just the perfect combination.

439
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I feel like after the events of the Grinch

440
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
starring Jim Carrey,

441
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that interpretation of the Grinch

442
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
went on a grand like America Trek

443
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and found in Slime City

444
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and was the original man

445
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and started the original film.

446
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What's the connection?

447
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He just looks like the kind of guy

448
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
who he does have that look about him.

449
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You put that Grinch suit

450
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
in like a business suit on top of it

451
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and had him smoking a cigar.

452
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He might be the founder.

453
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He might be the final boss.

454
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He might be N1 or N0

455
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
at the head of Slime Corp.

456
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Jim Carrey is the Grinch.

457
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Jim Carrey.

458
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I like how every single shot

459
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
in live action Grinch

460
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is a Dutch angle.

461
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Like it's just constantly skewed.

462
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Like they cannot center the camera.

463
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
They cannot like focus

464
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
or balance it whatsoever.

465
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The camera is like in a centrifuge

466
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the entire time.

467
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well maybe that's to symbolize

468
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
that the whole movie is taking place

469
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
inside a twisting falling snowflake

470
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
which you see at the beginning.

471
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Wow.

472
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It was really fucked up

473
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
how the Grinch just tied up St. Louis who

474
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and he just shoved her through

475
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
the fucking trash compactor

476
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
in the postal office.

477
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
She didn't deserve that.

478
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That didn't fit into his theme

479
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
of killing only the fools

480
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
who deserved it

481
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
who liked Christmas.

482
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
She didn't even like Christmas

483
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
at that point in the movie.

484
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What the fuck Grinch?

485
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That was, you know,

486
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I would have called it a gizomed

487
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Coots Verk if it wasn't for that one moment

488
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
but it really broke my immersion.

489
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You know, I wish that at the end of 7

490
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Brad Pitt's character had said

491
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
oh yeah, well guess what?

492
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Secretly, I'm you the whole time.

493
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm Tyler Durden.

494
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You killed your own wife.

495
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So, how do you like that?

496
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Bitch.

497
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And maybe Christmas isn't so bad after all.

498
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And then Brad Pitt carved

499
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the stuffed who beast.

500
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He got the greatest drift of all

501
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that Christmas.

502
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
His wife's sever head in the mail.

503
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You know what?

504
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Kevin Spacey just wanted to teach him

505
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the true meaning of the holidays.

506
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know what is like

507
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the worst, most decadent convenience

508
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
that we have?

509
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah.

510
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
By which I mean it's a good thing

511
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
but I lack the self-control

512
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
to have it in my life.

513
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's having YouTube

514
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
on the PlayStation 4.

515
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
On the TV.

516
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Because every night I lay down

517
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and I'm like oh boy,

518
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm gonna watch a movie.

519
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What great fucking movie

520
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
will I expose myself?

521
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm gonna expand

522
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
by cultural palette,

523
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
by watching a great movie tonight.

524
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And instead it's like

525
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
oh no wait,

526
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I better listen to Noah Caldwell

527
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Gervais talk about

528
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Baldur's Gate for three hours.

529
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah.

530
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Damn.

531
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hey, you know on that

532
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I just watched the first time.

533
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Totally worth it.

534
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I just watched it.

535
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

536
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
After all the...

537
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's worthless but I like it.

538
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah.

539
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's great.

540
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I want more of it all the time.

541
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The new Quentin Serentino movie,

542
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sharon Tate,

543
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
what's his name?

544
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What's that?

545
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Roman Polanski.

546
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I went and I watched

547
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Rosemary's Baby

548
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
with Michelle just the other day

549
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and it was great.

550
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It was like the first

551
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
like modern horror ever made

552
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
or something.

553
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It was pretty fucking dope.

554
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Way into it.

555
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Highly recommended.

556
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I've always been like

557
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
for a while there

558
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I was just totally enraptured

559
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
in the typhoon of YouTube content

560
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and I would basically consume it

561
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
to the exclusion of all other things

562
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
but I've recently like

563
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
really flipped that around.

564
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm almost exclusively...

565
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Like I do watch some YouTube series

566
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
there's a specific one

567
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
that I think Hippo's also watched

568
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
about a guy walking across Wales

569
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
in a straight line.

570
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Fantastic.

571
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I like that a lot

572
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
but like I barely watch

573
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
eating like vlogs

574
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
or anything like that now.

575
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Now it's all movies

576
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and all like real pieces of art

577
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
that I actually enjoy

578
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and it's fucking fantastic.

579
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's so good.

580
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
My audible has never gotten

581
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
as much use as it has

582
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
in like the past like two months

583
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and it's fantastic.

584
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I should get into some of those books.

585
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
On the one hand there's like

586
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
oh don't consume like

587
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
easy to consume content

588
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
because it's not as rich as

589
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the rich content that you know you like more.

590
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's good.

591
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah but like

592
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I have had this sort of like

593
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
in the back of my head

594
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in the back of my mind for like ever

595
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
that I should get around to

596
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
experiencing every video game

597
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
that I have

598
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
whether I got it in a sale or for free

599
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I should experience all of them

600
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in my library.

601
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I should you know

602
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
watch all of these movies

603
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that I've been meaning to watch

604
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
all these TV shows

605
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and I found that it's just like

606
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
it's just stressful thinking

607
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
that I have to do that.

608
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
100%.

609
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Like I would much rather

610
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
not give a shit

611
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and then be like

612
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
oh yeah I'd never seen

613
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
like Die Hard.

614
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I still haven't seen Die Hard

615
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and I'd be like

616
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
oh what the fuck

617
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you'd never seen that

618
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and I'd be like yeah

619
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
what are you going to do?

620
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You want to fight about it

621
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
or kill you?

622
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Kill me?

623
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
100%

624
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
because that's another project

625
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
that you'll have in your mind

626
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you'll get more and more

627
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
an option overload

628
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
you'll get more and more things

629
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
like oh gotta do this

630
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and I gotta do this

631
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and I gotta do this

632
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and we'll just clutter up your mind

633
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you really gotta reduce

634
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
as much clutter in your brain as possible.

635
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You know what I think is the

636
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the issue with that

637
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think we all as human beings

638
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
we perceive the world as though

639
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
we're immortal

640
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
we really from like

641
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
as soon as possible

642
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
should start to rationalize

643
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
like okay I'm going to live for 80 years

644
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
like did you did in that one big

645
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
vlog where he broke down

646
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
like I've got like 80 years to live

647
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I want to consume like

648
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
every anime ever made

649
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I've got this much time

650
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm going to sleep for this many hours

651
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I've got exactly this many hours

652
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
to like work

653
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and this may to enjoy media

654
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
like what am I going to

655
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
slot into that time

656
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
makes a lot of sense to do things that way

657
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
sounds like the worst possible way to live

658
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I mean maybe, maybe

659
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
it seems to work for him

660
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
specifically with his career

661
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and the fact that he just does

662
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
like watching anime a lot

663
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
but like for me

664
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I guess when people give you money

665
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
for watching anime

666
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
yeah it makes perfect sense to do

667
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
80 years watching anime

668
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I could technically

669
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I mean get paid to do

670
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
like to experience media

671
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and then tell you about it

672
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
it's just that I got bored of that

673
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and I stopped

674
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you know

675
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like it's something that I'm not

676
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
as into

677
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I think most people will eventually

678
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and like it just

679
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
it weighs on my mind this idea that

680
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't know

681
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I should get around to certain things

682
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
because so much of what I do consume

683
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
is people telling me about

684
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
video games that are good

685
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
let me tell you

686
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you don't have to worry about all that

687
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
because anything you're thinking about consuming

688
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
is nothing but a trick

689
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
is nothing but a lie

690
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
placed before you

691
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
by the capitalist hierarchy

692
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
in order to siphon power away from you

693
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and towards them

694
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
don't trust any of it

695
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
oh my god

696
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
what about this copy of Das Kapital

697
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
especially Das Kapital

698
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
yeah

699
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
no

700
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
unironically agree

701
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I feel constant guilt

702
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
every time that I consume

703
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
any piece of media

704
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
because like

705
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I've consumed enough fucking media

706
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've seen everything

707
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I've read everything

708
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I should be

709
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
instead of

710
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
continuing to watch movies

711
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and read comics and shit

712
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
should I not be like

713
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
in Budapest right now

714
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
or like seeing something for myself

715
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
you know

716
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
traveling the world on camelback

717
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
yeah

718
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
no I feel ya

719
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
as opposed to like playing the new JRPG

720
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
which I feel

721
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
probably would get a lot more out of like

722
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know

723
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
visiting Myanmar

724
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
visiting China

725
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
seeing

726
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't know India

727
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
probably you know

728
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
but of course

729
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
but you don't have

730
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
but you don't

731
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
but you can't have the freedom

732
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
to do cool stuff like that

733
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
because you've got loved ones

734
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
who go

735
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
where'd you go

736
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
why aren't you with me

737
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
this

738
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
so you know

739
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
all you can do is just

740
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
waste your fucking life

741
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
continuing to consume media

742
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and wishing you were other places

743
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
god I hate my loved ones

744
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
you know

745
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
it's the ultimate trap of capitalism

746
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
having loved ones

747
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I agree

748
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Tom Tom

749
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
hey

750
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
travel's never done anything for me

751
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
with all these things

752
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you gotta look at

753
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
your own personal

754
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
sort of situation

755
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that you're in

756
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
like for me

757
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think we talked about this

758
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
on an old PCP a while ago

759
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
but I

760
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
only

761
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I built a very tall empire

762
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I didn't really branch out

763
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
of the few

764
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
stories and movies that I had

765
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and I basically just

766
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
watched them over and over

767
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
so I'm pretty

768
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
immediate illiterate

769
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and so I feel like

770
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you know

771
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can't really travel

772
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
anymore than I already have

773
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I've already

774
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
went on this giant fucking

775
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
globe-trying adventure

776
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
last month

777
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
for 30 days

778
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
where I raced across

779
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and over and over again

780
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
but you know

781
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I can't do that anymore

782
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and I'm gonna be in college

783
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
for a while

784
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm just gonna buckle down

785
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
with some movies

786
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
because I only watch

787
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
YouTube videos

788
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that's not good

789
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm gonna get something

790
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm gonna get something else

791
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
in my body

792
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
there's definitely

793
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
what you do specifically

794
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
there's definitely like

795
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
a trap

796
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
that I fall into a lot

797
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
which is like

798
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
all or nothing

799
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
for a thing

800
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
like

801
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
ah man

802
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
media sucks

803
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I should do everything

804
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
other than media

805
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
like it has to be

806
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
all good or all bad

807
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
so whatever is bad

808
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
it's all good

809
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but traveling is often

810
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
really annoying

811
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and when you get to a place

812
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
unless the view is nice

813
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
unless it's actually

814
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
a nice place

815
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
it's just the same

816
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
as where you were

817
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
there's a pavement

818
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
there's a car

819
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
there's a guy

820
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
maybe he speaks in gibberish

821
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
but you know

822
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
it's just

823
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
it's mostly the same

824
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
some nonsense gobbledygook

825
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
because humans have like

826
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you know

827
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
they've made the world

828
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
the same place

829
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
basically

830
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
it's habitable

831
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
you'll survive

832
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
you're talking about

833
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
traveling right now

834
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
traveling yeah

835
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
like

836
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
like the thing

837
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that the reason

838
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
the video series

839
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
about the guy

840
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
walking in a straight line

841
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
across Wales

842
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
is so interesting

843
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
is because

844
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
he is like

845
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I thought you meant like

846
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Wales

847
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
yeah yeah

848
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
it's like the same word

849
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
or something

850
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
it must be tough to like

851
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
get the Wales to like

852
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
form a straight line

853
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
oh my god

854
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
it is

855
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that's my favourite part

856
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
um

857
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
that's literally what

858
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I thought you were talking

859
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
about before

860
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I just didn't say anything

861
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
cause I thought

862
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I thought like

863
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
everyone knew about it

864
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and I'd be the only one

865
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
like ah this guy doesn't know

866
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
about the dude walking

867
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
across Wales

868
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
what a fucking dummy

869
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the thing that's so great

870
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
about it is because

871
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
it's in a straight line

872
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
he has a little GPS thing

873
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
he has to go through

874
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
people's property

875
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and he has to

876
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
sneak past

877
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
farmers

878
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and their houses

879
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and he has to like

880
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
um

881
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
you know

882
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
constantly be on the lookout

883
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
if there's like

884
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
a cold river

885
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
there's like

886
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
a raging torrent

887
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
he has to cross

888
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and it's like

889
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
he has to like

890
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
make a decision

891
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
whether to cross

892
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
this very very dangerous

893
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
river

894
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
or like

895
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
deviate like

896
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
20 meters from his path

897
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and go around

898
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
20 meters

899
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and go

900
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
go around to a rickety bridge

901
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and it's like

902
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
it's

903
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
it's

904
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
turning this

905
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
it's turning

906
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the world that we live in

907
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
which is very

908
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
you know

909
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
um

910
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
it's all chopped up

911
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and all like

912
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
managed and

913
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
sorted out

914
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and there's paths everywhere

915
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and there's road signs

916
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
everywhere

917
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and you'll never be

918
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
perfectly alone ever

919
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and he just

920
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
bucks the trend

921
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
by smashing through

922
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
all the boundaries

923
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
that we've put up for ourselves

924
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
all these fences

925
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and barbed wire

926
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and it's such

927
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
it's like a real adventure

928
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
even though

929
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
um

930
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Wales is a very small country

931
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and he's going not that

932
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
very far

933
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
but it just feels so epic

934
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
because it's

935
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
it's a

936
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
it's an aspect of travel that

937
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
you know

938
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
you would never

939
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you would never bother

940
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
to like go over a fence

941
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
when there's like

942
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
a fence gate

943
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
like a couple meters

944
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
down the road

945
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that's the genre

946
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
of human madness

947
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
that I can respect

948
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I agree

949
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I mean

950
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I love

951
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I love the straight line

952
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Wales guy

953
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
as much as another person

954
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I've

955
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I've watched

956
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
like every video

957
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
like on repeat

958
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
for like every night

959
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
for the past

960
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
like two weeks

961
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that's like my one

962
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
that's my one YouTube

963
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that I watch exclusively

964
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
basically

965
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
it's great

966
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
but I will say

967
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that I completely

968
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
disagree with like

969
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
everything is like

970
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
the same

971
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I know you're

972
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
saying exactly the same

973
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
but like

974
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
it's even the pavement

975
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
even just the buildings

976
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
yeah

977
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
they are buildings

978
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
yeah there's hospitals

979
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
everywhere

980
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
but even that

981
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
there's so many different

982
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
unique things

983
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
all right

984
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
sure

985
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
what I meant by that

986
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
not that everything's the same

987
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
like you go to India

988
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and it's like

989
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I could have done this

990
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
at home

991
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
like you obviously couldn't

992
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
there's definitely things

993
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
to see in the world

994
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
but you don't

995
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
like seeing things in the world

996
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
doesn't take very long

997
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and if you stay

998
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
in a place for like

999
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
more than two weeks

1000
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
you're like yeah I get it

1001
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
like

1002
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I disagree

1003
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the reason to stay

1004
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
in a place

1005
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
is not just to be

1006
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in a place

1007
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
in the place

1008
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I mean that's

1009
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
maybe you took that

1010
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
as like part of it

1011
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
but a lot of the time

1012
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
travel doesn't include that

1013
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
because I don't know

1014
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
people in the world

1015
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and I'm like

1016
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I can't talk to strangers

1017
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but like

1018
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
if an opportunity arises

1019
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
where I could go

1020
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
meet somebody

1021
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
in a different country

1022
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that would be

1023
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
way cooler

1024
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
a lot of the reason

1025
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I agree

1026
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
is because I like to

1027
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
explore the place

1028
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I mean it's all about

1029
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the place for me really

1030
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I mean I just like

1031
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
well surely the culture

1032
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
of the people

1033
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
like I'd like to see

1034
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
this built by

1035
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the gaps and

1036
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
yeah

1037
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
well I mean

1038
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
it's all tied together

1039
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
we all have different

1040
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
acclimation times

1041
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
you know like

1042
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
some people like

1043
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
be in a space for like

1044
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
an hour

1045
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
they're like

1046
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I get it

1047
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
whatever I'm used to it

1048
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
other people can take

1049
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
weeks to really

1050
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
getting gross

1051
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and like the subtle

1052
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
differences

1053
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it really depends

1054
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
on the person

1055
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
what I love

1056
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
going to a new city for

1057
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
is I love

1058
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
getting all in the nooks

1059
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and cranes

1060
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and all the dense

1061
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
parts of it

1062
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and all the local places

1063
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
that I know

1064
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and we're all in a big

1065
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
unbroken series

1066
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
of dominoes

1067
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
falling

1068
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
oh my god

1069
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm obsesion of the world

1070
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I exclaim

1071
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
like every three seconds

1072
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
living in Boston

1073
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm with you

1074
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
and it's great

1075
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean definitely

1076
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I get that

1077
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I've just never

1078
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
never found that like

1079
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
compelling

1080
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
it's not that I don't

1081
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
it's kind of interesting

1082
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
like oh yeah

1083
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and then I just

1084
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
don't give a shit

1085
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and I go back to watching

1086
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I definitely feel that

1087
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
sometimes

1088
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
but like

1089
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I don't know

1090
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I've been to quite a few

1091
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
places

1092
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it's nice

1093
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
but like

1094
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I guess I just

1095
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
never feel comfortable

1096
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
enough

1097
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
like I always feel like

1098
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
like home bases

1099
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
like home

1100
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
home

1101
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and I can't really like

1102
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
relax

1103
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and

1104
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
like I like exploring

1105
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but only for like a day

1106
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
or two

1107
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and then I'm like

1108
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
it becomes a chore

1109
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
it becomes like

1110
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
there's so many places

1111
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
to see

1112
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
that seeing all of them

1113
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
is impossible

1114
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and so I have to like

1115
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
map out like the perfect

1116
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
places

1117
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
or maybe hire

1118
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
a tour guide

1119
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and I'm like

1120
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I don't care about fucking tours

1121
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
even though they're probably great

1122
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I just hate the idea

1123
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
of paying someone

1124
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
to just walk me around

1125
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
when I could do that myself

1126
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
like when I was in Japan

1127
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
basically the most

1128
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
interesting places I went

1129
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
like I walked around the city

1130
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
plenty

1131
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and since I like

1132
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
wasn't with people I knew

1133
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I didn't really know

1134
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
the sites to go to

1135
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
it's like you're just

1136
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
walking by like

1137
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
a bunch of closed doors

1138
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and you're like

1139
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
not talking to anyone

1140
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
you're not engaging

1141
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
but when I had guides

1142
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
like for example

1143
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
one person I met

1144
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
was like a native

1145
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
a Japanese dude

1146
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I was in my little friend group

1147
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
while I was there

1148
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and he like

1149
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
knew Kamiket

1150
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and he took

1151
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
which I don't know

1152
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
if you guys know

1153
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
like did you

1154
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
it's like the biggest

1155
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
yeah it's the biggest

1156
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
dojin thing in the world

1157
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
in this big famous

1158
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
place in Tokyo

1159
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
like he was our guide

1160
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and he's like

1161
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
oh you guys want to go

1162
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I will be your guide

1163
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and he helped us

1164
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
get to Kamiket

1165
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I went there

1166
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
had a great time

1167
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and like

1168
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I wouldn't have known how

1169
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
or like

1170
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
why to do that

1171
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
if I didn't have a guy

1172
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
or like

1173
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
when I went to

1174
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Mount

1175
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
with the Kuro Tamago

1176
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
the black eggs

1177
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
on these hot springs

1178
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
on a mountain side

1179
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
which was like

1180
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
the highlight

1181
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
it was like

1182
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
the naturalistic highlight

1183
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
of going to the place

1184
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
which is just this amazing

1185
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
hot spring covered mountain

1186
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
obviously because

1187
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
there's volcanic activity

1188
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
underneath it

1189
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
where they just

1190
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
hard boil eggs

1191
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and they turn black

1192
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
from the sulfur

1193
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and it was like

1194
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
a magic religious experience

1195
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
it was so fucking cool

1196
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
but it's only because

1197
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I had a guide

1198
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
who like knew the area

1199
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I was able to like

1200
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
even know this place

1201
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
existed

1202
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
let alone get there

1203
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
but that's amazing

1204
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
that's the sort of like

1205
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
that's the sort of stuff

1206
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I live for

1207
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
just being able to

1208
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
get on something local

1209
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and get and just

1210
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
really experience

1211
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
what kind of people do

1212
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
in other places

1213
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
just like

1214
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and this isn't just like

1215
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
for a broad thing

1216
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I feel this in America too

1217
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I mean I was just going up

1218
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and down California

1219
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and even though

1220
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you know

1221
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
America's very homogenous

1222
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
in a lot of

1223
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
a lot of

1224
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
a lot of ways

1225
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
just going to different towns

1226
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
like for instance San Francisco

1227
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
one big thing about there

1228
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
super vertical

1229
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
it's not like a adventure too

1230
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
it's real life

1231
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
and it was

1232
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
it was just like man

1233
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
it's so different here

1234
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and over there

1235
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
here's a really historic pier

1236
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
oh my god

1237
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
it's existed for a billion years

1238
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
look at those seals over there

1239
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm in raptured

1240
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
in euphoria right now

1241
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
like it's like

1242
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I have no like

1243
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
reservations about

1244
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
feeling not at home

1245
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I like just

1246
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
like immediately

1247
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
wherever I am

1248
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I sink into just a sense of

1249
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I want to know everything

1250
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
like what's the temperature like here

1251
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
is it a little bit different

1252
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's a little bit of humidity here

1253
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
look at these buildings

1254
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
they're like a different

1255
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
architectural style

1256
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
than I've seen before

1257
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and it's just

1258
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
it's just a constant stream

1259
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
of just joy

1260
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
whenever I travel anywhere

1261
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
just constant

1262
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I know what you mean

1263
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
you're saying all the right things buddy

1264
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I remember when I was in Rome

1265
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I was with my family

1266
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and you know

1267
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I loved them dearly

1268
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and we did all the coliseum

1269
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
all those sort of tour stuff

1270
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
but my favorite parts

1271
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
were just walking around the city

1272
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
because they were just

1273
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
a bunch of beautiful

1274
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
bridges we could go over

1275
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
or really just I did

1276
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
because I was walking alone

1277
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and I would sketch things

1278
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
in my sketchbook

1279
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
and I would talk to the people

1280
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I must have done this

1281
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
on the PCP before

1282
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
somewhere

1283
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
but on the last day

1284
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
we had Mr.

1285
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
we had Mr.

1286
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and we were had

1287
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
an extra day in Rome

1288
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
that I could spend in

1289
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and I was sketching

1290
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
the alter patriotism

1291
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
which I've talked about

1292
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
many times before

1293
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
because it's got a kick-ass funny name

1294
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and there's this

1295
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
there's this like Muslim girl

1296
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
next to me

1297
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
who was in hijab

1298
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and she was like

1299
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
oh you draw an anime

1300
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I was like

1301
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
yeah

1302
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and then we talked about anime

1303
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
for a little bit

1304
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
how she's going to become a manga artist

1305
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
oh wait

1306
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
where was this

1307
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
this was in Rome

1308
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
this was in Italy

1309
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I was sketching

1310
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
like a big monument

1311
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and then we had a nice little conversation

1312
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and then she had to go with her dad

1313
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and I said goodbye

1314
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and it was great

1315
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
it's just great talking to people

1316
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
just strangers

1317
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
yeah man

1318
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
that's like the

1319
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
that's awesome

1320
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I have a story

1321
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
when I was teaching

1322
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
physics in Poland

1323
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
all my students

1324
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
were

1325
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
they were all from Saudi Arabia

1326
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and

1327
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
one day I come into the classroom

1328
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
late

1329
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
as I often did

1330
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Lamal

1331
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and

1332
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
they're like doodling

1333
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
on the

1334
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
whiteboard

1335
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and one of them

1336
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
one of like the most

1337
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
talkative ones

1338
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
who I like

1339
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I talk to the most

1340
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
he's like doodling on the white

1341
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and he's drawing like

1342
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
an anime girl

1343
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
he's drawing like an anime

1344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and I'm like

1345
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
hey

1346
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I think like after class

1347
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I like talk to him about anime

1348
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
or something a little bit

1349
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
like I asked him like

1350
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I don't even remember

1351
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
what we were talking about

1352
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
but it came up

1353
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and he was like

1354
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
yeah

1355
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
yeah I love anime

1356
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but you know

1357
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
we're not technically allowed to watch it

1358
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
because the king

1359
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
fucking banned it or whatever

1360
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and I'm like

1361
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
what the fuck

1362
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
are you fucking kidding me

1363
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
it is subversive

1364
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
it should be banned

1365
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
yeah our literal king

1366
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
we

1367
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
from a country

1368
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
king

1369
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
just decreed that like

1370
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
yeah no anime

1371
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean Gibbs got one of those

1372
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
almost

1373
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
yeah I don't think it's the same thing

1374
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
it's different though yeah

1375
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I forget if it was Iraq

1376
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
or Iran

1377
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
but in one of those countries

1378
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
music was banned

1379
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
for a little while

1380
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
like just music

1381
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
oh my god

1382
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
that can't be true

1383
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
that can't be right

1384
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I've seen

1385
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I've seen Footloose

1386
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
actually I haven't

1387
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
the true story of

1388
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't know

1389
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the Arab Emirates

1390
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
or whatever

1391
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
yeah I think so

1392
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I think so

1393
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
well

1394
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
they got jet packs over there though

1395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
that's pretty sick

1396
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
what have we learned

1397
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
anime is universal

1398
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and brings people together

1399
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
across cultures

1400
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
it literally does

1401
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
it literally does

1402
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
well

1403
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and like media

1404
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
so we must destroy it

1405
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
like media with

1406
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
universal human values

1407
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
brings human beings together

1408
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
what a shock

1409
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
imagine that

1410
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
just like my favorite movie

1411
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
7

1412
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
by David Fincher

1413
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Brad Pitt

1414
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
fucking goes the shit out of that guy

1415
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
get the whole thing

1416
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
it's all just been

1417
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
secretly the movie topic

1418
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
oh hey hey

1419
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
it's not a left turn

1420
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
of a little bit of a story

1421
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
from yesterday

1422
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
it's not a long one

1423
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
it's very short

1424
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
but it's just

1425
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I was going to pick up Michelle

1426
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
from work

1427
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and me I'm going

1428
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
doop de doop de do

1429
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
walking out the store

1430
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
locked the door behind me

1431
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
from de dump de dump

1432
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000

oh no

1434
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I've locked the door

1435
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and I don't have a key

1436
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I turn around

1437
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
and I go back to open the door

1438
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
it's locked

1439
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I think to myself

1440
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
no big deal

1441
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
perhaps Michelle is a key

1442
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
call her real quick

1443
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
nope she left her key

1444
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000

I don't know if you guys are aware

1464
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
there was a thriving

1465
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
extremely competitive industry

1466
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
of locksmiths

1467
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000

1468
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
in this situation

1469
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and these people

1470
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
a lot of dumb people in America

1471
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
a lot of dumb asshole retards

1472
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
such as myself who locked themselves

1473
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
out of their house

1474
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and every possible check and balance

1475
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000

1476
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000

so here I am

1484
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
dump de dump de dump

1485
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
waiting for this guy to show up

1486
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and by the way

1487
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
this this doop de doop

1488
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
there's no payoff to this

1489
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
to this bit I'm doing

1490
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that's just not just happening

1491
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
so whatever

1492
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
like Michelle comes home

1493
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
we're just waiting for the guy

1494
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
to show up

1495
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
so whatever

1496
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
he just picks the lock

1497
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
he gets in

1498
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it's effortless

1499
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
this man is definitely a criminal

1500
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
these people have way too much power

1501
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and you know I wasn't thinking

1502
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
about this at the time

1503
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
but when like the locksmith shows up

1504
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Michelle's just kind of

1505
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
sitting in the entrance way

1506
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
inside

1507
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and the guy goes in

1508
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and like he picks it

1509
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
he goes inside

1510
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Michelle had like gone into the bedroom

1511
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
which I thought was a little bit rude

1512
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I was like don't you want to like

1513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
thank the guy

1514
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and then afterward I'm like

1515
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
hey you know that guy was here

1516
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I didn't want him to see me

1517
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
because I don't trust locksmith

1518
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
they have too much power

1519
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
he could do

1520
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
he could do anything

1521
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
he could do anything to this place

1522
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
he could know where I live

1523
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and that's totally fair

1524
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
that's totally fair

1525
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
he was a good guy

1526
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
but I don't trust anyone in the world

1527
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that reminds me of him

1528
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
who are you

1529
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and how'd you get in here

1530
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm a locksmith

1531
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and I'm a locksmith

1532
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
is that Leslie Nielsen

1533
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
yeah

1534
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
yeah

1535
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
that's a good one

1536
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I had a

1537
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
when I rented a car

1538
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I moved my stuff

1539
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
from Georgia Boston

1540
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I called a

1541
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I locked myself out of the rental car

1542
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
and I called a guy

1543
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and the guy just had these fucking

1544
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
he had a thing that he just inserted

1545
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
into like the

1546
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
the side

1547
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
like the gap between the doors

1548
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
and he just inflated it

1549
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and like the balloon pressure

1550
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
just like squeeze the door open

1551
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
like bent the door enough

1552
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that he could slide like a

1553
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
what do you call it

1554
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
like a fucking like wire thing

1555
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and like blow the lock up

1556
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
like this guy can just get into

1557
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
literally any car

1558
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
you know

1559
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I had a tool

1560
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I could have easily gotten into this

1561
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
but by the way

1562
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
like while we were talking

1563
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
he just one of the things

1564
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
he asked me was like

1565
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
hey so are you a student

1566
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I guess I look youthful

1567
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
oh thanks for saying so

1568
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I just

1569
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm like no no

1570
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I actually

1571
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I came out here

1572
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
working with like a

1573
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
there was like a program

1574
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
he asked you because you looked dumb

1575
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and he thought you needed

1576
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
to learn a thing or two

1577
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
yeah that's probably

1578
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
he's looking for an apprentice

1579
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I just had

1580
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
no I mean I was

1581
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I was a computer programmer

1582
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
but I actually just quit

1583
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the other day

1584
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and now I'm a YouTuber

1585
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
okay

1586
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
what did he say to this

1587
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I mean

1588
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I answered his question

1589
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
he didn't know before that point

1590
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that a stranger

1591
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
could be disappointed

1592
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
well he just

1593
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
like as he was leaving

1594
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
he was like oh yeah that's

1595
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
interesting and then as he was

1596
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
leaving he's like hey man

1597
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
like where do I

1598
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
where do I look you up

1599
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and I was like oh well

1600
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm best guy ever

1601
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
on YouTube you can

1602
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and but then I realized

1603
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
what am I doing right now

1604
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm like giving this guy

1605
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
like if this man wanted to

1606
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
he knows where I live

1607
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and he knows what I do

1608
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you just doxed yourself

1609
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I guess I doxed myself

1610
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
to this one man

1611
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I probably just shouldn't have

1612
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
to anyone else

1613
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
it would have been fine

1614
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
but to a locksmith

1615
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
to a locksmith specifically

1616
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
like what if this guy

1617
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
is a crazy obsessed fanboy

1618
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
or just like maybe

1619
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
maybe he hates me

1620
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
maybe he hates me

1621
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
stop stop

1622
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
stop right now

1623
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
you think your locksmith

1624
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
is going to go to your channel

1625
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
like oh best guy ever

1626
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that guy from early on

1627
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
let me look him up right here

1628
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
have you seen

1629
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
have you seen

1630
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
my favorite shows dude

1631
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
have you seen

1632
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
oh my god don't act

1633
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
like I'm getting a big

1634
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
fucking head or something

1635
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
no we gotta

1636
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
we gotta fast forward

1637
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
fast forward three weeks

1638
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
in Nate's life

1639
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
he's just

1640
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
he's just sleeping

1641
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
soundly

1642
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and here's a rattle at the door

1643
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and all of a sudden

1644
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
he turns over

1645
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
he goes back to bed

1646
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
that couldn't be anything

1647
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and all of a sudden

1648
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
there's his eyes

1649
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
staring at him

1650
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
he's just like

1651
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
you fucking asshole

1652
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
where the fuck is best anime ever

1653
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
goes to the shell, Nate

1654
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
you fucking assholes are acting like

1655
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
this is such a crazy thing

1656
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
to be concerned about

1657
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
literally having like

1658
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
a public platform

1659
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
and you know

1660
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
telling people about it

1661
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and like telling them

1662
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
how to break into your fucking house

1663
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
that one person in the world

1664
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
knows where you live

1665
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and that you have a YouTube channel

1666
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
it's funny that the person

1667
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
who's the most worried about it

1668
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
is the one who doxxed himself

1669
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and we're all just like

1670
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
yeah whatever

1671
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I never make a mistake

1672
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
now I know

1673
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
now I fucking know

1674
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
it probably

1675
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
god damn it

1676
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
you people are assholes

1677
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
shut up shut up to the locksmith

1678
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
watching this episode right now

1679
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
thanks for the story dude

1680
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000

1681
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I understand

1682
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
okay thank you

1683
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
because like absolutely

1684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
nobody in the real world

1685
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
knows anything about what I do

1686
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and that's the way

1687
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
it's going to stay forever

1688
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
that's mine

1689
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
nobody in my family

1690
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
they all think that like

1691
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't know that I

1692
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
what do you do I'm not like

1693
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
no one

1694
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I don't associate with people

1695
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
who understand what YouTube is

1696
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that's the way that I keep

1697
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
my life right

1698
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I do not associate with

1699
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
the YouTubers

1700
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
yeah I'm with you

1701
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
everyone in real life

1702
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
thinks I'm a failure

1703
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and they're not far off

1704
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
what the fuck is that

1705
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
are you not aware of that

1706
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I think it was originally a vine

1707
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that was an Indian boy

1708
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
using an impolite word

1709
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
for the African American community

1710
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
saying

1711
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I do not associate with

1712
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
you know

1713
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and then he said a bad word

1714
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
but it was really funny

1715
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
you know

1716
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
both of you guys

1717
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Nate and Ben

1718
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
yeah

1719
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
maybe this is

1720
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
maybe this is like

1721
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
a cultural thing

1722
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
or a class thing

1723
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
but that's the first time

1724
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I've ever heard a

1725
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
locked myself

1726
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
out of my something

1727
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
story

1728
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
that ended with

1729
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I called the locksmith

1730
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and not

1731
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I smashed my own fucking window

1732
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and broke my own fucking door

1733
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
down

1734
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and threw a fit

1735
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
because that's how

1736
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
we handle those situations

1737
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
in my world

1738
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
it crossed my mind

1739
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it crossed my mind

1740
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
but like

1741
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
my apartment's weird

1742
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
it's on like a second floor

1743
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I did not know that

1744
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
locksmiths were a people

1745
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
that you could call

1746
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
in such a situation

1747
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
well well

1748
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
okay maybe I should have

1749
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
because this fucking fee

1750
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
this is a hundred and fifty

1751
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
dollars

1752
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
what the fuck

1753
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
what

1754
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
yeah

1755
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
so I was right all along

1756
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I didn't call a locksmith

1757
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I called

1758
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
well I called AAA

1759
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
okay AAA

1760
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it was my call

1761
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Nate you should have done

1762
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
you should have just gone

1763
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
to Udemy.com

1764
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
spent fifteen dollars

1765
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
taught yourself how to

1766
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
pick locks

1767
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and then be good to go

1768
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I okay

1769
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
let's not act like

1770
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I didn't spend a twenty

1771
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
minutes on YouTube

1772
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
trying to find techniques

1773
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
to pick my own lock

1774
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
alright

1775
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
cause I did

1776
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
they just didn't work

1777
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
or I didn't

1778
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
could you

1779
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
my dog was inside

1780
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
and it was getting close

1781
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
to midnight

1782
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and it was his birthday

1783
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it was his birthday

1784
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
in like one hour

1785
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I had to say

1786
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
happy birthday

1787
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I couldn't wait

1788
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
please it's my dog's

1789
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
birthday

1790
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
he's fair

1791
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
okay

1792
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the house that I live in

1793
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
right now

1794
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
when I moved in

1795
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
my friend John

1796
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
he gave me a key

1797
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
but I lost it somewhere

1798
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and I was like

1799
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
well shit I don't have a key

1800
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
but I realized that

1801
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
like our door sucks

1802
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and I can literally

1803
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
just like Jimmy

1804
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
the outdoor lock

1805
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
with a credit card

1806
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and so for like

1807
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
months and months

1808
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
my key to my house

1809
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
was just a credit card

1810
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
that I would jam into the

1811
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
doorway

1812
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and open the lock

1813
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
worked easy

1814
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
every time

1815
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Nate called a locksmith

1816
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
he's like

1817
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I gotta get him

1818
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
it's my dog's birthday

1819
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and he's like

1820
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
oh Lord Shoshesh

1821
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
this guy ever

1822
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
is that you

1823
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I've been following you for years

1824
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
look around

1825
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
no that's

1826
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
he just

1827
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
he just casually says

1828
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Seshio

1829
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
he's like I didn't tell you

1830
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
my dog's name is Seshio

1831
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
oh shit

1832
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I remember

1833
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
the room I'm in

1834
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
you could have looked up

1835
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
like how expensive

1836
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
it would have been

1837
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
to replace the window

1838
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
rather than

1839
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
to hire a locksmith

1840
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
it may have been cheaper

1841
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
you call the locksmith

1842
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
you tell him what's up

1843
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you say

1844
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
all that happens

1845
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
he says oh Lord Seshio

1846
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
you say

1847
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I didn't tell you my dog's name

1848
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
so I know

1849
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I already let myself in

1850
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and you

1851
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and he slowly opens the door

1852
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and you look inside

1853
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and the locksmith is in there

1854
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
him and Seshio

1855
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
both wearing

1856
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
he's wearing your clothes

1857
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
he's with Michelle

1858
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
you know what

1859
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
he's better than me

1860
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
he knows how to pick locks

1861
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and I don't

1862
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the room I'm in right now

1863
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I was locked out

1864
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
of mere months ago

1865
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm in

1866
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Kazzy's dad's bedroom

1867
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
right now

1868
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and so

1869
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
we got locked out

1870
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
me and Kazzy

1871
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and a peculiar thing about this

1872
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
is that there's a balcony

1873
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
there's a balcony

1874
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
we're on the top floor

1875
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
so we got locked out

1876
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
our phones are in there

1877
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
we can't call

1878
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
for anyone

1879
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
her dad's out

1880
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I can't get to my computer

1881
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
or my phone

1882
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
or anything

1883
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
so we're just

1884
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm faced with the prospect

1885
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
of watching TV all day

1886
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
which sounds like

1887
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
literally worse than dying

1888
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
so I think

1889
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
okay

1890
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
what am I willing to do right now

1891
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
watch cable

1892
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
or risk suicide

1893
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I think I'm going to go

1894
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
with the suicide option

1895
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
so I go to the top floor

1896
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and I'm getting ready

1897
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
to throw myself off

1898
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the roof

1899
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and onto the balcony

1900
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
trying to angle myself

1901
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
so I can get in a side door

1902
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
like a patio door

1903
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
into my bedroom

1904
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and I'm like

1905
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm heave hoeing

1906
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm getting ready to do that

1907
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
um

1908
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
you know in Kirby 64

1909
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
after you beat a level

1910
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and Kirby like heave ho

1911
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
heave hoes

1912
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
we're getting ready to throw

1913
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
himself at whatever food

1914
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
if you angle in the 64

1915
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
correctly

1916
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm getting ready to do that

1917
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
but eventually

1918
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I just look up

1919
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
like a long enough

1920
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
YouTube tutorial

1921
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
where I like fully dismantled

1922
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
the door knob

1923
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and it's just ease

1924
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
outside from the socket

1925
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and there's

1926
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
ease nothing there

1927
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
like a plank of wood

1928
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that eases the door

1929
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and I just like

1930
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
like break it open

1931
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and then I'm back inside

1932
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
of my glorious

1933
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
glorious phone

1934
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
and then I break the cable box

1935
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
just for good measure

1936
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
way to go

1937
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
yeah cool

1938
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
so all I'm saying

1939
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
is I didn't have to have

1940
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
a locksmith's worry about

1941
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you know

1942
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
learning about park road

1943
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
dude 91

1944
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
or spirit silence

1945
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and you know

1946
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
trying to take in my identity

1947
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
smart move

1948
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
smart move

1949
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
you know

1950
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
speaking about like

1951
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
media

1952
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
right

1953
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
is it like

1954
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
watching media is like

1955
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
who cares

1956
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
you've you've seen enough

1957
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
or like you know

1958
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
we could cut down

1959
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
on the amount of media

1960
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
but like

1961
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
is that then

1962
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
immoral to be

1963
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
a person who aspires

1964
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
to create

1965
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
more

1966
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
yes

1967
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
yes definitely

1968
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
to add to the pile

1969
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
100%

1970
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
yeah

1971
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
all right

1972
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
no I'm gonna go hard no

1973
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
why so Nate

1974
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
why do you think

1975
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
that was a joke

1976
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I didn't hear the question

1977
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
that was the most in tune

1978
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Ben and I have ever been

1979
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
about anything

1980
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
you said is it moral

1981
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
to create more media

1982
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
with more

1983
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
yeah

1984
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
in a world

1985
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
where there's too much

1986
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
distraction

1987
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
is it immoral

1988
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
to make

1989
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
that's complete

1990
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
false equivalent

1991
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I don't even understand

1992
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
the question

1993
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I mean it's a fine question

1994
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm just throwing

1995
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
that sort of like

1996
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
thought into

1997
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm just throwing

1998
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
sand

1999
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
available

2000
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
well actually

2001
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I actually like

2002
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
the shirt

2003
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
that has the character bio

2004
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
of the guy who likes

2005
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Greg Poupon

2006
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and is retarded

2007
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I like that guy

2008
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
the most actually

2009
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
but okay

2010
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
like in a world

2011
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
where like

2012
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
you are distracted

2013
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
by too much for many

2014
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
is it like a different

2015
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
question

2016
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
than like

2017
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
is the amount of media

2018
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
bad

2019
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
yeah I mean

2020
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
my thought process

2021
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
would go to

2022
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I get the other side

2023
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
but my thought process

2024
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
would be like

2025
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
this is something that

2026
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
as the world

2027
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
like we can't

2028
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
we can't

2029
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
unless we're willing to like

2030
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
suppress the world

2031
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
it has to be something

2032
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
that individuals

2033
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
like control in their

2034
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
own lives

2035
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I mean maybe

2036
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
there's a way

2037
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
we could like limit

2038
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
how much media people

2039
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
are able to consume

2040
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and then we just give them

2041
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
like the best and most

2042
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
useful stuff

2043
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
but it's gotta be

2044
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
the individuals

2045
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
hold on

2046
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
okay okay

2047
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
we mean by like

2048
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
like what do you mean

2049
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
by this Hippo

2050
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
is that like

2051
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
people watch too much

2052
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
YouTube right

2053
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
is that the basis

2054
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
of this

2055
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
like this was totally

2056
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
like a devil's advocate

2057
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
sort of like

2058
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
thing

2059
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't actually

2060
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I would still do it myself

2061
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'm not like

2062
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
worrying about that

2063
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
so I haven't thought about it

2064
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
to such a degree

2065
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm just trying to think like

2066
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I do it

2067
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I do it in the first place

2068
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
because it's immoral

2069
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
hmm

2070
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
that's what I like about it

2071
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
there's no contradiction

2072
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
of like

2073
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
you being an artist

2074
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and you not consuming art

2075
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
with like

2076
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
every single moment

2077
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
of your life

2078
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
like

2079
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
it's not a matter

2080
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
like

2081
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
if you're

2082
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
if you think to yourself

2083
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
like okay

2084
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
listen

2085
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I really like media

2086
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
but you know

2087
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I gotta do other things

2088
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
like myself

2089
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
or I gotta go to work

2090
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and I gotta do this

2091
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
this and this

2092
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
like I can't

2093
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
like I get distracted

2094
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
too easily by media

2095
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
that's not you saying

2096
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
like

2097
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
media is bad

2098
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
and other people

2099
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
shouldn't like

2100
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
like

2101
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
what I was implying

2102
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
okay

2103
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
that was what it was

2104
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
like a potential

2105
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
like is like

2106
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
media on the whole

2107
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
bad for humanity

2108
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
no

2109
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
it appears in the human

2110
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
condition

2111
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I mean that's

2112
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
no

2113
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I mean

2114
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I totally agree

2115
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
that too much

2116
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
media consumption

2117
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
is bad

2118
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
here's the thing though

2119
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
we have to understand

2120
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
that the problem

2121
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
isn't even the abundance

2122
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
of media

2123
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
it's the facts

2124
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
that the vessels

2125
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
we have to deliver us

2126
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
these media

2127
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
are being designed

2128
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
like with teams

2129
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
of psychologists

2130
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
to get us addicted

2131
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
yeah

2132
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
yeah

2133
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
okay

2134
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
okay

2135
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
like there's no

2136
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
okay

2137
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
people are gonna

2138
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
make stuff

2139
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
people are gonna

2140
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
make stuff

2141
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and show it to each other

2142
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
right

2143
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
no matter what

2144
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
there's basically

2145
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
no point

2146
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I mean

2147
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
art is fine

2148
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
it's capitalism

2149
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
that's bad

2150
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
well

2151
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
just to think

2152
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
think of how much better

2153
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
YouTube was before

2154
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
it started shoving

2155
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
recommendations

2156
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
in your face constantly

2157
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
it was just your subscriptions

2158
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
it was never

2159
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
taking over your life

2160
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
it's not art

2161
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
that's the problem

2162
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
it's this

2163
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
sort of

2164
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
fake art

2165
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
or fart

2166
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
for short

2167
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
which is

2168
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
you know

2169
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
created by teams

2170
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
and corporations

2171
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and stuff

2172
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
to turn you into a drum

2173
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
think about it

2174
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
if there were no profit motive

2175
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
anyone

2176
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
would anyone make

2177
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
a like

2178
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
fucking

2179
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't know

2180
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
top 10

2181
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
would people make top 10

2182
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
list or would people make

2183
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
whatever

2184
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
there would be a smaller subsection

2185
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
yeah I mean

2186
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
did you would

2187
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
did you would

2188
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
they would only use people

2189
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
like them

2190
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
okay

2191
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
okay okay okay

2192
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
well

2193
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
yeah but would there be nearly as

2194
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
there would be like

2195
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
one thousandth of as many

2196
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
watch mojo would not exist

2197
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I mean

2198
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
it's popularity still a thing

2199
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
because people

2200
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
really like them

2201
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
a lot of people

2202
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
really really like

2203
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
top 10

2204
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
yeah but nobody

2205
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
but like

2206
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
people don't make them

2207
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
okay maybe did you

2208
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
makes them

2209
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
because he wants to make them

2210
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
but like most people

2211
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
don't make them

2212
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
because they want to make them

2213
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I mean

2214
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
in this scenario

2215
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
people still want to be

2216
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
popular

2217
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
people still want to be

2218
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
liked and have their video

2219
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
right like that's

2220
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
like we're saying

2221
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
like there's no money

2222
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
there's no incentive

2223
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
but I think

2224
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I mean just as one example

2225
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
popularity is the incentive

2226
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
over money

2227
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
so if it'll just

2228
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
like one real life example

2229
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
even now

2230
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
he never got a lot of like

2231
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Patreon support or anything

2232
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
but he was pretty popular

2233
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and had popular top 10 lists

2234
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
so I mean

2235
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I assume the goal was to

2236
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
eventually make more money

2237
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
off of it

2238
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
nobody's like talking about

2239
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Sai and how cool he is

2240
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
or

2241
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
well yeah

2242
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
but they did watch his videos

2243
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
you know they were popular

2244
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I mean people clicked on them

2245
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
well his videos were

2246
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
widely seen

2247
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
it remains to be proven

2248
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
whether anyone actually

2249
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
watched them

2250
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
well

2251
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
okay

2252
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
maybe just

2253
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
you know

2254
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
view-botted and

2255
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
sub-botted

2256
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
unlikely but I mean

2257
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
people definitely saw them

2258
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
but whatever

2259
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I agree

2260
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
well why are we talking about Sai

2261
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I mean I feel like

2262
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
more and more

2263
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
like I remember

2264
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
like you know

2265
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
for a while Hippo

2266
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
you were off

2267
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
YouTube

2268
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
and off Twitter

2269
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and then I'm off Twitter

2270
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm slowly getting back into it

2271
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and I wasn't really

2272
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
off YouTube

2273
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
but I'm curbing it still

2274
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I feel like

2275
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I've

2276
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
like retained the same

2277
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
sort of thing

2278
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and you probably would agree

2279
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
that it's not like

2280
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
any of those things are

2281
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
inherently bad

2282
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
like one of those things

2283
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
is just like

2284
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm being forced to do this

2285
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
not by like

2286
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
an outside force

2287
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
like with a gun in my head

2288
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but just like

2289
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
like my brain

2290
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
really wants me to do this

2291
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
oh god

2292
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
oh well I have to take this off

2293
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
cause it's just so bad for me

2294
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
it's like a tool

2295
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
you know

2296
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
it brings me joy

2297
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
which is why I want to do it

2298
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it's just

2299
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
you know

2300
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
too much joy

2301
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
and too little time

2302
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
means that you're not gonna

2303
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
have time to do things

2304
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
that actually matter

2305
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
it's just a matter

2306
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
of like

2307
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
you know

2308
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
focusing your time

2309
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
it's not a matter of

2310
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
like any of those things

2311
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
being bad or you know

2312
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
it's just a matter of

2313
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
outkitting

2314
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
speaking of Twitter

2315
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
we're talking about

2316
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
my booming new

2317
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Twitter business

2318
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
of selling yang 2020

2319
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
shirts

2320
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
on Twitter

2321
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
they're everywhere

2322
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
they're a sweep

2323
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
in the nation

2324
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I've got celebrity endorsements

2325
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
everyone is getting it

2326
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
everyone is getting on

2327
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
this train

2328
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I got

2329
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Boogie2988

2330
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I got

2331
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Monkey Jones

2332
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I got

2333
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Christine Weston Chandler

2334
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I got

2335
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Best of All

2336
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Lightning Bliss

2337
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
they're all yang gang

2338
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
they all say

2339
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
in unison

2340
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
in one voice creepily

2341
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
by Ben Shirts

2342
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
on Twitter.com

2343
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
sort of development

2344
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I think like three out of

2345
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
four of those people

2346
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
are like in the midst of

2347
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
PR disasters

2348
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
yeah

2349
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and it was so important to them

2350
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
it was so important to them

2351
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
that they get this message out

2352
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
because UBI is the future

2353
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
automation poses a threat

2354
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
to the modern worker

2355
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
it's the war on normal people

2356
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and the opposite of

2357
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Donald Trump

2358
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
is an Asian guy

2359
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
who likes math

2360
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
you can take that one

2361
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
of the bank

2362
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
my friends

2363
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Ben

2364
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Ben

2365
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
did you Photoshop those images

2366
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
what the fuck

2367
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
get the fuck out of here

2368
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
who the fuck are you

2369
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
how fucking dare you

2370
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
that's libel

2371
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
libel

2372
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
oh no

2373
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
didn't MagiChan

2374
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
have something to say about this

2375
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I don't know

2376
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
MagiChan is a pretty reliable source

2377
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
okay

2378
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
okay

2379
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
no I want more answers

2380
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
for MagiChan

2381
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
right

2382
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
because

2383
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I tweet out

2384
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Christine's

2385
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
heartfelt endorsement

2386
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
CWC

2387
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
endorses yang

2388
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
for 2020

2389
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
because she needs the UBI

2390
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
as much as anyone

2391
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
so

2392
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Christine

2393
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
so I tweet out the endorsement

2394
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and MagiChan

2395
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
okay

2396
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
MagiChan

2397
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
he must be a boomer

2398
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
or something

2399
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
because he

2400
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
he doesn't like

2401
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
he tries to come in

2402
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and libel me

2403
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
slander me

2404
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
saying that the image

2405
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
is photoshopped

2406
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
right

2407
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
he's in the pocket

2408
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
of mainstream media

2409
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
he wants to bury yang

2410
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
just like they did

2411
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
at the first

2412
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
at the first debates

2413
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
by turning off his microphone

2414
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
so I ask him

2415
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
like why don't you

2416
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
support yang

2417
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
like what's

2418
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
what's the deal

2419
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
what's up with that

2420
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and he tells me

2421
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
right he tells me

2422
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
that Lisa Simpson

2423
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
yeah

2424
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and I am intrigued by this

2425
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and I just

2426
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I want to know

2427
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I want to know

2428
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
what's Lisa's platform

2429
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
what's her stance on UBI

2430
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
what's her

2431
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
was she gonna

2432
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
eliminate college debt

2433
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
is she gonna build the wall

2434
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and

2435
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and I'm trying to get into

2436
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
cause like I'll switch

2437
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
right

2438
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
if I find a better candidate

2439
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I will switch to supporting Lisa

2440
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
just like

2441
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I just

2442
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I need answers

2443
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I need it

2444
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and I feel like

2445
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
MagiChan is the only one

2446
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
who can provide them

2447
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
well then

2448
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
like your shirt sales

2449
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
have not just impacted

2450
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the lives of you

2451
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
when your many

2452
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
old customers

2453
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
who have bought them

2454
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
it's also impacted

2455
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
the man that you represent

2456
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Andrew Yang

2457
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I don't know if you know

2458
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
the spin

2459
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
but minutes

2460
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
after receiving the call

2461
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
that your shirt sales

2462
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
have broken

2463
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
23,000

2464
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
in the first two hours

2465
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Andrew Yang was found

2466
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
celebrating

2467
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
in Charlottesville

2468
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
he was found dancing

2469
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
he was found dancing

2470
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
in Jazzercising

2471
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
he was so over

2472
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
was that in

2473
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Charlottesville

2474
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I think so

2475
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I don't know

2476
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
was that a meeting

2477
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
with Christine herself

2478
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
maybe

2479
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
maybe

2480
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
he was walking down the streets

2481
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
and then

2482
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and then

2483
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Chris Chan came over

2484
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
and said hey

2485
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
listen

2486
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
you know about this guy

2487
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Ben Saini

2488
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
he was like I watch the

2489
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
PCP all the time

2490
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
then he broke out and he

2491
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
danced

2492
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
he started doing

2493
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
orange justice

2494
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
he did the floss

2495
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
man

2496
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
all because of you

2497
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
when do we have a gang

2498
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
on an episode

2499
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
it's about time

2500
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
we've got to call

2501
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
them that favor

2502
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
eventually

2503
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
well okay

2504
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
no no no

2505
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
he went on H3

2506
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
he went on Rogan

2507
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
why not us

2508
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
no listen

2509
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Elon Musk too

2510
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
aka Andrew Yang

2511
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
was on H3 podcast

2512
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and on Joe Rogan

2513
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
we've got to get

2514
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Elizabeth Warren

2515
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
on the PCP

2516
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
you guys come on

2517
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
it's the next logical step

2518
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that makes sense

2519
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I don't think Ben

2520
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
would be able to restrain

2521
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
himself from murdering her

2522
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
on site though

2523
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
her boomerness

2524
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
is through the fucking roof

2525
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
no Warren's not that bad

2526
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Warren's basically

2527
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
basically diet burning

2528
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
which is

2529
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
okay

2530
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
it's fine

2531
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
alright

2532
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
anyway

2533
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
buy my shirts

2534
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
yeah that makes sense

2535
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
teespring.com

2536
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
slash yang

2537
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
dash 2020

2538
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
dash baby

2539
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
link in the description

2540
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
don't you want

2541
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
don't you want to be

2542
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
like boogie

2543
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
everybody wants to be

2544
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
like boogie

2545
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Ben

2546
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
like the amount of

2547
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
mental pirouettes

2548
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and physical pirouettes

2549
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
you must have done

2550
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
in order to make

2551
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
the eternal fencer

2552
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
take a hard stance

2553
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
take a side

2554
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
how did you do it

2555
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
you just can't argue

2556
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
with math

2557
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
okay

2558
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Andrew Yang

2559
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
likes math

2560
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
UBI is the future

2561
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
the numbers don't lie

2562
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
1000 is more than 0

2563
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
okay

2564
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
it's not that hard

2565
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
of a decision

2566
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
what's the debate

2567
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I literally don't

2568
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
it's hard to argue

2569
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
it's hard to argue

2570
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
so

2571
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
that's what I've been

2572
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
doing this week

2573
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
will you finally

2574
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
stop all the other

2575
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
bullshit you're doing

2576
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
like comics and streaming

2577
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and finally

2578
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
just dedicate yourself

2579
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
to Andrew

2580
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yang

2581
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
absolutely

2582
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
finally

2583
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
finally I'm

2584
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
accomplishing something

2585
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
simple life

2586
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
you know I've got

2587
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
just on this general

2588
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
side

2589
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I've discovered something

2590
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
while we were talking

2591
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
somebody turned me on

2592
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
to this the other day

2593
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I haven't watched these yet

2594
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I haven't looked into them

2595
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
but

2596
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm afraid guys

2597
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
my time was up

2598
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I was in

2599
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
the people thought

2600
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I was the gurren login guy

2601
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
for quite a while

2602
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
but I'm afraid that

2603
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
a proud

2604
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
YouTube junior

2605
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
a guy

2606
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
up and coming

2607
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
to destroy me

2608
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and make me look like

2609
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
a fool in an old boomer

2610
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
has come on the scene

2611
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
to reveal that

2612
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I've been wrong about

2613
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
everything all along

2614
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
with this video

2615
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
first of all

2616
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
why you should be

2617
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
leftist

2618
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
about gurren login

2619
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and I mean

2620
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I wanted to watch that

2621
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
what the fuck

2622
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I haven't watched it yet

2623
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm interested too

2624
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
shit yeah I saw that

2625
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and I thought

2626
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I gotta see this

2627
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and then I forgot

2628
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I need to watch it too

2629
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm not even shitting on it

2630
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I have not watched it

2631
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I'm interested to see

2632
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
because I know this exists

2633
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
in response to

2634
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to my videos

2635
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
and I think

2636
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
digis as well

2637
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
but it's followed up

2638
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
by another one

2639
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
don't surrender gurren login

2640
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
to Ann Capps

2641
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
and I think this one is

2642
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
even more

2643
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
so directed at me

2644
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
he's by the same guy

2645
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
they are shonen ronin

2646
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't know this guy

2647
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
he seems fine

2648
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
obviously a leftist

2649
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
that's cool

2650
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
but

2651
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I just like to go on the record

2652
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I joke about being

2653
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
an anarcho capitalist

2654
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
it's really funny

2655
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I'm not actually

2656
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
an anarcho capitalist

2657
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
just to be clear on that

2658
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
but

2659
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
that's it

2660
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
that's all I have to say

2661
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
on this subject

2662
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I will watch this

2663
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I could be more heinous

2664
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
a politics person

2665
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
and an anime person

2666
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
you know

2667
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
not to be

2668
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
not to shed on anybody

2669
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
but I couldn't agree more

2670
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
bringing

2671
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm aware that my world view

2672
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
informs my thoughts

2673
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
on anime and stuff

2674
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
but to make it a hard line

2675
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
you know me

2676
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
don't like talking politics

2677
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
in such terms

2678
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and you know

2679
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
like this title

2680
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
why you should be a leftist

2681
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I think we could agree

2682
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
there's attributes

2683
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
that are positive about that

2684
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I won't let you do this

2685
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Nate

2686
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
you can't pretend as though

2687
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
you're not

2688
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
you don't also engage

2689
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
in any political discussion here

2690
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
you're not like half of it

2691
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
well

2692
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I mean

2693
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
what's the title of like

2694
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
my video

2695
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
it's just like

2696
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
why Gurren Lagann is good

2697
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
no I don't know

2698
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm not thinking about that

2699
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'm just saying that

2700
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
you are

2701
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you are a political

2702
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
just talking about it

2703
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
we do this all the time

2704
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
on the piece of paper

2705
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
well okay

2706
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
now that's certainly true

2707
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
but I'm not an anarcho capitalist

2708
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
you could call me a libertarian

2709
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
you know what my political views are

2710
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
here's

2711
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
here's my political stance

2712
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Andrew Yang

2713
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
sounds like a fucking

2714
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
mortal combat character

2715
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
yeah

2716
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
that's all I got to say about that

2717
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
and he's as static as fuck

2718
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't know who this

2719
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Andrew Yang character is

2720
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
but this Andrew Yang person

2721
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
that's in real life

2722
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
aka outside my apartment

2723
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
so he's hanging out in the

2724
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
salt splash beach

2725
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
he's been just terrorizing

2726
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
the citizens lately

2727
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
and I'm really scared of him

2728
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
have you seen that

2729
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
have you seen this

2730
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
so there's the Andrew Yang

2731
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
platform

2732
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
where you gain a thousand dollars

2733
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
not even a good

2734
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
mortal combat character either

2735
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I'm talking like

2736
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
ultimate mortal combat 3

2737
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
like one of the random

2738
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I think I know what you're

2739
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
gonna say

2740
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm gonna say that

2741
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
there's also the competing

2742
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
platform of Andrew Yin

2743
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
to the Yang

2744
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
where you lose a thousand

2745
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
dollars if you elect him

2746
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
to the presidency

2747
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
tough tough call

2748
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
it's a tough choice

2749
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
it's a tough call

2750
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Nate what if

2751
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
we pose your hypothetical

2752
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
what if you make your

2753
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
you make some

2754
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
not you

2755
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
someone anyone

2756
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
makes a video right

2757
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
titles it in some

2758
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
titles it in some

2759
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
perfectly apolitical

2760
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
X is good way

2761
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and then in explaining

2762
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
why it's good

2763
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
they implicitly endorse

2764
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
a certain

2765
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
a certain

2766
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
a certain political

2767
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
political or economic

2768
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
worldview

2769
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I mean I would totally agree

2770
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
to that but

2771
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I mean like

2772
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
let's just take my video

2773
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
for example

2774
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
like what's my

2775
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
like my main thesis

2776
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
of the video

2777
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
is that line about

2778
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
like ask not for

2779
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
lighter burdens

2780
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
ask for broader shoulders

2781
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I think that's pretty

2782
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
clearly like

2783
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
not a leftist view

2784
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
of the world

2785
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
that is very much

2786
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
so you're saying

2787
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
it is political

2788
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
no I'm saying

2789
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
that I mean

2790
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
there's explicitly

2791
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
political where

2792
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
you're advocating

2793
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
for a specific

2794
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
like team

2795
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
which I think

2796
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
saying why you

2797
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
should be a leftist

2798
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
is doing so

2799
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I find it

2800
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't really like to

2801
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
talk in those terms

2802
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
when I talk about these things

2803
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I have absolutely

2804
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
no clue

2805
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
what you're trying to say

2806
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I mean

2807
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
you can advocate

2808
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
for a worldview

2809
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
without saying like

2810
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
that's why you should

2811
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
vote Democrat

2812
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
or that's why you should

2813
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
vote Republican

2814
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
so your problem

2815
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
why are you saying

2816
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
problem

2817
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
your problem is not

2818
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
your problem is not

2819
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
your problem is not

2820
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
with something

2821
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
being political

2822
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
it's with something

2823
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
admitting to

2824
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
being political

2825
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
well first of all

2826
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
who's got a problem

2827
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
there is no problem

2828
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
against what

2829
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
you're saying that it's

2830
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
you're saying there are

2831
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
negative aspects

2832
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
to a title

2833
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
like why you should be

2834
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
a leftist

2835
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
no I'm saying

2836
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I don't want to do that

2837
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
so I don't

2838
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
that's what I'm saying

2839
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
it's that time again folks

2840
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
it's time for this

2841
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
there's no political

2842
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
discussion here

2843
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
it's just

2844
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
it's interesting to say

2845
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
there is

2846
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
there is Nate

2847
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
there is

2848
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I mean to label me

2849
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
an ANCAP

2850
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I didn't do that

2851
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
even though

2852
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
you could probably

2853
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
make a pretty strong

2854
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
argument for it

2855
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
but I'm not doing that

2856
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I mean how do you

2857
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
resolve that with me

2858
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
just saying I'm not

2859
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
because I think

2860
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
maybe you are

2861
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
agreeing to many leftist

2862
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
positions

2863
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
well I mean

2864
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
maybe

2865
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I don't know

2866
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
you seem pretty in line

2867
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
with that whole thing

2868
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
you seem to be all about

2869
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
personal responsibility

2870
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
but I don't believe in

2871
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
anarchy

2872
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I don't believe in anarchy

2873
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
okay so

2874
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
alright fine

2875
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
okay alright

2876
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
we did it

2877
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
but that doesn't matter

2878
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
you totally move the goalpost

2879
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
did I

2880
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
yeah we were talking about

2881
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
something else

2882
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and then you say

2883
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
okay but I'm not an ANCAP

2884
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and then the conversation

2885
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
becomes about that

2886
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
well I don't care

2887
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't care about that

2888
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
okay

2889
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I want to know

2890
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I feel like the way

2891
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Nate moves the goalpost

2892
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
is like

2893
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
completely in a

2894
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
klutzy way

2895
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
he has no idea that he did it

2896
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
he doesn't

2897
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
what is

2898
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
what's

2899
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
how do you feel

2900
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
okay how do you feel about this

2901
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
why you should be a leftist video

2902
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I mean I think it's

2903
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
well first of all

2904
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
the why you should be a leftist

2905
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
okay first of all

2906
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I haven't watched

2907
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
either of them

2908
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I have not watched

2909
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
either of these videos

2910
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
okay me either

2911
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
in the description

2912
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
well rather in the comments

2913
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I see people being like

2914
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
don't surrender to Nate and Digi

2915
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I see in like a couple of comments

2916
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
so I'm inferring

2917
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
that there's discussion

2918
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
of our positions

2919
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I mean I know Digi's a capitalist

2920
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm sure of that much

2921
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
as am I

2922
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
no he made a video

2923
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
like the other day

2924
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
like saying that he doesn't like

2925
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
ascribe any specific political

2926
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
oh that's fucking dumb

2927
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
he has he believes in things

2928
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
on the left or the right

2929
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I mean I guess he's a capitalist

2930
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
oh yeah

2931
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I don't fucking know

2932
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I don't fucking know

2933
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I think it's

2934
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
oh yeah I have no

2935
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I have no opinion about anything

2936
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
no that's not fucking it

2937
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I have no opinion about anything

2938
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
he has opinions on

2939
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I just think everything's fine

2940
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
as it is

2941
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I don't really think

2942
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
that's the position

2943
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I am a neoliberal capitalist

2944
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Ben that's such a fucking straw man

2945
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
that's the typical

2946
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
centrist boogeyman

2947
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
that people just make up

2948
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
yeah that's what it means

2949
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
it's not

2950
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
when someone says they're a centrist

2951
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
or that they don't believe

2952
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
that they don't take sides

2953
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
it doesn't mean that

2954
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
they just believe in nothing

2955
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and they have no opinions

2956
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
it means that their opinions

2957
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
aren't fucking rigidly held

2958
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
to one fucking moral standard

2959
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
on one side of the fucking

2960
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
coin or the other

2961
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
yeah

2962
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
if they have different beliefs

2963
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
about different shit

2964
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
did she didn't say

2965
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
he believes in nothing

2966
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
he just was like

2967
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
making it clear

2968
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
that he's not on the left

2969
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
or the right specifically

2970
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
if you're not on the left

2971
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
or the right

2972
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
then I'm sorry

2973
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
but you're on the right

2974
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
you're a neoliberal

2975
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
you're a neoliberal

2976
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
that doesn't make sense

2977
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
it literally does make sense

2978
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
because the overton window

2979
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
has shifted right

2980
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
oh my fucking god

2981
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
that is so dumb

2982
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
it's not dumb

2983
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
it makes perfect sense

2984
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
if you understand

2985
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
how neoliberalism works

2986
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
can't you have complex views

2987
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
of various political things

2988
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
that put you neither on either side

2989
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
you can want some things to change

2990
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
but not the other side

2991
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
are you saying that if you're

2992
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
if we don't believe

2993
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
that's not what I'm saying though

2994
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
are you saying if we don't

2995
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
agree with your perspectives

2996
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
that we're on the right

2997
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
is that

2998
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I mean like

2999
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
when it kind of boils down to it

3000
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm saying

3001
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
that if you take no position

3002
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
you implicitly endorse

3003
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
the status quo

3004
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
you're not taking

3005
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
no position

3006
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
no one is taking

3007
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
no positions

3008
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
then

3009
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
if you say you're not

3010
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
it could just mean like

3011
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I think that people

3012
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
should be allowed to have abortions

3013
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and I think people

3014
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
should be allowed to have guns

3015
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
that's two positions

3016
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
it's not taking no positions

3017
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
you have different opinions

3018
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
about different issues

3019
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and you take them

3020
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
one at a fucking time

3021
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
right

3022
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
those are both

3023
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
conservative positions

3024
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
oh they're not

3025
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
what

3026
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
having a being pro

3027
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
oh sorry

3028
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I misunderstood

3029
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
look

3030
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
they're different axes

3031
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
they're different axes

3032
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
to be left or right on

3033
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I agree

3034
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
the thing that is just

3035
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
you're reacting

3036
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
to my oversimplification

3037
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
of a thing did you said

3038
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
in a video

3039
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and you haven't seen the video

3040
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
so just

3041
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I would rather people

3042
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
like

3043
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
don't

3044
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
like make big assumptions like that

3045
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
like

3046
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
you know

3047
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
yell at me I guess

3048
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
don't yell

3049
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
don't yell at didgy

3050
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
for having things like

3051
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
your case

3052
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
we don't want to make any assumptions

3053
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
that's just like

3054
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I don't want to make any assumptions

3055
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
about the contents of these videos

3056
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I just thought the titles were funny

3057
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
and I know that they're directed at me

3058
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and possibly did you to another degree

3059
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
isn't that funny you guys

3060
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'm gonna watch this later

3061
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and see what I think about

3062
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I think it's funny

3063
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I will also

3064
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
agree

3065
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
okay I understand what you're saying

3066
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
about

3067
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
okay I guess what you're saying

3068
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
is that didgy says

3069
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
he's not on the left or the right

3070
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
because

3071
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
he has

3072
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
like

3073
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
individual views on particular topics

3074
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
and he is not entirely on one side of it

3075
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
like yeah like

3076
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
everyone is like that to a certain extent

3077
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
that's all that anyone

3078
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
ever means when they say

3079
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I'm not on the left right

3080
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
north or south

3081
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm on the fucking

3082
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I'm on the fucking underbelly

3083
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
that's what

3084
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
that's what side I'm on

3085
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
fair enough

3086
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
well

3087
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
there it is

3088
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I got a new thing to talk about

3089
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I made my first

3090
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
rowdy fucker's cop killer

3091
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
slime girl character

3092
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
wait

3093
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
oh god wait

3094
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I have one more thing to say

3095
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
about what we just said

3096
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
no no

3097
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
the politics

3098
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
the politics is over

3099
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
slime only

3100
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
slime only

3101
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
one last thing

3102
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
one last thing

3103
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
okay I understand that thing

3104
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
about how you can have bits and pieces here

3105
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
that are more

3106
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
more conservative and more liberal

3107
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
okay

3108
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
but if you say

3109
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I'm not a capitalist

3110
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
then what are you

3111
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
if the answer is

3112
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
nothing in particular

3113
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
unless you have a specific thing

3114
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
that you are

3115
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
that is opposed to capitalism

3116
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
then you are just saying

3117
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I already

3118
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
then you are just endorsing

3119
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
the status quo

3120
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
no you're not

3121
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Ben

3122
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
who is a capitalist

3123
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
just with limitations

3124
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
therefore a democratic socialist

3125
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
or whatever

3126
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Ben how was he

3127
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
well he's a capitalist

3128
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I think the

3129
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I guess

3130
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
the thing there then

3131
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
is that I

3132
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
interjected incorrectly

3133
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
because did you

3134
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I don't think said anything

3135
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
about capitalism

3136
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
he was talking about left or

3137
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
right in the video I was watching

3138
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
okay

3139
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
well I already

3140
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
solved this dilemma

3141
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
like 50 episodes ago

3142
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
when I invented

3143
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
my political philosophy

3144
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and our co-fascism

3145
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
right

3146
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
you

3147
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
legalize it

3148
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
it's already a thing

3149
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I'm sorry

3150
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
it's not already a thing

3151
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I invented it

3152
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
it doesn't make any sense

3153
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
it's not okay

3154
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
first of all I take

3155
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
more offense

3156
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
drag has talked about it

3157
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I fucking set up

3158
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
before god damn drag

3159
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
who is drag

3160
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I don't care

3161
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
never mind

3162
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I don't

3163
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I invented it

3164
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
it's not a thing

3165
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
well there you go

3166
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
drag can go fuck himself

3167
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
tell me about an

3168
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
our co-fascism

3169
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
oh my god

3170
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
tell me

3171
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I already did this

3172
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
on a previous episode

3173
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
of this

3174
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
can you summarize it

3175
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
in a line

3176
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
what's the

3177
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
what's the thrust

3178
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
it's cool

3179
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
that's what it is

3180
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
it's just what you're being cool

3181
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
it's the philosophy

3182
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
that the only

3183
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
political systems

3184
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
that will ever be

3185
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
right and fair and just

3186
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
are either

3187
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
complete anarchy

3188
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
or complete fascism

3189
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
and everything in between

3190
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
is a worthless

3191
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
half measure

3192
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
which makes everything

3193
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
unfair and shitty

3194
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I invented that

3195
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
it's my

3196
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
thing

3197
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and I'm

3198
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I'm less offended

3199
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
at you saying

3200
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
it makes no sense

3201
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
than you saying that

3202
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
someone else said it first

3203
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
maybe they have

3204
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
a different definition

3205
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
or something

3206
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I don't know

3207
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
there's nothing new

3208
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
under the sun

3209
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
man

3210
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
okay

3211
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
slime

3212
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
anyway

3213
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
tell me about slime

3214
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I made a slime girl

3215
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I've seen

3216
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
there are slime girls

3217
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
in rfck

3218
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
you don't do anything

3219
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
gameplay wise

3220
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
to create them

3221
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
you just draw them

3222
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and then they're canon

3223
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
yes

3224
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
how does every single thing

3225
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
in rck

3226
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
sometimes

3227
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
no some of them are

3228
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
slime oids

3229
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
that exist in game

3230
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
oh yeah

3231
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
that is true

3232
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
true

3233
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
yeah

3234
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
but I made

3235
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I made one

3236
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and I think she's

3237
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
pretty fucking cool

3238
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
cause she's not like

3239
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
the typical

3240
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
beauty

3241
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
slime

3242
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
like fuck toy

3243
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
slime girl

3244
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
like all the others

3245
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
slime girls

3246
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
they're all just

3247
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
fuck toys

3248
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
they have

3249
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
they have feelings man

3250
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
they're all

3251
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
even the sexy

3252
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
it's no special

3253
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
they have a sexy one

3254
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
they feel

3255
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
they're all sculpted with

3256
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
bedroom eyes

3257
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
like permanently locked

3258
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
on their face

3259
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I saw this

3260
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
in community service

3261
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I saw this

3262
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
when you first posted it

3263
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
and I thought it was really nice

3264
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
and I liked your fallup

3265
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
gun girl comic

3266
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
what do you have to say about it

3267
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I don't know

3268
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I apologize

3269
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
okay

3270
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I like rfck

3271
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
can we talk about that

3272
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
just a little bit

3273
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
oh we can

3274
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I'm afraid

3275
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
you know

3276
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I don't know

3277
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm afraid that the more

3278
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
we talk about

3279
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
the more people are gonna hate it

3280
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
who are on the fence

3281
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I have a feeling that

3282
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
like the vast majority

3283
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
of PCP heads

3284
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
like know what it is

3285
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
and they're like

3286
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
oh god this should get

3287
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
now I hate it for no reason

3288
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I think quite a few

3289
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
have come to a decision

3290
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
that they don't know

3291
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
what that is

3292
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and they're not interested

3293
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
in looking into it

3294
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
for whatever right or wrong

3295
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
you know whatever reason

3296
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I think a lot of the time

3297
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
it's just because it's

3298
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
mostly munchy and Ben

3299
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
who are like

3300
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
advertising talking it

3301
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000

endorses yang thing

3317
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000

3318
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000

01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000

that song

3345
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
about the different dimensions

3346
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
different to other

3347
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
world dimension

3348
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
yeah of course

3349
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
foggy town

3350
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000

3351
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
just the same

3352
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000

3353
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000

3354
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
for the son

3355
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
for the sonichu canon

3356
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
we should look into that

3357
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
we should look into that

3358
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
yeah okay

3359
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
so and then

3360
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
like a huge amount of it

3361
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
is basically delivered

3362
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000

3366
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
fucking like

3367
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
time traveling

3368
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Nazis come into it

3369
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000

3370
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000

no explanation at all

3377
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
in the text about

3378
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
like what he's gonna talk

3379
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
you have to know neptunia lore

3380
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
to get that shit

3381
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000

3382
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
yeah okay it is

3383
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
it really needs

3384
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
some explanation

3385
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
and I am the man

3386
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I am the man for the job

3387
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I sense I feel it in my bones

3388
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000

3389
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000

3391
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
cocked and ready to be black

3392
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I could do it today

3393
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
if someone demanded me

3394
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
of it I could do it today

3395
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
so I'm just saying

3396
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
when that next bad boy rolls

3397
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000

3398
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I'm ready to go

3399
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I'm ready to go

3400
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Brad cunt for when

3401
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Brad cunt for when

3402
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
one of these days

3403
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
hey would you guys

3404
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
let me know in the comments

3405
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
would you give money

3406
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
for radcon for kickstarters

3407
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
oh no

3408
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
would you do that

3409
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
would you give us money

3410
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
is that the official name

3411
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
for radcon for

3412
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
radcon for when

3413
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
would you give us money

3414
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
please

3415
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I think we have to abandon

3416
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
the radcon for ever plan

3417
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
the devourage

3418
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
we suggest it

3419
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
because it's not forever

3420
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
it's far from it

3421
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
it's

3422
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
it's very limited time

3423
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
only

3424
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
if we can't

3425
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
then high five rfckhq

3426
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
happen way before pcbhq

3427
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
and we're real and we're

3428
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
actually cool

3429
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
what's rfckhq

3430
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
bam

3431
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I mean we both

3432
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
we live in the same place

3433
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and now rfckhq is

3434
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
only in person now

3435
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
it's rfckhq

3436
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
is it

3437
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
boston

3438
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
that seems a little bit

3439
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
cheating

3440
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
it's like

3441
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
a city

3442
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
why is it

3443
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
cheating

3444
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
how is it

3445
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
cheating

3446
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
an hq is not

3447
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
a city

3448
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
munchie

3449
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
do I have to explain this

3450
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
to your puny baby

3451
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
the point of pcbhq

3452
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
was never that

3453
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
we would all live in

3454
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
the same house

3455
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
it was that we'd live

3456
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
in the same

3457
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
it was initially

3458
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
the same house

3459
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
it quickly became

3460
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
gas

3461
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
also can I

3462
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I know I'm not involved at all

3463
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
but you have to

3464
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
change the name from

3465
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
rfckhq

3466
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
to rfckapital

3467
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
oh you know

3468
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
that makes sense

3469
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
what

3470
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
die

3471
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
uh oh

3472
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
hey

3473
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
weren't you in

3474
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
who was that who just drew

3475
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
a picture of tom

3476
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
and rfck

3477
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
that was

3478
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
acro

3479
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
that's right

3480
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
it was sick

3481
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
you were

3482
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
weren't you the general

3483
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
of the juvies or something

3484
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
yeah I think it's

3485
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
cause did I say that

3486
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
in the last

3487
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
rowdy fuckers copular stream

3488
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
that was on

3489
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
that I mentioned that

3490
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
yeah

3491
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
that would be tom oliver

3492
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
king of the juvies

3493
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
that's good

3494
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
to worship juvie hova

3495
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
take it

3496
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
you know what

3497
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
you can have it

3498
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
you can have it

3499
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
no one wants that crown

3500
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
it's yours for the take

3501
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
the crown weighs heavy

3502
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
just like the man himself

3503
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
back in the day

3504
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
he was

3505
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
disrespected

3506
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
but his legacy lives on

3507
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
past everyone

3508
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
it's a true crown of thorns

3509
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I'm thinking about

3510
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I'm thinking about continuity

3511
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I'm thinking

3512
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I'm thinking that

3513
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
rfck

3514
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
probably

3515
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
takes place

3516
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
in the same

3517
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
universe

3518
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
as a sonichu

3519
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
c197

3520
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm thinking

3521
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I'm thinking tbap

3522
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
probably does too

3523
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
this is all like

3524
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'm thinking

3525
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
there's no reason

3526
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
why these dimensions

3527
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
can't like

3528
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
you know

3529
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
connect with one another

3530
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I did I see no reason

3531
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
why

3532
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and also in my head

3533
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
ever since

3534
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
like the first

3535
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
crossover

3536
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
that I felt was

3537
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
important

3538
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I can't remember what it was

3539
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
but it was a pony thing

3540
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
ever since then

3541
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I've always been

3542
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
in my mind

3543
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
like spinning

3544
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
a web of like

3545
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
connections

3546
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
to connect everything

3547
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I've ever done

3548
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
and like

3549
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and all my friends

3550
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
all together

3551
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
in a cool like

3552
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
yeah you know

3553
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
that could work

3554
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
and you know

3555
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
considering the unusual

3556
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
amount of slime

3557
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
grime scum

3558
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
and villainy

3559
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
in the city

3560
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
the unnamed city

3561
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I believe

3562
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I'm thinking that

3563
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
7

3564
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
the movie 7

3565
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
by David Fincher

3566
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
probably takes place

3567
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
in the same universe

3568
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
starring Brad Pitt

3569
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Morgan Freeman baby

3570
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
all fictional characters

3571
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
all fictional characters

3572
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
exist in dimension

3573
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
C197

3574
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
and our dimension

3575
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
dimension 1218

3576
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
is merging with it

3577
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
to create dimension

3578
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
3

3579
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
C

3580
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
dash

3581
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
1

3582
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
2

3583
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
whatever

3584
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
it doesn't matter

3585
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
our dimensions are merging

3586
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
like zoos will be real

3587
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
slime city

3588
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
will be real

3589
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
it's all

3590
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
the movie 7

3591
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
will be real

3592
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
David Fincher

3593
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
will finally at last

3594
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
be real

3595
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
yeah

3596
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
so I will all live together

3597
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
in harmony

3598
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
the putty cast

3599
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
and the pony cast

3600
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
sail in the same ocean

3601
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
oh yeah

3602
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
magic hand says

3603
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
that the

3604
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
magic hand says

3605
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
that the dimensional merge

3606
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
is coming soon

3607
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
and let's not forget

3608
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
arm retrieval and potty cast

3609
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
have a crossover

3610
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
therefore all of homestuck

3611
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
so that

3612
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
so that all of homestuck

3613
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
is canon 2

3614
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
one piece

3615
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
it's all in there

3616
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
are you stealing your dads

3617
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I've always thought

3618
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
that they're like

3619
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
parallel universes

3620
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
to rf2k

3621
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
they're very similar

3622
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
in a lot of ways

3623
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
slime never existed

3624
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
but oil did

3625
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
well I

3626
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I imagine it's almost

3627
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
like if

3628
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
if stealing your dad

3629
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
is like in the far future

3630
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
from rf2k

3631
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
where like

3632
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
slime city just becomes

3633
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
slime everywhere

3634
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
like slime world

3635
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and then like

3636
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
after it all progresses

3637
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
slime is all dried up

3638
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
but morals and society

3639
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
is still fucked forever

3640
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and that's when

3641
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
stealing your dad

3642
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
takes place

3643
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
okay that sounds good

3644
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
boy

3645
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
this went way off the rail

3646
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
guys I'm so mad

3647
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
let's bring it

3648
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I have to bring it back

3649
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
to the political thing

3650
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I hate to be the bad guy

3651
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
and bring it back to that

3652
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
but because

3653
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
because Ben brought up

3654
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
that like

3655
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
my hilarious and cool

3656
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
political ideology

3657
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
has been bow guarded

3658
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
by smooth brains

3659
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
all over the internet

3660
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
you know I went on google

3661
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
just to fact check

3662
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
and make sure

3663
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and sure enough

3664
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
there's an urban dictionary

3665
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
for anarcho fascism

3666
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
and just listen

3667
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
you know

3668
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
you heard how I defined it

3669
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
you heard my cool

3670
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
philosophy

3671
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
what the philosophy

3672
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
actually is

3673
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
as created by me

3674
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
global icon

3675
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and national treasure

3676
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
endless jest

3677
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
listen to how

3678
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
these fucking

3679
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
smooth brain

3680
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
political fucktards

3681
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
have butchered

3682
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
my political philosophy

3683
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
anarcho which

3684
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
yeah

3685
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
okay go on

3686
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
sorry sorry

3687
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
anarcho fascism

3688
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
is based on the premise

3689
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
that in post capital

3690
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
in parentheses

3691
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
cryptocurrency centric

3692
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
societies

3693
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
racial identitarianism

3694
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
loses its stigma

3695
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
anarcho fascism

3696
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
or national in parentheses

3697
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
nationalist anarchism propounds

3698
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
what the fuck

3699
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
propounds is not a word

3700
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I refuse to believe that

3701
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
that only ethnic cohesion

3702
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
can form self-referential societies

3703
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
in the wake of capitalism's collapse

3704
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
in the absence of

3705
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
identitarian action

3706
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
national anarchism believes that

3707
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
capitalism specifically

3708
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
global capitalism

3709
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
will collapse into Marxism

3710
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
the exclusive precursor

3711
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
to 5G

3712
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
in parentheses

3713
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
fifth generation warfare

3714
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
what the hell

3715
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
they've butchered it

3716
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
they've ruined it

3717
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
yeah

3718
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
what the fuck

3719
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
that sounds very good

3720
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
it doesn't make any sense

3721
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
you know you know

3722
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
it's just

3723
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
how is anarcho

3724
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
this is how

3725
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
it was like a bunch of noise

3726
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
it was noise

3727
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
it was a bunch of meaningless

3728
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
drivel and words

3729
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
this is the problem

3730
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
the world has been so fucking

3731
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
poisoned with politics

3732
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
that when someone comes up with

3733
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
something that is pure

3734
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and hilarious and cool

3735
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
like my anarcho fascism

3736
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
wait

3737
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
like a political system

3738
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
yeah

3739
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
what's the deal

3740
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
immediately the world just takes it

3741
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and they just add words to it

3742
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and they add bullshit to it

3743
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
and make it mean nothing

3744
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and make it a stupid meme

3745
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
it was a fucking

3746
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
it was a cool meme

3747
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I made a cool meme

3748
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
and they made it stupid

3749
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
because they added

3750
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
what the fuck is this

3751
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
is this like a real thing

3752
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I do hate when people make things

3753
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
too grounded in real politics

3754
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Jesse what's the date of this entry

3755
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000

3758
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
oh wait 18

3759
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I thought it was 2019

3760
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I don't know

3761
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
does that predate

3762
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
doesn't predate your state

3763
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
it might but mine is better

3764
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
my idea was so much better

3765
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
my idea was pure

3766
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and it was funny

3767
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and it was cool

3768
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
is a political ideology

3769
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
how can you make it

3770
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
too about real world politics

3771
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
it's not a political ideology

3772
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
it's me being cool

3773
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
well I like Jesse's funny

3774
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000

3776
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I choose that one

3777
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000

porch monkey

3786
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
you have to make a shirt

3787
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I have to take back

3788
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
anarcho fascism

and you know

3798
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
they're simple

3799
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and anyone can understand them

3800
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
and you hear them

a narco fascist shirts

3809
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
please put them on a different site

3810
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
don't put them on the pcp

3811
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
teespring please

3812
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
too late

3813
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
why

3814
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
because

3815
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Ben can't be associated

3816
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
with his mortal enemy

3817
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
yeah

3818
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I'm really sorry

3819
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I'm really sorry

3820
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
that I don't want the pcp

3821
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
selling fucking fascism

3822
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
on t-shirt

3823
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I mean look

3824
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I don't thank you

3825
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I don't really give a shit

3826
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
no one's making a t-shirt

3827
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
you're getting nothing to do

3828
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
with anything

3829
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I thought you said something about shirt

3830
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
okay whatever

3831
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
if Ben had the good graces

3832
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
to put the yang thing

3833
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
on his own thing

3834
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
then let's keep all

3835
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
political shirts

3836
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
you know

3837
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
my point is

3838
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
no idea can just be

3839
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
pure and funny and cool

3840
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
someone has to take it too seriously

3841
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and turn it into a thing

3842
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
with words

3843
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
like identitarianism in it

3844
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
and propounds

3845
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I sympathize

3846
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I truly do

3847
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
with people

3848
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
who are very concerned

3849
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
about politics day to day

3850
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
and they worry that the world

3851
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
is going in bad directions

3852
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
but certainly

3853
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
we could all agree

3854
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
that sometimes

3855
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
you just want to be cool

3856
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
and you just want to

3857
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
hang out

3858
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and suck your own dick

3859
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
if you don't

3860
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
if you don't feel

3861
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
like thinking about

3862
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
real world politics

3863
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
then maybe

3864
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
maybe don't

3865
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
talk about

3866
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
an arc of fascism

3867
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
like that's

3868
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
that's

3869
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
talk about something else

3870
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Ben it's not

3871
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
it's not real world

3872
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
politics

3873
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
no one even believes

3874
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
in an arc of fascism

3875
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
you just described

3876
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
real world politics

3877
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I did not

3878
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
these are not real words Ben

3879
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
what the hell does

3880
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
identitarianism mean

3881
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
well I literally

3882
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
know the answer to that

3883
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
but I don't want to

3884
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
get into it

3885
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
what the hell does

3886
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
what the hell does

3887
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
based on the premise

3888
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
that in post-capital

3889
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
cryptocurrency

3890
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
centric society

3891
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
is racial identitarian

3892
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
loses its sigma

3893
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
that's not words man

3894
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
yes it is

3895
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
it means

3896
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
racism becomes cool

3897
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
and everyone forms

3898
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
that is not my

3899
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
well that is not

3900
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
my anarco fascism

3901
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
that doesn't even

3902
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I know and that's why

3903
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I don't want to fucking

3904
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
associate myself with this

3905
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
that doesn't even

3906
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
that doesn't even sound

3907
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
like it should be called

3908
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
anarco fascism

3909
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
that should have a different name

3910
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
like my

3911
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I really don't get the

3912
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
anarco ass

3913
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
okay you know what

3914
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't care

3915
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
well it's anarco because

3916
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
it's not imposed

3917
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
from the top down

3918
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
the whole point of

3919
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
my bit is that

3920
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
like it is

3921
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
what it sounds like

3922
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
like the words

3923
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
are opposites

3924
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
and that's why

3925
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
it's funny

3926
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
that's just what I thought

3927
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I was like

3928
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
what is this

3929
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
this is

3930
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
what is this

3931
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
this definition

3932
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
that I'm looking at here

3933
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
does not sound like

3934
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
that

3935
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
this is a measurable battle

3936
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
this is a battle

3937
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
which you can win

3938
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
and the way

3939
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
you win

3940
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
is by getting

3941
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
your definition so popular

3942
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
it becomes the

3943
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
number one definition

3944
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
on urban dictionary

3945
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
that's how you win

3946
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
the battle

3947
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
once again

3948
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
society has conspired

3949
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
to ruin one of

3950
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
my bits

3951
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
that's how it always

3952
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,400
I'm a bit machine over here, and I'm just cranking out cool stuff and and hilarious

3953
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:19,480
Witticisms and slogans and and and I'm making people have fun

3954
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:25,080
I'm creating fun for the world, but the world just can't handle the world doesn't want fun any world in anymore

3955
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:31,960
The world doesn't want fun the world just wants like weird political shit that they can argue about so they took they take all my fun

3956
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:38,600
Bits and they and they corrupt them and they pervert them into this and it just makes me sad for humanity

3957
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,200
You know when a character gets drunk in a party in a movie and the camera starts like wishing around

3958
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,640
It's like a zoom in and out just like tilting over and over and over again

3959
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,800
And then like the screen starts to fade black and the character falls on the floor. That's been me for like 35

3960
01:18:54,440 --> 01:19:00,360
All right, all right speaking speaking of UBI I've decided I no longer need UBI because I've found a way

3961
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:06,200
I found a way to give myself a thousand dollars a month, okay, and it's fucking fantastic. Yeah, so it's called crying

3962
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:11,080
With UBI you could have two thousand dollars. I guess I guess but but we all

3963
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,040
You got me back on the train, but um so I

3964
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:25,160
We've we've been long discussing the the energy drink wars, you know, we got the bansters Roman streets, of course

3965
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,920
We got the C4 heads. I'm a newly formed C4. We got the rain

3966
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,880
Fucking I'm a rain. I'm a rain now that 7-eleven offers two for one rain

3967
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,680
You're a rain cyst. Are you saying you're a rain?

3968
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,000
I'm a rain cyst. Yeah, rain. Rainsy rainsy rainsy in economics, baby

3969
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,160
I've dabbled a bit here and there and all these these newfangled

3970
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:50,560
Zoomer drinks, but I'm still I'm still clinging hardcore to the OG Red Bull

3971
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:56,120
Red Bull is the best dude. So it costs like eight dollars a can. That's my point

3972
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:03,760
This is the problem the big problem with Red Bull is that it comes in an 8.4 fluid ounce can on average

3973
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:10,020
But it costs the exact same as a 16 fluid ounce can of any other energy drink, which is shit

3974
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,240
But yeah, it is yesterday

3975
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,600
I was crippled in my bed because I can't move anywhere and I needed groceries

3976
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,220
So I decided to order Instacart from Aldi and Aldi has yes red

3977
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:29,080
Thunder which is Red Bull, but not and it's you get a pack of four for three

3978
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:35,860
Dollars and it is that has instantly given me like a thousand dollars a month back because I no longer have to spend like

3979
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,720
60 to a hundred dollars on am I crippling Red Bull addiction? I can spend a fraction of the price

3980
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:48,920
I have seen I have seen red Thunder at Aldi. Aldi is really good. I work if you like monster

3981
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,800
I recommend gridlock. I also did I got the red one is the best one

3982
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,720
I've not seen the red I got gridlock ultra-white and which pretty good

3983
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:03,440
Yeah, but I'm still red ones hard. I'm still on team red Thunder for life. It's the best. They got the sugar free

3984
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,800
It's good. Yeah less than a dollar a can like God intended instead of this three fifty to four dollar

3985
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,560
Scalping that dude original does

3986
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,920
Straight up super glad to hear you're an Aldi boy. Yeah Aldi Aldi is the shit

3987
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:20,440
You know this is we actually buy quite a bit of Red Bull

3988
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:24,480
I don't drink that much, but like Michelle, and I'll get it fairly really why I

3989
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,120
Because it's it was there and we think Red Bull is good, but but now here

3990
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,760
There's alternative energy drinks that are cheaper for more red Thunder

3991
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:39,360
I'm looking at his red Thunder. It looks exactly like Red Bull except it was made by like a college student with a design instead of a

3992
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:44,000
Professional, it's like okay. That's like that's like Aldi stick in general. They also have

3993
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,040
super cheap

3994
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,020
Slim Jim knockoffs. Okay. I bought like

3995
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:54,620
36 of them for like seven dollars super cheap knockoffs of stuff. Yeah, it's the best

3996
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,420
It's the best store of all time

3997
01:21:56,420 --> 01:22:02,420
Uh, it is the best and a bit and the only the only price you pay is that the place looks really ugly on the inside

3998
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:08,500
And you have to loan them you have to loan them one quarter to use a shopping cart

3999
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:15,180
I fixed that problem too because I got it with Instacart, so I paid three dollars and someone came to my door and gave me everything

4000
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:21,360
That's worth here's the other the other trick about Instacart Tom is that you can get them to shop at like Costco and

4001
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,820
BJ's and like places that you need a membership

4002
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:28,420
They will shop at these play at these like bulk places for you and you don't need a membership for it

4003
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,460
It's fucking so every time I use Instacart or the other time the whole time well

4004
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:36,380
It says your shopper is now getting though. I go dance puppet dance for me. Oh, yes

4005
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,060
Yesterday my cheap goods yesterday

4006
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:44,700
I bought like five pounds of sausage and like big-ass bags of like mozzarella cheese and almond flour from Costco

4007
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:51,180
Normally that would cost me like a hundred dollars or whatever for like a year's membership at Costco. Mm-hmm, and I fucking tricked them

4008
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:57,180
That's this is fantastic. It's amazing. This is capitalism working as intended. All the amazing Instacart fantastic

4009
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:01,340
Yeah, and now I have so much more money. The only thing that sucks about Instacart

4010
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,580
It doesn't take my ebt card and then I could totally destroy the system for real. Yeah

4011
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,020
Yeah, they don't you have to go it you have to go in person to use

4012
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:13,340
It's because they the delivery fee and stuff doesn't count like you can't pay that with ebt

4013
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:18,300
Yeah, I mean I they would just they would need the card they would need to have your card with them

4014
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:26,140
It's sad sad, but true. I mean, you know, I think you can actually just like withdraw ebt from an ATM

4015
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:31,500
That I'm pretty I haven't I haven't tried it, but I haven't tried it

4016
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,780
It does it sure does

4017
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,500
But I think it says somewhere in the literature that like you can do it

4018
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,780
I think I think there's a different program. There's an ebt cash program

4019
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:49,340
I don't think that's a standard ebt card that is that is different, but um, I'm I don't know

4020
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:52,380
Maybe I'll try it at some point and like get back to you on it

4021
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:59,500
But I think it said that like you can do it even with the food moral the story red thunder brings brings red bull back into the game

4022
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:03,540
Hardcore it's a real competitor now and everybody needs to get on it

4023
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,660
I like the system

4024
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:09,660
Yeah, that ebt card issue makes me think that like wouldn't it be more practical if I don't know like maybe like

4025
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:15,220
There's a lot of like, you know, layabouts, you know a lot of a lot of bums a lot of grifters and drifters

4026
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:20,780
Couldn't we just like make them our property and just like give them purpose and have the state and force them sort of

4027
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:26,220
Death explosion collar on them if they don't go get our groceries then we give them our ebt cards

4028
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:31,700
We'll call it a slavery that sounds good and then we'll just you know make that be the system

4029
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,500
Seems like

4030
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:41,780
Uh

4031
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:46,800
Well anything else or should we get to the voicemails? I'm down. I'm ready shit up. Let's get to the voicemails

4032
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:54,380
Yeah, Ben. Oh, no, I was thinking about was there something else that we talked about before the show

4033
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:59,780
No, I think it was mage. Yeah, mage asking who is CWC. We're just too many people too many people and I said shut up

4034
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:02,580
Shut up. We'll talk about it on the show and then she left. Yeah

4035
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:09,180
But scared off by our whatever I touched on that whole CWC time for everyone's favorite second

4036
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:15,180
The voicemails now you may be thanking yourself all got a strap in for some really terrible audio content

4037
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:19,580
Well, never fear. I was the one who picked out the voicemails on this one. So we only have five and

4038
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,420
Frankly, I'm fine to like skip like this one

4039
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:28,940
I just want to play it because this guy is another like I want to like publicly humiliate him because he's another one

4040
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:32,420
The long string of people who just are I'm gonna do them the pathetics

4041
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:36,400
So this guy's another pathetic who wants to come in here and like guys

4042
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:41,060
How do I be like a baseline like level zero human being?

4043
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:47,620
How do I like understand simple childlike concepts? Please explain to me how I can stop being such a like

4044
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:51,860
Comically bad person. So let's go. Let's go to this guy with this society

4045
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:57,500
You know, I got pretty like big list of friends and I'll like ask one of them to hang out

4046
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,740
Uh-huh, and they'll be like, no, I got a girlfriend can't hang out. Sorry

4047
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,740
Like I can barely

4048
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:07,460
Logical because he has a fucking girlfriend and then I have another friend who's got like work and that's like, you know

4049
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:11,140
More reasonable, but he's like, oh, I have to work all the time can't can't hang out

4050
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:16,820
Sorry, and like, you know other stuff like that like just friends that are busy like all the fucking time

4051
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,020
And I'm so busy with doing nothing like I don't have

4052
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:26,500
Any of that and I just want to hang out with people and I rarely ever can so I gotta make new friends

4053
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,220
New friends

4054
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:37,940
Hey, man, you oh, he's still going cut it off cut it off. I've had enough

4055
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,740
Look, man, you being an underachieving need is not your friend's burden

4056
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:47,540
That's that's true. Yeah, that's 100 percent. This is sounds like you need a job in a girlfriend

4057
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:52,980
Maybe maybe yeah, you should get a girlfriend yourself and then you too can know the joy of

4058
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:58,420
Of ignoring your other friends of someone. Yeah, the the the best part about having a girlfriend is

4059
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:04,420
Not being not being allowed to see your friend. Yeah, it's having an excuse to not talk to anyone

4060
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,340
There's that I think you need to realize that uh, you know

4061
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:13,460
If your friends wanted to hang out with you uh work in your girl and their girlfriends would not be an excuse

4062
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:20,180
We're a hundred percent of the time like it seems to be with you. So it's obvious that you are busy being doing nothing

4063
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:25,300
Obviously you have nothing contribute to them none in terms of monetary or anything like that

4064
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:29,540
But just in terms of you know, you have no personality. You have nothing going for you

4065
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:37,140
It might not be that he has what do you have that is that can supersede their monetary and sexual needs

4066
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,460
That's what that's what comes down to uh

4067
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:41,140
Just you gotta

4068
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:48,260
Literally just be cool up your cool level. Just go grind your coolness by doing fun things that people aren't hanging out with you

4069
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:55,380
Actually get an interest and a job or a girlfriend get anything just you know, stop doing nothing like a fucking freak

4070
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:59,540
Why would you think anyone would want to hang out with you? You obviously have no redeeming aspects

4071
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:04,980
Why would you go to the show the fact that you're watching the pcp right now and not slamming a fucking puts into the ground

4072
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,060
That's like really upsetting to me and honestly

4073
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:14,820
That's true. I am disappointed at every single one of you listening to this podcast instead of slamming a pus or yeah, that's fair

4074
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:20,820
So this guy society you're going in the voice channel. I fucking hate you. You're another pathetic

4075
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:24,420
You're just another one of the pathetic's lining up speaking of the pathetic's

4076
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:28,820
We got another pathetic following up on his last pathetic display. So come on dance for me pathetic

4077
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,140
Oh my god, we really went hard on that poor boy

4078
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:37,380
Hi, I called in last time basically for emotional support because I was anxious about going to a movie alone

4079
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:42,100
Going to see millennia mattress. Oh, right and thankfully might hear a munchie told me to kill myself

4080
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:48,820
I didn't have to go to the movie and uh, maybe I'm used to discover that it was almost all other men who were alone

4081
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:52,180
Who looked basically exactly there you go. There you go. Also millennia mattress

4082
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:56,500
All right, so see we're making a positive different people's lives. Listen, you come on the pcp

4083
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:00,580
You get the tough love you need. I tell you to kill yourself and then your life's fixed

4084
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:03,620
I mean, I think there's no that I think it's just a win-win for everyone

4085
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:09,140
No, it's a three-step process come on the pcb munchie. Tell us to kill yourself. That's it. You're probably solved

4086
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,140
You don't clear in your reborn again

4087
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:17,140
So that's I listen, you know, he came on here with like a pathetic like baby tear question

4088
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:19,620
Oh, how do I like exist?

4089
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:26,020
How do I breathe and fucking move my legs to the movie theater to sit down on my fat ass and munch popcorn

4090
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:30,660
And not be scared that people are looking at me. He just did it and it was fine. There was no problem

4091
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:34,660
He had nothing to overcome literally at all. This is what this is what the other guys gotta do

4092
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:41,140
You know, you it's completely fine. You and your friends just hate you just stop being someone who they hate and then you'll be fine

4093
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,220
Like it's not a big deal. Yeah

4094
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:49,620
So no more pathetic. Let's give this something like normal people like like something just like a normal thing that like you like a real question

4095
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:56,660
Toot the room other fuckers. No gimmicks or anything. I just got a totally normal ass question for you

4096
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:01,700
What is the most human core thing ever?

4097
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,380
Oh

4098
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:07,140
Now I don't want I already know the answer, but I don't want to reveal it right now

4099
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,460
Instead, I actually want to see what you guys think it is. Maybe talk about it a little and

4100
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:15,300
I'll get back to you next week and I'll tell you what it is. I know

4101
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,900
Only humans do this

4102
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:24,580
Okay, nothing else does it and every human does it. Here's my here's my answer

4103
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:33,140
Applauding in the crowd at a wedding as they just said like I do and everyone's applauding as they kiss

4104
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,460
In the in the little thing up there

4105
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,500
I've got another one

4106
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:41,380
Uh thanking thanking your bus driver

4107
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:47,860
I'm saying saying thank you when you get off the bus. I have like they did you a favor

4108
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:51,860
I have what I believe to be the answer. I don't think it's going to be his answer

4109
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,780
Yeah, but uh

4110
01:30:53,780 --> 01:31:01,380
The most the most human core thing that has ever happened is probably the 1980s charity collaboration song

4111
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,380
We are the world

4112
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:07,300
Yeah, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. That's very human core

4113
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:12,340
I hadn't gone on their speech about this if you want look I I if I if I remember called the exact number of this

4114
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,340
I'm gonna be a fucking genius episode

4115
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:21,220
104 the one where I go to hawaii about sea turtles. Um, but my answer is collectively bread and dogs

4116
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,180
Dogs are definitely up. I was thinking like

4117
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:30,100
Bread is a great answer bread is it's a food that we invented. Yeah out of nothing

4118
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,420
It's it's it's like an agricultural thing

4119
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:37,620
Which the reason I describe that as human cores because we as humans have gone above what other animals are able to do

4120
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,620
We are made able to make agriculture and farm

4121
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,220
It's a collective thing and it's just high in dense and calories and we feed it to other people

4122
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:47,060
It's collaborative group effort project the normal bread is like the most

4123
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,380
enduring

4124
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:54,660
Thing that is still used today from the dawn of civilization. Yeah, it is civilization

4125
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:58,660
Uh, you find that's it. That's the answer why fix why fix what ain't broken

4126
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:04,100
Uh, he okay. Um, maybe because I'm fucking keto because I've evolved beyond it. I know better

4127
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:07,380
That's true. I mean, that's true

4128
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:11,060
Whatever bread works for for bread does what it's supposed to do. That's true

4129
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:15,060
Okay, I don't know if I agree that bread is human core because to me

4130
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:18,420
What is human core is not simply doing what humans do

4131
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,420
It is doing like a it is it is like a

4132
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,380
Well, hold on

4133
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:33,860
Okay, I think to me human core is indulging in a human impulse that is uh, never that is detrimental

4134
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:40,180
To two humans actual ends. Well, this goes this goes to I mean this I mean it just depends on our definition here

4135
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:43,700
Just depends on our definition. I don't get human human core. I don't know

4136
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:47,940
It's not being human core to me is not the same thing as simply being human

4137
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:53,220
Well, I don't I don't think I like I say bread just because people eat bread

4138
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,060
I say it because I think it's emblematic of like a very like human thing

4139
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:02,260
Which is agriculture and like collaborative eating and and farming and surplus and stuff like that

4140
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:05,460
That's right. Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with those things. Well, I don't think

4141
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:10,340
I mean to me human core is is a derogatory not to me

4142
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:16,820
The most human thing is discussing politics online. There is nothing more deplorable

4143
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,060
That's pretty human

4144
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,660
And I agree that is very negative

4145
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:26,500
Shit, I had another thing I wanted to bring up the you can do it

4146
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:28,980
I will

4147
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:30,500
human core is like

4148
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:36,420
It's so strange that I can't even like decide on which definition I agree with like really doesn't

4149
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:43,540
It's so vague that I I I can't like I can't even I can't even come up with my own like idea of like what it means to me

4150
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:45,780
To be derogatory or is it meant to be?

4151
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:53,940
When I use it and I invented it so so this is me when I use it, I mean it as

4152
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:58,900
Yes, I did. Okay. No. Well, as we saw ben when you invent something cool

4153
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,980
It will be perverted by the world

4154
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:08,100
All right. Well here like like the guy who invented the the gif to try and tell everyone no actually

4155
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:10,180
I always intended it to be pronounced gif

4156
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:16,900
Here's me the the true and the true and honest creator christine weston chandler telling you that human core is an insult

4157
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,140
It is not to be used to just describe

4158
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:26,820
Anything that humans do it is it is uh, it is the like the worst human impulses. I mean, I think sneakers are pretty human core

4159
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,820
And they're pretty cool

4160
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,940
There you have it, you know, my uh

4161
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:36,900
Dita's walk to concrete doors and walks all the concierge floors

4162
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:41,380
Anything that you would be embarrassed of as a human core is is yeah, okay

4163
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:45,940
So if yeah, if you'd be embarrassed of your love of sneakers, no, I'd never be embarrassed of that robot

4164
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:49,060
Something very human core is just being like

4165
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:56,020
Doing nothing in particular than all of a sudden being paralyzed as you remember something cringy you did like 15 years ago

4166
01:34:56,340 --> 01:35:01,300
That is pretty. He makes you discuss it. That's human cores. That's true. I'll agree with that

4167
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:05,780
Yeah, I but I guess we'll have to wait for his answer and I hope he has something impressive

4168
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,940
I'm sure none of us have said what he was

4169
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:13,460
What was interesting about what he said he said that he said that it's it's super human core and that every human does it

4170
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:17,540
What's up? No, no, no, no, no, he didn't say every yeah, he said only humans do it

4171
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:18,740
No, I don't like though

4172
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:23,780
You know, I don't like he's gonna have a chance to listen to our answers and say like he's gonna be able to change

4173
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,940
His secret he didn't like write it down

4174
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:30,020
You're right email it to so we would know what it is. I had a time here's my answer

4175
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:34,980
It's it's episode episode 11 of season six of my little pony

4176
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:38,660
That's human core. That's the most human core thing. Which one is that?

4177
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,700
I can't remember and I don't know

4178
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,980
Okay, yeah

4179
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:50,580
Hey speaking of my little pony as you all know, we all went to bernie con except for you tom

Thank you everyone for making this play con

01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,460
Awesome

4195
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:43,780
Thanks a lot. Sorry. This is a week late. Thank you riddle my ass batman. It was

4196
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:47,540
That was that was in fact riddle my ass batman. Yep. Did we mention we met him?

4197
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:52,740
Yes, we did. We did. He did me riddle my ass batman. He gave me a he gave me a little phantom horn

4198
01:36:53,460 --> 01:37:00,020
Drawing he did which is cool. He wanted fan art from from he wanted me to draw my favorite moment for a riddle my ass batman

4199
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:07,380
So it was me I drew for him in his sketchbook an image of digi plunging into the dicking piranhas and being really happy about it

4200
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:09,460
So

4201
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,260
Have you ever you guys ever heard uh

4202
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:17,780
The classic Leonard Nimoy bilbo baggins song where he's like he wrote on a barrel

4203
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:20,340
Uh, he he battled the trolls

4204
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:24,420
He riddled with riddle my ass batman a magic ring. He stole

4205
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:29,220
Yeah, yeah, that's that's that's what my adventure was at at brony con

4206
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:33,060
I did all those things and riddled with riddle my ass batman

4207
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:36,340
If we if we haven't wait, I have I had I remembered one other thing

4208
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:39,460
I wanted to bring up and I should have done it before the voicemail. Okay. All right. No problem

4209
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:42,900
um, did anyone anyone anyone tune into the uh,

4210
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:48,020
Portland protests. I know unaware unaware. I have no idea what that is

4211
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:53,860
You know, it was like anti-fabris of the proud boys or some shit. Yeah, the proud boys is that a real thing?

4212
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,460
Yeah, believe it or not the proud boys are some fucking like

4213
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,020
Identitarian

4214
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:06,180
I think they would push back against that. Yeah, they would push back against that like any fascist would

4215
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:11,300
Um, they uh, they're well, I mean, okay. They're not all right. They're not all like that

4216
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:16,740
But like they definitely have like like a strong vein of that running through their their bones and their blood

4217
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:21,540
Okay, got it. I don't know the point. Okay. I watched some streams of it yesterday just to see what was going on

4218
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,300
It wasn't that interesting

4219
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:30,020
But then afterwards I see fucking idiots on twitter like charlie kirk and andy know and these fucking morons tweeting about like

4220
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,500
specifically they're like as a video

4221
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:38,580
Of like a bunch of antifa guys like banging on like a bus that like the proud boy people are like get like these people are

4222
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:41,140
Leaving in a bus and they tweet it with a visual like

4223
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:46,020
Antifa thugs antifa thugs like smashing like like attacking

4224
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,740
These these guys with a hammer and there's a video and like yeah one of these antifa guys like has a hammer

4225
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:55,940
And he like breaks one of the wind or he's like swinging it the thing is okay in the video in the exact video

4226
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,140
You can see that one of the people on the bus

4227
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:03,140
Brings the hammer out and starts swinging it at the antifa people

4228
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:07,140
Out the bus and one of the antifa people grabs it and pulls it away from him

4229
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:13,860
And it makes me so fucking mad. There's that's the context that seems they're just fucking lying through their teeth

4230
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:18,340
And this is what they do people like like andy know just go out there and just like fine

4231
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:21,780
Just like oh, I gotta I gotta find I gotta find anything that I can frame

4232
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:23,460
Right. I got any fight that breaks out

4233
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:27,700
I got to only film the part where like antifa is fighting and not film whatever happened before it

4234
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:31,940
Put that out there so everyone can see that. Yeah, maybe maybe I'll get maybe I'll get punched

4235
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:35,460
Maybe I'll get punched again and make another two hundred thousand dollars. Mm. Fuck. Yeah

4236
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:37,540
I see your point, but uh

4237
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:42,740
Defending antifa is not a good look and I just associate with this completely

4238
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:49,620
All right, cool. Go how go have fun with being antifascist or being a narco fascist or whatever

4239
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,820
I'm over here with antifa and tifa's cool. They've been smeared by the media

4240
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:58,500
Trump's uh, Trump's an asshole. Trump's an asshole calls them a terrorist racist one the cool one

4241
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:05,380
I'm sorry. Who's a terrorist? Who's a trump trump? Yeah, Trump said Trump said antifa is terrorism. Oh, I mean

4242
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:08,660
Aren't they

4243
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,180
No, no

4244
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:15,140
No, I mean, I've seen plenty of videos of them like mobbing on old men and beating the shit out of people

4245
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:18,020
I think that's yeah, okay. They've never killed anyone

4246
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,420
They've never killed anyone

4247
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:30,900
Yeah, but if you're if you're in a gang and you're assaulting people and beating the shit out of them

4248
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,300
Just because you didn't kill them that doesn't mean you're not

4249
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:37,940
Hang on there. The far right fucking shoots up mosques and drives cars into crowds of people

4250
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:43,140
What in news? Are you blaming us for news? Like, sorry, I don't know why I said us. I am not on the far right, but like

4251
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:48,020
In new zeal. That was a new zeal. Yeah, but ben ben. Yeah, that's that's far right extremism

4252
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:52,100
Antifa is far left and they don't kill shortly. They can both be considered terrorism

4253
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:55,300
Yeah, but there's no equivalency

4254
01:40:55,300 --> 01:41:00,100
Does there know about that guy? No, it's not no counter protesting is not terrorism. What about that far left?

4255
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:03,300
Elizabeth Warren guy who just shot up in Dayton, Ohio near where I live

4256
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,660
Was he far left? Yes. I don't know about that

4257
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:12,020
I wonder I mean, I okay. Look ben. I'm with you. I agreed. There's absolutely lots of people

4258
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:16,900
I'm not even trying to do a both sides or bad thing. I simply think that that every side

4259
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:23,700
Tries to find the most damaging thing about the other because they you know, they've got a team and you know, it seems normal

4260
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:27,620
Yeah, okay. Well, sure. Yeah. Well, the point is that like this video

4261
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:32,580
This thing with a hammer really demonstrates that they will they will smear them. They will like just they'll just lie

4262
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:39,140
Like they've just do you really think that's not a lie never lied or never never like put themselves in a

4263
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:41,940
Better situation than what they actually are. This is just

4264
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:49,540
Political I guess. I mean like yeah, everyone's lying about everyone else. Everyone's trying to play gotcha and just making shit up

4265
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:52,820
That's the way the world is now. I mean just like with confirmation bias

4266
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:58,100
It's the same thing of you only analyze the sit any given situation to get enough detail

4267
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:03,700
To paint your political or idealized opponent as the bad guy and then you stop analyzing the situation

4268
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:06,820
and like we all do that it reminds me is it's like um

4269
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:13,220
When the thing first came out about the uh, the trump hat kids who were supposedly like harassing the indian

4270
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:17,700
And uh, yeah, everyone was against them and then after a while everyone is like, oh no

4271
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:20,420
Here's it from another angle and they were actually harassing the indian

4272
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:25,940
So then everyone, you know, kind of switch sides. You mean the the indian guy was harassing them. Yeah, that's what I meant

4273
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:30,420
They were the indian guy was harassing them and so that but but then even after that

4274
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:34,100
I would see other videos being posted of the kids early in the day

4275
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:41,700
Actually like calling out to people and kind of harassing them. So everyone's bad. Everyone's lying. It's all a big fucking shit show

4276
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,700
Everyone should die

4277
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:49,540
Basically, that's why we need fucking either anarchy or fascism either put them all in jail or destroy all laws so that I can kill them

4278
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,460
One of the reasons

4279
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:57,620
Yeah, one of the reasons that I personally hate uh, like identifying with any particular group is because I do think like

4280
01:42:57,860 --> 01:43:04,980
Everyone is fucked up in their own way including me. I'm no fucking saint and like I'm just aware that when I attach my name to any group

4281
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:10,660
I will be associated with the the negative things about any particular group if I said it was far left

4282
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:13,700
They'll say that I'm a communist and I want to kill like two million

4283
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:19,060
20 million people in russia or whatever if I say I'm far right, they'll say I'm a nazi and I want to kill jews or whatever

4284
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:24,020
Problem, right? Here's here's my problem, right? Antifa is not a centralized organization

4285
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:28,340
They are like a loose coalition of people that show up to counter

4286
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,180
Let me let me what do you mean? What is it? What do you mean?

4287
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:36,100
How can you label something like that terrorism that if you label antifa terrorism?

4288
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:41,220
That means like literally any counter protest movement to any far right event is automatically terrorism

4289
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:44,900
If you'd have to examine you don't have to be organized to be a terrorist

4290
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:51,940
Like one dude can just like say wake up like I'm gonna fucking bomb something and it's an act of counter protest is not terrorism though

4291
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:58,580
It's just a counter protest by default isn't but terrorists you can do terrorist acts during a counter protest

4292
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:06,340
It's just so tiring how like everything then at the end of the day antifa bad proud boys bad all of this bad

4293
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:14,340
Oh my god. No, you are totally wrong. Okay. Yeah, there's been violence, right? Fights have broken out people have been punched fine

4294
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:21,780
Yeah, it's not that's not great. That doesn't mean antifa is bad. What they're doing is good because fascism is bad. Okay

4295
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:30,340
Okay, what you're saying you're literally calling for like, oh, don't pro don't protest fascism. No, like don't

4296
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:33,220
Yes, you are. No, that's what it is. No, that's all

4297
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:39,300
That is such a charitable interpretation of what the group is

4298
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:44,180
Well, what do you think it is? I think that's a bunch of people who disagree with the

4299
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:51,620
Right inclinations in the political discourse and go out of their way to make that known and get violent and aggressive

4300
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:54,580
It's just it's it's that's that's only the worst

4301
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:58,980
It's angry people who are lost and confused and sad about their lives and want to fuck shit up

4302
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:03,380
That's all any of the groups are. They're all the fucking literally just people are angry

4303
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:06,020
It's literally just anyone who hates fascism

4304
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:12,420
It's anyone who hates anything anyone who has hate in their heart joins some fucking goofy group and starts fucking shit up

4305
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:18,580
Ben Ben surely you would agree that the definition you're using is the most charitable version of the group

4306
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:20,820
Isn't that fair to say?

4307
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:26,020
Um, I mean, that's what it is though. I mean because you're aware that some people who identify as like the fact like the

4308
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:31,380
Okay, like the like the fact like the fact that some people have died here the fact that some mostly because

4309
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:39,700
Mostly because saying Proud Boys bad Antifa bad is like Ben said a false equivalence Proud Boys are worse

4310
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:42,020
But but why but Antifa is not good

4311
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:46,980
But I don't care who's because their ideology is fuck is a nightmare. They're not but they're okay

4312
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:49,940
Yeah, I don't like when people get killed anyone else

4313
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:55,940
The fact that some people have been punched by Antifa does not mean that Antifa is about punching well Ben

4314
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:01,460
I'm definitely with you in the sense that I don't trust any group of people that are named like a fucking mad max gang

4315
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:05,460
From like the fucking first movie like right before the apocalypse

4316
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:12,180
But it's just so I guess my point is that it's so tiring when everything that you see in here

4317
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,860
A week later you see in here that it was actually the opposite and you were lying to and then a week after that you see in here

4318
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:20,820
But no that was the lie and this is the true story. It's just

4319
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:24,100
Nothing is real. Nothing is true anymore

4320
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:26,340
We've killed truth completely

4321
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:32,660
Everything is a fucking slant and a fucking lie and a meme and a joke. So fucking everything is just fucking

4322
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:38,100
Everybody has an agenda or another so there's no way like there's no way to fucking parse through it anymore

4323
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:44,740
There's no strainer to find the truth. It's just impossible. So here's here's here's my here's what I think

4324
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:49,140
Here's what I think. Okay. You got you got two groups, right? You got one that's out there

4325
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:51,780
Promoting an ideology that is about like

4326
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:58,580
Identitarianism, right? Like even if they're not overtly, there's they're supporting there's they support fucking racist policies

4327
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:05,220
Aren't you just they want they want the political overture window to slide even further right towards fascism, right?

4328
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:08,820
Even if they're not overtly fascist themselves, even if they say they're against fascism

4329
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:14,340
Uh, they're doing that and then on the other side you got people that oppose them and don't want that to happen

4330
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:18,100
And even if shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up

4331
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:23,220
And even if both sides were equally violent which they are not but even if they were

4332
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:27,940
I would still say that the that the antifa is better because what they stand for is better

4333
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:33,620
Okay, I have nothing further to comment on who gives a fuck. It don't matter. None of this matters

4334
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:40,820
Boy, oh fucking boy next voicemail, please. Oh my god save me from this nightmare

4335
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:47,540
That that that was the last real voicemail this last one's just uh, it was just gonna be uh, it's by teen cp

4336
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:53,220
Who made a other voicemail last uh last week and then we put him in the voice gel not knowing he's a teen cp

4337
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:59,780
And then he and then he made a funny little skit like oh, I'm gonna break out a voice gel next time on teen cp

4338
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:04,660
I'm gonna fucking kill munchie or something. I feel like the mood. I feel like the mood for that is not in the air

4339
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:07,220
Aren't you on the teen cp? Yes, I am

4340
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:12,340
My munchie play what are you gonna not play it because we had a political discussion fucking play that shitty piece of shit

4341
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,420
I'm playing it right now. Good

4342
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:19,780

Teen cp

4345
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:29,460
I've been man raped. Well, I'm not really raped. I was talking but other than that. It's been miserable in here

4346
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:33,140
I need out. Luckily, I have an in with one munchie tiny hats

4347
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,140

I bring the topic of in-depth security details of prisons we control once I have the info I strike

4349
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:43,060
I tried to reach out to the japanese man

4350
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:47,780
You just to find a bushido blade sharp enough to slice my way out, but he just grunted and shin chin

4351
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:52,820
I'm expecting a package from the lost tape archive once he gets out of solitary teen cp

4352
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:55,700
signing off

4353
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:58,660
Godspeed godspeed teen cp

4354
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:01,540
Is

4355
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:05,780
Is it proven that that is in fact a teen because it sounds like a seven-year-old?

4356
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:09,940
He's like 12. No. Yeah. He's really young. He's really really young

4357
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:15,060
Oh boy. Are we going to jail guys? Are we going to jail cancel them?

4358
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,660
I'm glad I'm glad we put a child in jail

4359
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:22,580
Next time by the time you hear this you will already watch the third episode of the teen cp

Except I'm not on that one and what he just refers like it was recorded like just like a bit ago

4361
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:33,860
And I just I'm gonna post it but next time after that time then you'll be able to hear the conclusion

4362
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:40,500
Tell that young lad if he wants to be taken seriously. He needs to pick a side right now antifa or proud boy

4363
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:45,140
Yeah, that's what all the adults are doing teen cp. They'll reply
