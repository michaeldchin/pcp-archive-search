00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you're listening to this, it is Friday. It's 6.20pm.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They already know that.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's useless information.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh my god. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I have nothing to talk about. Let's go to voicemails.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No. Let's talk about Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Fine. Very well. How's that going?

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's going quite well.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The numbers go up. I see number go up.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The number go up is we are at 79 backers as of recording. 2,571 pounds pledged. We're less than 500 away from the Redman...

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Zeen.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I got it. I got it. I was thinking about it.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I know. I could tell you were thinking. And I wanted to make sure you came to the right conclusion.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You could have made fun of me if I got it wrong. You can't give it to me that easy.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I jumped the gun. I jumped the gun.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's getting pretty close to the Redman Zeen. It's more than halfway towards the plush.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The plush.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes. I got the sample of the plush. I didn't get a sample. I got an image sent to me of the progress on the sample.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They've made a little first draft. They said, hey, do you want any changes?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I said a few things about it. But mostly, it's great. And it looks exactly like I wanted it.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It looks nice. How big is it?

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a smaller plush than the Pumpk one. Although Pumpk is artificially big because her legs are really long and thin.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's about six inches tall and quite round. You could put it on your desk. You could put it on a dog.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A dog could play with it. You could throw it. It's the sort of thing you could grab with one hand and you could have it.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's the sort of feeling I wanted. You could just grab its face and just look at me.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's cool. We got 23 days to go.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's pretty good. It's pretty soft. Do you have the graph? Does it show you the graph of the money?

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How do I find that? I'm on the side right now.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's somewhere in the dashboard. Let me see. I can look at my old account.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, now I found it.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Show me the graph. I like the graph.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here it is. Put it in general chat.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There we go. That's a pretty sharp beginning.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, it is. Then it kind of accelerated a little bit the two days ago.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Maybe that was the bump from the episode coming out?

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, the episode coming out or one of the streams I did.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to be streaming more often for the opportunity to plug that while I'm playing.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If people somehow haven't, they're not on the Twitter and they're on my Twitch.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They're like, oh, I didn't know you were doing that. It'll be a good moment.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You were playing, what was it, House Flipper?

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was playing House Flipper the other day. I played Hollow Knight I think yesterday.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Right. I didn't catch that one.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That one was fun. I started off having no knowledge of Fortnite of Hollow Knight.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hollow Knight is basically the same.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Have you not played Hollow Knight before?

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've never beaten it. I got four hours in once and then I stopped and that's it.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I played it through the first time with all the DLC.

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a little awkward how all the DLC stuff kind of just exists on top of everything else.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I have no idea what it looks like without DLC if I even have it.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You might not be seeing it yet, but there's quests that are like, you got to go around and do stuff

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and you got to collect shit and it's like shit that you...

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When it released, I think the point was to kind of make you to go and re-explore the world with a new goal in mind.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But having it be present alongside everything else when you're playing the game

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
for the first time is a little bit like, wait, I got to do...

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What are these things around? I got to get these too? Okay, I guess.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know whether this is a DLC thing, but I saw these weird little trees, little bushes

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and I couldn't do anything with them. I thought maybe they were special.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are they the little dream catcher looking trees?

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Are they curved, like bonsai trees with outlighted circles on them?

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know what they are, like little wheels.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think I know... I don't think that's DLC stuff, although I don't even know what is DLC.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I know that the Grim Troop is... I'm calling it DLC.

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think the better word is Expansion Pack or whatever, because it was added to the game later.

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think that's like Dream Nail stuff, that tree, maybe. Do you have the Dream Nail?

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm very early on. I've beaten the Screamy... the guy on the...

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh God, I can't remember any of the places.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Where there's this rain and there's a city and you go up the tower

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and there's that magic guy who has the magic and he throws at you.

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, I hate that guy, yeah.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You kill that guy and then you get the thing that makes you go smash down through glass panes.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, what's the place called? The City of Tears? I love that place.

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
City of Tears, yeah. It's my favorite location.

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And then I got that and then I went down over to the crystal mines and that's where I stopped.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, good. Did you meet that bug that sings?

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's a bug in the crystal mines that sings.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, I haven't gone very far into the crystal mines. I was looking for the map and then I realized I had been going for like four and a half hours.

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Keep an eye out for it, I guess.

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I found the cute fat lady bug who's really shy and she makes a plush of you and writes fanfic about you when you save her.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why don't I remember that?

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You save her and she goes back and then she's on the bench and if you sit on the bench and wait for a few seconds she blushes.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What? Why don't I remember this? Oh no.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And then she's in one of the buildings off to the side and then sometimes it's like a...

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think the first time you go in there there's like a health item shard, mask shard and that was cool.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But next to her bed there's like a little fanfic she writes about the exploits of you, the white savior she calls you.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Base.

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And because you're a little skull face.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And yeah, it starts off with just like a plush and then there's a poster and then there's like a bigger plush and then the fanfic continues.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She has dreams about you. It's kind of epic.

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You know, I have... I think I know what you're talking about now, but I don't want to say anything.

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think I would spoil it. I think there might be some stuff going on out there that maybe you haven't seen yet.

91
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh no.

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll tell you, the one thing I am spoiled for is the grubs. If you save all the grubs, the main grub man is like, haha, thank you.

93
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then he eats them.

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, I think that's true. I think that's true.

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's like, oh, it's scary. It's like fucked up. You just got played.

96
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But it's like, I think it's like implied somewhere in the in-game like enemy description that like that's like normal and that's like part of the grub life cycle.

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like they're not dead, maybe. They're just inside of him.

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I think maybe it's not that fucked up.

99
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's just vor propaganda.

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, I don't know. I think it's a little ambiguous. It's like, oh, it's, you thought you were doing a good thing, but I don't know. It was a bad thing.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, but maybe it's not a bad thing, though.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Maybe it's okay.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Good game. A little bit the samey locations wise. A lot of the places look the same in Hollow Knight.

105
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
In Hollow Knight? Yeah, a couple places.

106
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I mean, I've got to a point where I can, I'm starting to like differentiate the different places.

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And like, I like it. I think the color palette is restrictive, but it works.

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I think I, I think I, oh, I beat the Radiance and I beat Grim. I never did the like Godseeker stuff.

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That stuff is like another like expansion pack thing. I never did anything.

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's like the, the true like ultimate bosses are in the Godseeker, but I didn't do them because it just didn't seem that interesting.

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I like the Castlevania, if that was like a, like a boss rush kind of thing, I don't care about that that much.

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I like the side scrollly exploration Castlevania bullshit.

113
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, I'm not like, I'm not, I'm not that hardcore of a gamer.

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Radiance was really hard, the final boss. I got stuck on her for, I think I got stuck on her for a while and I stopped playing for a while and I was, and it took me a long time to finally come back to it and beat her.

115
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
God, she's cool though. So fucking cool. She is the sun.

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What a, what a visual. I don't know any of that. Oh, well, it's not, it's not literally true, but I don't know, you'll, you'll see, we'll see what I mean.

117
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's, there's bugs and some of them are knights and some of them are hollow. I mean, what more do I need?

118
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,000
She's, she's not, when I say that she, she is not like the actual sun up in the sky above hollownests. That's not, that's not the case.

119
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, I won't say anymore, but it's a good fucking video game.

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I might play more of that on stream on twitch.tv slash gibbon take.

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I am very bad with scheduling, so I, I have no plans to do it in any particular day, but I won't be doing it on Sundays because that's PCP recording.

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I won't be doing it on Fridays because the PCP comes out or maybe I could, I don't know, there's no reason I couldn't.

123
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But also on Wednesdays, we usually do heckles for shackles.

124
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, true, true.

125
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So some other time, maybe a Monday or a Tuesday.

126
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You know what I did? You know, I started doing it yesterday. I actually started writing up the, the final Road to Radcon chapter.

127
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I got like one page of it written. I wanted to be, I don't know how long I want it to be.

128
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's probably stupid, but I mean, you know, that's fine.

129
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you going to attempt to mimic the writing style or is it just going to be the Benson chapter?

130
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I, I, I would like to try to do that. I don't know how successful I would be.

131
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I feel like I'm doing my best to mimic the writing style, but I, I don't, I think it's not, I think you can tell I wrote it, which is like, I don't know what to do about that.

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, you could do your best. I mean, I'm sure I'm doing my best. I'm doing my best.

133
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's, it's going to be dumb. It's going to be goofy. And it should be a hoot.

134
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, I tried, I tried getting drunk and writing it because I thought that that would be the right mindset to do it in, but it didn't work.

135
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It didn't work that well. I just kind of didn't do it and I'm hungover this morning and I feel sick.

136
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So, you know, didn't, didn't, huh?

137
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What time is over there?

138
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, I guess it's, I guess it's not morning. It's 3 30pm. Well, but I only woke up at like noon, so it feels early.

139
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I woke up at noon as well. So it's noon, it's noon days, these days.

140
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I hung, I hung out with, I hung out with Munchie and Kazi and Ethan and Steve and, and Azkan and Zen Huxedable yesterday and I slept over on their couch.

141
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Cool.

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, it was pretty fun. We went and got ramen. It was good. You got ice cream. It was really good. It was really good.

143
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I ate a bunch of food.

144
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So I saw an image. I played smash of VR somewhere.

145
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, did he? Yeah, it's at the right. I forgot. We went to like a video. It's like a video game cafe.

146
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It was goofy, but they had, they had an Oculus Rift that we took turns using a little bit.

147
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I didn't, I didn't do it. I surrendered my time because I own an Oculus Rift.

148
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The privilege.

149
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes. They played a bunch of like Beat Saber and shit. Kazi literally just like did Google Earth and like looked around Google Earth in the VR headset.

150
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You know, I would have never thought to do that, but that is possible with 360 everything.

151
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, she was just like flying around. Was it Beijing, I think? Just looking at buildings.

152
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Beijing.

153
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Maybe it was Beijing.

154
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe Hong Kong. I don't think, does China not have Google stuff in it? I thought that was.

155
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It wasn't Hong Kong. You can, surely you can see Beijing on Google Earth.

156
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Check. Well, I don't know. I don't feel like you can't see Street View and stuff. Like they don't have Street View for that country.

157
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Weird. Maybe that's true. I didn't even think, I didn't even consider that.

158
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Like the China says, you can't have people drive cars and take pictures of all of our secrets.

159
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, maybe, maybe so.

160
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Maybe Google Earth is different from Google Maps. Maybe that's what I'm thinking.

161
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I think it's the same. Like I think Street View is the same images for both.

162
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?

163
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It must be.

164
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Where's Beijing?

165
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't know.

166
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Where's Beijing?

167
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I remember seeing the 2008 fucking Olympics. I remember it must have seen it on the map somewhere.

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's like, it's like a special place.

169
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's not inland, is it?

170
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Most big things are by a river.

171
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Most big things are on the coast or on the river, yeah.

172
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's the lifeblood. It's the lifeblood of society. It's water.

173
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Water, water.

174
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What has thou dunced?

175
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Dunced? Oh, it is kind of inland. It's quite north.

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, I'm zooming. Okay, so Google does have...

177
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
How do I be down on the earth?

178
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is a riveting podcast content.

179
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You can play along, guys. Play along.

180
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Beijing is.

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Beijing.

182
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Go to Google that map.

183
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Zoom in. Like flick your mouse to the left once, twice.

184
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Get a plane ticket to Beijing and take a picture and send it to Google for Street View so we can see you.

185
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, alright. You can go down onto individuals' photographs.

186
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So this person took a 360 photograph in Beijing and I can go and see this photograph from their perspective.

187
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Like a Google employee or something?

188
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
No, no, just like a person. They uploaded their location to Google.

189
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh.

190
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And now the 360 image is...

191
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Weird.

192
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Seable.

193
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So wait.

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's insane. It's madness.

195
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So there's this big, epic, like Earth Kingdom temple house.

196
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm going to put my old guy...

197
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
China totally ripped off the...

198
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Right in the middle.

199
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Ripped off Avatar, in my opinion.

200
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

201
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I mean, what the fuck? Okay.

202
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Just like Mulan. I'm there.

203
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Just like...

204
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's just like that movie.

205
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Just like Disney.

206
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's just like media.

207
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's like, aw, Pog.

208
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
When I see...

209
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I meet a Chinese person and I go, it's just like Mulan.

210
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I've seen this movie.

211
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh dear. This is cool though.

212
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I didn't know you could see any of China.

213
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I thought it was like Google no-no zone.

214
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Google no-no zone.

215
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah.

216
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Based.

217
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Anyway, there was...

218
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yes, there was VR.

219
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There was video games.

220
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And we ate food and I don't know.

221
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And then I got drunk and I passed out and now I'm hungover.

222
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And that was my...

223
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, and I practiced inkling.

224
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I won't say I got a little good at playing inkling in Smash,

225
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
but I sort of figured the character out a little bit.

226
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And that was kind of fun.

227
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You know, when you squirt the ink, it's good.

228
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You should be squirting ink.

229
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You should be shooting ink when you're inkling.

230
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's the trick.

231
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You should be squirting.

232
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
My problem in Smash is that I don't guard and I don't roll.

233
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, why would you do that when you could attack and squirt ink?

234
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's right.

235
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Anytime you're not squirting ink as inkling is just waste of time.

236
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're just losing...

237
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're surrendering board state.

238
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You've got to be putting ink on the ground all the time.

239
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I...

240
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There were so many times I would be like,

241
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
yes, I've set up for the kill.

242
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes, I've got them.

243
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I've got them in my sights.

244
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And then I pull out the roller and I do the forward...

245
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think it's the forward B rolling attack.

246
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And then there's no ink and it just doesn't work.

247
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And then they go, aha!

248
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And they punish me because I wasn't looking at the bar.

249
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I wasn't looking at the ink meter.

250
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a nightmare.

251
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's a fucking nightmare.

252
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And you can't refill the ink meter unless it's already empty, I think,

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
unless you can and I just never figured out how to do it.

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That would be embarrassing.

255
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Did you play as Minecraft Steve?

256
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
No!

257
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No!

258
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's so crazy.

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But Zen was playing as Creeper.

260
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But Creeper is not a Minecraft Steve re-skin.

261
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He's a me-fighter for some reason.

262
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He's just a me-fighter brawler, I guess.

263
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know why they did that.

264
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I feel like he should be Steve, but he's not.

265
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He should have a little pickaxe.

266
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He should go ding, ding, ding, ding, ding up stuff.

267
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know what I thought?

268
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I was thinking about like Mario Sunshine and how the flood,

269
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you get the water and you splash and you get rid of all the goop.

270
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
True.

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You get exactly the same sort of goop as like the Splatoon kids.

272
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Splatoon?

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Like what if Mario from Mario Sunshine with the flood versus the Splatoon?

274
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like the Splatoon splats.

275
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's like, dude, asymmetrical multiplayer where one player,

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
One giant Mario.

277
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's a team of Splatoons.

278
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh my god, that would be so funny.

279
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What if in like Splatoon 3 they have it as a multiplayer mode

280
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
where like four players play as inklings

281
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and one player plays as Mario from Mario Sunshine with the flood?

282
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It just seems like such an obvious versus.

283
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But because Mario Sunshine is so old, it'll never happen officially.

284
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'll never acknowledge the idea.

285
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Now that you say it, it makes perfect sense.

286
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It makes perfect sense and I want it.

287
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
These squids are just trying to make a mess and Mario is like,

288
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No, do not make a mess.

289
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So you splash.

290
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, true, true.

291
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Man, Splatoon is so fucking cool.

292
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Aesthetically, I mean.

293
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm pretty bad at it.

294
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm pretty bad at most competitive games and shooters in particular.

295
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
There's too much splash and going on.

296
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There's just too much dang ink.

297
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's a bad influence.

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, I can't believe they would depict someone squirting ink in a piece of media.

299
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Do they have a fountain pen weapon yet?

300
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Do they have like a fountain pen sniper rifle?

301
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I feel like they do, but I don't know.

302
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Maybe not.

303
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It seems like something they would have.

304
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No, they got rollers, they got brushes, they got buckets, and they got guns.

305
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You know what else? Okami.

306
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Okami, a mattress who dip the god dog brush tail and draw stuff with it, with the ink.

307
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think I saw, I watched Tim Rogers' review of Okami and he didn't like it that much.

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What did he say?

309
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He said that obviously it looks great and the art style is great,

310
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
but the game is basically just a Zelda and as a Zelda it's not that impressive.

311
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's like a pretty mediocre Zelda, which I guess that makes sense.

312
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I think I've heard that comparison before, but I don't like Zelda because I don't like the way it looks so there.

313
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah, true.

314
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Actually Wind Waker is really nice.

315
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Twilight Princess is ugly and that's it.

316
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The only 3D Zelda I've ever played is Ocarina, which I went back and replayed it just a couple years ago just to know what the deal was.

317
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Is Ocarina one of those games where it's completely impossible to figure out unless you have the strategy guide like the first Zelda?

318
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I mean that's not impossible, but there's a lot of esoteric things in the first Zelda game.

319
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's not like that, it's not like that.

320
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No, I think you could beat Ocarina without a strategy.

321
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No, there's that one thing where you have to give the fish to the thing to make it open its mouth.

322
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I think that part is a little bit like how would you know to do that?

323
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's a jub-jub? Is that how you get into jub-jub's belly?

324
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Jabba's belly? Who's fucking belly do you go in with the Zora Princess?

325
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Wait, have I played this game? Have I played Ocarina? I don't even know. I feel like I've watched so much of it.

326
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And I remember playing it briefly, but I don't know how long I played it.

327
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It definitely didn't win. Definitely did not beat the game, but...

328
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I beat Ocarina, and then I thought like, boy, everyone says Majora's Mask is the good one.

329
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Maybe I should have played Majora's Mask instead, but now I don't want to because even though I know that they're completely different games,

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
they look similar, so I feel like I kind of got a lot of the experience from playing the first one,

331
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
which is probably wrong, and it's probably a stupid way to look at it, but instinctively that's how I feel.

332
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I already played the game with all the same assets, even if it's a different game, so I'm done.

333
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I guess I'm not that much of a Zelda head. I played a bunch of the 2D ones.

334
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I mean, I actually beat Zelda 2 Link's Awakening.

335
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Wow.

336
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It was the one nobody plays, the one nobody likes.

337
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I've heard people like it. It's just really difficult.

338
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It is really difficult. I beat it, and I beat the original Zelda 1, maybe like 7 or 8 years ago.

339
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I used guides for both. I just had a lot of free time, and I had NES, and I was like,

340
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I had these games as kids, and I never beat them because I was a dumb kid, so I'm going to do it, and I did.

341
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
My feeling with Mario and Zelda and stuff is that I didn't even know what that shit was.

342
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Mario?

343
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, I think I knew Mario because I'd seen him in gaming magazines, but I'd never had a Nintendo 64.

344
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:56,000
To me, Nintendo was entirely Pokémon, and then I didn't know any of that stuff until the angry video game nerd taught me all about the NES.

345
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I was like, whoa, what? That's what the NES was.

346
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
When in Pokémon Blue, they said the player played with the NES.

347
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I thought that was someone's NES bit, like someone's name.

348
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I didn't get it, and then I got it. That was my introduction.

349
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So I don't have desire to go back, necessarily, and play all these old games from my childhood.

350
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
They're games from AVGN's childhood, which is somewhat my childhood, a little bit.

351
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
My young teenagerhood or something.

352
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Fuck that guy. Fuck reviews. Fuck internet. Fuck videos. No.

353
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I will never listen to another video game review ever again because they're all liars.

354
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What about all of those ones you're about to watch?

355
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Well, I'll do those, obviously. Obviously, I'm still going to watch those.

356
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But after that, I'm done. It's over.

357
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I genuinely listen to... I genuinely spend a lot more time listening to people talk about media than I do just consuming media.

358
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I don't know if that's a problem. I don't know if that's weird, but...

359
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I think it's just because it's easy.

360
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,000
A piece of review, you go into it expecting them to explain everything, and they're just going to tell you all about it.

361
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You don't need to lift a finger. You don't even need to press start.

362
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You don't need to do any work to figure out what the fuck's up with this game.

363
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I have no interest in watching a movie and any movies at all.

364
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But I am interested if someone is like, this movie says something about our society.

365
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I am interested to be like, oh, what do you think it says about our society?

366
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, that's where I'm at with media, I guess.

367
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Did you watch Parasite?

368
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
No, I didn't see Parasite.

369
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You probably heard movie reviews, though, about it.

370
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't know if I heard any reviews. I mean, I definitely heard people talk about it.

371
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't know if I watched any reviews.

372
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's a really good one, but everyone would say that.

373
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It seemed good. It seemed like a good film.

374
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's one of the only movies of the last 25 years that I've watched.

375
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't watch movies, really.

376
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But I was forced to watch that one.

377
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Because somebody said please, and I was like, okay.

378
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I watched, I think like the last movie, oh no, I watched The Witch, The Vavitch a couple months ago.

379
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And I was pretty good.

380
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I watched, the only time I watched movies are when I met my parents' house.

381
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, I watched The Witch.

382
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And before that, like Christmas, I watched Flushed Away, The Artman.

383
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That movie's good. That movie's actually good.

384
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's all right.

385
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I thought it was better than all right.

386
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I was like, wow, that sure was a compelling, pretty conventional three act structure that I just experienced.

387
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
God, I love that glistening three act structure.

388
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It worked for me.

389
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What was it?

390
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I was going to say, oh, and I watched that one.

391
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What's the one with Snake Plissken?

392
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That one.

393
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Escape from New York.

394
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I watched Escape from New York also at Christmas with my parents for some reason.

395
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That's the only time.

396
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Flushed Away and Escape from New York basically the same.

397
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It's, you know, there's the call to action.

398
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
There's the, you know, the crossing the threshold, the meeting with the goddess, the whatever thing that happens.

399
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The lowest point in the second act, obviously, they're the same.

400
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
There's only seven stories that have ever been told, and those are two of them.

401
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Flushed Away and Escape from New York.

402
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Leaving only five possible new stories to be made.

403
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's right.

404
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Lord of Ghosts was one of them.

405
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So that one's taken now.

406
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That one's taken too.

407
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yeah.

408
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's over.

409
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
God, I still, I still gotta write the, I keep meaning to, obviously.

410
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's like the classic dilemma.

411
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh, but I kept meaning to do it, but I just didn't do it.

412
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Well, I guess I'll just continue.

413
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Like who cares?

414
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's like, it'll be done when it's done.

415
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Gotta write the things.

416
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I also want to.

417
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You should, don't be like me.

418
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't be like me and put it off.

419
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I put it off for so long doing my vapor arts.

420
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It was really a mistake and foolish of me.

421
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Some, some days I'll wake up and I'm like, okay, well, I gotta buy ingredients so that

422
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I can cook dinner.

423
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's today's goal.

424
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I go out, I get the ingredients, I come back.

425
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I sit around and I'm like, well, I'll, I'll work on it after I cook dinner because that's

426
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
it'll take a little while.

427
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I cook dinner.

428
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I eat it.

429
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And I'm like, well, I won't do it.

430
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
The day's over.

431
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I did one thing.

432
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That's enough.

433
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm accomplished.

434
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Fair.

435
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I've, I've done in exactly one thing.

436
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And oh, look at the Kickstarter as a whole other person.

437
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You know what?

438
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Everything's going well.

439
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I don't need to work today.

440
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah.

441
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah.

442
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I got, I'm, you got that one, uh, you got that one pledge that's today paid for.

443
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

444
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I know the feeling.

445
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Uh, I, I actually had a run recently of maybe like two weeks or so where I was like feverishly.

446
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I got into like a mood or something.

447
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I got into the headspace where I was feverishly grinding out stuff for the phantom's revenge

448
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
game.

449
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah.

450
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You mentioned I would like, I was basically doing nothing but that for like, and then I,

451
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I looked back at my, um, cause you know, I have the, I have the secret chat where I post

452
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
like updates and stuff that I'm working on for it in my, in my, my server.

453
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
My server is not patrons only, but that channel is for his patron channel.

454
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I look back at like the stuff I'm posting and I realized I spent basically the entire

455
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
month of June just grinding out, uh, basically enemy sprites and like sprites for the like

456
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
attack animations.

457
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Uh, I didn't realize I spent like a whole month doing it, but I sure did and it really took

458
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that long.

459
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It wasn't like I was just fucking around.

460
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So I don't know.

461
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Boy, I sure hope they came out good because I spent a really long time on them.

462
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Uh, but, uh, I guess it was worth it.

463
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I guess I, I think it's looking pretty good.

464
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I had hoped that the game would be done by now, but it's not.

465
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And that's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.

466
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah.

467
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But yeah, I was, I was really grinding.

468
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I was really grinding.

469
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Uh, and then a couple of days ago, I think I was like, I can't, I can't do it anymore.

470
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

471
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And I fell off and I lost my momentum and then I didn't do anything this weekend on it.

472
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So I need to try and get myself back into another one of those sprints because I have a bunch

473
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
more things I need to do.

474
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Um, it's getting, it's pretty close to being done, but like the things that I have left

475
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
to do are things that I don't exactly know how long it will take me.

476
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Uh, then it'll take ages because you'll come in, you'll come up to a point where like,

477
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
yeah, I mean, I've got to do this one thing, but like one thing that you don't know how to do

478
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
contains within it hundreds of hours of learning that you need to do or preparation.

479
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I don't know.

480
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's just one of those sort of things.

481
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
If you are, if you're not sure how long something's going to take, it'll probably take an extremely long time.

482
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The game, the demo that I put out was eight rooms long.

483
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And I needed, I wanted every room to have a cutscene, but not every room would have like a real cutscene.

484
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Some rooms would just have like one line of dialogue and that's, and that's the scene.

485
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Um, so some, some, a couple of the rooms would have fairly extensive, maybe like two of the rooms

486
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
would have an actual like extensive cutscene where like a character walks around, does animations,

487
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
does stuff beyond just like say a line.

488
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And then I, I need to add, I need to add another room.

489
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
There's another room that needs to be added that will also have a pretty extensive cutscene in it, take place in it.

490
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Um, and then I added a couple of features.

491
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I added a couple of new like battle commands to it that they work, but I think they need to be debugged a little bit.

492
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I think they, they act a little weird sometimes in like certain outlier situations.

493
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Like when the, like when you die while you're doing them, then like the animation looks weird.

494
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And I'm like, okay, I have to fix that.

495
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So it doesn't look weird when that happens.

496
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Um, you know, that, that kind of thing debugging basically.

497
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Um, the cutscenes though, the cutscenes there, that's a thing where I could probably work on them for like a whole year.

498
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
If I wanted to make them real fancy, and I need to not do that.

499
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yes.

500
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I need, I need to, because I mean, I think I've gotten a little, a little bit fancy with some of the like attack animations.

501
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And that's maybe why it took so long.

502
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Um, and I, I think it to the point that it actually looks like it's maybe a little fancier than like the Super Nintendo style that it's going for.

503
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I want the game to look like it, it's like a Super Nintendo aesthetic.

504
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Uh, but I think some of the effects are a little bit, the too many pixels.

505
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They have, they have extra pixels.

506
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So they're a little like, finely detailed in a way that is like, hmm, you, maybe you couldn't do that on the Super Nintendo.

507
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Uh, but it's fine.

508
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's okay.

509
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Uh, I just gotta not worry about it.

510
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I just gotta not worry about it and just, and just keep chugging along and just get it done.

511
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Art is never completed, only abandoned.

512
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Hmm.

513
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah.

514
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's good that you're doing stuff.

515
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I've, I've.

516
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It is good that I'm doing stuff.

517
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I feel good about it.

518
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, now I feel bad because I haven't worked on it for a few days.

519
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Uh, but.

520
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I mean, I haven't been working on fucking anything for months.

521
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Well, I mean.

522
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
This Kickstarter is, is, is like the most work I've been doing.

523
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's really just like number munching and organizing and like.

524
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Well, I mean, doing the, I mean, doing the like, um, I mean, there's real work involved in the Kickstarter.

525
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Like you had to do the, like you, you made the design for the plush and stuff.

526
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And you had to write it all up and, and you know, set up the goal.

527
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I mean, yeah, it's not like it wasn't work, but like, I had just been like, I mean, I only thought of that.

528
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I mean, I only thought of that idea.

529
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I only did all that since, um, what was this?

530
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I forget their name.

531
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Hoodie.

532
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Was it Hoodie?

533
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Hoodie, Hoodie in zero.

534
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah.

535
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Like the Cato, the Cato guys.

536
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They suggested the doing of like Laura Ghost Kickstarter.

537
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And so before that point, I had just been feeling sick and not doing any drawing all year.

538
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And it was just like, I had been doing working on my secret project, which I put on hold.

539
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And it's, I just, I just want to get be doing things, you know, I just want to be like,

540
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I want to be chugging along and chugging along and making like Lord of Ghost Act three Clarissa

541
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
like finished and then all of these other things I have.

542
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I just, I just spend most of the day watching like German live stream vods and doing like

543
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
playing video games.

544
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And it's, it's cringe.

545
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I, I hate, I just cringe it.

546
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'm cringing it myself.

547
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I have, I have been, um, I have been binging a lot of, um, a lot of, a lot of long like

548
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
JRPG speedruns from like RPG limit break.

549
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I think they did like a marathon recently and there's a bunch of like, they did a 10

550
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
hour legend of Dragoon run.

551
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I watched all of that.

552
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Uh, they, I think I'm in, I'm in the middle of a, of a Final Fantasy 10, uh, one which

553
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
is also like really, really long.

554
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
This is, I've been putting those on while I do other stuff.

555
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Uh, I, I, uh, I can't believe that it's end of June, which means that I've been working

556
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
on this game for six months.

557
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I started at the end of December.

558
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I, I can't believe it's been six months.

559
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I just don't understand.

560
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I don't know what I was doing.

561
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I mean, I guess I've been working on it, on the game and like, I just, the time went

562
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
by so fast and I like, I thought it was going to take me like maybe two months to do the

563
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
game because the, the champion game, I literally made that in like three weeks.

564
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
This, this game has taken me, I didn't expect it to take me this long.

565
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm, I'm just in shock that the, it has flown by and I don't know where it went.

566
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's weird.

567
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I just don't feel like summer.

568
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Well, it's hot.

569
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Well, I mean, like it doesn't feel like it's where, you know, past spring, like that doesn't

570
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
make sense.

571
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I didn't feel like spring even began.

572
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah.

573
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I feel like it was cold just a little while ago.

574
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah, I do.

575
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't, where did spring go?

576
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh no.

577
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's the vaccine.

578
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's making me lose time.

579
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's making me lose time because this is my control of microchip.

580
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Oh, microchip.

581
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That's what did, oh, that explains it.

582
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What are you doing?

583
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
That explains everything.

584
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
What was I, what was I was doing at night, the, at night, the, the microchip activates

585
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and I lose, and I lose a week at a time because I disappeared to go out into the streets and

586
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and protest like a BLM and Tifa thug and smash windows to get Joe Biden reelected.

587
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They didn't know that last year.

588
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
They just been doing it for no reason.

589
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
They didn't.

590
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
They didn't.

591
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah.

592
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Well, they never turned it off.

593
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
They didn't know.

594
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
They didn't need to give me a microchip.

595
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I was going to do that anyway.

596
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
They didn't need to chip me.

597
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That was the plan all along.

598
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I saw, what did I see?

599
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I saw some, saw some fucking freak on Twitter.

600
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Was it Tim Pool?

601
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I don't know.

602
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm a fucking idiot saying like, that the, you know, and Tifa is like the Joe Biden army

603
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and Tifa just loves Joe Biden.

604
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
They got him elected.

605
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
They rioted to get Joe Biden elected.

606
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm sick.

607
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You're insane.

608
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You're fucking the world is full of sick freaks.

609
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Say things like this.

610
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And I'm upset.

611
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Fortunately, I can't see it because Twitter is bugged.

612
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Twitter is broken.

613
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's not working for me.

614
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's not loading.

615
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That is the best.

616
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You're insane.

617
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's great.

618
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Twitter to be broken.

619
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's super good.

620
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah.

621
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I can't fucking see anything on there.

622
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And my life is richer for it.

623
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Maybe I'll just let it stay bugs.

624
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Maybe I hope those never fix it.

625
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I think I might need to like track and like get, get the, bring out the big guns.

626
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Like the harsh truths, the strict, the harsh mistresses.

627
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
What does that mean?

628
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It means I got to like knuckle down and ban myself from all of this YouTube crap that

629
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I've like, it worked before like the forcing myself to not look at something.

630
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And then I go onto it and I'm like, oh, but I want to click on Twitter.

631
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I want to click on YouTube.

632
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And then like an hour later, I'm like, well, I may as well make progress in my life's work.

633
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And then I do it.

634
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I've got to turn that back on.

635
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I turned it off because I was sick.

636
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's been too long.

637
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I think it's perpetuating my sickness.

638
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I see.

639
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I see the, I mean, the, I am literally going to install a website blocker specifically

640
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
so that I don't go to DoorDash and order food anymore.

641
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I, I develop, I have developed a crippling addiction to ordering a fried chicken and pizza.

642
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And it's really bad.

643
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah.

644
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's bad because I'm fat now, but also because it costs so much.

645
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It costs like 30 fucking dollars to order anything from anywhere.

646
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's always $30, no matter what it is.

647
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's quite a lot.

648
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's quite a lot.

649
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So I need to, yeah, no, I can't let myself do it anymore.

650
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I can't, I can't allow it.

651
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But I mean, my, my, my justification to myself was like, eh, I'll just eat a bunch of junk food

652
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
because I'm, because I'm working out now because I'm lifting now and I'm getting really strong.

653
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So it's, it's good.

654
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Like the classic like, oh, and all the fucking things is like, oh, well, and now that I started

655
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:35,000
my diet and I've started my like exercise, one little many donuts won't hurt.

656
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I mean, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a cope.

657
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's a bit of a cope.

658
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There's a little bit of truth to it because like I have gotten stronger.

659
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I have, I have my lifts are up and I think that they have gone up faster because I've been eating a lot

660
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
because you got to live, you got to eat big to get big.

661
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You got to eat huge to get huge.

662
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You got to fuel, you got to turn your body into a metabolic furnace.

663
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I mean, I think I, so I have gotten a bit stronger, which is good.

664
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm, I'm in a, I want, I really like that my lifts go up.

665
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I like when number go up, but also I'm getting fat and I don't like when that number go up.

666
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But yeah, I heard you'd said that last time only both number go up, both number go up or both number go down.

667
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I have to choose.

668
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I have to choose get like non fried chicken, like just actual chicken.

669
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You fucking nerd.

670
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And like, why would I want to eat that?

671
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I don't know.

672
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's chicken.

673
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's, it's not, that's not delicious.

674
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah, but number go up for, for strength, but that's not what I'm going down for weight.

675
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, I mean, I mean, obviously you're correct.

676
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Obviously you're correct.

677
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I mean, I, I was doing this thing that was like super easy, like pan fried chicken breast.

678
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It was just some oil.

679
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I put the chicken on it.

680
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And I know before that I put like a mixture of like salt, pepper and herbs and some, some flour and just rolled it in that and put it in there.

681
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And it's just like fried chicken, except it's, it's good and good for you.

682
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Literally the thing, the thing that the thing about ordering food from DoorDash is just that I don't have to cook, right?

683
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Like if I, if I have to cook food, then I will eat less of it because I just, I just won't bother cooking.

684
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'll be like too lazy.

685
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'll be like, oh, I want to eat something.

686
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm going to, I'm going to do some boredom eating.

687
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh, but I'd have to cook to do it.

688
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Oh, it's not worth the effort.

689
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Never mind.

690
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's the, yeah.

691
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I've been feeling like that as well.

692
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I just, yeah, I just got to do it though.

693
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah.

694
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I need, I'm like, I'm hungry right now, but I didn't eat lunch.

695
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I'm like, uh, damn, now I'm doing PCP.

696
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I can't, I got to eat afterwards.

697
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And I don't have like a plan.

698
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I can reheat something or I could just cook a big thing of rice and just eat rice.

699
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And that, you know, that'll work.

700
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It'll be energy, I guess.

701
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It won't be nice, but I go to do something.

702
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I feel sick from being a little hungover, but I'm sick in a way.

703
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Like I feel a little gross, like I don't want to eat because of, because I'm sick.

704
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But also you ever, you ever feel nauseous, but in a way that you're like, hmm,

705
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
if I could just eat just the right thing, it would cure my nausea.

706
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You ever feel that?

707
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Um, I don't think so.

708
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Mostly because I don't think eating.

709
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Well, now that I think about it, maybe.

710
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I think, I think I feel nauseous when I anticipate eating or drinking the same thing again.

711
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
When I, sometimes, when I feel nauseous, sometimes I get like, man, if I just eat like an orange,

712
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that'll like cure it and then I'll feel better.

713
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But it's never true.

714
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I just eat it and then I feel more full and I feel sicker.

715
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I was like, if I eat something healthy, it'll, it'll fix the like.

716
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh, you mean what?

717
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Like when you're stuffed?

718
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Yeah, or just not wanting to eat for any reason.

719
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Most of the times when I feel nauseous is because I have a taste in my mouth and I'm like,

720
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I don't want any more of that taste.

721
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I need something different.

722
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Hmm.

723
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Hmm.

724
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I, this is totally off topic, but I wanted to mention it.

725
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I was thinking about my, my dream where my uncle Joe Rogan killed a guy because he wanted to go drunk driving.

726
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And I realized that the gun, the gun, the big silver gun that he shot that guy's head off with before

727
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
making it through a window.

728
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It was the, it was Vash's gun from Try Gun.

729
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Do you know the gun I'm talking about?

730
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, yeah, of course.

731
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It was a big, big, big flat silver.

732
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It was the big flat silver gun.

733
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It was that gun or it looked just like it.

734
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I was like, huh?

735
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But didn't know Joe Rogan was such a fucking weeb.

736
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
He has a recreation Vash the Stampede gun that kills people with her fun.

737
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Good old, good old uncle Joe.

738
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Okay.

739
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Podcast's over.

740
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Wait, wait.

741
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Well, yes.

742
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But Lord of Ghosts though.

743
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Lord of, Lord of Ghosts, everybody.

744
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh.

745
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I know last episode, it was like, it was small.

746
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It was a small little moment because of the tales gets trolled guys, like more important.

747
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
It was unfortunate timing because I just launched it and wanted to talk about it.

748
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But if you don't know, Lord of Ghosts is a comic that I've written and I'm continuing to write.

749
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm printing the first two acts of the comic in physical book form where you can have it.

750
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And there's a little enamel pin, just like the vapor is just, I'm just copying Ben St.

751
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Hell yeah.

752
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And I'm just going to copy Ben St. steal his ideas and it'll be great.

753
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I think you should go to the Kickstarter.

754
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You should watch the funny video and get addicted to the song.

755
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I think you should give me a cut.

756
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I think you should give me a cut since you stole my idea of charging money for a product.

757
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I'll give you a cut when you have drawn the ghost story that you will draw.

758
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
That's true.

759
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay.

760
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Fair.

761
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yes.

762
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Good.

763
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
My portion.

764
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
My royalties.

765
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I will call them.

766
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'm excited.

767
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm excited for that zine.

768
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm excited for that red man zine.

769
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I really want it.

770
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I really want that added value.

771
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Hey, you had like restricted, it was the Doodle rewards, right?

772
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You had like a limited number available and they're sold out.

773
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Oh, oh yeah.

774
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:15,000
The maximum, the biggest one, 45 pounds, the signed comic with the Doodle and the ghost pin.

775
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
25 backers no reward, no longer available.

776
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That is crazy.

777
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I didn't expect that one to max out first.

778
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah, so I mean, I could, you could get the Doodle but not with the pin now, I guess.

779
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I think I'm probably going to have extra pins, so I might make it so if I'm going to be doing

780
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
other Doodles, I might as well just lump them all in together and you can pay more if you

781
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
want the pin.

782
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yeah.

783
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Because if people want, you know, they're willing to pay for the Doodle.

784
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
They probably also want the pin as well.

785
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So, I don't know.

786
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yeah, I definitely would.

787
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's like if I'm buying the book, like, yeah, I want the fucking pin.

788
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Well, of course.

789
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah, so yeah, I'll make a note about that.

790
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Do I click an update?

791
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Is that what I do?

792
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't know.

793
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Let's make an update.

794
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
How many pins did you have made?

795
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I haven't had them made yet.

796
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I was waiting until...

797
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, you just got the sample piece.

798
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, I got the samples and I'm like, ah, this looks great.

799
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'll tell you when the, I know how many I need to order because it was the minimum was 50,

800
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
but I'm thinking I might need 100 just to cover everything.

801
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And I want to know that before I, you know, order it.

802
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And I was keeping it open and just in case it was really successful out of nowhere

803
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
and I needed like 200 pins, which is unlikely, but you know.

804
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Oh, I want it.

805
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I want the pin.

806
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Now, now I know people, people, when I, when I did my Kickstarter and I offered pins,

807
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
people were like, oh, pin, pinpog, I want the pin.

808
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Now I'm on the other side and I understand.

809
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I understand pin hype.

810
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's just so, it's so fun.

811
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I'm looking at it right now.

812
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah.

813
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah.

814
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I like, I made that tweet comparing the one, the Lord of Ghost, a smear,

815
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
the smear pin from the RFCK Kickstarter.

816
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I like it's, I just think it's funny that there's two, two different takes.

817
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah.

818
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
On the character.

819
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah.

820
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
On the one hand, it was like, oh, I can't exactly do a Lord of Ghost nega slime pin

821
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
because that already exists from Endless War.

822
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But it kind of, you know, I mean, it's him and it's the magical event.

823
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah.

824
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But the Lord of Ghosts with the, with the like the shitty drawing version is really,

825
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
really funny to have as an enamel pin.

826
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The, the, the.

827
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's a different.

828
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Different.

829
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I've said it before, but I really, really like the opening of the comic

830
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
with the sequence with all the pages is such a cool little,

831
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
it's a cool little, like what could you call it a set piece?

832
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Can comics have set pieces?

833
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's a very, it's a very cool sequence.

834
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
An opening scene, I guess.

835
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah.

836
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Sure.

837
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Sure.

838
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, dog.

839
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah.

840
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I don't know.

841
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm hyped.

842
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm hyped to get mine.

843
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Link in the description.

844
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Get that fucking book.

845
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Get that fucking, get the red man.

846
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Pledge to the Kickstarter so that we can get the red man zine.

847
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I want the zine.

848
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I want the red man zine.

849
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I always think it was, oh man, I think last time I said that, like,

850
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I will never, I will never, like, dig back through the Twitter archives

851
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
to see those red man comics.

852
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So the only way I'll ever see them again is if they get put in a zine

853
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and sent to me in a book.

854
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yeah.

855
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So it's the only way.

856
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I think I talked about, I talked about how, like, it's funny that,

857
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
like, some of the comics suck.

858
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yes.

859
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And the fact that they're printed will be like,

860
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
oh, maybe I talked about it on the stream.

861
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, did we talk about it there?

862
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I genuinely don't remember, like, what we talk about on an episode

863
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
versus what we talk about on the stream.

864
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
All the days bleed together.

865
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I don't know what time of the year it is.

866
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I don't know what day of the week it is.

867
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I don't know where I am.

868
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's a, yeah.

869
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Oh, God, I got to move.

870
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh, God, I got to find a new house.

871
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Oh, my God, I've only got, like, a month left.

872
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, fuck.

873
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
A negative Pog.

874
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's negative Pog.

875
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It's Monka S, for sure.

876
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It's Monka S, for sure.

877
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
No, I actually really got to get on that.

878
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's actually a little bit bad.

879
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Wait, how close is it?

880
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I have to move out at the end of July.

881
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So it's about five weeks.

882
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
About five weeks from now.

883
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh, shit.

884
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Okay.

885
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah, I thought it was July now.

886
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
My time.

887
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Oh, yeah.

888
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I have three days.

889
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I have three days to find a new house.

890
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
No.

891
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I was saying, I don't know, I don't know.

892
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Man, the place, the place I live is such a deal.

893
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It's such a deal.

894
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I've saved up.

895
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I've been able to save money because the rent has been, like, nothing.

896
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
But now I have to pay, like, a real rent to live in, like, a real place.

897
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And it's like, oh, God, fuck.

898
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
No.

899
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I refuse.

900
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm going to do what they did in the musical rents.

901
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm going to just be like, no.

902
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I won't.

903
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I'm going to throw a riot over it.

904
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm going to not pay rent, just like the movie rent, just like the stage play rent,

905
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
just like I didn't pay rent.

906
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I'm going to find a new apartment, sign the lease, get moved in,

907
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and then immediately be like, rent your strike.

908
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
No, eviction moratorium.

909
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You can't kick me out.

910
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Instantly.

911
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
What if I barricade the door?

912
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Huh?

913
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What are you going to do then?

914
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah.

915
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I think it's still, I think the moratorium on eviction is still active.

916
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It might vary state to state.

917
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I don't, I feel like it was never really enforced.

918
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So I feel like, I don't know, I wonder, I wonder what, I wonder what Carmen would do,

919
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
would just tell me to do if he was here.

920
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Carmen was the guy who convinced me and that when we lived in that place with the landlord

921
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
and he was trying to kick us out, he was the one who was like, he has no legal grounds to kick you out.

922
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Just, just stay here.

923
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Just stay there and don't pay rent for six months.

924
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
They can't kick you out.

925
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And he was right.

926
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So I wonder, I wonder what he would do if he were, if he were in my position.

927
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That guy has never, that guy always gives good advice about how to fucking get away with shit and then not pay for stuff.

928
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Based, based Carmen for sure.

929
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Anyway, I'm very stressed about that.

930
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I don't want to be homeless.

931
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
That would be pretty bad.

932
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
No.

933
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But it'll be fine.

934
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It'll be fine.

935
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
To be homeless?

936
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
No, that would be super bad.

937
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I just, I just, I just want to finish my game.

938
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I just want to finish my fucking game, but there's no way.

939
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's, it's not going to be done.

940
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It's not going to be done by the end of the month.

941
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And I'm going to have to move my computer and I'm going to have to move my hard drives.

942
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Oh my God.

943
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
What if my hard drives get damaged in the move and what if my files get corrupted?

944
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh, definitely back them up to like one of those funny services.

945
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I could probably, I could probably back it up some like Google, Google Drive or something.

946
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah, you probably, if it's a lot of stuff, you might have to pay the Google's premium and big amount.

947
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It's not that huge.

948
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
No, I think I could fit.

949
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I think I could fit.

950
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I mean, if I needed more storage space, I could just make a new email.

951
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
All right.

952
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Just make a new dummy email.

953
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I think I have a bunch of like just extra email accounts that just have Google drives attached for me to back stuff up.

954
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Stuff from like, I don't even remember.

955
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
That's what I've always done.

956
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Let's make a, make a dummy email.

957
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Just store a shit there and then forget about it.

958
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, it's, the files are not that big.

959
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
The game maker files are, actually, I wonder, I wonder how big they are.

960
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I'll probably tell you right now.

961
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It is the game maker file for Phantoms Revenge is 50 kilobytes.

962
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Nothing.

963
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Nothing at all.

964
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That's, that is nothing.

965
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah.

966
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I mean, that, that doesn't include.

967
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It's probably just all the logic.

968
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
No, it does.

969
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It loads, it loads this, that and the other.

970
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I was going to say that doesn't include like the assets and like the, but no, it does.

971
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
The game has, the game file has all like the sprites and the background and stuff in it.

972
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Like those aren't saved in like a separate folder.

973
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So no, that's, yeah, that's the size of the game is like 50 kilobytes, including all the art and stuff.

974
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You know, low res, low res shit.

975
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Oh, but I finished on the upside.

976
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I did finish all of the patrons that requested a like a custom enemy because I like patrons suggest enemies.

977
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I got through adding all of those in.

978
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I think there were like 11 or 12 or something people that asked me to make a special enemy for them.

979
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And some of them are really funny.

980
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'm looking at one right now and he's making me chuckle, but I'm not going to say what it is because it's, it's very goofy.

981
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
You know, it'll be, I want, it'll be a surprise, LeMau.

982
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Hmm.

983
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Good times.

984
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I like doing, I like making sprites.

985
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I like sprite work.

986
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's very, I think part of the reason why like that, like two week period just flew by without me even noticing was just because I find that kind of work enjoyable and I could just lose myself in it and just like making a sprite for that.

987
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Okay, open it up, move pixels around.

988
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh, it's done.

989
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Oh, two hours are gone.

990
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Oh, wow.

991
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I didn't even notice.

992
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It's fun.

993
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It's, it's enjoyable.

994
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I was just put on a fucking, put on fucking 10 hour, let's do 10 hour speed run of Final Fantasy six and just go to town.

995
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And that's, and that's my day.

996
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Day in the life.

997
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Good times.

998
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Huh?

999
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I was just saying, it's just saying life sucks.

1000
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Yeah, bro.

1001
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
True.

1002
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
True.

1003
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Oh, no.

1004
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So place.

1005
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And that's it.

1006
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That's it.

1007
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That's it.

1008
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Hey, hey, I got some, I got some news.

1009
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
What?

1010
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I got some, I got some news.

1011
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm going to be on a, I'm going to be on a podcast.

1012
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Can you believe it?

1013
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
No, I can't.

1014
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Can you fucking believe it?

1015
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Who would invite Benson?

1016
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I've been invited, I've been invited to appear on Animorphin Time, the leftist Animorphs podcast.

1017
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Oh, cool.

1018
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah.

1019
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Pretty cool.

1020
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
All cops are Yerks.

1021
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Hell yeah.

1022
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I have to, I have to, I have to read the book.

1023
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I think I have to read.

1024
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I have to get like any knowledge about Animorphs.

1025
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I, Tyler from, from Animorphin Time messaged me yesterday to be like, when do you want to record?

1026
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And I didn't get back to him.

1027
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And now I can't see my Twitter messages because fucking Twitter's broken.

1028
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So I can't get back to him until they fix whatever's going on with their servers or whatever.

1029
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Sorry, sorry, Tyler.

1030
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Whoops.

1031
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I have to read, I think it's book number like 30 something.

1032
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's a Tobias one, which is good.

1033
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:57,000
It's past the point in the series that I had read up to, I think I read up to like number 20, like late 20s, early 30s, I think.

1034
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And then at some point I, that was about when I fell off.

1035
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I never finished the series.

1036
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
So the one that I have to read for that episode is like post, it's past the point in the series that I stopped reading.

1037
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So I don't know, could be, could be interesting, could be pretty, could be pretty nifty, I guess.

1038
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I guess I'll, I'll link that when that episode comes out on Apple podcasts or wherever it was they publish them.

1039
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh, shit.

1040
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I just remembered I got an email about like, like a kickstart.

1041
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Oh, your Kickstarter is great.

1042
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And I was like, okay, I was going to ignore it.

1043
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
But then they said, we do a podcast promoting people.

1044
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
They didn't want me to be on, but they just said, if you want, you will promote your thing.

1045
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Looks cool.

1046
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Send us an audio clip of you promoting your thing.

1047
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And I'm like, I don't want to speak into a microphone.

1048
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
But I also feel like there's no harm.

1049
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So maybe maybe it's like a, it's like a podcast about kickstart or like indie comics or something.

1050
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
That's interesting.

1051
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I mean, I get, whenever I do a Kickstarter, I always get a bunch of like scam emails about it.

1052
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Yeah.

1053
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I saw like, the normal stuff is like, haha, we will get you pledges like shut up.

1054
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah.

1055
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yeah.

1056
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Sign up for a pay our advertising fee and we'll, we'll, we'll get the word out or whatever.

1057
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000

1058
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh yeah.

1059
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I found this other one like Olivia and William says greetings from myself and William.

1060
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
My name is a will Olivia and my partner's name is William.

1061
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
We are a duo expert crowd funders focus on seeing product projects get funded.

1062
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I would not want to impress you with too many words, but would rather let our results and

1063
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
deliveries speak for us.

1064
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000

1067
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Cool.

1068
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Like so obvious.

1069
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
This other one.

1070
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah.

1071
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah.

1072
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Wait, I'm curious about Tyler, Tyler James from comics tribe and the comics launch

1073
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
podcast.

1074
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Right now, comic book projects have a third highest success rate on Kickstarter.

1075
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The mission is comic, the mission of comics launch is to make comics number one.

1076
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,680
So I'd love to get the word out about your project with a free plug in the new just launched

1077
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,680
on Kickstarter segment of my weekly podcast.

1078
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,680
What is the podcast called?

1079
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,680
I'm kind of curious about it.

1080
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,680
The comics launch podcast for the next comics.

1081
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,680
The comics launch podcast.

1082
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,680
Is it on YouTube?

1083
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,680
Oh, no, I see.

1084
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:55,680
It's got its own website, comicslaunch.com.

1085
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,680
It's on Apple podcasts on Google podcasts.

1086
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:05,680
I mean, what he's asking for is like go to comics launch for Boy To Smell, hit start

1087
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,680
recording, and speak to it for about 30 seconds, hit send.

1088
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,680
So I'm like, that's so easy.

1089
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,680
I may as well try it even if it's like nothing will come of it.

1090
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:24,680
Yeah, I mean, he's, hmm, I see he's he's he's posting podcasts on his website.

1091
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,680
He's doing them like every couple weeks or so.

1092
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:31,680
I, I, I don't, I wonder like what kind of an audience he has.

1093
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
That's kind of neat.

1094
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,680
That's kind of cool that this exists.

1095
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,680
Doesn't look like a scam.

1096
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,680
Doesn't sound like a scam.

1097
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:45,680
No, I mean, it couldn't be if unless the comicslaunch.com slash voicemail asked me for my credit card

1098
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,680
information again.

1099
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:55,680
Yeah, the thing that I stopped like stopped myself from doing it already was like, I keep

1100
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,680
failing at the elevator pitch for Lord of Ghosts.

1101
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,680
I don't know what to say.

1102
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,680
It's a comic.

1103
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:10,680
It's about a lord is a little ghost guy and he's like, and he just wants to kill, but

1104
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,680
he doesn't really want to kill.

1105
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,680
Like, I don't know how to explain it.

1106
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:21,680
It's the adventures of little ghost as he goes because there's, I guess you could say it's

1107
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:27,680
just a, it's about a, I don't know about a little freaks wacky adventures.

1108
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:34,680
Little freaks like adventures in a strange new land filled with mud instead of the familiar

1109
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,680
slime.

1110
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:40,680
It's like, I mean, yeah, that God, yeah, I don't know.

1111
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,680
I don't know what you, what the elevator pitch for it is.

1112
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,680
It's just to read my fucking comic.

1113
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,680
It's funny.

1114
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,680
It's funny.

1115
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,680
It's cool.

1116
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,680
Yeah.

1117
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,680
I was reading it the other day and I was like, oh, you know what?

1118
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
I like this.

1119
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,680
I'm a fan of my own comic.

1120
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,680
I forgot.

1121
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,680
This is, I can't, I can't believe this.

1122
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:10,680
Like I'm looking at comics launch and I'm like, why, why does this exist?

1123
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:18,680
This, this guy just seems like he is just like, I want all comics to exist.

1124
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:25,680
I will make all comics succeed on, if it's a comic, I will fucking do anything to prevent

1125
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,680
its destruction.

1126
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,680
I like it.

1127
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,680
I don't know how, I don't know what's, what's, what's in it for this guy?

1128
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,680
What's his angle?

1129
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:38,680
Well, it could be potential networking, I guess.

1130
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,680
He's talking with comics.

1131
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,680
Like it maybe starts from a love of comics generally.

1132
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:50,680
And then by promoting people, he can be like well known in the comics sphere.

1133
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,680
Like getting, getting small indie comics off the ground.

1134
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,680
People like are happy about his work that they helped him.

1135
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,680
And then that helps him by word of mouth, I guess.

1136
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:02,680
Maybe.

1137
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,680
Maybe.

1138
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,680
Cause I mean, we're talking about it.

1139
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,680
What does he say?

1140
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,680
He says, creators, Superman isn't coming.

1141
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,680
So we get to save ourselves.

1142
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,680
My name is Jay, is Tyler James and I'm one of thousands of creators who are doing things

1143
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,680
differently.

1144
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,680
We believe the creative life and career we want is not only possible, but inevitable.

1145
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,680
If we're willing to work hard enough, smart enough and to commit, commit to bringing passion

1146
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:32,680
to every project, commit to action even when it's scary, committing to building a network

1147
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,680
and always adding value first, committing to doing things with integrity and keeping

1148
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:41,680
the promises we make to others and ourselves, commit to never stop developing our talent

1149
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,680
because we are all works in progress.

1150
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,680
And we also believe that starving has nothing to do with being an artist.

1151
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,680
While others are waiting for permission to get started or for approval from some gatekeeper,

1152
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,680
we've picked ourselves and we're building our legacies.

1153
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:00,680
One fan at a time, one project at a time, one launch at a time.

1154
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,680
So serious.

1155
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,680
It's just comics, bro.

1156
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,680
It's just comics, bro.

1157
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,680
It's not a big deal.

1158
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,680
Fuck it.

1159
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,680
I like him.

1160
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,680
I'm going to give it a shot.

1161
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,680
I'm going to figure out an elevator pitch.

1162
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,680
I'm going to say it.

1163
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,680
I'm going to send it in.

1164
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:21,680
Oh, God.

1165
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,680
I'm Flemme.

1166
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,680
Why am I Flemme?

1167
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:28,680
This is the image of him with his dog and there's a mug and the mug says, do what you love,

1168
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,680
love what you do.

1169
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,680
Well, words to live by, I guess.

1170
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,680
True.

1171
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,680
True.

1172
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:40,680
He, he, it seems like, how come this guy didn't call me?

1173
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,680
How come this guy didn't do, hey, this is, I can plug this guy in.

1174
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,680
This guy never offered to plug the vapors.

1175
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,680
Well, he's been saying that's why.

1176
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,680
What is, what does Gib have that I don't have?

1177
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,680
It's not right.

1178
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,680
I have a better comic.

1179
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,680
No.

1180
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,680
I want to, I'm really curious.

1181
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,680
Like, what is kind of following this guy?

1182
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,680
I mean, maybe he only appeared recently.

1183
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:11,680
He's, he's been, he's got his blog, the website blog goes back a couple years at least.

1184
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,680
Oh, well, I don't know.

1185
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:20,680
Maybe you, maybe you sifted through your spam emails and you just didn't see this one.

1186
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,680
If you sent one to you.

1187
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,680
Maybe.

1188
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,680
Yeah, maybe.

1189
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,680
That's interesting.

1190
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:35,680
He, he just does, he's just like, he's just got a, he's just got spotlight.

1191
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,680
So like, hey, these guys did a Kickstarter.

1192
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,680
Hey, these other guys did a Kickstarter.

1193
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,680
Hey, this comic came out through Kickstarter.

1194
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,680
That was pretty cool.

1195
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,680
Hmm.

1196
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,680
How does he make, how does he monetize this?

1197
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,680
How does he make money off this?

1198
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,680
What's, what's, it's a, it's a front.

1199
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,680
It's a front.

1200
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,680
It's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a money laundering scam.

1201
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,680
Maybe it's the only way.

1202
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,680
No, you're jealous.

1203
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,680
You're just jealous.

1204
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,680
I got picked.

1205
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,680
I am.

1206
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:06,680
I am also that I'm jealous that you got picked for the money laundering scam.

1207
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,680
Yeah.

1208
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,680
What about me?

1209
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,680
Based, based.

1210
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,680
Do you want to go to voicemails?

1211
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,680
Yeah, I got nothing else to say today, I guess.

1212
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,680
I think I've said, I think I've said all I have to say.

1213
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,680
Let's get into this horse shit.

1214
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:33,680
If you go to speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail viewer, you can send us a voicemail and we

1215
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:39,680
will re-respond to it in a disappointingly low energy sort of way.

1216
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:43,680
That's what I'm going to do today because I'm, I'm under the weather and you're all just

1217
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,680
going to have to deal with it.

1218
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,680
I see the first voicemail here is called big chicken.

1219
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,680
You see it?

1220
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,680
Yep.

1221
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,680
Okay.

1222
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,680
In three, two, one, go.

1223
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,680
Hello, PCP.

1224
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:04,680
As it occurs to me during my intense play session of Neopets, that many of the people sending

1225
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:12,680
voicemails to the channel should in fact invest in a new microphone because they all sound

1226
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,680
like shit.

1227
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,680
I mean, true.

1228
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,680
Yeah.

1229
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:22,680
In a perfect world, I would like everyone to have a great microphone and deliver crisp,

1230
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:33,680
clear, 180 billion megahertz audio quality, but I have to accept the reality that you're

1231
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,680
one of the good ones with a good microphone, big chicken.

1232
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,680
We're down here in the muck and the dirt and the grime and the filth and it's okay.

1233
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,680
It's all right.

1234
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,680
I can take it.

1235
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,680
The next voicemail is called a warning.

1236
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,680
Three, two, one, go.

1237
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,680
Yo, this is Mr. T.

1238
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,680
Ben St.

1239
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,680
You damn fool.

1240
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,680
No, false.

1241
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,680
Listen, I'm going to call a truce with y'all right now.

1242
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:10,680
Since that summer I bastard being gone, I've been released from his mind control.

1243
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:16,680
And I was going to go home and be done with this whole damn thing.

1244
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,680
But first, I had to warn you.

1245
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:27,680
Because when Mr. T came to, he was at the Kawasaki clan base.

1246
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:34,680
And there's actually one more summer I left alive.

1247
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,680
And he's got a vendetta against y'all.

1248
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,680
Never ends.

1249
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,680
Never ends.

1250
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:47,680
Y'all going to be hearing from a new, even more powerful summer out very soon.

1251
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,680
So good luck with all of that.

1252
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,680
Thanks.

1253
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,680
Mr. T, go home and fall ever.

1254
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,680
Well, bye.

1255
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,680
Thanks, Mr. T.

1256
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,680
Goodbye.

1257
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,680
We love you.

1258
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,680
Have a beautiful life.

1259
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:07,680
Have a good trip.

1260
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,680
See you next fall.

1261
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,680
Bam.

1262
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,680
What do you think of the samurai is going to be like?

1263
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,680
I think...

1264
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,680
Oh, I can't even speculate.

1265
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,680
The possibilities are just...

1266
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,680
Did you ever give back the scroll?

1267
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,680
Do you think they're going to be angry with the scroll, the same one?

1268
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:42,680
Don't you remember on stream when we realized that in creating the void Thaumaturge's robe,

1269
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,680
my Minecraft avatar has the scroll on it now?

1270
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,680
Oh, of course.

1271
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,680
You can literally see me carrying the scroll around.

1272
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,680
It's part of my character design now.

1273
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:59,680
Yep, it's that Thaumcraft.

1274
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,680
I'm high on that Thaumcraft goodness.

1275
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,680
The next voicemail is called From Collapsic.

1276
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:09,680
Three, two, one, go.

1277
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,680
Hi, Ben.

1278
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,680
It's me.

1279
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,680
Collapsic.

1280
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,680
Yo.

1281
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,680
You remember me?

1282
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,680
Ben.

1283
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,680
Yes.

1284
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,680
And all the other soldiers?

1285
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,680
Admiral Collapsic, I remember.

1286
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,680
We missed you.

1287
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,680
Ben, so very much we've missed you.

1288
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,680
Oh.

1289
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,680
We're just waiting here patiently.

1290
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,680
I left you in a low light.

1291
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,680
Are you to boot up your 3DS again?

1292
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,680
Or your switch, if you can afford one?

1293
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:43,680
Yes, we're just waiting for our chance to shine again.

1294
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,680
Shine like pixie turkey.

1295
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,680
Another Nuzlocke, Ben.

1296
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,680
We need another Nuzlocke.

1297
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:53,680
We need to prove ourselves as fine soldiers in your army, Ben.

1298
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,680
Please quit the trilogy.

1299
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,680
You know we need the trilogy to be completed, Ben.

1300
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,680
Is it a trilogy?

1301
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:07,680
We just, we're so lonely here with another Nuzlocke.

1302
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,680
God, Jesus.

1303
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,680
Laying it on a little thick, aren't we, Collapsic?

1304
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,680
We just need one, Ben.

1305
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,680
We need another Nuzlocke.

1306
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,680
Is the pig coming?

1307
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,680
Complete the trilogy.

1308
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,680
What's the trilogy?

1309
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,680
The trilogy.

1310
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,680
Jesus.

1311
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:28,680
This is me, Collapsic, and this is the way I talk.

1312
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,680
Yes, Ben.

1313
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,680
Okay.

1314
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,680
We'll see you real soon.

1315
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,680
Oh my God, my skin is crawling.

1316
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:44,680
The, the, uh, yeah, I know I said, I have said that I wanted to do another Nuzlocke,

1317
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:48,680
and I do, but I just, I gotta do, I gotta finish the game.

1318
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,680
I can't, I can't do another one of those before I finish the fucking video game.

1319
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:56,680
That's just the way it's gotta be.

1320
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:00,680
Um, but I mean, thanks for the reminder.

1321
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,680
Nice to hear from you, as always.

1322
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,680
Glad things are going well in Alola.

1323
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,680
You're taking care of business.

1324
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,680
Good, good shit.

1325
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,680
That's the lore.

1326
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,680
That's the deep lore.

1327
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:17,680
Next voicemail is called Please, 3, 2, 1, go.

1328
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,680
Please keep talking about Tim Rogers.

1329
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,680
Please make it a weekly sing.

1330
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,680
I'm not joking.

1331
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,680
There is not enough Tim Rogers discourse online.

1332
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:30,680
I guess you've done at least some research on Tim by now, but he's been around for a long,

1333
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,680
long, long, long time.

1334
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:36,680
He had a whole arc where he went to be a game developer in Japan and had a noise band.

1335
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,680
And look, honestly, Ben puts himself down too much.

1336
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:42,680
Tim has put out so many reviews and they're insanely long.

1337
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,680
He's easily written like 5 million words worth of game reviews.

1338
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,680
This man has never fucked.

1339
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,680
I have high hopes that he's never fucked.

1340
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,680
He will reach this level of completely autistic content creation.

1341
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:59,680
If you've read Backman, Tim here is like Nizuma Agee, a completely autistic,

1342
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,680
turbo virgin that lives to work.

1343
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,680
And by work, I mean waste everyone's time.

1344
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,680
That is the ideal to strive for.

1345
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,680
I know Ben, our dark hero, cannot be stopped.

1346
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,680
Nothing can take him down.

1347
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,680
The elves slide off him like Ponderwater.

1348
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,680
He will never give up.

1349
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,680
He will never give in.

1350
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,680
He will reach the top.

1351
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,680
And once he's there, a new generation of workflow's trash will look up and say,

1352
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,680
fuck Ben St.

1353
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,680
Fuck his little club.

1354
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,680
Returns to Groves Ben St.

1355
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,680
You asshole.

1356
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:30,680
And you will look down and say, no.

1357
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,680
True.

1358
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,680
Who is Tim Rogers?

1359
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:37,680
I don't think I was here when you talked about him.

1360
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,680
Really?

1361
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,680
He is a...

1362
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,680
I'm shocked.

1363
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,680
I'm sure you were.

1364
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,680
He is a guy.

1365
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,680
He worked for...

1366
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,680
Okay.

1367
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,680
I know a lot about him.

1368
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,680
Just because he talks about himself a lot in his video game reviews.

1369
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,680
But he is...

1370
01:20:54,680 --> 01:21:00,680
Now he has a channel on YouTube called Action Button where he has made like five really,

1371
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,680
really long video game reviews.

1372
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:09,680
Before he was doing that, he worked for Kotaku making videos.

1373
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,680
And he is...

1374
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,680
Yeah, you know, he was a game...

1375
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,680
He worked for a game developers in Japan.

1376
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,680
He was like a translator for a...

1377
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:22,680
He was a translator for a Yaoi manga artist.

1378
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,680
He was a...

1379
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,680
Or he was just some kind of assistant.

1380
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,680
He...

1381
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,680
He's in a...

1382
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:29,680
Oh god.

1383
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,680
What else?

1384
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,680
Yeah, he was...

1385
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,680
I know he's been in a noise band.

1386
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:33,680
He didn't...

1387
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,680
He says his band was bad.

1388
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,680
I don't know if any recordings of this music or anywhere.

1389
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:48,680
He always talks about doing running, doing track when he was younger and having six pack abs.

1390
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:52,680
He was a fashion model, I guess, for a while, which is like really weird.

1391
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,680
That's a really strange detail because he's not like a...

1392
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:56,680
He's not like a...

1393
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,680
I mean, I guess he's kind of fit.

1394
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,680
I guess he's like skinny.

1395
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,680
He's not like a...

1396
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:04,680
He's not really a fashion model looking kind of guy, but I guess he did that.

1397
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,680
This guy has managed to get...

1398
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,680
He's 42?

1399
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,680
He's 42, yeah.

1400
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:16,680
This guy has managed to get away with complimenting another person that I am envious of.

1401
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:23,680
He has managed to get away with it without irritating me by implying that I, too, am great.

1402
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:27,680
So, thanks for that, voicemailer.

1403
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,680
Appreciate it.

1404
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,680
I thought you meant...

1405
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,680
Tim...

1406
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,680
Tim Rogers complimented you.

1407
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:33,680
No.

1408
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,680
No.

1409
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,680
No.

1410
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,680
No.

1411
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,680
I've been...

1412
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,680
I've been...

1413
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,680
Every week, for the last couple weeks, I keep complaining about, like,

1414
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,680
I found this guy on YouTube.

1415
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,680
I kind of like his videos, but he's not so great.

1416
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,680
I could do what he does.

1417
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,680
What's so special about him?

1418
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,680
These are my gripes.

1419
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,680
These are my gripes with Tim Rogers.

1420
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:58,680
This guy says there's not enough Tim Rogers discourse, but what discourse is there to have?

1421
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,680
I mean, the guy...

1422
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,680
He just talks about himself.

1423
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,680
He just talks about himself in his videos.

1424
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,680
And that's why I know all about him.

1425
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:12,680
There's nothing I can say about Tim Rogers that he hasn't already said about himself.

1426
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:19,680
Looking forward to the next review, I guess.

1427
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:24,680
The next voicemail is called Best Voicemail I've Submitted.

1428
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,680
Sorry for the bad ones.

1429
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,680
Three, two, one, go.

1430
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,680
Hey, PCP.

1431
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,680
Nah, actually, fuck it.

1432
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,680
Yeah.

1433
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,680
Yeah, dude.

1434
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,680
Now, that's what I call a good voicemail.

1435
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,680
Get in, get out, make your point.

1436
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,680
Don't waste anyone's time.

1437
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,680
Good job.

1438
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,680
Next voicemail.

1439
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,680
Oh, this one's gonna be good.

1440
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:50,680
It's called the Ben St. Child molester.

1441
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,680
This is gonna be epic.

1442
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,680
All right.

1443
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,680
Three, two, one, go.

1444
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,680
What?

1445
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,680
All right.

1446
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,680
Thanks for the voicemail.

1447
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,680
It sounded almost like it was real.

1448
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,680
Like someone was actually driving really fast, but I don't think so.

1449
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:24,680
Well, I mean, that guy...

1450
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,680
There was a guy who would send us voicemails who would just rev his car.

1451
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,680
He would just drive his car really fast.

1452
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,680
And I was always scared he was gonna crash on voicemail.

1453
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,680
It was gonna be horrifying.

1454
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,680
I don't even know.

1455
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,680
I don't even... I don't know what to say.

1456
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,680
Good job.

1457
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,680
Okay, the next one is called a physicist.

1458
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,680
Do you see that?

1459
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,680
Yes.

1460
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,680
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1461
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,680
There is a problem in physics.

1462
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,680
We can't unite quantum field theory and general relativity.

1463
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,680
So here is my question.

1464
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:00,680
Do you quantize the gravity or gravitate or geometrize the quantum?

1465
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,680
So which one? Choose wisely.

1466
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:08,680
Ah, fuck.

1467
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:14,680
Should we quantize gravity or geometrize the quantum?

1468
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,680
You should quarkize gravity.

1469
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,680
How should I know?

1470
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:24,680
How should I know which one we should do?

1471
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:31,680
I mean, gravity seems the Pythagorean...

1472
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:38,680
I mean, if they aren't compatible, then you can't just do that, right?

1473
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:44,680
Then you would be incorrect to quantize gravity.

1474
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,680
If gravity isn't...

1475
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:51,680
I feel like this isn't a question you can just be like, which one should we do?

1476
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,680
Because if either one works, then you just do it.

1477
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,680
But the problem is that it doesn't work.

1478
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,680
I don't know.

1479
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,680
Real question is...

1480
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,680
Should you poopoo in the pee-pee?

1481
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:18,040
You poopau-poop audition

1482
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:25,960
Next voicemail is called Ben your alcoholism is slowly killing you part two three two one go

1483
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,840
Told you so

1484
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,040
Yeah, bitch

1485
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,240
Did you know did you know that I was gonna be hungover this episode, how did you know?

1486
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,980
Hey, who sent that then was it somebody watched you be drunk. I

1487
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:50,660

01:26:54,700 --> 01:27:00,580
Don't know. I don't they got you. I don't I guess they fucking got me. I think they got me by accident

1491
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:05,060
I think that was an accidental L on my part, but but an L nonetheless

1492
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,420
Next voicemail is called

1493
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:13,700

Begetting this sick cash flow we're making

01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:43,160
Yeah, we're making we're making so much money right now because we sold

01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,200
That's right. We sold it for like

1502
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,560
32 dollars

1503
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,500
Which which I spent on weed and also we got rid of our house. So we don't have to pay rent

1504
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,760
But we're not homeless shut up

1505
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:10,080
We're just camping out inside of this Walmart parking lot in our super cool RV

1506
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,400
Which you can't see cuz fuck you and this could have all been yours Ben

1507
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:21,280
You kind of had a share in this but yeah, I'd be a bitch and say things. Well jokes on you

1508
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,720
Fuck oh

1509
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,960
Anyway, I gotta go there calling security on me or something

1510
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,840
Smell you later

1511
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,560
nerds

1512
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:38,040
Obviously, I agree with the spirit of this of this voicemail. Obviously, I endorse its message

1513
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,560
Oh

1514
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:47,680
Yeah, I saw like Riley make fun of you for like doing making a brony game or something

1515
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,680
on Twitter

1516
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,680
No, no

1517
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,760
Or it was like the X that account

1518
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,360
That's a that's a dummy. That's like a fake account. How was it?

1519
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:02,840
That's that's some that's some guy who runs like a fake account and calls himself yig studios to make fun of them

1520
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,720
But decided to like call me a brony and make fun of me for being a brownie or something

1521
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,040
I don't know why he felt the need to do that

1522
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:15,360
But he well, I mean it was a big own. It was like a massive L you took

1523
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:22,280
I did when people remembered that you were a brony once my my the diarrhea from that L was

1524
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,960
Put put the other ones to shame

1525
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:31,680
Yeah, yeah, that was that was such like a that was such like a deep cut like a blast from the past

1526
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:37,280
I know it's been so long since anyone been like dude give up the like usually. I'm I'm

1527
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:44,040
Historically been the guy who's like dude give up the pony shit, bro. The po the brony shit. It's kind of cringe, bro

1528
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:49,400
Like it's I mean, I don't say it like that, but like to hear to hear someone say that to me

1529
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,920
I was honestly just like that's it's bizarre

1530
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:59,040
It brings me right back. It brings me right back to when like our bronies like allowed to exist

1531
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,600
That's the discourse

1532
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,640
Was a cringe to like ponies. Yes, but and who cares

1533
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:15,120
Is it cring is it cringe to like ponies because as we all know being cringe is punishable by by exile exile at least

1534
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,760
Yes, that was funny also

1535
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,280
Just a reminder

1536
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,960
Just reminds me of the of the message tricks. He sent me where she said

1537
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:31,200
Riley's made me so many connections to big people with big money

1538
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:36,200
And now you're never gonna get to have any of it the only me because you're too mean

1539
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:40,720
And I guess I think it's funny because like she lives with her parents now

1540
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:47,000
She's just moved back in with her parents. So I guess those are the big money connections that Riley made for her parents

1541
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:54,640
Wait, is that real? I think so. I believe so. Yeah, she's in California and

1542
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:03,480
Pretty sure she's where her parents are. So I mean that's that's God. That's like that. Why else would she be in California?

1543
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,440
Was his father's day, you know visit your folks

1544
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:12,080
Oh, but the other reason she'll be in California because Dick Masterson's there, I guess

1545
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,160
He's living there and out of then that and then our hills. I

1546
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:24,200
Don't know does he maybe he lives in there. Wait, Los Angeles. I don't I don't think I don't think Dick

1547
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,760
Masterson is letting her crash on his couch

1548
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,840
I don't know that would be pretty funny. I don't I don't see that happening

1549
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:37,800
I'm pretty sure she's just living with her parents, huh? It's like our third parent

1550
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,680
She wishes

1551
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:47,340
Next voicemail is called failed relationships and flesh lights

1552
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:54,760
Saucy, okay, three two one go. All right. Here's part two of my woman hate blog a thing

1553
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:59,720
I gotta tell you something. Okay one thing. Well, first of all, I'm not trying to be disgusting

1554
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:06,080
I'm trying to be realistic. Okay, if you're seriously a horny toad and you're fucking eat pussy and

1555
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:12,100
Some of you probably already heard this from trolls or you heard it from somebody. Don't be ashamed. Go to

1556
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,720
www.fleshlight.com

1557
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:20,080
If you have 60 bucks, you can get yourself the best sex toy a man could ever own for himself

1558
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:24,800
Not only does it feel like real pussy. It doesn't give you any troubles. It doesn't give you any headaches

1559
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:30,160
It feels it feels like the real deal now. I know what some of you especially trolls are saying

1560
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:34,840
Oh, you've never got pussy. Oh, you've never got me. Listen to me. Listen to me good

1561
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,680
I'm gonna be fucking open and honest and I don't give a fuck

1562
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:44,560
Okay, TMI it is. Okay. It's okay. All right. All right. Cool. Good voicemail. Yes

1563
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,560
pussy rules

1564
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,600
Uh

1565
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,160
Bass thanks for the voicemail. Are we still listening to him? I did. Yeah, I'm over it

1566
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:59,400
But I think I think I get the picture the next voicemail is

1567
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:05,360
From tarbuck transom and it's a YouTube link. Okay, let's listen to it in three two one go

1568
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:12,840
H bomber guy is wrong Ruby is good actually I the beneficent to tarbuck transom was in the audience of a recently published

1569
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:19,160
Lecture about ruby that we filmed at nlokon it totally sold me on the show and actually watching it has exceeded the

1570
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:24,360
Expectations set by the lecture. I know folks are on these parts like lectures. So I thought they'd want to know and

1571
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,200
Anlokon I

1572
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:31,840
Think though Simon did that it is Simon. I saw I did see

1573
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,440
Simon posting this

1574
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,640
Somewhere I saw it posted somewhere that they did a ruby lecture

1575
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:46,160
I did see it and I have not watched it. So I I don't I I don't know. Oh, it's six and a half hours

1576
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:50,840
Yeah, that's why I didn't watch it. It's six hours long. Yeah, but yeah, this is another

1577
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,920
It's a ruby lecture. It I if that's out. I mean, I'm sure

1578
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,200
That would be interesting to people. It's

1579
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:07,760
Seems like the kind of thing that could that that a lecture could could work. Yeah, that's definitely good lecture material

1580
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,840
I've I've I think I've watched like a first episode and

1581
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:17,480
Like a few friends have like talked about ruby because they were a fan's bit and I said, ah, this is when it started getting shit

1582
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:21,360
Look at how cool it was here and how shit it was here. I'm like, okay

1583
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,160
interesting

1584
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,120
But I watched the first episode and I wasn't really that into it

1585
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:30,080
But the fight scenes are very very well like animated and choreographed

1586
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,880
So there's that I I should I think I think I watched the H bomber guy

1587
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:43,680
video about it and like the ruby is something and here's why the the deal the deal with it or the

1588
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:49,520
The the the what I learned or what I think I learned about it is that it's basically made by a guy

1589
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:56,200
Who's really good at animating fight scenes? Yes, and then they were like, I guess we should make a story about it

1590
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,200
And like their writing is bad

1591
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:04,440
But the fight scenes are cool. That's what that's my impression of it based on a little I've never watched any of it

1592
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:09,880
I think I've heard that the the characters are good. I don't know

1593
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:17,520
Writing ways. I don't know whatever fuck. There's a lot for it. Check out the fucking lecture in

1594
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:25,120
Would it be better to watch like six and a half hours of ruby rather than the lecture about it

1595
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,120
It's quite a lot. Oh, hmm. That's a good question. How much ruby is there?

1596
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,560
entire

1597
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,640
length of

1598
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,760
Ruby

1599
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,000
Use ask in Google. Yeah

1600
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,800
How long is Ruby? Oh

1601
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,640
No, don't do that to me Google

1602
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,640
I

1603
01:35:54,720 --> 01:36:01,240
Can see the the volumes 16 episodes in volume one episodes very greatly in length

1604
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:08,680
One eight fifteen and sixteen around eleven minutes long and all other episodes are split into approximately six minute halves

1605
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,080
Oh, so you could that's not even that much

1606
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,520
How long would it take you to watch all of ruby?

1607
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:22,080
I'm I there's no number provided. I'm so I'm just reading like volume two features 12 episodes

1608
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,640
12 to 15 minutes each

1609
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,600
so

1610
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,600
12 episodes 16 minutes in length

1611
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,960
12 episodes 16 to 20 minutes in length

1612
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,480
So that you could figure it out

1613
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,560
But I it's like eight volumes and they've all got slightly different numbers of episodes and lengths

1614
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:49,680
Do you I feel like you could get through to like volume three at least in six hours? Yeah

1615
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,840
I see

1616
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,000
well

1617
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
cool, I don't know

1618
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:01,760
Fucking link in the description if you want to check out Simon's PCP style

1619
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,520
Ruby lecture, I guess I'll just take credit

1620
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:11,400
PCP takes credit for the format any lecture that anyone ever does from now on on anything is a PCP style

1621
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,100
It's the

1622
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,800
What was the fine brothers thing they did a while ago when I tried to like?

1623
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:25,280
Oh, right that like owned the the idea of reacting to things the reacts the like yeah

1624
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:31,720
The like kids react elders react whatever like that you could you can pay us a fee to use the react format

1625
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:35,880
And you'll be part of the fine brothers family or some stupid bullshit. No, yeah

1626
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:43,920
Okay, next voicemail is called comrade Tarbuck transom three two one go

1627
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:52,080
Ultimate programmer and the leftist Jordan Peterson your beloved Tarbuck transom here keeps calling us looking time ago in a town called

1628
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:58,040
Kikapu there lived a game development studio called Westwood who made command and conquer and the red alert series

1629
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,920
They were purchased by EA and then treated badly

1630
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:08,880
The original team's refugees eventually escaped and went on to form a worker co-op called a super giant and made the game Hades

1631
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:12,160
By playing the game. You are directly supporting socialism

1632
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:21,400
Other worker owned games made by different people include dead cells disco Elysium tonight. We riot and the board game co-op only

1633
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:28,320
Do you know of any others? I had a list in a website, but I can't find it again

1634
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:35,280
Um, I didn't know that's interesting. I didn't know that about Hades. I didn't know that about disco Elysium

1635
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,280
I did know that about tonight. We riot

1636
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:43,040
That is pretty another reason to try and play Hades then I guess I

1637
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,640
Already bought Hades a long time ago and then never played it because Noida

1638
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,600
Could hook to me too hard

1639
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,720
the

1640
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,840
I'm I guess I'm just I'm surprised, you know, maybe I'm not that surprised

1641
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,200
I think feel like if there's any industry

1642
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:04,400
I feel like if any kind of like company was gonna be like worker owned it would be oh

1643
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,040
Like a small indie dev studio God

1644
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:14,320
I was talking to Munchie yesterday and he said and I agree that like good good end for Ben

1645
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:19,640
Saint is like get a exact is work for one of those work for like some local like small

1646
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:27,200
Worker owned like game game dev co-op. I wish I could find a group like that. That sounds so cool

1647
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:31,120
Since I mean since I have to move and my rent's gonna go up

1648
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,120
I've been thinking about what kind of a real

1649
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:38,200
Real job could I get if only if only I could find something like that? It wouldn't be so bad

1650
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:47,560
But it'll never happen it'll never happen my my my I'm not we're in the darkest timeline and I'm just gonna

1651
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:53,760
Die in the gutter. It's fine. It's fine. Oh, don't worry about me

1652
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:59,160
I mean, what if you made you what if you started one? How would you start a worker co-op?

1653
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:06,640
What if you just said hey, I mean the PCP is basically a worker co-op. We all like own it together

1654
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,640
So I guess just do it the same way we made the PCP

1655
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,120
However that was

1656
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:21,800
Uh-uh, duh, duh, you just get mage to start a Skype a Skype group

1657
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:27,680
That's where all worker co-ops come from didn't you know I

1658
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:34,240
Guess that yeah, we could technically do that online, but I think in person would be a lot easier

1659
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,960
Sure

1660
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:44,520
I mean, huh are you okay? And I need to get it. I need to get a drink. I'll be a second

1661
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:47,600
Fine a few moments later

1662
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:53,480
Sorry, I thought I could I thought I could hack it out

1663
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,280
But I

1664
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,520
Don't know. I just felt like I needed a drink for a while

1665
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,880
But I didn't have a drink because I drank it all and then I need to go get one

1666
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:05,840
You gotta have your drink and drink it too. I'm gonna not dive

1667
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:09,480
Dehydration that's the one

1668
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,080
Okay next

1669
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:18,400
Next voicemail is called voicemail detective three two one go

1670
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:27,960
Hey, what's up fellas? It's me the voicemail detective and I have discovered in my meticulous research that that guy

1671
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:34,360
that called in towards the end the last episode with all his bullshit about

1672
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,200
being the nuns and

1673
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,600
did you being a father figure and

1674
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,760
Max reviving Tarantino cast

1675
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:49,120
That was definitely fucking Tommy J. And he knows good and well he is banned from the voicemail

1676
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,320
No

1677
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,760
This is a scream at the end

1678
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:07,680
Okay, I'm I'm on the phone. I am calling 9-1-1. I have dialed 9-1 and I am ready to hit the final one

1679
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:12,040
I just need his location. We need to have him arrested apprehended

1680
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,240
He is he has violated. He has violated the terms of our arrangement

1681
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,800
Retribution feels like a snitch moment. I don't want to like I don't like a applaud like snitchery. Oh

1682
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,440
shit

1683
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:33,440
That's true. I don't know. Maybe that voicemail was fine as far as I remember

1684
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,960
maybe

1685
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Maybe cops are base though

1686
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,880
No snitch snitching is cool. Remember your your traditional lifted values

1687
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,800
Traditional anti for values. I smell a little red brown alliance

1688
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:54,880
Wait, I don't know what that is

1689
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:00,680
I think I think it's red red like communists, but brown like Nazi brown shirts

1690
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:04,400
I think is the do a little nas we do a little nas Bolin

1691
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:12,400
No, sorry. Sorry. It was a momentary insanity. No snitching leave Tommy J. Alone. He's uh, he's uh, he's reformed

1692
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:20,880
So long as the voicemail is not terrible no beating need be required

1693
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,640
Yes

1694
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:29,480
Optional next voicemail is called Ben. You have hurt me three two one go

1695
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,480
Okay, then what the fuck?

1696
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,240
Yeah, first off you don't

1697
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:43,800
Respond to the title of my voicemail as you can wear diapers at the beach Ben. Fuck you. I'm sorry be

1698
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:51,320
You keep accusing me of doing pig noises. So I ain't going bitch

1699
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,240
I don't I don't mean who are you?

1700
01:43:55,500 --> 01:44:05,080
I think they didn't realize your reference to the pig was not about what they were saying but instead about

1701
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,280
Oh

1702
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:13,400
Maybe yeah, I mean I guess if you don't know that there's a scary pig in the voice mails

1703
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:17,920
You might be a little confused when I anticipate pig noises coming

1704
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:24,360
Yeah. Hmm. Yeah interesting curious I apologize voice mailer

1705
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:30,720
Next one is called give is a perfect angel three two one go

1706
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,520
So last week you talked about like

1707
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,040
How it feels

1708
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,320
That's how it feels to be trans and like I

1709
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:51,200
Guess forgive have you found a good YouTube video that like explain how it feels because like as a

1710
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,920
Sysman, I don't get it. I don't

1711
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:01,360
And this isn't a rude thing at all like I do not understand what changing your pronouns

1712
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:06,160
Possibly dressing a little differently. I don't know what other changes you've made

1713
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,080
Physically, but I don't understand

1714
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:15,160
What that has done for your mental health or how that has helped your I don't and it's not a mean thing

1715
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:20,680
I'm just very I mean, I don't I'm not like a psychologist. I'm not entirely sure why

1716
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,400
It really made me just feel better

1717
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,840
It was it was a lot of stuff in 2020 that I looked up

1718
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:36,520
Like little bits here and there that are not like in on of themselves

1719
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:42,120
Like smoking gun evidence or anything, which is why it was hard for me to notice

1720
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,760
But just sort of I don't know gender dysphoria or whatever it is I have

1721
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:52,040
causes like a blanket layer of depression and

1722
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,240
It's just sort of

1723
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,480
like

1724
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:04,680
Society expects certain things of a man and I didn't want to do those things and therefore

1725
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:07,560
I just felt like a failure all the time no matter what I did because

1726
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:13,160
The the masculine ideal that I should strive for was just something I didn't want to do

1727
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,120
so like

1728
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:22,320
Succeeding was upsetting in a way and doing the other thing. It was just I don't know

1729
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,520
I don't know what about my brain

1730
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:31,880
Change changes or like how it works. I just know that I tried the the pronouns

1731
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:40,840
And being referred to as a as a girl as a woman as a she it changed. I just made me feel better

1732
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,000
It's it's very strange

1733
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,360
I don't know

1734
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,520
If you want like

1735
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:57,040
Videos that explain it a bit better. I think Contra points does a lot of stuff about that

1736
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:02,120
Yeah, it was mostly contra points a little bit of philosophy tube

1737
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:06,840
Damn contra points is is good at what that's valid as fuck

1738
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,760
You're being thanks. You're being so valid right now

1739
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:19,080
Thank you. Yeah, I don't know. It's just I mean it take gender out of the equation and it's like

1740
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:27,320
You've always lived your life thinking that you're supposed to have a mohawk and and you just keep shaving your hair like that

1741
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:30,920
Because that's what you're supposed to do and then one day you said, you know what?

1742
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:34,400
I'm just gonna have a different haircut and then suddenly you feel

1743
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
Suddenly they don't let you use the bathroom anymore

1744
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:41,600
Suddenly they don't like to use the different hairdressers or whatever. It's like

1745
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,900
It just a change in your life

1746
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,640
The you know you prefer

1747
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,320
That's it. You just prefer it. I don't I there's no

1748
01:47:54,760 --> 01:48:00,640
There's no way to like quantify it more than you could quantify anybody's preference for anything

1749
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:05,000
And it just so happens to be very socially

1750
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,120
Socially

1751
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:18,280
What's the word not stigmatized exactly just sort of like the social pressure to be masculine or feminine or to not be the opposite

1752
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:26,220
Is is quite prevalent in in Western society or lots of basically everywhere

1753
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:34,720
So it's more it seems more important or more like drastic. I guess it's it's basically the same thing

1754
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,040
So, I don't know. I

1755
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:42,880
Like it. I just like it. That's all I just I just think they're neat. I just think I'm neat

1756
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,520
Okay

1757
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:52,480
Good aunt. Thank you voicemailer. Good answer. I hope you're I hope your queries have all been addressed

1758
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,480
query

1759
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:55,920
Got them

1760
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:01,280
Next voicemail is called ignore the end three two one go

1761
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,160
Okay, last one

1762
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:13,000
You guys talk about Homestuck a lot and I've never read it. Yeah, you give me a short concise pitch on why?

1763
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,960
Like I know the discourse of it. I know the trolls. We've we've talked about it so much

1764
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:23,280
What is so captivating about the story? Oh my god? I feel like also Ben

1765
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:30,280
What comics of yours do I need to read to care about your game? Thanks? I love you care

1766
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,400
Baby Ben

1767
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,240
Okay, so ignore the end ignore the end. So it's okay. It's okay a few

1768
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,880
the game is

1769
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:46,480
Only relevant to slime and punishment the game is a part of the slime and punishment story

1770
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,400
So you only need to read that one

1771
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,400
If you don't read it, then it won't make any sense. What's going on in the game?

1772
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,560
I mean, you could probably still play the game and it would be fine

1773
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:00,640
But like this would be like what what is this situation that I'm witnessing who are these characters?

1774
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,160
Well, I mean

1775
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:08,520
If you wanted an elevator pitch for Homestuck, I can't give one to you because it's too

1776
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,600
Difficult to do that

1777
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:16,800
Maybe that gives you enough of an idea. It's just good. I mean, it's hard to explain

1778
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:20,360
He's heard us talk about Homestuck. He should know

1779
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,780
What I don't really know exactly what he wants here. I

1780
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:28,320
Should I just just read it dummy?

1781
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:36,720
Yeah, like you can't I can't give like a plot synopsis that explains Homestuck and why it's good because why it's good

1782
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:40,120
It's like the premise of Homestuck is not why it's good. It's the

1783
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:45,800
It's like the like weird and like funny and and very it's the journey

1784
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:52,200
Specifically way that it explores that that concept. It's not the premise exactly

1785
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,920
It's not like even the way it's told exactly

1786
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:59,040
It's the journey you go on reading it and seeing everything that happens

1787
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:07,400
Yeah, and I've like I've said a lot a lot of people like the trolls and and got into it like post act

1788
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:13,840
three and four four for for me for me peak Homestuck is is act one

1789
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,200
But a lot of people don't feel that way a lot of people think it only gets good later. That's fine

1790
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:24,760
That's fine for some people. I guess well, that's exactly the thing is that the the comic shifts and changes

1791
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,080
it's

1792
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:28,080
It's focus so much

1793
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:34,920
That it is like the journey of reading it and seeing where it goes with all the different things all the different threads

1794
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:40,520
Yeah, and and how it chooses to explore them. So just yeah read it. There's real

1795
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:44,400
There's really no simple way to explain why I like Homestuck. It's

1796
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:51,080
That's why do you think I've taken you 300 episodes of a podcast to do explain it?

1797
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,080
Oh

1798
01:51:53,400 --> 01:52:01,080
Flynn okay next voicemail is called. I am the captain of my life now three two one go

1799
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,320
but a PCP got a

1800
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,760
Question for you guys that can maybe become a discussion if you care to have one my question is

1801
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:16,440
Have you ever regretted being a fan of someone or something in the long the long run or the long term?

1802
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,640
Quick short context behind this question. I used to embarrassingly be

1803
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:24,160
Pretty active listener of Trixie and all of her content

1804
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:28,280
Should make those $10 vlogs in her side channel and just all this stuff every day

1805
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,600
and I listen to it just out of force of habit and

1806
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:35,280
I would consider getting like one day I'd be like I want to maybe become a teacher

1807
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:39,400
You know and take my career in that direction and then maybe I saw like a Trixie vlog

1808
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:44,560
She was like man fuck school. I failed college fuck

1809
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,720
High school sucks. Yeah suck man, and I was like, yeah teachers probably suck because you know, they probably suck

1810
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,840
Same thing for like the government. I'm thinking about getting a job like a government job. It pays well

1811
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:02,680
It's it's up my alley. It's utilizes a lot of my skills, but Trixie is like the government is it's anarchy

1812
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:08,040
And we need we need anarchy the government is a destructive force. Yeah, so I'm embarrassing shit like that

1813
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:12,620
I kind of regret listing all those so you guys have any similar experiences

1814
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:16,820
Yeah, I man. Yeah, I can

1815
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:20,180
Yeah, I

1816
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,300
Don't know that don't

1817
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:33,100
That's unfortunate whether that's unfortunate if that affected your affected your your course in life a real choice

1818
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:37,500
Yeah, I mean, I don't I can't think of any like

1819
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:44,020
People I became like fans of I mean I watched a lot of Trixie stuff

1820
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:50,460
Especially earlier on it's like I was watching all of it, but I never really took her advice as like

1821
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:59,620
Gospel like I'm sure some of the younger fans of hers were yeah, cuz I was her friend. It was like oh like, you know

1822
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,380
She's not always right. I

1823
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:10,420
Cuz I'm sort of on the same level, but some people they get into that. Oh my god the the youtuber die. It's so

1824
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:17,220
Beautiful a lot of radiant light. I can't not agree with it even like yeah

1825
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:21,260
I can I can imagine I could fuck you up a little even if you say like hey

1826
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:26,580
I'm not a role model. Don't don't like be like me which you know she would say that yeah

1827
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:32,100
But but but still like you know a lot of people in the world want to be

1828
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:39,100
Youtubers a lot of people like want to do that and they see someone doing that doing what they want to do and

1829
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:45,260
I think even if you say don't I'm not a Roma a lot of people like be like oh, but I kind of I kind of want to be like

1830
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:48,660
You you know like if you're being successful at a thing they want

1831
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:54,820
They're probably gonna want to emulate you like why wouldn't they it it's gonna happen. It makes

1832
01:54:55,420 --> 01:55:01,900
Perfect sense. I I guess like it's weird cuz I don't feel like I regret any of the things

1833
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:04,940
I was into when I was younger even if some of them are cringe

1834
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:08,420
I suppose like like it's not really a regret worthy thing

1835
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:12,940
Because my life wasn't completely turned around or ruined

1836
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:15,460
Yeah, anything

1837
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:22,380
Like I used to be a fan of dr. Wolf. I would watch I would watch his videos and be like, huh, you know

1838
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:27,820
Insightful, but like I fell for the the I fell for the accent. I fell for like

1839
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:32,500
The the sense he puts on of like oh, he's got a waistcoat. He must be smart

1840
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:35,940
And I was just like, yeah, you know

1841
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:40,860
Analysis bronies are cool. I well there. I I guess I

1842
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:48,300
It's it's not like I feel like it was a terrible thing that I kind of like watched some of the cringier brony

1843
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:51,380
People for a while like whatever

1844
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:54,540
Yeah, I don't I don't feel I don't I mean

1845
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:59,580
I don't feel like anything that I was into like really did me harm or or anything

1846
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:02,460
There's nothing that I'm like, oh, if only I had never gotten to that

1847
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:05,780
I wouldn't have you know done something or other

1848
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:12,460
I mean, I guess I were I kind of regret that I was a big Harry Potter fan growing up because I don't like JK

1849
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,060
Rowling anymore

1850
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:20,500
And I kind of feel this. Oh man. I mean, I maybe the worst one is that I used to read ruches

1851
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:24,860
Blogs and ruches a is a horrible horrible human being

1852
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:28,660
I didn't know at the he wasn't he didn't used to be quite as bad as he is now

1853
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:31,180
You know, you know who that is right the pickup artist guy. Oh

1854
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:38,060
No, well, he he was a pickup artist guy now. He's like he's just like a fucking

1855
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:45,700
Now he's just like a fucking social commentator. He's a down guy trad trad calf like fascist man

1856
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:54,060
Just like he's he's the worst human. He wasn't always quite so bad

1857
01:56:54,060 --> 01:57:00,100
But boy, I'm like, it's it sure is embarrassing to be like, yeah, I used to I used to read that guy's blog

1858
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,100
I bought one of his books

1859
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:05,260
But it's it's true

1860
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:08,940
So but I wouldn't I don't say if I regret it because it didn't like

1861
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:15,060
Didn't do me any harm and like sure some of the stuff see he made he was he was edgy

1862
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:18,580
But I never like took any of his edgier statements. That's seriously

1863
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:22,900
I don't feel like it it made me a worse or even much edgier person

1864
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:29,500
Maybe I mean when it comes to like Harry Potter like I still like

1865
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:36,660
At least the games the games are like treasured memories didn't didn't turn me into a turf. So, you know, I

1866
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:41,460
It's fine. That's J.K. Rowling sucks, but we all know that

1867
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,420
Yeah

1868
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:50,580
So so I guess not really I guess there isn't really anything that I regret being into that much

1869
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:57,380
Even even stuff that like I look back and I think oh that was pretty bad actually like whatever

1870
01:57:58,020 --> 01:58:00,980
It's not bad. It's not bad that I used to like something that is bad

1871
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:05,100
It's character building character building. That's right

1872
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:11,580
Next voicemail is called politic question three two one go

1873
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:19,460
Short question voicemail for this week PCP sort of similar to another voicemail I sent this week

1874
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:22,380
But what are your general thoughts on the government?

1875
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:25,420
What do you think it's kind of a broad topic?

1876
01:58:25,420 --> 01:58:28,740
But if you could sum it up, what do you generally think about the government?

1877
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:32,260
What do you think the role of the government should be in people's lives and

1878
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:36,940
The state of the government currently do you think there's departments that should be

1879
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:46,300
Sized down or removed from power. Do the government should be expanded. Do you have any general thoughts on I have for discussion next

1880
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:48,300
I have been thinking about this

1881
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:51,740
lately, I have been seeing people saying that

1882
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:55,620
Anarchists are just liberals and I'm

1883
01:58:56,620 --> 01:59:03,100
Part of me thinks that I understand why they say that and I've been I've been thinking like I

1884
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:07,940
Don't know. What am I am I am I am I am I an anarchist or am I a communist?

1885
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:12,660
I'm I'm definitely one or the other and I guess you can technically be both, but I guess

1886
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:16,340
In my I'm like stupid. I'm like stupid. I don't understand anything

1887
01:59:16,580 --> 01:59:17,780
But when I hear those words

1888
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:23,220
I think an anarchist would want no government and a communist wants the government to

1889
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:25,780
Do stuff and like take care of stuff

1890
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:30,940
And give people stuff and redistribute wealth, which I do want it to do that

1891
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:33,140
I

1892
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:36,100
Think I might I think I'm I think I'm I don't know

1893
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:40,740
I think I do kind of want I

1894
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:47,420
Mean obviously the government we have now is imperfect and I wouldn't authorize like the government as it exists currently

1895
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:51,060
Now has the authorization to do everything that would be bad

1896
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:56,060
But I do think that in a perfect world. Yeah, the government would control a lot of stuff

1897
01:59:56,060 --> 02:00:01,820
That would just make life easier for people and like just offer everyone in the world

1898
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:11,500
It's the essentials, you know food clothing housing healthcare education and just

1899
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:14,900
Yeah, I want the government to do lots of stuff for free

1900
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:19,460
Maybe that means I'm not an anarchist

1901
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:26,060
But yeah, and yet I don't like all the anarchists that I know all the people that I know that call themselves anarchists

1902
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:30,420
They all see they're all pro, you know universal health care and all that stuff. I

1903
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:33,500
Guess I don't fucking understand anything

1904
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:40,260
Yeah, yeah, I don't know terms quite that much

1905
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:44,220
I think closest I would maybe call myself a socialist

1906
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:48,220
But like what kind of socialist I'm not even really sure what the terms are

1907
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:52,500
I know certain things that I like when it comes to government

1908
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:58,140
I the I mean the UK government is

1909
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:02,620
It sucks

1910
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:07,860
But I'm not like well read enough or like knowledgeable enough about how it sucks to explain

1911
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:11,260
I just don't like Boris Johnson or the Tories and

1912
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:16,620
I don't like the the media machine that like demonized Jeremy Corbyn

1913
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:23,540
But by you know, like it all pushed that the anti-semite thing so that people wouldn't vote for him democracy

1914
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:31,180
It's it's so heavily swung by just whatever people end up being able to say on the news and it sucks

1915
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:34,060
I

1916
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:36,060
Think the government

1917
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:39,460
It should exist. I don't think you should be completely gone

1918
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:44,060
Mostly because I don't know how you could organize things

1919
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:48,140
Without one, but I obviously think the the government's

1920
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:52,500
Power shouldn't be like

1921
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:59,580
Like from one person more democracy within the government I suppose

1922
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:05,860
Yeah group groups of like a representative from each place

1923
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:10,420
I don't know. I don't really know how it works right now, but I know that it doesn't work

1924
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:12,940
You know, they they say like um

1925
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:19,220
Socialism is about like democratizing everything, right? Like even the it's not democratizing everything

1926
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:22,220
Work democratize work

1927
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:29,020
Who is not one guy at the top of any given system that like scrapes a little off the top for himself

1928
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:31,900
as extra free profit for no labor

1929
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:37,260
It's it's all like everybody works together to make everything work

1930
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:40,860
Yeah, and people would say oh well

1931
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:45,420
What if people don't want to do it, but I don't know it's the same as everything I

1932
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:51,780
Think yeah same as you people the government should provide free basic living standards

1933
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:55,220
So the people don't die people have somewhere to sleep if they need it

1934
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:02,580
I mean, I feel like the food all that stuff the government should exist too and like people say I

1935
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:06,660
Understand there's a difference between like the state and the government and like the state is bad

1936
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:12,780
But like government is good in theory at least government is like just people organizing as a tool

1937
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:16,060
Yeah, government is just people organizing to like

1938
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:22,380
You know fucking accomplish things. It's sort of like a big union if you think about it

1939
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:25,100
kind of or it could be

1940
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:27,540
you know

1941
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:30,540
Ideally a government it gives it it

1942
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:35,900
It you know it could collects it collects, you know resources from you know the

1943
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:39,740
accumulated from the aggregate like production of

1944
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:48,100
Civilization you know everyone's working everyone's doing stuff making stuff government collects that stuff and then redistributes it in the form of you know

1945
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:50,380
free services or

1946
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:54,420
Housing UBI what whatever form reach redistributive

1947
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:57,340
Justice I guess

1948
02:03:57,620 --> 02:04:02,580
Is a good and also and I mean also as a check against like private

1949
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:05,420
power right like monopolies right like

1950
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:09,900
Jeff Jeff Bezos gets more money than the government

1951
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:15,740
And is more powerful and can just buy the government right it can just lobby the government to be like oh do this do that

1952
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:19,460
And it's like well, you know ideally the government exists to be like well

1953
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:24,220
Actually, it's illegal for you to have that much money because you're just one person and that's bad

1954
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:27,980
So we're breaking your fucking company up, and we're gonna shoot you

1955
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,900
Yeah, I

1956
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:37,300
Know yeah, it's so difficult at least in the UK is that

1957
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:42,780
so much of politics is run by ministers who are

1958
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:45,780
funneled through like the

1959
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:48,340
upper-class like a

1960
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:53,180
Super-rich eaten school and then Oxford and Cambridge

1961
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:59,340
Really expensive schools where they are told you will be a minister you will be a politician

1962
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:05,540
Because you have all the money and you can just do that because you got the you got the degree and being the prime minister

1963
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:12,540
Now you're the prime minister well done, and then they have no reason they have no incentive. They have no idea that

1964
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:16,060
They should

1965
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:21,100
Stop that system from funneling their own children through the same super-rich

1966
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:26,500
Highway to politics. Yeah, because it worked because it worked for them the system work for them

1967
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:30,220
Yeah, it works for them like it, and they just they actually just

1968
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:38,520
It's it's weird to think that they view the like it's a human being and they're viewing other human beings as

1969
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:42,620
Disposable and trash and nothing and so that seems like super villain stuff

1970
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:46,320
But I it just has to be true by based on their actions

1971
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:53,160
They just don't think of poor people as deserving of life or or needs being to be met

1972
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:58,680
They only do it in the pursuit of continuing to be in power if it's not good PR then they wouldn't bother

1973
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,640
hmm, I

1974
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:05,920
Mean, I guess that you gotta you got you gotta maintain your power so that you can do

1975
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:11,080
The things that you might tell yourself are good and for the good of everyone

1976
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:17,880
Right, but like if you lose your position if you lose the votes or whatever then you're out, and then you can't do it

1977
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:20,760
So whatever whatever it takes, right?

1978
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,200
Yeah

1979
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:28,200
The next voicemail is called gaming

1980
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:32,600
Smiley face, okay three two one go

1981
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:35,800
Hey PCB on a tone Jones here

1982
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:41,520
Tom is on this week, but the rest of y'all may be familiar with the new guilty-gear game that just came out

1983
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:45,960
I was just wondering if y'all had any thoughts on that be it based on story gameplay or whatever

1984
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:53,920
I at the at that the gaming cafe that we went to they were they had a big like seating area and they had big

1985
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:59,600
Monitors in like a central area, and they were playing people were playing guilty-gear stride strife, right is the new one

1986
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:04,680
I don't know. I've never heard of such a thing never heard of I think they have the new guilty gear

1987
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:06,280
It's called guilty gear strife

1988
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:10,560
I think and my opinion of it is that I don't play fighting games, and I don't care and

1989
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,400
I'm sorry

1990
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:19,640
Everyone seems really into it, and that's great, but I am not interested in seeing more drawings of May on my

1991
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:23,560
Timeline, I don't care that she has a pirate hat

1992
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,400
I'm just it's whatever

1993
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:33,440
Yeah, it's fine the day. I care about a fighting game is the day I am Tom Oliver

1994
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,420
Mmm, and not a second before and that's today. Oh

1995
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,720
No, it shows you the sign that turns you into Tom Oliver when you read it. Oh

1996
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,760
Somebody could maybe make a

1997
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:55,000
Version of the sign that makes you like they could make that if they get a clip or an image of Tom looking at the

1998
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,500
The board for the guilty-gear lecture or the animos one

1999
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:01,920
Yeah, it could easily be realized

2000
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:06,320
But do we dare? What do we dare though?

2001
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:09,240
Oh

2002
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:16,120
Yeah, I forget everything Tom said in the guilty-gear lecture. I remember pauging, but I don't

2003
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:22,520
I wonder I wonder if that's like exploding in views now because of the new game

2004
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,560
I'm sure it does. It's been doing well

2005
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:31,080
You know, I mean I can I can find out I can find out right now

2006
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:34,960
Let's see. I gotta log out of my account

2007
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:41,240
Twitter is why is Twitter like this Twitter is just not working for me, and I'm like

2008
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:44,120
It's making me nervous

2009
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:46,840
It's making me nervous that Twitter is just doesn't it works on my phone

2010
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:49,280
What did it do to me?

2011
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,160
What they fucking do to me? I don't know

2012
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:57,200

And animal morphs and guilty-gear where the people the videos people were watching on our channel the most last month this year

2024
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:41,160
Guilty-gear has jumped up ahead. It was really going

2025
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:45,360
It was getting like over a thousand views a day

2026
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,920
For a couple weeks there in early June now. It's kind of settling back down to under a thousand

2027
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:57,360
So yeah, I had a little bump there. That's pretty that's pretty good. That's pretty exciting

2028
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:00,080
Let me look a little back in the timeline

2029
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:04,080

Now that you have successfully turned the PCP into the Ben St. Podcast

2045
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:23,400
What are your plans for the future of the show?

2046
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:29,200
Nuclear option nuclear option baby, uh

You should have more guests on just have more guests on

But there's yeah, but it's so hard

2050
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,280
So hard to ask someone do you want to be on my show?

2051
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:46,800
It's embarrassing. What if they say no? What if they laugh at me?

2052
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:51,320
Well, they record them laughing at you and say they were on the show

2053
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:59,560
That just just play the laugh track every time you say anything and it's like they're laughing at your jokes

2054
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:03,900
That that's that's one. That's how you get them. There's

2055
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:07,520
You take life gives you lemons make a little lemonade

02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,400
Next voicemail is called me again

Let's see

02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:28,200
sub

2062
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:33,640
The Titan PCP read it and I got some different things

02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:42,720
The top post in

2065
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:49,200
The top post that I see is red in the playlist redcon 2017 the playlist

2066
02:12:53,040 --> 02:13:00,440
Four years ago, what's wrong with that? Oh, it does not exist wait. Why does this playlist not exist?

2067
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:08,280
Wait, who had who made the playlist? There's there's bunches of videos in there

2068
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:15,280
But I mean, maybe maybe maybe Trixie maybe Trixie made the playlist

2069
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:20,560
And by priveting everything the playlists are also gone

2070
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:25,680
I mean all the videos. I mean a lot of the videos are still there because they weren't all on Trixie's channel

2071
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:27,800
the

2072
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:29,800
the I'm did

2073
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:36,520
You think you think the playlist was made on on Trixie's channel. I mean, I can't remember who made it

2074
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,840
But maybe

2075
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,560
This is

2076
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:51,800
I'm looking at the at the subreddit. Oh, it's did we show this

2077
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:56,960
Meme this is a good. I'm surprised this this post has like 50 upvotes

2078
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,680
It was posted two weeks ago. It's got 50 upvotes

2079
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:03,640
You know what?

2080
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:09,880
I'm I'm reading I'm reading the subreddit. I'm reading the subreddit. It's actually getting like

2081
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:15,800
It's actually got people looking at it. That's that's crazy. I like forget that the subreddit exists

2082
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:24,240
Tarbuck trans and posted the ruby lecture this this meme about everyone else being dead is funny to me

2083
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:26,440
Uh

2084
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:28,720
Unfortunate that I'm not there or Tom

2085
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:35,640
Are you just not no, we're just not there just not there. Hmm

2086
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:43,240
But they could have done something funny like like me and tell more each of your arms or something

2087
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:50,080
Pandaman Pandaman post post here that says

2088
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:54,080
The PCP has a real art preservation problem

2089
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:59,200
Many members take down old videos and the vast majority of their old videos in some cases. How is this okay?

2090
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:03,920
Yeah, that's for it. I agree. I believe in our preservation, but I can't

2091
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,880
Oh, we haven't we haven't deleted. Uh, well

2092
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:11,700
Never what I haven't deleted anything. I'm doing my part

2093
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:19,440
Do someone unit number 2278 asked guys who are the current members of the League of Nate fuckers?

2094
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:26,640
You must need to know for lore. I don't need them all but the more you can name the better because I don't remember a single one

2095
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:28,640
Thanks in advance

2096
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:32,720
Your boy Cthulhu zero comments

2097
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:39,440
Your boy Cthulhu says important sources for PCP history. It's like this guy is looking for

2098
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:42,040
looking for

2099
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:44,040
for for for

2100
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:49,040
Knowledge secret knowledge. Okay, I'm gonna stop reading it now

2101
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:54,320
But I it's cool to see people up post in there and actually like voting on stuff and be it's neat

2102
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:59,360
Me me me stumbling upon the subreddit while trying to find out what happened to the Homestuck podcast

2103
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:02,240
I was listening to and it's the it's the funny gif

2104
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:04,840
where you know

2105
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:07,760
Where he goes in with the pizza and there's everything's on fire

2106
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:10,040
mmm. Oh

2107
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:12,220
Yeah, it's uh, yeah Troy

2108
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:17,420
I'm trying to find out what happened to the Homestuck. Is is is he talking about arm retrieval?

2109
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:23,980
I'm assuming so like arm retrieval scone. I wonder what's happened then looks into it. Oh, no

2110
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:31,260
Oh, oh look at it a month ago. Henlo Corgo posted PCP is even better now to be honest

2111
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:34,260
The episodes are about as focused on a specific topic as they everywhere

2112
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:37,620
And the fact that every episode doesn't have four or more people talking over each other arguing

2113
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:39,620
Which makes them easier to listen to and enjoy

2114
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:41,980
Woo

2115
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:51,380
I like it if you listeners if you if you are a if you're a if you're a lay epic redditor

2116
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:58,700
And you haven't seen it. I mean go check out the fucking PCP subreddit. It's uh

2117
02:16:59,220 --> 02:17:05,300

2118
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:12,660

2125
02:17:49,300 --> 02:17:55,940
Ben becoming a calmer really was he harambe everything change in the timeline for the PCP

2126
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:01,860
Thanks for coming on playmaker tune in next week same pcb time same pcb channel

2127
02:18:02,420 --> 02:18:05,300
Really really was he harambe?

2128
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:10,340
Uh, uh, I gotta find the pro crastinators

2129
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:13,620
podcast

2130
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:18,740
So it's happened so first. I didn't know when he started saying the comment comment

2131
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:25,380
Uh, so it's also sort of blended into his own speech. Oh wait, I was from 267

2132
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:30,820
That was from 267 not 268. Uh, are you really gonna go find the comment?

2133
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:33,060
I just it's

2134
02:18:33,060 --> 02:18:37,460
What does he mean? What does he mean me becoming a commie? Was he harambe?

2135
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:41,380
Oh, here's it was was the harambe

2136
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:44,340
Maybe they mean his harambe moment

2137
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:48,500
I think maybe what it means is that like when harambe

2138
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:53,780
Was killed that was like when we branched into the dark timeline and everything started going wrong

2139
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:55,940
I think I think that's the implication here

2140
02:18:56,740 --> 02:19:00,740
Uh, okay. Oh, we can understand more if we listen to the next voicemail

2141
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:04,900
PCP bad comment award show meta post three two one go

You're really gonna ban all these terrible comments and undercut my fucking show

2144
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:14,260
Who am I supposed to make fun of now?

2145
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:18,500
There are people whiting about the pcb being different every single week

2146
02:19:18,740 --> 02:19:21,300
I'm only gonna ban people that say nothing

2147
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:24,020
Constructive at all, but just be like

2148
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:28,340
Just end the show guys guys the show's not like it used to be just end it

2149
02:19:28,660 --> 02:19:33,060
Just stop just stop making it guys. Please. I personally don't like this youtube video

2150
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:37,620
It shouldn't be existing should you should stop me you should delete the thing

2151
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:40,580
I don't like instead of me leaving which is so much easier

2152
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:45,380
I don't like this episode of you should do something about it

2153
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:48,020
Uh

2154
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:53,700
No, I won't be I'm I'm there will never be any shortage of bad comments

2155
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:57,620
Uh next one if I if I deleted all the bad comments

2156
02:19:57,620 --> 02:20:00,180
We just wouldn't have any more comments and that wouldn't be any fun

2157
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:06,900
Uh next voicemail is called the three. I don't know what that means three two one go

2158
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:12,420
Hi so

2159
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:16,500
Hello

2160
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,100
Hello

2161
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:20,100
Is the question about how much

2162
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:23,300
Ellie is our cuts out. Is it mainly just moments where

2163
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:27,300
No one's speaking for an extended period of time or is it

2164
02:20:27,940 --> 02:20:29,940
Or are there actual like chunks of

2165
02:20:30,660 --> 02:20:32,660
Conversation being cut out

2166
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:37,380
Ellie is our cut out that long pause that he put in that the one that voicemail

2167
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:39,140
Uh

2168
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:46,180
No, it's pretty rare that we actually cut out like actual conversation. Generally. It's like generally it's like um

2169
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:52,820
Just someone like you you went to get a drink before and I said Ellie is our cut out the silence

2170
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:56,740
Yeah, that's usually it. Uh, or if

2171
02:20:57,380 --> 02:20:59,380
I don't know if we said something uh

2172
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:04,500
Devastatingly bad and we like oh, we're gonna cover this up. It's good a little watergate

2173
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:07,380
And let's say cut that out

2174
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:12,420
Yeah, if if I'm if it's something if like someone says something that's like sensitive information

2175
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:15,060
It's like now. I don't want to say that Ellie is our cut cut the part

2176
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:18,420
But that like almost never happens. It's happened like once or twice

2177
02:21:19,220 --> 02:21:20,820
Uh, generally it's just silences

2178
02:21:21,460 --> 02:21:25,220
Or if there's like a voicemail, that's like particularly bad and we're like we just don't want to play it

2179
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:32,420
Uh, then it'll just be like Ellie is our just cut that out and pretend like it wasn't there that also pretty rarely happens

2180
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:34,340
um

2181
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:39,460
Next voicemail is called le power tools three two one go

2182
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:44,340
You know, I fucking power tools to make furniture. I did it myself with a hammer and nails

2183
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:47,620
So I was like, I don't know fucking seven or some shit

2184
02:21:48,020 --> 02:21:53,620
Like and how was it how was the chair that you made when you were seven functional a person can sit on it

2185
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:56,580
So therefore, uh, you're wrong benny boy

2186
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:04,740
I think there's something about like tarbuck transom said just build your own furniture

2187
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:09,060
And then we were like but we don't want to do that because it's all of the things about it

2188
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:13,540
I including having to get tools and it's like no just get a tool

2189
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:16,500
It would be really just get a single tool

2190
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:20,340
I mean, I'm sitting at a at a at a desk with a drawer in it

2191
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:27,380
I like having a desk with a drawer in it. It would be really hard for me to build a desk with a drawer in it

2192
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:29,700
um

2193
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:31,860
I would I'll just fucking buy one. I don't know

2194
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:36,580
Hey, so my you could my parents gave me this one. You could carve a desk with a drawer

2195
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:38,180
um

2196
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:41,460
In it out of a larger desk with a larger drawer in it

2197
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:43,540
Uh

2198
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:48,340
Scrape the venero just pretend you made it. I guess I guess that's true

2199
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:51,700
Oh, we got the it's our last voicemail

2200
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:58,100
Um, it's a it's a virus. It looks like it's it's a mp3

2201
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:04,580
Fast upload. It's why did they do this? I don't I don't like it, but I'm going to

Oh, okay, pick it. It's yeah, it's a link to another like audio

2203
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:13,460
It's a 30 second voicemail

2204
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:18,580
I don't know why you put it here, but one second. Yeah, okay. Let's listen to it. It's called voice

But for me, like, you know, if you were to I mean, you don't really criticize me

2207
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:34,260
Often ever but like if you were to I'd be like, yeah, you're you're right

2208

You know, like I trust your opinion on my work or not to say that I would not to say your work is so consistent

2209
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:43,060
Like right there's

2210
02:23:43,220 --> 02:23:50,020
It doesn't really tend to veer off in like new directions that like I need to point out like what are my thoughts on them? Yeah

2211
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:54,740
All right, I see

2212
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:57,860
um

2213
02:23:58,420 --> 02:24:00,420
Where's the trust gone

2214
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:02,660
The trust

2215
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:07,460
Trixie trusted your judgment and now oh true true. I mean I

02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:39,060
Uh, it was a different time

2225
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:45,780
Is a time when you had terrible audio and I just remembered that you used to have really terrible audio for a lot of the

2226
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:50,580
The podcast I used to have yeah, I had a pretty I mean my mic is still pretty mediocre

2227
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:53,700
But I had an even worse one for the first like year or more

2228
02:24:55,380 --> 02:25:02,420
Uh, it was bad. Yeah, it was pretty bad. Uh, but you know what it was great and I wouldn't have it any other way

2229
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:04,580

02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:23,220
It's white. It's not blue. It's white

2234
02:25:24,420 --> 02:25:26,100
It's more powerful

2235
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:28,100
Well, the one I had was gray

2236
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:30,660
