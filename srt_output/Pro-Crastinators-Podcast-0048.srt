Welcome to the perfect cast. It's the number one best solo podcast on this whole channel.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Welcome to Digibro's decompression chamber. The only depressing shit suicide game.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Welcome to Mumkey's Countdown to Suicide, baby. One episode to go.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Welcome to Endless Jess Countdown to Suicide. It came before Mumkeys. It's the real one.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Welcome to the Suicide Squad Squad.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This podcast has already killed itself. This podcast just won the Oscar for best makeup.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We did it, boys. Yeah. Damaged. Hashtag damaged.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, yeah, today it's a PCP episode about suicide.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And everyone here is looking forward to experiencing that sometime in the near future.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's that brass ring we're all reaching for.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mumkey, you seemed like you had some idea of what you were doing in this podcast.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, why don't you do that?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, okay. I was hoping you would have us introduce because I had a great bit.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, real quick, introduce me real quick so I can see my name.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, yeah. I should say everybody's here. We got Mumkey Jones here, everybody.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Goddamn it. Come on, go. Go. No.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Come back to me. I'm going. Come back to me.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, I got a good name.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We got Hippocrite. Hippocrite's a guy.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I got it. I got it. All right. Hi, everyone.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here's my gun. Click. And here we go.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay. Come back to me. I think I'm ready.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay. Here's Mumkey Jones, everybody.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I wish that I was dead.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah. I know that song.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's a good song.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's how I say hello. Oh, shit.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
StemClad won't turn off when I turned off my phone. Goddamn it.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This bit is a fucking mess.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Lovely use of my wonderful music.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Here we go.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Actually, why am I even continuing?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, go ahead.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Tom Oliver as well.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not going to do anything gay like with a toy gun

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to make light of this serious topic.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's very mature of you.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You big gay. And also, Endless Jess.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey, everybody. Life is a precious gift.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And welcome to the Happy We're Here cast.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Boy, it sure is great to have good friends.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And it's the sun's in the sky.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And everything's going to be okay.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Shut up, Morty.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So how about I read the Urban Dictionary Suicide?

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No. It's kind of long.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Who just said no?

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Actually, you know what? This definition is really short.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay. It's suicide in Urban Dictionary.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Your way to say to God, you can't fire me, I quit.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, I don't believe in it. It's a shitty definition.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't believe in it. I'm bored by this.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right. Here's my intro to this whole thing.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When you want to... I mean, we're all alive.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's one thing to make, you know...

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Unfortunately.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We're all alive.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
For now.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
When I think of suicide, it's because I'm sad.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And then I think of the things that would happen afterwards.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And it usually results in me realizing that

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't want to be that guy that jumps off a bridge and then holds up traffic

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and everyone's like, ah, fucking dead guy again.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Geez.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't want to be known as the guy who inconvenienced everyone.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So I just usually just stay alive.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's just generally how I do this.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There's ways to kill yourself without it inconveniencing that many people.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, it will only inconvenience at least the people in my family.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You'll be like, oh no, he's dead.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They might have you in pain for a funeral.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you're still giving a shit about what other people think,

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that's how you know you're not ready to kill yourself.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, yeah.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're not at that level.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're just too much of a normie.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think before we get into the weeds of this argument,

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we should go around the horn and each person should say

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
whether they're pro or against suicide,

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and then maybe a little blurb about why.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Pro or against suicide as a general concept or for ourselves?

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Both.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Each one.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Did you want to start since you're already talking?

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, Jesus Christ.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, in suicide as a concept,

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I mean, I understand if you're someone who truly feels

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that being alive is just not worth it,

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can't really blame you for killing yourself.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Like, it's going to suck for probably some people.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I mean, I'm sure there's some people who could kill themselves

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and it wouldn't even suck for anybody.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There's got to be some people in that bad of a situation.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right, right.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But you know, because every time they say,

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
oh, think of how it'll hurt your family.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's like, well, there's got to be some people who it wouldn't,

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you know, who like those guys, what do you tell them?

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like, I guess do it because clearly things have gone horribly wrong for you.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How about it's a beautiful life where if that guy killed himself,

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
he would have gotten the insurance money to feed his family.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean, sure, it turned out that he had the support of the community

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that loved him so much,

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but also killing himself was a pretty good plan.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, let's be frank here.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Like, we act as though, you know, sure, life is precious.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You can't do anything unless you're alive, if you're dead, you're gone.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But at the same time, if we're thinking of this in terms of like the net gain

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and loss for humanity, there's probably a lot of people who'd be better off dead

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and like the world would be better off if we lost it.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Like, we're kind of overpopulated.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We got a lot of dead weight.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There's a lot of people weighing down the system, you know.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Did you, bro?

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, so, yeah, exactly.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, you know, some people, if you just, if they got rid of themselves,

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
it's just less of a burden on the rest of us, you know.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are there any racial groups you want to mention in this context, Digi?

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is that where you're going?

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, I had no, I wasn't even required.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So Digi, that's your idea of suicide in general,

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
but what about for you specifically?

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
For me specifically, I have too many things I want to see to kill myself.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like, even if there's moments when I'm like, man, I don't,

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I like, I'm not really contributing anything.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I mean, granted, if I killed myself, my family would be absolutely wrecked

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and I wouldn't do that to them.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But more important because I, because I care about them,

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but like more importantly than that, for me, just like,

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm afraid of dying because I want to see everything.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I would rather try to live until like with these, the,

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the incredibly pale chance that the technological singularity happens

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and I get to live forever.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want that.

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I want to live for all time.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know, you'll be happy to know that I heard optimistically

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that not necessarily the singularity, but I heard recently

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
that some experts who I completely forget,

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was listening to some podcast about it.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was Neil deGrasse Tyson.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He figured it out.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It wasn't Neil deGrasse.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It was actually Sam Harris's podcast.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I forget which episode, but he was saying that experts have said

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that it is possible that we have currently passed the threshold

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
of people who were born today will discover like the de-aging process

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and just in our current bodies will be able to theoretically live forever.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That was the theory that he was saying.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So I hope so.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I hope that worked out.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The funny thing about it is that my fear of death is also

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
what makes me feel depressed and suicidal.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Like my fear that all of this will be for nothing makes me like,

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you know, it's like, why even go on when I know that I'm going to die anyways?

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why not just get it over with now?

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why suffer all this bullshit for the sake of no progress?

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because eventually I'm going to be dead and it doesn't even matter.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But if there's that off chance that I could live forever,

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
then all of it is for something.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like I can continue to grow and continue to become better for all time.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I feel like we've had this exact conversation maybe on another podcast,

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
but I feel kind of the opposite in that the idea that eventually I'm going to die

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
sort of motivates me to do things.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And if I could live forever, I would just get super lazy and be sadder.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I feel like I would.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's always the thing in anime or fantasy stories like humans have short lives.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's why they get things done unlike the elves who just fuck around for a thousand years

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and nobody cares about them.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's such bullshit.

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's just like humanity just like jacking themselves off.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not bad that we die.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's totally cool.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We're going to be so fucking cowardly.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I completely agree.

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Every time someone's like, I wouldn't want to live forever

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
because I'd have to watch everyone I know die.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I'm like, you'd make a whole bunch of new friends

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and get to have all these other deep relationships that go on for hundreds of years.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, well, I mean, eventually.

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If I'm living forever and I have to watch all my friends die, that's sad.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But hey, there's a guy living forever who gets to keep them alive for all time in my memory.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If I died too, then everyone wouldn't matter.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yep.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I get it, but it's just...

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean, I'm sure living for maybe like three or four hundred years, that would be great.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That would be pretty good.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You can get a lot of skills mastered in that time.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You can be really cool and stuff.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But forever is just such a weird concept that I'm sure I would go insane by the time.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The ultimate solution to cure nihilism and cure meaninglessness from the world

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is for one person, me, to live forever as a historian of all the great people who ever lived.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's how we fix the meaningless void.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, Hippo, what is your view?

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Endless murder.

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hippo, what's your view on suicide in general?

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, me?

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, I think generally people who seem to kill themselves...

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Actually, I don't know any statistics about that stuff.

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But if you're a teenager, you shouldn't because emotions are running high.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Generally, you might not have the best understanding of your situation

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and it might not be as bad as you think it is.

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, people who commit suicide, do it when you're an adult and you know that everything's fucked

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and if you really feel like doing it.

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I guess it's not so bad as long as you set things in order before you go.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because when I think about doing it myself, I've never really considered doing it

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but I've always enjoyed just thinking of all the things that were not enjoyed

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
but it's just taken up time.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Just thinking of all the things that would happen.

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know, I took pills and I was just found and then people would be like,

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
oh my god, oh no, he's dead.

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And then they'd have to pay for a fucking funeral and I'm like, oh shit.

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I didn't want them to do that.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I should have left a note saying, don't just throw me outside, okay.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And that would dream of all the different ways to die,

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
each one a little more than he would dare to try.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Was anybody else being driven insane by the fact that you just realized

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hippo Crit is just written as Hippo Kit in his name right now?

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There's no R.

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's driving me fucking crazy.

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
How long has it been this way?

231
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is the last straw.

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Even I don't know. I don't even think it has been that for very long.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Maybe someone changed it.

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know.

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Jesse, you go next.

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I think that suicide is probably good for most people, just not for me

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
because living rules and there's too much stuff that I like here.

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There's, yeah, I just, fuck it.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I get it.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll kill myself.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Living does rule.

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's just sometimes it's like,

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Living does rule, but sometimes it's like,

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Or it'll just be like a face, like a face of that emotion.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, I've got a great t-shirt idea.

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That text is centered on the main chest area, but that wraps around the body

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and just goes all the way to the bottom of the t-shirt around the body.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But anyways, I guess my point was I definitely believe that most people are inherently bad

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and should die and should probably kill themselves.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My dream is to make as many people want to kill themselves as possible.

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's a lot of bad people in the world who are just making it worse for everyone

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and deserve to be here and most of them are found replying to my Twitter all day.

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oops.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I, on the other hand, I've never been suicidal.

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't think I ever would be suicidal.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Even at my most lowest moments and my most depressing moments,

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
at least happy to be alive because I know that I'm me and I'm my favorite person pretty much.

258
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I mean, I'm not my favorite person, but I'm pretty good.

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I feel like the world needs me.

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It would be irresponsible for me to not be guiding humanity's hand.

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I really feel like the human race would be utterly lost without me

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and pretty much everyone would just give in to hopelessness and despair

263
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
if I wasn't here to brighten the world's day.

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, there's just too much stuff that I love here and there's too many people I like

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and I'm one of them.

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm kind of surprised to hear that, Jesse.

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I always thought you were at least a little bit of a suicide boy.

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Fuck no, that's gay.

269
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, I think most of us, I mean, I don't know about all of us,

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but like from based on things from like the fact that we're alive

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and also we joke about it more than we,

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
because I feel like people who would do suicide don't joke about it or talk about it.

273
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They just sort of blow it up and then suddenly they're dead.

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, we're gonna have to get into our real suicide boys here in a second.

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Monkey, you're our resident real suicide boy. Why don't you tell us what you think?

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I've got a bet going. If he actually does it, I make a lot of money.

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, do you guys have like a suicide pool going on?

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No, just me. Just me for Monkey.

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm really mad at you with yourself.

280
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Would you put like money in a box and you only get to open it if I'm dead?

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I put money against you killing yourself,

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
so if you have to keep living, at least I've got some money out of it.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Right, that's smart.

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm absolutely down to put bets on a Monkey when and how suicide pool.

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh, I think we should. I think we should do that in this podcast.

286
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah.

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But yeah, I don't think it's any secret that I have a bit of an affinity for suicide.

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I have a whole YouTube channel called Monkey's Countdown to Suicide.

289
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
As did you. You did that podcast last week in response to Tommy Boy here.

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And you just had to mention that YouTube channel.

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And from your one fucking podcast, I gained like 40 subs in that one day on a channel.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't even update.

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In my book, I have a whole chapter titled Suicide,

294
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
where I pretty much list my personal philosophy through the lens of that character.

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But yeah, I think that suicide is a human right,

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and that anybody, for any reason, if they feel so inclined to end their life,

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
that is their right, nobody owns their life more than they do.

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It should be their decision, despite how it makes other people feel.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Because, and I said this in my Depression video, there's that stigma of,

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
oh, suicide is the most selfish thing a person can do.

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But I think forcing another person to live an entire lifetime of sadness and suffering,

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
just so that I don't have to feel sad about it, about them dying,

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think that's the real selfish thing.

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's really, it just rubs me the wrong way when people are like,

305
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
oh, you're so, you know, you have to be so selfish to kill yourself.

306
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Because what about the people you leave behind?

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We'd be so fucking sad.

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, what kind of a selfish fucking attitude is that?

309
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You didn't give a shit about being nice to the person when he was fucking alive,

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
but you're gonna guilt-trip him because you might be sad if he decides to fucking end it.

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Motherfucker, where were you for the last his entire life when he was sad?

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Fuck everybody. You're the cowards.

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's interesting, because I feel guilty if I were to kill myself and make people around me sad,

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
but I would never think to impose that guilt onto someone else,

315
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
because even if I do know a lot about their situation, it just seems a bit weird.

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I mean, I would feel guilty not out of some kind of moral obligation,

317
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
because society says so.

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I just feel like my family doesn't deserve that.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They did a good job and they were fine.

320
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I would hate for them to think that somehow it was their fault because it totally isn't,

321
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
whereas I'm sure for some people, you do want them to,

322
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
kind of like in Monkey's book, the main character, Mario Quintanilla,

323
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
wants his mom to know this was all her fault.

324
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So I'm sure for some people it's easier that way.

325
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, well, that is kind of the appealing part of it in a dark, morbid way.

326
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I would never want to die, ever, for any reason.

327
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's why I'm endless.

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But if I did have to die, I would definitely want certain people to know that it's their fault

329
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and that they could have been better to me in life.

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want them to live with that guilt.

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That would be the best part of being dead.

332
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If I could haunt my own funeral, I'm like,

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
just appear as an apparition above my casket,

334
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
floating over my body with a megaphone,

335
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
sitting like Siam Punk, hovering two feet above my body,

336
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and this is your fault, and your fault, and you did this to me,

337
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
just airing my grievances across the whole funeral parlor.

338
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That would be the best death.

339
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Maybe it could be like a stream or a YouTube video,

340
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
where when I'm dead, play this YouTube video,

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and it's at the funeral, and it's like, fuck you.

342
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh my god.

343
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's Horseshoe Finale 3, essentially.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
One of us could be the first person in history to write a suicide note via YouTube video.

345
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yep.

346
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yep.

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
We can't do it first, right?

348
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Someone's done it, right?

349
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Didn't Amanda Todd do that?

350
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't know if anyone specifically like,

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm talking like set a video up to upload after you're dead.

352
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's a pretty good angle.

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Get a lot of views.

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You guys just, I think David's going to do my monkey finale,

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and you guys just ruined it.

356
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's actually the perfect YouTube video,

357
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
because you wouldn't have to see the comments.

358
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah.

359
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Well, monkey, you gave us your broad stance on suicide,

360
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
but what about you personally?

361
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Because you seem the most interested in actually doing it out of anybody here.

362
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah.

363
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah.

364
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think the greatest comfort.

365
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You don't understand.

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The greatest comfort in life is to accept death.

367
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Being afraid of death, I mean, I see where Digi's coming from.

368
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I used to be in those shoes, and that is horrifying.

369
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's like, oh man, what's the point of all this shit if I'm going to die one day anyway?

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But to accept death and to say, hey,

371
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the worst thing imaginable could happen to me, and it won't matter,

372
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
because I always have suicide in my back pocket.

373
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I think it's a great comfort to know that I always have that available to me,

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and that I am not afraid of it.

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You got that get out of jail free card you can cash anytime.

376
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, that's right.

377
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Well, that's only as far as...

378
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Sorry.

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Go ahead.

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I was going to say, as far as actually doing it, I'm kind of,

381
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm 50-50 right now.

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll toss a coin later and see what happens.

383
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Is it?

384
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I was going to...

385
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, sorry.

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Go ahead, Hippo.

387
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
There's a thing about the suicide.

388
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There's the one...

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
On the one hand, there's people, right, and you don't want to make them sad,

390
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
but there's the other thing, which is the ease of doing it,

391
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
because I think about how easy it would be to kill myself,

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and I'm like, I would have to do certain things like get something and...

393
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I've got a perfect video for you, Hippo, the top 10 most lethal suicide methods.

394
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, but I need, like, I just need something like right next to me.

395
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Like, if suicide implement was right next to me, and it was very easy to do,

396
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
it would be easier to just do it than to go and get a bunch of pills or a gun or a noose.

397
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't even want to go to the bank, let alone like set up some elaborate mousetrap escapade ending in my death.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think if you have the ambition to kill yourself and you have the ambition to do anything else, yeah.

399
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I mean, really, suicide is as easy as walking off a building or jumping off a bridge.

400
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's not really that hard.

401
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Or going into a black neighborhood, if you know what I'm saying.

402
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Sure, walking into a black neighborhood and yell a word of choice and see what happens, I don't know.

403
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Any word will do.

404
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Walk into a black neighborhood and yell, Watermelon isn't even that good!

405
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Walking into a black neighborhood and yell, Moonlight didn't deserve the Oscars.

406
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh no!

407
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What the fuck is Moonlight?

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can see that shit.

409
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I saw La La Land.

410
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I heard that movie about a gay nigga.

411
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I ain't gonna watch that movie about some homo dude sucking some dick all day.

412
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Anyway, monkey, what scares me about people with a philosophy like yours,

413
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
there's nothing more dangerous than a man with nothing to lose.

414
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

415
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, like, I've always found that hard to deal with because of the fact that you don't give a single fuck about what effect your actions will have.

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Like, on some level, I know you have enough restraint to be like, hmm, well, let me make a cost-benefit analysis.

417
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like, I enjoy being in the PCP, I won't fuck all of them over horribly yet, you know?

418
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But you could do it, and you wouldn't care.

419
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Because even if everyone hated you and you lost everything, you'd be like, well, I guess now I get to kill myself.

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Like, it's a win-win.

421
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Digi, I see the basis of your argument, but it harkens back to what my dad would tell me when I told him I was an atheist and that was,

422
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
oh, without God, how do you have a sense of morality, son?

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh boy.

424
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What I say is, well, I mean, just because I'm okay with dying doesn't mean I have no morals.

425
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm not going to be a dick for no reason.

426
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's not that I think you have no morals.

427
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I just think that you would be more willing to do something amoral.

428
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, sure, I would be more willing, but that doesn't mean I'm going to do it.

429
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The real problem with monkey is that he hides behind that mask.

430
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And here at the Daily Bugle, we know not to trust anyone who hides behind a mask.

431
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
He's a menace.

432
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
He can't say anything.

433
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, I know we have another-

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Monkey Jones is a menace.

435
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I want pictures of Monkey Jones.

436
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Parker, get in here!

437
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Pictures of Monkey now!

438
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Monkey, you sound relatively, at this point, you sound like your 50-50-like death is a comfort, but not something you're actively seeking,

439
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
but we do have another suicide boy here who maybe is even further down the line than you.

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Tom, do you want to tell us about suicide?

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Um, okay.

442
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Well, I think suicide is totally okay.

443
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think anyone who vilifies it is an asshole, or at least completely misunderstanding the point.

444
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's like, we kind of touched on a lot of the things I was going to say, that people who say suicide is cowardly,

445
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
or people who think suicide is the worst thing you could do, whatever.

446
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
They're the other ones being selfish.

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's not you.

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And we talked a lot about, like, immortality and stuff, and, like, did you say, like, oh, I want to live forever?

449
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I think if living forever is your antithesis to suicide, you're not actually suicidal,

450
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
because I can't think of anything worse when I'm suicidal than living forever.

451
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Does that just mean subsisting in this hell indefinitely with no expiration?

452
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So, if you're- and, like, if you think immortality is a good thing, you're not actually suicidal.

453
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
If you're still worried about what other people are going to think or be inconvenienced, you're not actually suicidal yet.

454
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You're not there. You're not deep enough into it, because, like, I know my family cares about me.

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I know they'd be devastated if I killed myself, and I cannot bring myself to care enough to put it off the table.

456
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Like, I'm just like, yeah, you guys would be miserable, but you know what?

457
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm miserable being alive, so fuck you.

458
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I mean, they'd be miserable for maybe, like, you know, a year or two, but they'd eventually get over it,

459
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
whereas you would have to suffer for your whole life.

460
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I gotta suffer for another- I mean, I have a terribly unhealthy lifestyle for, like, another 30 years, okay?

461
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You guys have- you have a year, you get numb to it, and whatever, maybe someone, like, starts a foundation

462
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
or some shit, or they get on the news and get money or make a movie deal or some bullshit.

463
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I don't fucking know. Something gay. I don't care.

464
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't- fuck it, you know? Even, like, oh, like, they're sad for a while,

465
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
but then, like, they don't have to pay for my sorry ass because I'm still living at home,

466
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
so, like, it's a net gain for everybody involved.

467
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Tom, I thought you were- you were like me wanting to be in a robot body really badly, though.

468
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I do want to be in a robot body.

469
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Like, when I say that I want to live forever, I don't mean I want to live forever, and it's like this.

470
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I mean, either- I am in- because the- I mean, the idea is that to live forever, something's got to change, right?

471
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Either I become immortal physically, which means that I no longer have the constant fear of anything would kill me,

472
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and I can do whatever the fuck I want. If I'm immortal, I don't have to worry about society at all.

473
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What can they do? They can't stop me, you know?

474
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, they could lock you up, which is, you know-

475
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Well, I can-

476
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Well, what?

477
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Bad.

478
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I mean, sure.

479
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Like, remember that immortal guy from, uh, from Bakano? You know, that one-

480
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh, yeah, well, they cemented him in the lake.

481
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah.

482
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Or that one kid who was immortal who just got tortured forever, over and over again.

483
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Well, that was not fun.

484
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, well, okay, there's things- there's situations I wouldn't want to find myself in,

485
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
but I'm just saying, like, I no longer have to worry about putting food on the table, you know?

486
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So, like, it's not about I have to work a nine to five to live.

487
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm just going to live. I can do anything.

488
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I can just live my passions for the rest of my life.

489
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If you're a robot, you still got to put oil on the table.

490
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Digi, have you seen the movie Groundhog Day with Bill Murray?

491
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I have.

492
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Bill Murray is pretty much immortal in that movie, and it doesn't take long for him to start trying to kill himself.

493
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah, but then he eventually becomes-

494
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Well, first of all, he's immortal in- but living one day over and over again.

495
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Sure.

496
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And, like, over the course of it, he eventually gets past that part and then becomes, like, the perfect man.

497
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Like, by the end of the movie, he's just absolutely- he's the best guy ever, you know?

498
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Wow.

499
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So, Undertale sure is great.

500
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Are you guys aware that that movie is very popular amongst Buddhists?

501
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Because it's, like, a great encapsulation of their idea of reincarnation to get, like, better and better

502
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and improve yourself and eventually obtain Nirvana?

503
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Did not know that.

504
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Which is what he does.

505
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I know that it's in my top five comedies of all time.

506
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's possibly my favorite movie ever, but next to the room.

507
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The suicide part is my favorite part, though.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Because-

509
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No, the Enlightenment is the best part.

510
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
God damn it.

511
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, not unlike Monkey.

512
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I have, like, a deep fascination with suicide.

513
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Like, aesthetically, I just really love the idea of suicide.

514
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Look at this.

515
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Look at this suicide tourist over here.

516
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, it's so cool.

517
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Why don't you go to Hot Topic, kid?

518
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
If you're yourself a joker, dammit.

519
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You know how they have, like, transgender?

520
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
He's like a suicide seer or something.

521
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Suicide seer!

522
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Holy shit, yes!

523
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh my god, that's stupid.

524
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I mean, I was really suicidal when I was a teenager and I was like-

525
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm just- I have a really low threshold for pain.

526
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So the idea of actually causing myself pain was the scariest part.

527
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Like, I wanted to be dead, but the process of making myself dead was too scary, you know?

528
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
If I was gonna kill myself, the only way I would kill myself would be something that would be instantaneously.

529
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because even if I ever get to the point where I'm just like, yeah, I'm definitely gonna fucking do it.

530
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Like, if I, like, took some pills and, like, it took, like, 20 minutes or something to die,

531
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I guarantee you, within that 20 minutes, I'm like, fuck, I changed my mind!

532
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Shit!

533
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

534
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So let me ask a question to the entire panel real quick.

535
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If suicide was as simple as flipping a light switch, and that was it, would you be dead right now?

536
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Did you?

537
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Dude, everyone would be dead.

538
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You think so?

539
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Everyone would have done it.

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No, I would encase that fucking shit in, like, a- don't ever break the glass.

541
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I would fucking put it beneath the earth.

542
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah, I would make sure to hide it.

543
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I would fucking take the treasure map and rip it up and swallow it, so no one could ever find my switch.

544
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, I don't think it's a switch to someone else, because it's a suicide.

545
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
No, no, it's just, like, for you.

546
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
No, I picture it as something that I have to hide and hoard from the rest of the world, because they're all, because everyone's against me.

547
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm hiding it from myself.

548
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I think if there was, like, a, like, a power to just die, like, if that was your superpower,

549
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
the ability to instantaneously not live,

550
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
the only thing stopping you would be how sad you are, and then,

551
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
that would be kind of scary for me.

552
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Dude, that-

553
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I wouldn't want the power to kill myself.

554
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's easier to just get over it and then be happy later.

555
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
If I had that switch, I would fucking-

556
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That switch actually doesn't exist.

557
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

558
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I would hit that shit by accident while I was, like, in a rage throwing bottles around or something.

559
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah.

560
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Well, that's kind of the thing.

561
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's like, if suicide was as easy as, like, your mind actually was totally committed to it, it just instantaneously happened.

562
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, I'd definitely be dead by it.

563
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Well, guys, that's the thing.

564
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That switch does sort of exist, and it's called a handgun.

565
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And the thing is, wherever handguns exist in large numbers,

566
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
suicide rights go way up.

567
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They go massively up.

568
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You're saying we need to ban all guns.

569
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I knew it.

570
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
What?

571
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's what I'm saying.

572
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Now, what I'm saying is the ease with which you can commit suicide

573
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
exponentially increases the likelihood of anyone actually going to do it.

574
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That is how I would kill myself if it was a handgun or some sort of fire.

575
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah.

576
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Are you guys aware of suicide in Greenland?

577
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No.

578
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
The country Greenland.

579
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So, Greenland has, like, a one in five suicide rate.

580
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh, my God.

581
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Like, basically-

582
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Sounds like paradise.

583
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Because the thing is that-

584
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The thing is that, like, your likelihood to commit suicide goes up not only for the ease of doing it,

585
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but also from knowing that other people have done it.

586
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Like, it's a lot like a copycat crime kind of thing.

587
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Like, when you know that, like, it's on the table and it's something that can be done,

588
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
it makes you more likely to think about it and it becomes-

589
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
In Greenland, it became kind of an accidental cultural institution.

590
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It became a meme in Greenland and now we're up with this situation.

591
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Essentially.

592
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because in Greenland, I mean, Greenland's a fucking-

593
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
That's a meme that needs you to die.

594
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Greenland is a frozen wasteland where the days and nights each last, you know, for-

595
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Right.

596
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You know, several days and several nights and, like, people just lose their mind up there

597
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
because it's such a fucking- there's just nothing to do except kill yourself.

598
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And apparently-

599
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's like Virginia Beach.

600
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's not so much that it's a- I think it was that, like, it was one in five people know someone who's killed themselves

601
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and that's why it spreads so much is that everyone has seen someone else do it.

602
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And so they do it.

603
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And just the rates are, like, out of control.

604
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Like, the country will eventually just all be dead because everyone will have killed themselves.

605
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Most popular method, hanging, incidentally.

606
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Really?

607
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yes, hanging.

608
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, so it's not like a doctor-coordinated thing.

609
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's just like an epidemic of people doing it on their own.

610
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I thought it was like-

611
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah, no, it's just-

612
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
A euthanasia thing.

613
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
No, it's just tons and tons of people killing themselves in Greenland.

614
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's a cultural phenomenon.

615
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's literally a meme.

616
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah.

617
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Here, I'll link you.

618
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
There's a whole fucking Wikipedia article just about suicide in Greenland specifically.

619
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That actually might be part of the reason why I wouldn't even start to consider it.

620
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Because, like, I don't really even know that many people who have died in general.

621
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah.

622
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You know, I think someone like Ben would be fine in Greenland because he'd be like,

623
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh, that's a normie meme.

624
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
This whole killing myself thing.

625
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't want to- I mean, tomorrow I'll turn it over.

626
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Dude, he would do that.

627
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He'd be like, you know, I always thought suicide was cool.

628
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But now that I'm seeing all these, like, all these fucking kids on Tumblr posting about how,

629
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh, I'm going to kill myself tomorrow.

630
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
He's telling this to his therapist.

631
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Oh, look at my friend who just killed himself.

632
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Like, dude, get over yourself.

633
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And the therapist is like, No, you shouldn't take your options off the table like that.

634
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You really need to keep your choices open.

635
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So can I come in and give my interpretation of this?

636
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Yes.

637
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Because I think I have a different perspective.

638
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay.

639
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So actually, one interesting thing that you guys didn't mention was that,

640
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So this whole immortality thing, you know, has a certain appeal to it.

641
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But the thing is, the universe will end one day.

642
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It is like in billions or trillions of years, the heat death of the universe is where the universe is continually expanding.

643
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And it will, at one point, it'll get so wide that all like planets will kind of separate from each other.

644
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And they won't be close enough to suns to be able to sustain life is what I'm saying.

645
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So basically, it looks like the universe is doomed for the life within it.

646
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We're in a very temporary position right now.

647
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So you could say that everything we do in life has absolutely no meaning whatsoever because it will not last in the grand scheme.

648
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Right.

649
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And in saying that, by the way, I want to say, by the way, if you're listening to this, do not kill yourself.

650
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't take, don't listen to this.

651
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't endorse this.

652
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Just not take responsibility for you if you kill yourself.

653
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Wait until at least the age where you can drink and then maybe you won't need to.

654
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, okay, I mean, but that aside, here's my actual thoughts on society.

655
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I say don't suffer because Nate wants you to suffer.

656
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I think Nate was doing that for legal reasons.

657
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
No, no, no, I'm saying for legal reasons.

658
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah, that's my only interest here.

659
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Shut the fuck up.

660
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Okay, but that out of the way, definitely kill yourself.

661
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Nate, I can't believe you would say that.

662
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm sowing you.

663
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I think that as some people were saying, we, we live in a society and when you were born into it,

664
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
things are given to you depending on where you live.

665
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
There is a legitimate social contract that you are signing into by being alive.

666
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And that being said, I think that there is some responsibility to not just kill yourself.

667
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think that you, you do have a debt that you sort of need to pay.

668
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Now it's not, it's not that simple.

669
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Wait, wait, wait.

670
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
We're being extorted by society.

671
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
We didn't even choose to be foreign, bro.

672
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I didn't sign on the dotted line.

673
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Can you be on the contract that you didn't choose to sign?

674
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You're putting us in here tonight.

675
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think this is the dumbest thing you've ever said.

676
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, well, well, hear me out.

677
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We were, we were born and we were given lots of stuff by our parents and the society that we live in.

678
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And one of those things is...

679
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Just imagine an African tribe as Nate is saying all these things.

680
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
No.

681
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Okay.

682
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, that's the thing.

683
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's, it's relative to culture.

684
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
All right.

685
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So I can only speak as to like, you know, middle America culture.

686
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That's all I know about.

687
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So if there are places, and that's the thing.

688
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
If there are places where life is suffering and every moment is agony, you should definitely kill yourself.

689
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Sounds like a matter of perspective.

690
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
If it's respected to me, buddy.

691
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
No, it's not.

692
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Name, name for me, Nate, a food you don't like.

693
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Uh, lentils.

694
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah.

695
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay.

696
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Let's say that I order you out of nowhere.

697
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I say, I call you up.

698
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I say, Nate, I just bought you a lifetime supply of lentils that are going to be shipped to your house once a month forever.

699
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm taking care of you forever.

700
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You can live off of this for the rest of your life.

701
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Are you going to feel any gratitude towards me whatsoever?

702
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Um, no.

703
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
No, I see what you're saying.

704
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The answer is no.

705
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So why, like, you know, just because someone has given us everything, it may be important to them that they've given us so much.

706
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But if I don't care about what I've received, if, to me, what I've received is in fact a detriment to me.

707
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like, like pounds and pounds, truckloads of lentils coming to your house every fucking week that now you have to deal with because you don't have space for it.

708
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Uh, you know, you're not going to think, wow, thanks, Digi, for giving me all this food.

709
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You're going to be like, fuck you.

710
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I hate you.

711
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Why did you do this to me?

712
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Let me explain.

713
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm going to kill myself.

714
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That's not the end of my argument.

715
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's not like I don't think you should be allowed to.

716
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's that I think a lot of people commit suicide, obviously, at their lowest point.

717
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And it is an objective fact that their life would improve later on if they continue to live.

718
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Now, I'm not saying that's a good enough reason.

719
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm just saying that this decision they're making is actually against their own best interests, even though it's what they want to do.

720
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't trust people to make the best decisions about their own life.

721
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I simply don't.

722
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I think that what should be done for something like suicide is, go on, if you want to interject.

723
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Well, that's what I was saying about, like, don't do it while you're a teenager because you wouldn't really know.

724
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Right.

725
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Like, I still think-

726
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I don't see you there.

727
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Well, I mean, after a certain age, I could trust people off the 23 or 4 or something.

728
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Like, I think, like, I don't know the data on this, but I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of suicides happen in old people.

729
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And it's usually when you reach the point in your life that you realize it won't get better than this.

730
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
In fact, it will get worse because at some point, that tide turns.

731
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I have a complete plan for everything you're saying right now.

732
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay.

733
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If you want to face your point, go ahead.

734
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

735
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, just that, you know, I think it's one thing to say when you're a teenager, like,

736
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
well, you know, maybe it'll get better when I'm in my 20s.

737
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And you're in your 20s, and you're like, well, maybe in like five years, it'll be getting better.

738
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But then at some point, if things aren't getting better, and in fact, they could be getting worse,

739
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
then you're going to go, is it, is it actually possible?

740
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And then even if things do get better, there does come a time when it's like, maybe what you wanted to do in life is just behind you.

741
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You're just too old.

742
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You're too, you can't, you can't do it anymore.

743
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And, and you've gotten to the point where you're like, I have less time left than I had.

744
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Like, you know, if you're 50, you know that there's less time left in your life than what you've experienced so far.

745
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And if you think, man, things weren't that great, and I don't want to have to deal with more of it, then that's when you're probably the most likely to kill yourself.

746
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And so that's why I think it's, it's, it's more common and makes more sense in older people.

747
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And I can easily see a lot of us going that way in our old age.

748
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I totally see your point.

749
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And, and I largely agree that you should be able to make those decisions.

750
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But see, here's my thing.

751
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Here's what I want.

752
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I think that it should be treated sort of like a legal case where you're submitting a request.

753
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I want to kill myself.

754
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And here is the evidence for why I think that that's an appropriate thing to do.

755
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And, and like this is kind of a fantasy, but what that would be based on is, you know, like your current, you know, living situation.

756
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And it would sort of be based on your perception of your own life, because ultimately what this is about is how happy or miserable you are.

757
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
If you could, what I would want is you to be able to prove that, yes, my life is horrible.

758
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It has been horrible.

759
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:46,000
There's no, like if your brain chemistry is just fucked and it makes you in pain every moment of your life at an unbearable level, you should absolutely be able to kill yourself.

760
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But I don't think that you should be able to just do it at any, well, okay.

761
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I mean, I'm not saying that people don't have free will.

762
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm saying that it should be treated as a crime, because you're doing something that's bad for society as a whole.

763
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
By doing this just on the spur of the moment.

764
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You're the only person I know who's so into bureaucracy that you would bring it to fucking suicide.

765
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Your own is like a really shitty way down there right now.

766
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
All right, okay.

767
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I know it sounds like there's a lot of government red tape involved, but ideally what I would want is there'd be like a fucking app that you put against your brain.

768
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And it just brain scans your current life, determines where you are, where you're going.

769
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The psychopaths, in other words.

770
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, I don't have to say the simple system, Nate endorses, that's the gayest thing ever, you need to go die.

771
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Anyway, you need to kill yourself.

772
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No, seriously.

773
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
The problem is there are tons of things that people do all the time that are terrible choices, but are allowed to do them anyways.

774
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Like doing this podcast as someone who's suicidal.

775
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Probably not the best idea, but I'm allowed to do it anyway.

776
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Should I have to hold a hearing with everybody just like, should you be talking about suicide?

777
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I don't know if that's the best idea.

778
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I mean, I'm obviously only talking about one thing here.

779
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
There needs to be a foolproof system of determining whether a person's life has value or if they're just an evil sack of shit, and that system should be me.

780
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I should be the judge, the jury, I should be the arbiter of whether people deserve to die, because I'm the only one I trust to make that decision with anyone's life.

781
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I mean, keep in mind, I'm also basically pro eugenics, but I'm talking classical eugenics, you know, where we're trying to breed the best of the best,

782
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and just let the people with subpar genes just be sterilized and weeded out of society because we don't need them DNA.

783
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I completely believe that you do support that.

784
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Of course.

785
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't believe that to me.

786
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
When you say classical eugenics, you talk about Hitler Youth or...

787
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Before Hitler fucked it up, before Hitler gave it a bad name, you know?

788
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Three Hitler eugenics.

789
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
There were good times, there were good times for eugenics.

790
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Eugenics was pretty big in America for a while back in like the 20s and 30s.

791
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You know, someone was just telling me, and maybe it was, I don't forget if it was you Digi, that Planned Parenthood was started to like exterminate black people?

792
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Is that accurate?

793
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Guys, I don't know about that.

794
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I've never heard that before.

795
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Someone was telling me that it was started, it was like a eugenics program.

796
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I can't believe people want to defund Planned Parenthood.

797
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The black birth rate.

798
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Oh my god, yeah.

799
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Nate, it sounds to me...

800
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
By the way, this is completely non-racial.

801
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I just want the best of the best to continue to be the best of the best, and everyone who's shitty just go away.

802
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Here, Nate, listen up.

803
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It sounds to me like you're trying to develop some sort of standard that somebody has to pass in order to be able to commit suicide,

804
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:21,000
but the truth of the matter is, there's only one thing that every single person who has committed suicide has in common,

805
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and that's that they wanted to commit suicide.

806
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That's the only standard that there needs to be.

807
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
No, I disagree, because I think you can paint a picture.

808
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
How can you disagree with that?

809
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That's the only thing.

810
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Okay, that's fine, but I'm talking about how to decide, but you can paint a picture.

811
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You can't deny that people, most of them are stupid and don't know what they want.

812
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So, if you want to kill yourself, why not?

813
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah, I think we're undervaluing free will.

814
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Because if I get entertainment out of you being here, I'm talking to you specifically, and no one's allowed to kill themselves because I'm the only person who matters!

815
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, but if we've already established that there's no objective point of the universe, that it's all pointless, then who fucking cares about that?

816
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I mean, Tom, Tom is talking about free will and all that, but will Tom, we already have restrictions against, you can't do things that hurt other people or hurt other things.

817
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We know that suicide does cause damage to other people and society.

818
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So we should make it illegal to die at all then.

819
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It already is illegal.

820
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah, it's illegal.

821
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Not allowed to get hit by a bus, not allowed to die at all days, not allowed to get cancer.

822
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I think the only reason that suicide is illegal right now is because it was a conspiracy by the church back in the day to keep the money rolling in,

823
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
because everyone was miserable back in the few days and they're like, well, Jesus said you can't kill yourself,

824
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
so you have to keep paying or give us money.

825
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm open to an evaluation of the law.

826
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
That's perfectly fine with me.

827
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I have no problem with deciding that, but this is what I think.

828
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I just think that everyone is a lawyer or a soldier of humanity and that you have to submit a proposal.

829
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Even if your system was implemented and even if there was an objective evaluation, it's like, your life is good enough that you don't have to die,

830
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
because I'm pretty sure if I was subjected to this objective measurement, my life would probably be good enough.

831
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But it's not about what my life is, it's about how I perceive those things.

832
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Your perceptions are guided by emotions, not by logic, and I think the decision to kill yourself is not technically a logical one,

833
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
because it's not about how your life is, it's about how your life feels, how you feel.

834
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Dude, that was the first thing I said.

835
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The first thing I said is that it's based on determining how the person views their own life,

836
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and if they're suffering at a significant level, then they should be allowed to kill themselves.

837
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Why can't they be the determinants of that?

838
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Because I do not trust people to make this decision.

839
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Well, it's not your decision to make.

840
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Nate, I have a counterpoint, a pragmatic counterpoint to your thing.

841
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
People who are killing themselves, largely it's because they're depressed and sad,

842
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and people who are depressed and sad often are not very productive to society anyway,

843
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
they're just sort of existing in life, they're doing a menial job and they're just sort of slouching around

844
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and not really adding much to society.

845
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I think the fact that we have a population problem, like there's too many people on the earth for the resources,

846
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I think if people who are not really doing anything except existing in a sad state kill themselves,

847
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
it doesn't really affect society as much as somebody who's really productive and great for everyone,

848
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
like someone who's really making a lot of good things happen.

849
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
If you're arguing for eugenics, what's the worst thing that people who want to fucking kill themselves

850
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
and don't do anything, shouldn't they be fucking gone?

851
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
When I say I want eugenics, I'm talking about the future as in what we should do to breed people selectively,

852
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
not killing anybody.

853
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But why are we talking about how it affects society as a whole?

854
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That doesn't fucking matter.

855
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's not a social question at all.

856
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's about the individual.

857
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Like always, this conversation has gotten way too big and broad as all of our conversations do.

858
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
We need to bring it back.

859
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
The fact is, I want less people on the planet and I especially want less depressed people on the planet

860
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
because depressed people are fucking annoying.

861
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
This is an objective fact.

862
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I think that in general, we give way too much benefit of the doubt and leeway to depressed people

863
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
or people who quote unquote suffer from depression or are suicidal because nine times out of ten,

864
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
they're just insufferable assholes.

865
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And like, you can't help a depressed person.

866
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You can't tell them anything.

867
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Depressed people don't fucking listen to anything.

868
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
They just want to be depressed and they want to drag everyone down with them.

869
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So I think that they should, you know, if you want to kill yourself, please go away and do it.

870
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And I want less people in the world.

871
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Now see, when we colonize Mars, we're going to need those people to ship off,

872
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
to just take up space there and build things.

873
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We're going to need this extra population.

874
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I don't want them to just die.

875
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We need these human capital.

876
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We'll have all robots to do it.

877
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And then the robots will get depressed.

878
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So we need people to build the robots.

879
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Can we transition into the mumkey suicide pool?

880
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Everyone will become robots and then we'll be, and then we'll be all,

881
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
the only thing we'll have to worry about is how cute our robot designs are.

882
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And we can design cute robot designs.

883
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I would like to be a little sphere with a little eye, like a thick camera in the front.

884
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Shout out to Near Automata with the cutest robot designs of all time.

885
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Now I do have to say to transition us.

886
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Sorry.

887
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah. Did you guys still want to do the mumkey suicide pool to predict how and when I'll kill myself

888
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and whoever is closest to like,

889
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
podcast just to prove a point.

890
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
That's right here.

891
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
No, we have to announce so they know so that everybody knows.

892
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'm putting all my money down.

893
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I'll put.

894
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
No, I meant that was my guess.

895
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
He's going to kill himself.

896
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
All my money down, dude.

897
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That you will never do it.

898
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I don't have any money, so I'm just going to put my name on it.

899
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think everybody should put in like 20 bucks.

900
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I would put down $100 that you never kill yourself.

901
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Oh shit.

902
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

903
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Going all in.

904
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's a pretty bold guess.

905
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
It's going to take a long time for you to,

906
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
to, to cash in on that one.

907
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That's fine with me.

908
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Because see, as long, every moment that I, that continues to be the case,

909
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I'll just feel like I'm winning.

910
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So it's an extra boon to my day.

911
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I can't let Nate win.

912
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I have to do it now.

913
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm putting, I'm putting $100 on age 42 by way, by way of, by way of God.

914
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
That's very specific, but that's the most popular way anyway.

915
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah.

916
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I don't, I don't know.

917
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's, it's, it's weird to, I don't, I don't want you to die.

918
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It's not good.

919
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But if you had to guess logically.

920
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You don't have to participate in this.

921
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I can make all the money and like, if my only competition is Nate,

922
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I'm just commenting on the idea that we're, we're, you know, just even discussing it.

923
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah.

924
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't like it.

925
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay, Jess.

926
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm going to put it, I'm going to put it all on, you know, whatever age you are currently

927
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
suicide by arguing with me in the chat too much.

928
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That's pretty much already happened.

929
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Just so everybody knows it, I will be cashing in on this at Mumkey's funeral.

930
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I will be hitting you all up while you're all crying over his casket.

931
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Actually, you know what?

932
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I, I'm not going to cry over Mumkey's casket.

933
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Come on.

934
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
No.

935
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I don't think Jess would even bother to come.

936
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm going to, I would come.

937
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I, someone would have to pass out like the party.

938
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, you'll come when you hear that I'm dead.

939
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Actually, I'm going to put it all on that Mumkey will never commit suicide.

940
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I don't think he's got the balls to do it.

941
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You can't copy me.

942
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
He's calling you out.

943
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
He's calling you out.

944
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You see these, they know, they know you're all, you're all talk, Mumkey.

945
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You're all talk.

946
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
He's all talk.

947
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Very little gunplay.

948
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
What's even your history with guns and ropes and.

949
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
There's only eight of these here.

950
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So did you guess 42?

951
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't believe you've ever seen a rope in your life.

952
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Did you down for age 42, Tom for right after this podcast and everybody else says never.

953
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Yep.

954
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I don't say anything's so basically definitive.

955
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So are we basing this on like whoever's closest?

956
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Like if you kill yourself at like 30, does Tom win?

957
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But if it's at like 38, then I win.

958
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
No, Tom is so specific with immediately after this podcast that I think if I do it tomorrow, did you still wins?

959
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
It's got to be like the closest without going over like prices, right?

960
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Okay.

961
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Can I bet that I will kill Mumkey?

962
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah.

963
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Go ahead.

964
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Of course.

965
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Assisted suicide like Sigmund Freud.

966
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So if we're done with that, I do have one other suicide related topic I wanted to address to the panel if that's okay.

967
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
If you could force any person.

968
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm just thinking about me showing up at your house on your 42nd birthday with a stool and a rope and being like Mumkey.

969
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I need that hundred dollars.

970
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I need that 500 bucks.

971
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:01,000
If you could force, and this is going to seem weird with the word suicide, but if you could force any living person on earth to commit suicide, who would it be and why?

972
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And you can't say Ben St. That's too obvious.

973
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Just one?

974
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Yeah, just one.

975
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Oh boy.

976
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
You got to pick your prime target I guess.

977
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
That's like Sophie's choice for me.

978
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Trying to decide which person should die.

979
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'm surprised you didn't go straight for the Trumper just to make all your...

980
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
He's going to be out of here eventually.

981
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
No, too many people would be happy about it.

982
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah, they don't deserve to be happy about it.

983
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Is that your standard for things that are likely to happen?

984
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
If so many people would be happy, it just will not happen.

985
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It's not going to happen.

986
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It's good. It won't happen. I know that much.

987
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's fucking John Tron.

988
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
John Tron!

989
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Agreed.

990
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
What the fuck?

991
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Just to make the paid stop for the rest of us.

992
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That would be good. I would like that.

993
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
No, I would not like that. I mean, I wouldn't like anyone dying except someone I don't know.

994
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So just some random guy I don't care about.

995
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I'll force him by...

996
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'll find a pen pal and then force him by writing him a note saying,

997
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
kill yourself and hopefully he'll do it.

998
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I've got one.

999
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I can think of a few people but I don't want to name them on stream because it would just be cruel and controversial.

1000
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Because they're all real.

1001
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
No, but I can think of several like real people who I've interacted with that I'm like,

1002
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
if he was dead I think we'd all be better off.

1003
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Commenters and like anime avatars on Twitter right now who I wish would die.

1004
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah.

1005
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh yeah, yeah. I'd force anime to commit suicide.

1006
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Anime.

1007
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Nobody's going to opt out for David Clegg?

1008
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I want him alive. I need more Clegg. I need more of the circus in my life.

1009
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
No one fucking cares about egg.

1010
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Egg?

1011
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
There was this very...

1012
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You know, there's people in my life who like I wouldn't want to commit suicide only because I would want to kill them myself.

1013
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Right.

1014
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Like put my hands around their throats and watch the fear in their eyes as the light leaves them.

1015
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
This is like a death note essentially.

1016
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's like a death note. You make them hang themselves.

1017
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's like your, you know, the scenario is that the person you want to be dead you just hear about them.

1018
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh, you hear that guy committed suicide and you're like, huh.

1019
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Like that would be most of the time it would be the, you just go, huh, yeah, well.

1020
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I think good.

1021
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Back to watching anime or whatever.

1022
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Like it's just, it wouldn't really be much of an event.

1023
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
There's a few people I know of who I would like it if they committed suicide and it's not unlikely to happen.

1024
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So like, I feel like this is not even a hypothetical. I'm going to experience this in my life.

1025
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Thank God.

1026
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Is it me?

1027
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Is it Maddox?

1028
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
No, Maddox doesn't seem suicidal. That dude's full of himself.

1029
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Hmm, yeah.

1030
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So nobody's opting for like people who are running prisoner of war camps or like ISIS leaders.

1031
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I don't know any of them. I don't know who they are.

1032
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Well, the thing was, I don't have to know their names.

1033
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Someone's just going to step in and take their place.

1034
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
How would you be able to pick the one guy out of all those like big targets that would make a difference?

1035
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
There's some research. There's like one modern game stalling.

1036
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Like if you kill, like it's like if you kill Trump, you just end up with Pence as president. Nothing changes.

1037
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I wouldn't kill Trump.

1038
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
If you kill anybody in a position of power, there's just going to be the guy under them who does the same thing.

1039
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
There is one person, there is one person who I think would make a significant difference if he died.

1040
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I think if Vladimir Putin died, Russia would lose a lot of its strength, which would reduce its influence on the world,

1041
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
which might put America in a better position.

1042
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
There's no change over here. Fucking risk. I'm talking about risk.

1043
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,000
The kinds of people I'm thinking of are more people who are just drains on society, who are not offering anything

1044
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and are only causing problems for people, and if they were gone, it would just literally make everyone involved's lives better.

1045
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Doctor Wolf is the one. There he is.

1046
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Well, you know, you say that, but he's such a psychological fortress of a man that there's nothing you could do

1047
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
to make him ever commit such a self-harming act.

1048
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I hope he doesn't hear that, even though I don't really care about him.

1049
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Somebody will go tell him that I wished that he would be dead.

1050
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm convinced that everyone on my Kingdom Hearts video saying that they understand the fucking story better than I do

1051
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
is actually just one guy on multiple accounts, so if that guy died, it would really make my life much better

1052
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and we could stop pretending that there are people who understand Kingdom Hearts better than me.

1053
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I've done the research people. You don't get it. You do not understand.

1054
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
God, the things, they don't, they say these things like they get it, but they don't.

1055
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
We're on that topic of commenters, because this is not a commenter cast.

1056
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Any fucking person who fucking starts tweeting at me and starts hurling insults and trying to piss me off

1057
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and then when I insult them back, they tuck tail and act like I'm harassing them.

1058
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Anyone who's ever done that, you should definitely fucking kill yourself.

1059
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You see, it was just some banter on the internet.

1060
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It was just banning you. It was just a joke.

1061
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Me and Hipple were saying how we need to do a Twitter rules PCP at some point.

1062
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It gets to the point where it's becoming a thing.

1063
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah, I guess. It could be a bit different from commenter rules, because it's slightly different.

1064
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's basically the same thing, though.

1065
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I mean, we can use it to bring up things that we didn't mention in commenter rules originally, so there's things to discuss there, I'm sure.

1066
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Speaking of Twitter, Nate, do we have any Twitter questions for this episode?

1067
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, hold on. I don't want to wrap us up yet.

1068
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I thought we were off topic so much that suicide was dead.

1069
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
We killed suicide. We did a great service.

1070
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We've talked a lot about suicide as a social construct and the broad sense of whether we do it,

1071
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
but again, everyone laughed off when I said this earlier, but I do find suicide really fascinating,

1072
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
just in the sense of it as an idea.

1073
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's just something to think about a lot and to find an interest in.

1074
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I guess because it's death.

1075
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I mean, what is more interesting in the world?

1076
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I think I honestly legitimately think killing yourself is the bravest thing you can do.

1077
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I'm not saying that I want to believe it.

1078
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Tom, have you ever asked out a girl before?

1079
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I've asked out multiple women. I've never killed myself,

1080
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
so I feel like I just proved my own point.

1081
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah, that's true. Fair point.

1082
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's not easy. Death is the one thing a living person cannot experience.

1083
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It's the most mysterious thing in the world.

1084
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I think people should have a right to kill themselves, I guess, but I don't think it's brave or courageous in any way.

1085
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I think there's a difference in saying it's brave versus courageous.

1086
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Something that gets you to be celebrated, but I think considering human beings

1087
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and all living things are programmed on an instinctual level to try and continue to survive

1088
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
so they can pass on their seed and shit and procreate,

1089
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I think to stare at that face instinct in the face is like, no, fuck it, and do it anyway.

1090
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
We're also programmed on an instinctual level to rape.

1091
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Does that mean I'm courageous for not rape?

1092
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Oh, I guess you're right, it does make you courageous.

1093
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Hippo, to go back against what you just said.

1094
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Every day that I don't rape, I give myself a pat on the back.

1095
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I'm a brave fucking man for not raping all the people I want to.

1096
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I would guess that there are millions of people on earth right now who have attempted suicide,

1097
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
so we can't say that there are no living people who haven't tried to kill themselves.

1098
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
No, I would never say that.

1099
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
No, I wasn't saying that. I was just saying that the reason that he finds it fascinating,

1100
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
the reason I think about it a lot as well, and Victor does as well,

1101
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
he likes suicide thinking about the implications of it and what would happen.

1102
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It's interesting because nobody fucking knows, nobody could tell you what happens afterwards.

1103
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's just like the most untapped, the bravely go where no man has gone before while they have,

1104
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
but they didn't come back.

1105
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I guess it's like, because the two things that fascinate me the most are suicide and immortality.

1106
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I guess it's because both of them are exactly that.

1107
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
They're both the unknown.

1108
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
They're the two things that I assumably could never know,

1109
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:16,000
because if I think, okay, I'm going to live for, let's say, 70, 80, even 100 years,

1110
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I can completely predict what I'm going to be doing in that time.

1111
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I can just say, oh well, for the next 80 years, here's what I meant 80 in total,

1112
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
not 80 from today on.

1113
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
If I think about it that way, it's like, well, I can kind of understand where technology seems to be going,

1114
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
where the world's going to be going.

1115
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'm going to eat, sleep, and shit.

1116
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
That's going to be my life.

1117
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing for the last 25 years, for the next 60 years,

1118
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:52,000
but if I killed myself, it's a total unknown, and I'm assuming there'll just be nothing,

1119
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
but I don't know what that's like.

1120
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
If I lived forever, that's also a total unknown.

1121
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I don't know where the eventuality is going to take us.

1122
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I guess that's why those two things are so interesting, is that it's just a different world to think about.

1123
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The closest I've ever come to killing myself was the other day when I was reviewing my 401k account

1124
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and realized I'm already planning for retirement and the end of my life,

1125
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and just thought, my god, my life is all mapped out.

1126
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
There is nothing new to be discovered here.

1127
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That's when I was really like, there is no point in my existence, but then I pulled it back in.

1128
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I think the most interesting thing you could do instead of killing yourself,

1129
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
if you're like, oh, nothing new is going to happen,

1130
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
is just to take all your money and go fly somewhere that you don't know and just go to a total weird place.

1131
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I guess that's what a midlife crisis is, is that realization?

1132
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That does bring up one of, I think, the most useful things to anti-suicide sentiments that I've heard.

1133
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I don't know how well it actually works as a pick-me-up because I've never been suicidal,

1134
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
but I imagine if I was, it might help.

1135
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You said something about your life being mapped out,

1136
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
but of course it really isn't just because you're planning for your retirement or whatever.

1137
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It reminds me of a line on Game of Thrones when Tyrion says that he prefers life to death

1138
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
because life is more full of possibilities than death.

1139
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Like, anything could happen tomorrow.

1140
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And it also, you know, a similar sentiment I saw once on like,

1141
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
it's like a 4chan meme that gets passed around a lot of like a guy arguing against suicide.

1142
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And he, just like random anon, he raised a really interesting point.

1143
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:36,000
If you're at the end of your rope and you want to die, then obviously you don't give a shit about anything anymore.

1144
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So why not just fucking do something? Anything?

1145
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Go out and live. Go get on a plane and go somewhere and start a whole new life.

1146
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Instead of ending your one life, just end it in the sense that you're starting a new life.

1147
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Go spend all your money on a plane ticket or some shit.

1148
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It's funny to bring this up because I was going to say that.

1149
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
A lot of times when I think about killing myself, it's like,

1150
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
oh, maybe I could just like go like full ham and just do whatever the fuck I want.

1151
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
If you have nothing left, just build something new.

1152
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Instead of just pulling the trigger.

1153
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Makes sense.

1154
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I feel like that's just like the long way of killing yourself.

1155
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I think the biggest reason, I think most people who kill themselves when they're relatively young

1156
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
do it because they feel trapped.

1157
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
They feel like they can't reasonably escape this situation,

1158
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
but they usually haven't explored other options or just don't understand the other options.

1159
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Because kids are fucking dumb and they don't know anything.

1160
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
You know, I think the best way to kill yourself is the long way,

1161
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
with drugs and alcohol and fast food and living.

1162
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Yeah.

1163
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
If you want to die, if you want to die so bad, just wait.

1164
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Yeah, you'll get there eventually.

1165
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And you might have some fun along the way if you stick with it.

1166
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You never know.

1167
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I didn't want to present too much of an anti-suicide message in this podcast

1168
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
because this is the suicide podcast,

1169
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
but ultimately I think that the only kind of suicide that seems reasonable to me

1170
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
is when you're old.

1171
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
When you're really old and you just physically can't do it anymore

1172
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
or if you're like, you know, if I was in a situation where I...

1173
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
If you're like crippled or like you're covered in like severe burns,

1174
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
like someone said your mom was really fat or something.

1175
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
If I was trapped in a body that could not move or express myself in any way

1176
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and was just trapped there, emotionalist, I would want to die.

1177
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I would not want to continue that.

1178
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Pull the fucking plug on me.

1179
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But like, if I always think, as someone who calls myself a gonzo journalist,

1180
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I always think of Hunter S. Thompson, who killed himself when he was in like his 60s.

1181
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And he had said that...

1182
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
He had said that like he always thought of suicide as empowering

1183
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
because it's the one thing he absolutely had control over in his life.

1184
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
He got to decide whether or not he dies.

1185
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And so he didn't...

1186
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I mean, he held on to it for a long time.

1187
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You know, he lasted until his old age

1188
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and then he was finally at a point where he was like,

1189
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
well, I did it.

1190
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I mean, the guy, he had plenty of money.

1191
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
He did lots of things.

1192
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
He went around.

1193
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
He did every fucking drug known to man,

1194
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
fucking, you know, drink every kind of alcohol he got.

1195
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
He did all the...

1196
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
He did the fucking love Ebo Hem lifestyle.

1197
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And finally by the time he was 60, he was like,

1198
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
yeah, I guess that's it, you know, checked out.

1199
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And I'm like, yeah, cool.

1200
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You know, 60 years is a pretty good amount of time.

1201
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
It's a good book-ended career of life, you know.

1202
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Fuck retirement.

1203
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Retirement sounds like hell.

1204
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I never want to stop doing bullshit.

1205
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
What is retirement, but just like waiting to die?

1206
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Exactly.

1207
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That's exactly what it is.

1208
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I mean, if you can do it in cool ways,

1209
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
like my parents are getting ready to retire

1210
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
and they've saved up a ton of money

1211
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
and they're gonna like travel and do things.

1212
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I don't even see that as retirement.

1213
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Like, you know, like there's retirement from your job,

1214
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
which means, which can just mean I go out

1215
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and start, I don't know, building things in the woods,

1216
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
build a log cabin in the middle of the woods

1217
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
and live off the land.

1218
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That sounds badass, you know.

1219
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
But like, if your retirement is like sitting in a home

1220
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
literally doing the same thing every day,

1221
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
like playing bingo and waiting to die,

1222
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
then like fuck it, you know?

1223
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
If your retirement is doing all the shit

1224
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
that you wanted to do for like 50 fucking years

1225
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and only now you can do it, cool.

1226
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I guess that sounds great, yeah.

1227
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah, that's legit.

1228
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That's arguably better than what you were doing

1229
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
the previous 20, 30 years.

1230
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah, though I think people have an intrinsic desire

1231
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
to feel useful that can be a problem

1232
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
when they retire or something.

1233
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You know, Nate brought up a point about

1234
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
feeling like people shouldn't kill themselves

1235
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
because on some level you do owe the people around you something

1236
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
and everyone kind of shed on it,

1237
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
but I don't really disagree with them.

1238
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And I was thinking, I mean, I do think that,

1239
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
you know, that generally most people should kill themselves

1240
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
because most people are bad.

1241
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And I definitely would not want to discourage any piece of shit

1242
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
from killing themselves who wants to go for it.

1243
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But, um, and I do think that it's selfish of people to say

1244
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
you killed yourself that's bad for me because you made me sad.

1245
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But on the other hand, you know,

1246
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I do feel like maybe you could have someone who depends on you

1247
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
who you don't even realize depends on you

1248
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
because you don't know who you're affecting.

1249
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You have no idea the ripple effect.

1250
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I actually have a counterpoint to my point

1251
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
about how everyone should kill themselves

1252
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
because I actually have a personal experience with this

1253
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and now when I was four years old,

1254
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
my brother committed suicide.

1255
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And, you know, shit, I, uh,

1256
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I don't know, I think about it sometimes,

1257
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
like how would my life be different if he were still around

1258
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
because I didn't know either of my brothers

1259
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
because one of them died and the other one was so messed up from it

1260
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
that he sort of drifted off.

1261
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So, you know, is it fair to me that I didn't get to know him

1262
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
or either of my brothers?

1263
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You know, maybe that's why I didn't know my dad as well.

1264
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You know, he didn't, I don't fucking know.

1265
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So, maybe he had a responsibility to me

1266
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and he checked out too early.

1267
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I'll never know.

1268
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I know how old he was at the time.

1269
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Uh, he was fucking 17, I think.

1270
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I agree with you here.

1271
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
It's pretty young.

1272
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Like, when Nate was saying this stuff earlier,

1273
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I was thinking of it more in terms of just your parents

1274
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
and that, like, that idea that society gave you things

1275
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
but you didn't necessarily want it.

1276
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But in terms of responsibility, I do think that, like,

1277
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I always got pissed off.

1278
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
There was this book called The Awakening

1279
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
that we had to read in school.

1280
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
That was, like, this feminist book about...

1281
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Oh, the feminist bit? Yeah.

1282
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I have that on my fucking shelf.

1283
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's about this woman who...

1284
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It's her favorite book.

1285
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I hate it.

1286
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
It's about this woman who basically is unsatisfied

1287
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
with her life.

1288
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
She's got, like, two kids.

1289
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Her husband's cheating on her.

1290
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
She, I think, cheats back on him, but it doesn't...

1291
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
She ends up killing herself at the end.

1292
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And I just remember reading it

1293
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
and, like, the way they present it is, like,

1294
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
her suicide was empowering or something,

1295
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
like, that she took things into her own hands.

1296
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Smash that patriarch you do.

1297
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And I was, like...

1298
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
You do kill yourself.

1299
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I was, like, you've got two fucking kids.

1300
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
There was no way I could possibly respect this decision

1301
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
because those kids are going to be fucked

1302
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
without a mom for the rest of their life.

1303
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
There's definitely a thing about feminism itself,

1304
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
because it puts, like, not just feminism,

1305
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
but, like, a lot of SJW stuff is putting, like,

1306
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
individual liberties over social health

1307
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
and, like, the well-being of society.

1308
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And I don't agree with that at all.

1309
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I was just, like, you know what?

1310
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Your life sucks.

1311
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
But live for the fucking kids,

1312
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
because maybe they'll have an OK life.

1313
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
If you got kids, if you chose to have kids,

1314
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
you have a definite obligation to those kids

1315
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
to not fucking kill yourself.

1316
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah, but this takes place so far in the past.

1317
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I don't know if she had a choice.

1318
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I mean, we're...

1319
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
OK, well, that's a real case.

1320
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
We've all been presenting, you know, arguments for or against

1321
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
your, like, why it's OK or why it's good or why it's bad.

1322
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But really, like most things that we talk about

1323
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
on this podcast, the truest answer is the simplest answer,

1324
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
which is that it's different in every single possible circumstance.

1325
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You can't say for sure that suicide is OK or not OK,

1326
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
because it's different.

1327
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Some people are just shit,

1328
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and they deserve to be wiped off the earth

1329
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and they should kill themselves.

1330
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Some people don't have anyone,

1331
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and they know their life isn't going to get better,

1332
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
so they can kill themselves if they want.

1333
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Some people, they don't even realize

1334
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
that people need them around,

1335
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
so they probably shouldn't.

1336
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
You know, it's different everywhere.

1337
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And I just think that the true moral of the story

1338
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
for everyone out there listening,

1339
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
if you're suicidal or depressed,

1340
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
is just stop being a faggot.

1341
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
That's all there is to it.

1342
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's not being a whiny little bitch.

1343
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Whether that means finally do it or not.

1344
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

1345
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Whatever stop being a faggot entails, do that.

1346
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Whatever to you feels like you've stopped being a faggot.

1347
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Do that.

1348
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Someone in my life tried to kill themselves once,

1349
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
and I never thought that they actually thought it through

1350
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
in the slightest.

1351
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I just felt like they were just having a bad day,

1352
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
decided to try to kill themselves.

1353
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yeah, and people do do that.

1354
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Some people do, like, impulsively.

1355
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And I'm not saying this like that all the time.

1356
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I'm agreeing with you.

1357
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's nuanced.

1358
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It depends on the situation.

1359
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I've known people who have told me stories

1360
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
usually from their teenage years,

1361
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
because teenagers are fucking mentally retarded.

1362
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Stories of how they just impulsively said,

1363
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I want to die and just started swallowing pills.

1364
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
People do that impulsively and not even think about it.

1365
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That's why it needs to be obstacles in the way

1366
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
to kill yourself.

1367
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I definitely agree with you, Nate,

1368
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
that you can't trust people to ever make the right decision

1369
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
about their own lives or anything else,

1370
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
because people are pathetic and stupid.

1371
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That's my main context.

1372
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Kind of think about it.

1373
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
We didn't even ask this,

1374
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
but has anybody in here attempted suicide?

1375
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Because I did.

1376
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I did.

1377
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
That's true.

1378
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
When I was eight, I tried the ultimate suicide.

1379
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Some of you have probably heard this story before,

1380
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
but it was the greatest suicide attempt of all time,

1381
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
because I was getting bullied at school

1382
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and I was really unhappy with it,

1383
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
and so I was crying,

1384
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and I went up to my brother's shades room,

1385
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
and he had this line of beanie babies all across the walls

1386
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
that were held up with clothespins,

1387
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
like these weird, fat clothespins

1388
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that had little nubs on them.

1389
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I was like,

1390
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
alright, I'm going to suffocate myself,

1391
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
so I put a clothespin on my nose

1392
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and then another one on my lips,

1393
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
and I was like,

1394
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'll suffocate myself.

1395
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Impressive.

1396
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Unfortunately, the clothespins were really painful,

1397
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
and I couldn't, again,

1398
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
low threshold for pain,

1399
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
so I probably had them on for 20 seconds,

1400
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
and I was like,

1401
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
this hurts,

1402
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and I took them off.

1403
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
A suicide attempt is a suicide attempt,

1404
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and they say that if you've tried it before,

1405
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
you're more likely to do it again later,

1406
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and that knowledge has haunted me forever.

1407
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Don't give him any ideas.

1408
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
He's addicted to killing himself with clothespins.

1409
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You know, I have often, actually,

1410
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
now that I think about it,

1411
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I've often committed the slow draining spiritual suicide

1412
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
of asking a girl out and telling a girl that I like her.

1413
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I think asking a girl out is the most fiery inferno

1414
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
a man can put himself through,

1415
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
trying to ask a girl out.

1416
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
If you come through alive on the other side,

1417
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
you are infinitely stronger than you went in.

1418
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It is the truest achievement of the Buddhist ideal

1419
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
of destroying the self.

1420
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Exactly.

1421
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
It doesn't exist anymore.

1422
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
One time, I went outside in the cold,

1423
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and I had the idea to just go into the woods

1424
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
and stay there until I died,

1425
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
but I was too cold, so I went back.

1426
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
That's exactly the kind of thing I would have tried to do,

1427
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
or maybe even did and forgot, I don't know.

1428
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It sounds like a very familiar scenario to me.

1429
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I don't mean to diminish the seriousness of those,

1430
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
but thinking about those examples,

1431
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I probably did try something like that.

1432
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
You should diminish the seriousness of mine,

1433
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
because it's hilarious.

1434
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Because it's an eight-year-old kid

1435
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
putting clothespins on his fucking mouth and nose,

1436
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
because he thinks he can kill himself that way.

1437
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
My dad told me about one time when he was a kid,

1438
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
he just held his breath,

1439
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
because he was really mad at his mom,

1440
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and just would not breathe for like...

1441
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
He turned blue and eventually passed out,

1442
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
or gave up, or something.

1443
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Good effort.

1444
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Yeah, it was impressive.

1445
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
That's what made his sperm retarded,

1446
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and resulted in me...

1447
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
resulted in the best guy ever.

1448
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You just need a little bit of retardation

1449
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
to balance out this incredible intellect.

1450
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
You have to balance.

1451
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I got a pee.

1452
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Why don't you go, and we'll get to the questions,

1453
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
and we'll see what's going on.

1454
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
He committed suicide in the bathroom right now.

1455
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
What if he just died?

1456
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Yeah, what a funny thing that would be.

1457
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
That'd be a goof.

1458
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I pray that he does.

1459
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Twenty bucks that he does it.

1460
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Okay, here we go.

1461
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I pulled some of the questions out ahead of time.

1462
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Before we get to the questions,

1463
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I just want to make it clear that I hope

1464
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
that nobody in this podcast dies,

1465
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
or commits suicide,

1466
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
because I think they're all...

1467
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I don't believe you.

1468
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Really smart and genius.

1469
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Even Mumki, who I hate like 40% of the time,

1470
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
is a genius and a wonderful creative mind

1471
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
who should live forever,

1472
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
just like everyone is in this channel.

1473
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Jesse, did you wait to say that

1474
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
as soon as did you was out a little bit?

1475
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Is that why?

1476
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I was going to make the same joke about Ben,

1477
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
because he's not here right now.

1478
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Yes, well done.

1479
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Okay, let's get into these questions here.

1480
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Here's a goofball one.

1481
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Casey at CaseySnap asks,

1482
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
if you had to pick a spirit animal,

1483
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
what would it be?

1484
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Everyone's thought about this question.

1485
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I'd be a dog.

1486
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I got a dog spirit animal.

1487
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I think I know Hippo's answer.

1488
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It's a frog.

1489
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's a frog.

1490
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Frogs are cute and small and funny.

1491
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You weren't going to say that, you lying boy.

1492
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Oh my...

1493
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I just...

1494
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
We've already...

1495
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Most of us already have an animal-like guy

1496
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
associated with us.

1497
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
I just realized that.

1498
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Walrus?

1499
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That's me.

1500
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I don't know what the question was,

1501
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
but Walrus is my spirit animal.

1502
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
What's your spirit animal?

1503
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah, Walrus is my spirit animal.

1504
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Real quick, before we get too deep into questions,

1505
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
while I was taking a pee, I remembered this.

1506
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I have some suicide advice for everybody.

1507
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
All right, I'm taking notes.

1508
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
If you...

1509
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
If you want to kill yourself,

1510
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
but to be able to leave money with your loved ones,

1511
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
by taking out some kind of life insurance policy,

1512
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
do it before telling anybody

1513
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
about your suicidal intentions,

1514
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
because I legitimately cannot get life insurance

1515
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
because it says on my record that I have a history

1516
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
with suicide attempts.

1517
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So, my dad...

1518
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
It's good to know.

1519
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Yeah, my dad took out a big life insurance policy

1520
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
on everybody else in the family,

1521
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
but he tried to do it on me,

1522
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
and they won't give me life insurance,

1523
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
because they think that I'll kill myself.

1524
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
How did they find out about the clothes pins?

1525
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Because I told that to my psychologist

1526
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
when I was seeing him.

1527
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I think the solution here is to just not bother

1528
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
the bureaucracy of trying to get life insurance.

1529
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Just go old school and bury all your savings in a chest

1530
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
and give your family members a map.

1531
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I said them on a grand quest, little member.

1532
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Tighten all in one piece.

1533
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Endless justice family members from all over the globe

1534
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
began the great age of fucking suicide.

1535
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And it never ended.

1536
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yes.

1537
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Well, I did when everyone died.

1538
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Well, fuck this animal question.

1539
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I don't have an answer yet.

1540
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I want to be a fox,

1541
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
because I'm clever and I'm mangy.

1542
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And everyone hates me because I'm stealing your chickens.

1543
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I want to answer two.

1544
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I think the obvious answer for me is monkey,

1545
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
but I also have a great affinity for goats,

1546
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
and I want to live at the goat tower,

1547
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
so I wish I could be a goat.

1548
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Wait, I also like cats and dogs,

1549
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and lions and turtles and shit.

1550
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Monkey picking goats over sheep,

1551
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
you fucking traitor.

1552
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
It's like incest.

1553
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Hey, why don't we do a podcast about all the animals

1554
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
that are cool instead of all this philosophical

1555
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
fucking circle jerky bullshit?

1556
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
That's when you said the last episode.

1557
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I want to fucking have fun with my friend

1558
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
and talk about cool animals.

1559
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I don't like animals.

1560
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You know, really, the suicide cast

1561
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
should have been an animal cast.

1562
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Who better to talk about suicide than Colt Corona

1563
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and fucking the hypocrite and the Tuscany Walrus?

1564
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
An action-y draft who lives with a crippling disease

1565
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
in the day of his life.

1566
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Who better than Brunswick,

1567
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
who literally can't stop dying?

1568
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
If you brought me on to an animal cast,

1569
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
it would turn into a broad concept thing

1570
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
about how plants also have different kinds of thought

1571
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
that humans just can't understand.

1572
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Why do we care about plants?

1573
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
What the walrus thinks about it?

1574
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Oh, I didn't need an animal cast.

1575
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I meant a podcast about animals.

1576
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I hate animals, except walruses.

1577
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
They're cool.

1578
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
We should bring back animal casts sometime.

1579
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Walruses?

1580
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
They're the bad guy in Tusk.

1581
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
There's a few other OK animals.

1582
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Reptiles are kind of cool.

1583
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Yeah, that's about it.

1584
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Demolition D's lizard's pretty sick.

1585
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I want one of those.

1586
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Hedgehogs are fucking sweet, bro.

1587
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I want to hang out.

1588
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I want to juggle hedgehogs.

1589
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I want to get a couple of hedgehogs together

1590
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and watch them have a real dilemma.

1591
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You know what I'm saying?

1592
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm talking about the hedgehogs dilemma.

1593
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Oh, god damn it.

1594
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
The funniest part of that, and now it's ruined.

1595
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
It got cut off.

1596
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I said I want to get a couple of hedgehogs together

1597
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
and watch them have a dilemma.

1598
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Oh, yes.

1599
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
It was better when it got cut off.

1600
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I could picture whatever funny joke I wanted.

1601
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
There's a new pond in my back garden

1602
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and all the frogs have come back

1603
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and they're all...

1604
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
like they're in pairs, one on top of the other.

1605
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Oh, man. Yeah.

1606
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah.

1607
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
That's the coolest thing about animals

1608
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
is they just fuck all the time

1609
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
with no... there's nothing...

1610
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
there's no conversation about it.

1611
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
There's no hitting on.

1612
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Every time I see...

1613
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
that's the hottest thing about

1614
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
animal girls,

1615
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
like anime animal girls

1616
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
is when they give them the one property

1617
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
of animals that really matter

1618
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
incessant desire to fuck with no prejudice

1619
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
and that's the best part of those.

1620
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
You can create an atmosphere like that

1621
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
if you like...

1622
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
but first you have to get a girl living with you

1623
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
or move a bunch of black people into town

1624
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
but you can't just go out in the world.

1625
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Just pick up some jungle sluts.

1626
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Yeah, you can't just go out and rape a girl

1627
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
in the streets. I've tried it, it doesn't work.

1628
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That's the whole thing with the anime

1629
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
cat girl, whatever, and then furries.

1630
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
The furries have got it the wrong way around.

1631
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
They got all the fur and the fangs

1632
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
and stuff but they're just normal humans.

1633
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
That's terrible.

1634
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
They are the worst of both worlds.

1635
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Digi's point, the minks in one piece

1636
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
there's like this thing they do called

1637
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
garchu, they're the animal people.

1638
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
They just fucking rub everyone all the time.

1639
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
They're up on each other all the time.

1640
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
They're rubbing and touching and groaning.

1641
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
The reason I brought that up is because I literally saw

1642
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
a kimono friends dojin

1643
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
yesterday that was about this.

1644
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
This happened and I was like

1645
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I was just looking at it and I was like,

1646
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
yeah, yeah.

1647
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
The concept of touching

1648
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
another living being is an extremely

1649
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
attractive thing. The animals do a lot.

1650
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Well, except not other humans.

1651
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Anyway, let's move on to the next question.

1652
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Yeah, let's do that.

1653
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Other members of the species, we'll say.

1654
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Here's a fun one.

1655
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
At Jbud

1656
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
VA asks,

1657
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
hey procrastinators, how do your families

1658
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
respond to the type of content you create?

1659
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Do you feel they understand the full

1660
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
picture?

1661
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
No.

1662
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
My parents don't really know anything about what I do.

1663
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
They know that I make animations,

1664
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
but they call

1665
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
my Gibb and take a blog

1666
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
and that's what they say.

1667
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I call my channel a blog.

1668
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I have a blog.

1669
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Gibbs is not like yours, Digi.

1670
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Gibbs is definitely more...

1671
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
They don't watch them, they don't really know

1672
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
what's going on.

1673
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I only tell my dad

1674
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
the business side of things ever,

1675
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
and he's really interested in that shit,

1676
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
but he doesn't know anything about

1677
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
any of this shit.

1678
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Nor does my mom.

1679
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Your grandma is in your videos,

1680
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
and your mom

1681
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
has been in one where she was

1682
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
sloshed. How much do they know about it?

1683
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
My mom refuses,

1684
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
they know pretty much everything,

1685
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
but my mom refuses to watch them

1686
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
because she doesn't like it when I cuss.

1687
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But my dad actually is subscribed

1688
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
to Mumkey Jones and Mumkey Jones too.

1689
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah.

1690
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
He's not subscribed to Mumkey's Countdown to Suicide?

1691
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
He doesn't know about that one yet.

1692
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I'm hoping he doesn't find that one.

1693
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
He's missing out.

1694
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I might have said this before,

1695
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
but when he watches my Elliot Roger parodies

1696
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
where I pretend to be Elliot Roger talking about

1697
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
how lonely I am and I want to kill people,

1698
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
he'll send me a text message

1699
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
asking me if I'm okay,

1700
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
so that's how they feel about it.

1701
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
That's really cute.

1702
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It's not cute.

1703
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
That's cute. It's funny.

1704
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
It's hurting people so cute. I like that.

1705
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
What do your parents think?

1706
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
They don't really understand.

1707
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
They're always just having to be like,

1708
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
yeah, this is great, but when are you going to get a real job?

1709
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Yeah.

1710
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
The one thing that kind of set the tone

1711
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
for how they thought about it was that

1712
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
when I got fired from my job in 2013

1713
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
and I started Patreon

1714
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
and I got money, the first thing they said

1715
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
was like, oh, now we can take rent from you

1716
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
and immediately took half my Patreon money

1717
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
for the entirety of like two years.

1718
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Lol.

1719
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It's good when it pays them.

1720
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
It's good when it gives them money.

1721
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Other than that, they just want me to take more money.

1722
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
They didn't ask for rent when you had

1723
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
a quote unquote real job.

1724
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Right. Okay, that's bullshit.

1725
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
As soon as I got art money,

1726
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
they were like, well, we need to crush your soul a little bit more.

1727
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It's like they felt the need to stop you from doing this.

1728
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
We need to do a podcast

1729
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
on the topic of parents and why they should

1730
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
all be exterminated and should not exist

1731
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and should not be allowed to have any part

1732
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
of anyone's life past the age of four.

1733
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Ben has a real good plan for this.

1734
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's where we take everyone's children,

1735
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
we harvest them, and we send them to a camp

1736
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
where they're raised independently

1737
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
with our best practices.

1738
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Parents are kept separate.

1739
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It's a different society between parents and children.

1740
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
That's what happens.

1741
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That's what it should be.

1742
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
My parents probably

1743
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
just follow my stuff more than anybody

1744
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
else is in here going about what I'm hearing.

1745
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
They don't watch any...

1746
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
What a surprise. Did you have a great life?

1747
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
My parents...

1748
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
They don't watch any of the anime content at all

1749
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
because they don't know the first fucking thing

1750
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
about anime and they don't care.

1751
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
But my dad loves

1752
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
showing people my videos, particularly

1753
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
the ones that are about explaining

1754
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
what anime is.

1755
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
He'll always show people what is the appeal of anime

1756
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
as his introduction

1757
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
because my dad just really likes bragging

1758
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
about me.

1759
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Virtually anybody who my dad...

1760
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I have the most autistic son

1761
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
in the whole goddamn world!

1762
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's really weird for me

1763
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
because he shows my stuff to everybody

1764
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
he works with.

1765
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
When I go to my dad's work,

1766
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
everyone there recognizes me

1767
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
and knows things about me.

1768
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I don't know who any of them are.

1769
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It's always that weird disconnect of

1770
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
everyone's looking at me like,

1771
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
the rapper guy...

1772
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Now my parents are...

1773
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
because the anime stuff is hard to explain to people

1774
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
they'll just show them a video and be like

1775
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
here you go, my parents don't watch a lot of it

1776
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
but they do keep up with all the raps a lot

1777
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
more because that's something everybody gets

1778
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
is the music.

1779
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So my parents will...

1780
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
They both follow my soundcloud

1781
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
they both follow...

1782
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Generally, if there's a video

1783
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I actually think my parents will understand

1784
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I'll post it on Facebook

1785
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
and I'll go, hey, here's one

1786
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
for you guys.

1787
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Here's one that's not going to confuse

1788
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
and terrify you.

1789
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I think on some level

1790
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
they avoid watching a lot of the after dark stuff

1791
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
because they know that it's stuff they shouldn't

1792
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
see.

1793
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
The stuff that's really going to make them

1794
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
worried about me, I think they avoid

1795
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
because

1796
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
generally when my parents hear something

1797
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
concerning about me, they bring it up to me

1798
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
and I always try to downplay it as much

1799
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
as possible. They'll be like, so we heard

1800
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
you were

1801
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
worried that you're going to kill yourself

1802
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
in the next week and I'm like

1803
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
it's a joke, it's a meme.

1804
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I'm fine, that was

1805
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
three days ago. Totally different

1806
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
guy.

1807
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
So yeah.

1808
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
What did your parents think of the Asperger rap on your soundcloud?

1809
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't think they heard that one

1810
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
or they didn't bring it up because I don't think they knew

1811
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
what the hell it was about.

1812
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
My parents are not allowed

1813
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
to see my family

1814
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
is allowed to see anything I do.

1815
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I find it extremely disturbing

1816
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
finding out that they've watched a video of mine.

1817
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I don't want it.

1818
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
They don't deserve to.

1819
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I don't like them.

1820
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
My father is the stupidest piece of

1821
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
shit in the world and I don't talk to him

1822
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and so he doesn't deserve to see my videos

1823
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and my mother is a perfect

1824
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
saint and so she especially shouldn't

1825
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
see my videos.

1826
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Okay,

1827
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
go on, finish.

1828
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Nothing, it just creeps me out.

1829
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Especially when I'm recording

1830
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
and they hear me through the walls.

1831
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
That actually makes me want to

1832
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
kill myself.

1833
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
That's the closest I come to wanting to not be here on this planet.

1834
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Anytime I'm recording

1835
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and I hear

1836
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
what might be somebody

1837
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
nearby in the house, I have to stop

1838
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and investigate.

1839
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
When I'm in the kitchen at night

1840
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
and I walk by the living room

1841
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
and my mom and she's like,

1842
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
when are you yelling about down there?

1843
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
When are you telling me you sound like you're mad

1844
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and I'm like, oh my god, I want a shotgun

1845
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
in my fucking, I want to put the fucking trigger

1846
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
on my toe and go out like Hemingway.

1847
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I don't want to be here anymore.

1848
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Yeah, Digi, that's why

1849
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
doing videos in this apartment

1850
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
is the most,

1851
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I get a lot of anxiety from it because I share a wall

1852
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
with some dumb bitch neighbor

1853
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
who's always making noise.

1854
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
She's gonna hear me yelling about

1855
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
the pomp today, I can't wait.

1856
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Dude, next time you hear him fucking

1857
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
through that wall, it'll be like my sister

1858
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
is having sex with her boyfriend through that wall.

1859
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm making an Elliot joke.

1860
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh, okay, I thought you wanted me to jerk off

1861
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
to the thought of incest.

1862
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Well, yeah, I mean that too, obviously.

1863
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
That's not what Elliot did.

1864
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Well, wasn't he deeply disturbed by hearing his sister fuck through the wall?

1865
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm not wrong about that, Emma.

1866
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yeah, because he was jealous that she was doing it so young

1867
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
while he hadn't even had kids.

1868
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Because he was jealous that he wasn't fucking his sister.

1869
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Dude, I am so sympathetic

1870
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
to your fucking plight of neighbors

1871
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
because that's been my whole life,

1872
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
my entire career

1873
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and now you finally

1874
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
understand why I don't have

1875
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
videos out every Monday

1876
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
and have never had a schedule like yours

1877
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
because it's goddamn impossible

1878
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
when people barge into your house

1879
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and you can hear them stomping around

1880
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
in the other rooms.

1881
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
It's a nightmare.

1882
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I wish that everyone in my house were dead all the time.

1883
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Yeah, moving out of my parents' house

1884
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
was the worst mistake

1885
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
for my YouTube channel because at least then

1886
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I knew what their schedule was

1887
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and when I could record shit, but here

1888
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I don't know what the fuck this neighbor's up to.

1889
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Seems like she's home at the weirdest parts of the day

1890
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
and then always making noise with her day ass music

1891
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and screaming at her boyfriend to stop hitting her.

1892
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
It never ends.

1893
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
People don't know, but managing your recording environment

1894
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
is really fucking hot.

1895
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
The worst ever was filming the horseshoe finale

1896
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
and just because

1897
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
there was so much setup. I had to fucking put on the costume

1898
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I had to set the stage up in the lights

1899
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
and slip my hair back every goddamn day to sit there

1900
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
and remember those long fucking monologues

1901
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and fucking have to... there was so much stress

1902
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
to get it right because I don't know

1903
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I might only have 10 minutes to fucking film all this

1904
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
this time. I might only get one shot

1905
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
at getting this take right because at any time

1906
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
there's gonna be a whole fucking nigger party parade

1907
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
upstairs stomping around for the fucking teenagers

1908
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
and 20-something

1909
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
dopers and fiends up

1910
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
up in my house making noise. It was a fucking

1911
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
nightmare. And that fucking

1912
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
maybe that

1913
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
added to the rage in the video

1914
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
so maybe it worked out for the best.

1915
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I gotta say there's no escape

1916
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
from this either because you would think

1917
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
that I have the perfect recording

1918
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
environment. I have a super isolated room

1919
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
way across from that. I know that you do.

1920
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I probably have the best you can get

1921
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
but even here, first of all

1922
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
recording during the day is really difficult

1923
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
because there's constant road noise

1924
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
because I live on a major road which

1925
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
doesn't seem to affect these podcasts

1926
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
too badly thankfully but like

1927
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I can't do like a serious recording

1928
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
with that going on. But then

1929
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
recently

1930
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
after Trump's inauguration

1931
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
for like two and a half weeks there was just

1932
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
constant helicopters

1933
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
for like seriously every day

1934
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
for like six hours a day there were

1935
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
fucking helicopters overhead and that's when I wanted

1936
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
to launch all these vlogging series that I've been

1937
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
doing all these daily weekly vlogs

1938
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and like I just wanted

1939
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
to record like six vlogs in a row and it was

1940
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
constant helicopters so finally I just made it

1941
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
a joke in the video that

1942
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
this is the only manga review show with a constant

1943
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
thread of helicopter noise because there was no

1944
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
avoiding it.

1945
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Fucking Trump suppressing

1946
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
free expression god damn it

1947
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
by way of

1948
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
just by way of increased

1949
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
helicopter traffic yeah

1950
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
he's crafty that one he's crafty

1951
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
okay what else questions we got here

1952
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
how about um oh here's one

1953
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
uh by at mighty cleffa

1954
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I think you've taken a question from her before

1955
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
um what's the favorite piece of

1956
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
fan art you've received and Jess I know

1957
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
you're a big enthusiast for the fan arts

1958
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
oh man there's too many great fan arts

1959
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
to even to even remember her name

1960
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I just recently got that great one of

1961
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
me as like fat Kamina which

1962
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
was beautiful I make a better Kamina than me

1963
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
that was the most perfect thing I ever seen in my life

1964
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I did love the fatness of it

1965
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
that was beautiful and then like someone like

1966
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
then like it took off like a meme and more

1967
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
people like immediately started drawing me

1968
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
as Kamina so I just you

1969
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000

cold corona uh boozy it'll fade

01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
it'll fade I'm sure it will

1972
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
but there's always more there's always new fan

1973
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
art to spring up it's like the gift

1974
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
that keeps on giving is that uh that

1975
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
dude yesterday just made me that cool ass

1976
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
fucking it was that scene

1977
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
in Avon Galeon where Misato finds out that Kaji

1978
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
died and she cries at the kitchen table

1979
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
and someone drew me in that pose crying at the table

1980
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
yeah uh Ukrainian or whatever

1981
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
yeah like this guy's been churning out fan art

1982
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
at mock speed on like the fantasy

1983
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
that was shit yeah he's even made shape over

1984
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
uh fan art I think shape over

1985
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
is more than me now I deeply

1986
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
appreciated that one especially because it's like

1987
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
such a like a weird specific

1988
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
like frame of animation

1989
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
in the show that like no one would get the reference but me

1990
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
so no one would see how cool it was

1991
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
but it's super cool and then there's this guy

1992
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
there was one guy who followed me for a while called spider

1993
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
who kept drawing like panel cast

1994
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
fan art of like stuff that I dreamed about in the panel

1995
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
cast he drew me like nice he drew me

1996
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
that um as like a wireframe res man

1997
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
like flying through my dimension of comics

1998
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
which was to my fucking

1999
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
radio head music playing

2000
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
like I'll just describe these inane things on the panel cast

2001
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000

2037
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I love that because it used to always be didgy

2038
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
brony the character and he was very popular

2039
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
himself and there's tons of great art

2040
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000

people just draw me I fucking

2042
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000

01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
smoking or something or wearing my big

2045
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
jacket and like that's my favorite

2046
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
drawing me with the cool shades

2047
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
the cooler the shades and the trippier

2048
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
the artwork the more I enjoy it

2049
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
there's a lot of people draw me like

2050
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
like fucking evaporating

2051
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
into a mist of colors or something

2052
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000

um where like

2055
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
they drew me in a tank top that

2056
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
just said the word wrestling on it

2057
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
and like

2058
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000

so I can print that shirt and sell to

2060
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
people it's like

2061
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000

2062
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
shirt only you know retooled

2063
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
my favorite kind of fan art

2064
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
is anything to do with my Nuzlocke series

2065
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
when people like draw the

2066
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
the Pokemon that I have along with me

2067
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
and I always play as a girl so they'll like

2068
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
they'll draw the girl from the game

2069
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
but with the monkey head

2070
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
and ended that right

2071
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
by having like the guest art so he gets

2072
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
beautiful arts in his episode time

2073
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
so I really like those

2074
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
if you make those don't be afraid to send them

2075
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Ben drew a

2076
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
monkey blowing up Charizard that time

2077
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
or whatever oh yeah that's right

2078
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
oh my god I forgot

2079
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
the people they draw

2080
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Vriska when I asked for it I really like

2081
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000

don't kill yourselves if you draw

2088
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
one of these days I'm gonna

2089
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
just invoke an ultimate

2090
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
power because I did this once before

2091
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
in the early early part of the pony

2092
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
days um a cousin

2093
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
of mine was having a birthday

2094
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
and her aunt like asked me if I could get someone

2095
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
to draw her a pony oh see

2096
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
so I like made a main channel video

2097
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
asking for that and I got like

2098
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
fucking like 50 to 100

2099
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
of them or something it was like just a million

2100
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
of the one I described and so

2101
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I've always known in my back pocket

2102
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
if I ever like really need

2103
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
100 of one piece of art

2104
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
then I've got it there and I could just

2105
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
unload this onto the world

2106
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
and receive every fan art ever

2107
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
so just everyone have your pencils ready

2108
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
for when I have this need

2109
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
oh yeah there was like a whole folder

2110
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
full of fucking fan art

2111
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
that I've gotten I like to try and save it

2112
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
you know what sorry Tom I don't know

2113
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000

2114
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
do you have more to say about that

2115
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I mean I was gonna go but if you want to

2116
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
finish your point go for it

2117
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
well I was just gonna say that I remembered

2118
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
that one of my favorite things that I completely

2119
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
didn't expect at all

2120
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
that's been happening recently is people

2121
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
fan art of my fucking stories

2122
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
like I got a bunch of fan art of

2123
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Tales from the End of the World

2124
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
when I released that and then

2125
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I've gotten a lot of it for

2126
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
this anime idea I had

2127
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
for a show called Omar that I just made a video

2128
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
like describing this show and then I got a bunch

2129
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
of fan art for it and I was like

2130
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
it's brought it to life now like I didn't have

2131
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
a vision of it in my head and now I do

2132
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
so that's very cool

2133
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
that is great I was gonna say

2134
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I got a ton of fan art like I got some good

2135
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
ones from Idol Yo-Kai from like

2136
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
about a year ago Twisted Prism

2137
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
did a couple cool pieces my favorite pieces are

2138
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
when people do art of my characters

2139
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
like yeah I don't matter

2140
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
they matter so

2141
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
that's the coolest thing I'm always excited

2142
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
lives matter I'm excited vicariously

2143
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
to see Sorceress Lost Fan Art

2144
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
whenever I see it

2145
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
me too hey I want

2146
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
to give a shout out to everybody who drew

2147
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
pictures of my like my one

2148
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
piece OC character that I described in that

2149
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
episode of the potty cast a while back

2150
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
about the umbrella and the thing those were

2151
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
all great because I've been saying

2152
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
in the episode like for years I've wanted

2153
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
people to draw this character because I can't draw

2154
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I can't make a real I need someone else to do

2155
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
it at what one day I'll get

2156
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
the the guy who did the Steins Gate art

2157
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and the Black Rock shooter artists to draw

2158
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
that's my dream I want that guy to draw it

2159
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I don't remember at all

2160
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I don't remember at all

2161
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
but everybody did that

2162
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I'm surprised we haven't seen

2163
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
any fan art yet of Don Bracken

2164
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
from the triflers

2165
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
yeah I'd like to see

2166
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
all the triflers characters chilling out in that basement

2167
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
there's less probably like mental connection

2168
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
between like a book character and like drawing

2169
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
fan art of them you know what I mean

2170
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
maybe something like that going on

2171
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I don't know it feels like there's a big gap

2172
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
in the artistic mediums there

2173
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
usually with a book character you need

2174
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
like at least one canon

2175
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
image before people will start

2176
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I mean I don't know people drew a bunch of art

2177
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
of my story and fewer people

2178
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
read that than read monkeys so

2179
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
yeah you're an anime boy

2180
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
more I don't know I think

2181
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
it'll happen we just got to we just got to put

2182
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
the seed of people are still trying to read

2183
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
yeah if you say it right now people

2184
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
will try just request it right now and

2185
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
you'll you'll get some shit if you get

2186
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I mean I think only 20 people have actually

2187
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
finished it so what's the chance is that one of those

2188
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
20s and I'll try a fan art when I finish

2189
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
it but it's just so agonizing

2190
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
to read

2191
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
by the way I also want to say

2192
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I love people have drawn me with my wife

2193
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
who's a bunch of times historically those are all great

2194
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
my favorite one was that like one day

2195
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I was just talking on Twitter about like how

2196
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
much I love jury's design from the new

2197
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Street Fighter 5 and that leather tit covering

2198
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
is like the hottest thing ever that like skin suit

2199
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
and like and then somebody

2200
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
drew just like a picture of me with all my wife

2201
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
who's but it wasn't just the ones for my banner they

2202
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
included jury in that and I just thought

2203
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
like this person really pays attention to

2204
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
what I'm saying and gets it so whoever that

2205
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
was that big best guy ever thing

2206
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
that I love that and then I also want to say

2207
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I looked up the person who did the

2208
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
the picture of you and me

2209
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
on the you know like the wedding dress or whatever

2210
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
given that was Uppity Princess at

2211
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Drowsy Apricot yeah thank you that was great

2212
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I think the fan art I get the most excited

2213
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
about is always when it's something very specific

2214
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
when it's like I wasn't done

2215
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I also want to say Drowsy Apricot

2216
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
you are super cute you should

2217
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
come over to my house sometime

2218
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
so we can get together and hang out

2219
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
and do just what men and women

2220
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000

2221
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
so there you go call me

2222
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000

01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
24 she's not that young

2225
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
she's too old

2226
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
10 years too old or so

2227
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I'd say but too old for the channel anyways

2228
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000

2229
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000

2248
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000

we're going to explore every possible

2261
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000

01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Potter book he's like in the bathroom

2269
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000

material guys no no don't

2271
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
don't stop everybody stop this has been a preview

2272
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
one final question there's

2273
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
one final wrap-up question which

2274
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
really is kind of actually the touchstone that we should

2275
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
have addressed in this episode long ago

2276
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
and this was by who else but idle yokai

2277
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
asks should I kill myself

2278
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
to reunite with my waifus

2279
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
yes yes 100% that's

2280
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
the best reason to kill yourself

2281
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
every time I look through the news

2282
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I can see all the

2283
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
caions over there and I hear the beat

2284
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
from the song paradise by

2285
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
me and endless Jess and blind sky watcher

2286
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
playing in my head and I'm just like

2287
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
that's that's there's the real one

2288
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
that's the real paradise over there

2289
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
this three-dimensional shell that we're

2290
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
trapped in just holds our 2d self

2291
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
we have to set it free from this

2292
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
prison of a body that we live in by

2293
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
killing yourself so there you go

2294
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
one day and that's it

2295
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
that's that's all all the good questions

2296
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
keep sending questions people at tbcrasnators

2297
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
send them every time send them every day

2298
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
but especially on Saturday people the most

2299
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
important thing of all before we wrap up

2300
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
this episode

2301
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I'm crapping my pants

2302
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000

2303
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
again

2304
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I can't believe the consistency

2305
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
of this man's shit

2306
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
it's so thick

2307
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
and so common

2308
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
