00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,000
post-Bronicon edition. Welcome back, everybody.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Last week you had the non-Bronicon. Today you have pure distilled.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,200
Those fucking nerds, those non-Bronicon embarrassing.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Sorry about that, everyone. The nightmare is over.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Yep, you're welcome. Ben Saint is back.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,200
The glorious Ben and Nate combo is finally back.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,800
Everyone was dying for it once again. Everyone was complaining.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
Where's Ben and Nate? Our favorite duo.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,400
Where's Ben and Nate? I need to know what they thought about Bernie Sanders' appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
We've got to know. We've got to know.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,600
Through the past weekend and week, we have been putting our hooves up over and over and over again.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Just completely thrashing around, just dancing our hearts out about Bronicon.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,200
Now that's over. That was the last Bronicon we will ever experience.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Can we please put our hooves not up, but over our heart and pray?

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Can we get some forward slash right parentheses in the chat, please?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Can we please get those flooding the chat? I would really appreciate that.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Munchy, Ben, Gib, Jesse, the whole crew's here, plus me.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
All the people who went to Bronicon.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Yes, literally all of us, and no one who did go.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Was this intentional? Did we do this on purpose?

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Not really.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Well, all right then.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Yeah, obviously.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Well, it was a glorious time.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I want to say it.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,600
As we told everyone who went to Bronicon, this was not what was destined to be.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Because there was another person who was supposed to be here, and that we cried and cried about not being here.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
And Tom, Tom was going to be at Bronicon, and it was going to be incredible.

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
He has more friends at Bronicon than us.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,600
No, no, he was going to be in Illuminati's Secret Spirit cooking parties, and it was going to be great.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
It was going to be a great time. But his back is just so fucked up that he couldn't even make it.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
It's literally like a nightmare, and I'm scared for him.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Well, who knows, man. I hope he is better or whatever.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
His back or his legs, or I'm not 100% clear on that.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I did the last PCP. I'm sure he discussed that at some, I don't know how much he said, I didn't listen to it.

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I have not listened to the last one yet.

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,600
And also Digi didn't come, because he has a wicked heart.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
For all the sympathy we have toward Digi.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Let's talk about Digi's wicked heart for a second.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
All the sympathy we have for Tom.

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
It turns into rage at Digi.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
His cynical, evil heart, and not going to be with friends.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
I just want to say, to even push this even further, because you may think,

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, well, you know, Tom might have been fucked up, but like, you know, he's a poor boy too.

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Nate specifically was like offering to help pay for his flight to get to Bronicon.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
We did look into arrangements somewhat to see what could be done.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Even if that was paid for, Tom said he still couldn't go. It's just pure pain.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Let me tell you, I don't remember who it was, Nate or Munchy.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
One of you suggested that like, well, what if you come and we just carted you around in a wheelchair?

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
What if we push you around in a wheelchair?

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Unironically, it was like, dude, I will be the wheelchair push guy.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
That's my excuse not to talk to anyone.

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I don't have to do anything. I have the excuse.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
And they're like, no, I got to fucking push a thing. I got to do it.

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
No, sorry, guys, I can't fucking do this. I'm out.

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Yeah, sorry, responsibilities. Oh, I'd love to, but I have to push this wheelchair.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Yeah, yeah, that was good. You know, it was gonna, Tom's wheelchair was going to be my, the talk of the town.

59
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,600
No, Tom's wheelchair was going to be the guitar to my give and take at a party, if you know what I'm saying.

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
You know what I'm saying?

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I do, I do.

62
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
But it didn't, but it wasn't to be. So fuck you, Tom.

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
You couldn't, you couldn't do that. You couldn't do me this one thing and give me that out.

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
You couldn't even help Ben in this one aspect of life. Truly a useless man.

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,600
You couldn't even help Ben cheat out of social situations scenarios. You couldn't even help Ben cheat at life.

66
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
That's right.

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,600
You know, every, every opportunity that was ripped away from Tom tragically is an opportunity that Digi squandered willingly.

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Deliberately, maliciously.

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
We tried again to come maliciously.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I know he had just been to Otacon the weekend before. I know that's true.

72
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
But he had what, four days to rest up? Plenty of time. Plenty of time.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I mean, I came to bring him to Bronycon from camp.

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I will defend him until the day I die.

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Nothing to do with Otacon. He had been saying forever that no guys, that sounds dumb.

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
That's dumb. Why would I want to go to Bronycon?

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Bronycon.

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:43,600
This is that thing I think permeates this group to some degree that is this deep rooted shame about having been a pony boy at one time.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I never identified as a Brony, but I have zero shame about being a pony boy back in the day.

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Who has shame?

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Literally, who has shame?

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
No, no, it's just Digi that has shame.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Yeah, I think it's, I really think it's just Digi.

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Okay, maybe it is. Maybe it is.

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Maybe, I don't think Tom. Do you think Tom, do you think Tom has the shame?

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I think Tom's got that Brony shame.

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't. I don't. No, not really.

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Do you think, do you think Mage?

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
You know, Mage maybe a little bit. Maybe a little bit.

90
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I don't think, I don't know if Mage has the Brony shame. She's definitely got Brony rage from like people messaging her, asking her like, hey, I love how you draw a pony.

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
She's frustrated about that.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
I think Mage is the very normal, maybe kind of like artist cycle thing.

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Mage is a little different from us.

94
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
She's mad that she's been typecast.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah, yeah, that's true. And like she kind of has moved on artistically and I think feels a little annoyed.

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
She's still associated with that fairly strongly.

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
So I think she has some annoyance at that.

98
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
But I mean, she could, she can tell you all about it, I'm sure.

99
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Okay, let's look at this from Digi's perspective.

100
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,600
You know, he, of course, you know, he has no reason to go to BronyCon other than to meet us.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Well, none of us had a reason to go.

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Why do you think I fucking went, motherfucker?

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I listened to the podcast he was on and he did say that the reason it was like he wanted to see us, but like, like Radcon is like not too far off in the distance.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
It was just about to say, yeah, yeah.

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Well, we don't know that, nobody's planned Radcon at all.

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Nobody has planned it.

107
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
We do not have a plan.

108
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
The desire is there to do it like kind of soon.

109
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Yeah, the desire.

110
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I suppose, I suppose.

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
This sounds like a rationalization maybe.

112
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I imagine that he wouldn't would rather think like, oh, well, I'll wait for that as opposed to do something which I don't want to do, but just have the frosting of my friends that they're also sprinkled on top of.

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Like, I think all of the BronyCon things he would hate, which I did as well, even though I thought it was funny.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Ironically, I wasn't able to have fun with you guys.

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:42,600
The only times I felt joy at BronyCon that were not in spite of BronyCon were anytime that a song from Friendship is Witchcraft came on.

116
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
And then I was like, I'm unironically back into it.

117
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I remember.

118
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I remember why I gave a shit.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
And then the song would end.

120
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I'd be like, this is the fucking worst.

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
This is a fucking nightmare.

122
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I mean, you had a couple like, like, like, like depressant, like on the floor, Ben St hates BronyCon moments.

123
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I did.

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah, I did.

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
No, I, but yeah, let's talk about those.

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
There were quite a few of those, of the famous Ben St tantrums.

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
All of that convention floor.

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
They were not tantrums.

129
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Let's talk about, let's talk about my depressive episodes at BronyCon.

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Sure.

131
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,600
You had low lows and low highs at BronyCon.

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,600
And first of all, the whole thing is underscored by this, this Twitter thread that you're doing of you, you know, here I go to BronyCon.

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Here I am meeting my friends at BronyCon side.

134
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
The thing about that, that was, that was ironically ironic.

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Indeed.

136
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
You know what I mean?

137
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
That was like double ironic.

138
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
So it was like half sincere.

139
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:44,600
It was like, it was like, I genuinely feel dread and terror and dismay at the thought that I have to go do this, even though I think I will probably have a good time.

140
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
And I was like, how can I monetize it?

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
So I put it on Twitter and made $0.

142
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Could have logged, I suppose, perhaps.

143
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I don't know.

144
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
I could have logged.

145
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Is that a way to get money?

146
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Maybe.

147
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
I don't know.

148
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
What even is, what even is money?

149
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
No one knows.

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I almost feel a little bit stupid going to BronyCon.

151
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Like I feel a little bit like I've made the decision.

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
No.

153
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
No, really?

154
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Because, why money?

155
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Because it's the hottest take of a year.

156
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
At first, I thought it was going to be like a mix of like, oh, you know, I'm going to BronyCon.

157
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I'll be with my friends.

158
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
That will be the main source of passion and joy.

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,600
But also, like, you know, like, I will sort of like go to a panel or two and just be like, haha, isn't this silly?

160
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Or also even just go around to the vendor store and buy anything.

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I couldn't get one iota of joy from like real pony shit.

162
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
No panel.

163
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm done.

164
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
No panel was any good.

165
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
No.

166
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I mean, the Lauren Faust one was like kind of good.

167
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,600
But it was also kind of depressing because she was, she was like talking a little bit about like, all right.

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Here's the one like, the one interesting thing about that panel was that she was talking about her like plans.

169
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Wow, you guys really fucked this up, huh?

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Like the plans for the main six and all that.

171
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
And season one, she was doing the thing.

172
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
It's like she didn't know whether there's going to be a season three.

173
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,600
So for season two, she just sort of treaded water and she didn't like introduce the plot elements that she wanted.

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
To expand on in case the show didn't continue.

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
And then they got rid of her.

176
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,600
So like that was her biggest regret that she didn't start like her pony story.

177
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,600
And hearing her talk about that was just like, that was like, oh, so like it, it's, you know, really sad.

178
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I mean, I already knew it was really sad, but like she sounded really sad.

179
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
And it's something.

180
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,600
We're all in this panel together and like there were like several moments of like across the board.

181
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Everyone there had their own like sad moment.

182
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
They had their own like Lily of the Valley moment, if you will.

183
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
No.

184
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
So like even, even Lauren Faust was the demon to another.

185
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
So like Bonnie Zachary, a person who first made Malapony.

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Like one of like, I had heard this before.

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
One of the like thousand.

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Wait, like made it back in like the fucking six season?

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Yeah.

190
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Yeah.

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
She was, she was there.

192
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Yeah, she was there.

193
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Wow.

194
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
How old is she?

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
She's like 70.

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Like 80.

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Oh my God.

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Wow.

199
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Okay.

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Well, okay.

201
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Whatever.

202
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Lauren Faust, like one of like the, the, the funny, the funny sound bites that she always

203
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
says is that, you know, when, when she was brought into Hasbro and someone showed her

204
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,600
like a, like a Malapony movie and they're like, Hey, what do you think about this?

205
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
And she's like, wow, this was really bad.

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I can do it better.

207
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Basically.

208
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
And then she repeat that story.

209
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,600
And like Bonnie like was there and like, like squint and cringe a little bit.

210
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Wait, what did she say about the movie?

211
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
They, Lauren Faust said that the movie was really bad.

212
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Did she watch it?

213
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
That the old show was shit and terrible.

214
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah.

215
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh God.

216
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
How uncomfortable.

217
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
No, no.

218
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay.

219
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
No, Ben, it gets worse.

220
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Smash cut to later.

221
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
We did a review of that like first ever special Malapony.

222
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Later.

223
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I don't know if that was the first one ever, but there is a point where, where Lauren Faust

224
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,100
is like, like describing like an old show that she wanted to pitch to a network, but

225
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,600
she didn't really get the pitch together.

226
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Was it Galaxy Girls?

227
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
No, it wasn't that.

228
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Okay.

229
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
So she was doing that.

230
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
And she was like, you know what?

231
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
You should make that into like a book, like like a pop-up book.

232
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
That would be a really interesting thing to have in a book.

233
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
And then Lauren Faust or so, or I think the moderator was like, you should, like you do

234
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
should work together.

235
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
That'd be really cool.

236
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
And then Bonnie was like, oh no.

237
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Lauren's a way better artist than I am and she's a way better writer than I am.

238
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
So I wouldn't have anything to add.

239
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
No.

240
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Get fucked, get fucked, you old bitch.

241
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Get fucked, you old bitch.

242
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Die, boomer.

243
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Die.

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Literally like listening to an episode of Quick Draw.

245
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
It was so sad.

246
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Everything was sad.

247
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Everything was terrible.

248
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Everyone looked like they had like waste of their lives and they had.

249
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,600
At the end of the panel, they brought a coffin in and they got Bonnie to climb in and they

250
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
carried her.

251
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
A pink coffin with pony tassels.

252
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah, with like a Puget Pies key mark on it.

253
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Yeah, exactly.

254
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
They gave her a noose and it was like that gif where you're looking through the noose

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
and you see the anime girls, but it was my little pony.

257
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Okay, it was very clear that nobody gets out of this fandom without a lingering depression

258
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
that will last a lifetime from it.

259
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Even the creators.

260
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Even the creators.

261
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
It's just, okay, think about it.

262
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,600
How much suffering has Lauren Foust inflicted upon the world?

263
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Like how much like net total suffering has she personally caused?

264
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Literally worse than Hitler.

265
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah.

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
You know what?

267
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Like I don't even think that's that incomparable.

268
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
You know, at least Hitler's victims were dead afterwards.

269
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Yeah.

270
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
They're going to live with this trauma.

271
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
It's a literal nightmare.

272
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
So that was the only panel that was even slightly positive.

273
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Interesting.

274
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
The rest of them weren't even funny.

275
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Ironically, the rest of them were just straight up like a fucking nightmare.

276
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Well, no, no, there was the, uh, the, uh, the costume runway panel.

277
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Oh, yeah.

278
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Oh, with the Fluttershy.

279
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
You want to talk about it?

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Big, evil Fluttershy.

281
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
That was all right.

282
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
I guess.

283
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Talk about the Fluttershy.

284
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Floated off to a cosmic realm beyond the scope of mortal comprehension.

285
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Like the actual winners of that contest.

286
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I mean, whatever.

287
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
They were like, kind of okay.

288
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I guess who cares.

289
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Some, some, some, some competent costuming work going on there.

290
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,600
The moment when like you Jesse burst into laughter like as loud as you possibly could.

291
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I was like, oh my God.

292
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Like we were sitting in the back so nobody could hear, but it was like really loud.

293
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
And I was like, oh my God, this, this Fluttershy's killed Jesse.

294
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Yeah.

295
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
It was like eight feet tall.

296
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Well, well, like we had like a group of like a bunch of like fans and like lesser YouTubers,

297
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
like hanging around us and stuff.

298
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
And so like there was people around, you know, like laughing at my jokes and shit because

299
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
they thought I was cool.

300
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,600
So I was like, so when the, when the costume panel started, you know, I had this, I had

301
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,600
this bottle of Wild Irish Rose that I had bought that morning at the liquor store across

302
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
from my hotel room.

303
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
So I, you know, I immediately, I started drinking as the panel started and it was just

304
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
enough to get me like perfect drunk.

305
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
And so I was like cracking jokes.

306
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I was like doing running commentary, like making like quips about everyone who came out and

307
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,600
all the costumes and all the, all the, all the little, you know, the glad handing hangers

308
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
on around me.

309
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
There was like a let's play jokes and stuff.

310
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Yeah.

311
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
It's like a let's play, but like real life.

312
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Like is there a word for that?

313
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
I don't know.

314
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
So I was feeling pretty confident.

315
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
It's called comedy.

316
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
It's called improv.

317
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I was feeling pretty self assured in my place in the universe.

318
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I was like, nothing can possibly rock my perceptions of the world.

319
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I know exactly who and where I am.

320
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,600
So, um, so right at like, right at peak drunk, this costume comes out and it's like, I guess

321
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
you would describe it as furry, but that's not doing it justice.

322
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,600
It was like, it was like a fursuit times 11.

323
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,600
It, it was this lumbering monstrosity, this behemoth from beneath the death.

324
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Like a mecca.

325
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
It was like, it was like its own, like personal robot.

326
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,600
It was just rise, like face the thing that should not be.

327
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,600
It's just like lumbered out on, you can hear the earthquake with each lumbering step of

328
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,600
this man standing 10 feet tall, like Paul Bunyan, but even stronger.

329
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Um, and it's just, it's like a, it had like, it was a, it had like hooves, like no hands,

330
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
like flat hands.

331
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,600
And it was, and like its head was like 10 times bigger than its body.

332
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,600
And its head was kind of like, like rolling around on its shoulders and stuff, like a fucking

333
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
silenail monster.

334
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
And it was like, it was like Aldrich of the Deep from Dark Souls 3 that swelled to such

335
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
size that it lost shape and became like a formless mass.

336
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
But it was supposed to be Fluttershy.

337
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,600
It was so ill fitting that it was just like, every part of it was just like loose and like

338
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,600
moving around like a, like a Jacob Slatter abomination.

339
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,600
And it's fucking 10 feet tall and it lumbered out on stage and I'm at peak drunk and I

340
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
just see it and something happened in my body.

341
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Like my soul came out through my eyeballs.

342
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
It was like, you ever see that music video where the girl in the pool and at the end

343
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
she sees the Eldritch thing and her eyeballs explode.

344
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
It was that.

345
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I think it's called fantasy.

346
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
And it was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

348
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I can't explain why any more than I just did.

349
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Why it was the greatest thing I have ever or will ever see.

350
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
But it captivated me.

351
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
It got inside my brain.

352
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
It drove me to the brink of madness.

353
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I am its thrall.

354
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I became this Eldritch creature's thrall for all time.

355
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I will serve big evil Fluttershy until my dying day.

356
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I will, I will work to, to, you know, create, to, to ripple out its machinations throughout

357
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
my society and the world.

358
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,600
I will work to achieve the perfect apocalyptic setting for his glorious return.

359
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
I just, I just started laughing harder than I've ever laughed in my life.

360
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
And like, I got dizzy.

361
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Like my vision was actually blurring.

362
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
And I thought I was having a stroke or something.

363
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
There's like a red vinerette, like around your like field of view.

364
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Yeah.

365
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
And you're taking like.

366
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Remember that horrible Dark Souls 2 effect when you enter a boss room and like the weird

367
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
red pulse appears on the edge of the screen.

368
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
It was exactly like that.

369
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Yeah.

370
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
And I almost died and I think maybe I did die.

371
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,600
And what is before you now is not the original me, but a superior version created from the

372
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,600
trauma and chaos that was birthed by this monstrosity.

373
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
And after like, and then like as soon as it was there, it was gone.

374
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Like you didn't see it again for the rest of the panel.

375
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
At the end of the panel, like all the costumes were there at the side and they were like

376
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
giving up the awards and stuff, but you didn't see big evil Fluttershy.

377
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Big evil Fluttershy.

378
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
It seems impossible considering the size.

379
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Yeah.

380
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
It just went off stage and disappeared and it was never seen again.

381
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,600
But after the panel, when you guys all went off some direction, I had like a spider sense.

382
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
You know, it had planted its seed in my brain.

383
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
So now I can always sense it's present.

384
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
So I knew where to go.

385
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,600
So I was like a rat in a maze that was cloned from another rat that had already completed

386
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
the maze.

387
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Exactly where to go to find big evil Fluttershy.

388
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,600
And I ended up alone in an elevator with big evil Fluttershy.

389
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,600
And at first, you know, I dare not speak out of turn amongst my Lord.

390
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I dare not bother it.

391
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,600
But after the elevator ride, I couldn't hold back my excitement anymore and I flagged it

392
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
down and I'm like big evil Fluttershy.

393
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Big evil Fluttershy.

394
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,600
It's me, your favorite thrall, endless chess, global icon and national treasure.

395
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Here to do your bidding.

396
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,600
And I saw it without its head on without its head.

397
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
And what was what was under the head?

398
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I will never say I will never speak the true identity of big evil Fluttershy.

399
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
It's better left the imagination.

400
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
But it was glorious.

401
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
And I'm like big evil Fluttershy.

402
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Can you please for my familia at home?

403
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Can you can you put on?

404
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Can you once more don the big evil Fluttershy head and take a picture with me?

405
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,600
And it graciously accepted my humble request and I did get a selfie with big evil Fluttershy.

406
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
And it was the peak of my life.

407
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
The greatest moment.

408
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Oblivion, get that in there.

409
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
We got to get all these.

410
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,600
But by the way, while the like the rankings were finishing up, they were like announcing

411
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
a third place in the costume contest.

412
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
It was some whatever crazy Luna Celestia fusion thing.

413
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Second place was, I don't know, some like Pinkie Pie thing.

414
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,600
And as like as they're like, okay, and the winner of the cut, we're all chanting big evil Fluttershy.

415
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Big evil Fluttershy.

416
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Big evil Fluttershy.

417
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
It was not.

418
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
It was some other idiot.

419
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
But you know, Jesse, while that was happening, while you were making your whips and quips,

420
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Michelle leaned over to me, you know, my girlfriend at this time and said to me, Jesse is really funny.

421
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
And at that moment, two things happened.

422
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
My IQ plummeted to zero.

423
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
And my rage surged to levels never before seen by man.

424
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
And I knew you had to die.

425
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,600
There was no way I could let you live after she said this to me.

426
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
But I thought I would leave you until you were in a vulnerable position.

427
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
But alas, you did not let your guard down.

428
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
So watch your fucking back.

429
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
The picture of my Lord Big Evil Fluttershy.

430
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Ha ha, get cut.

431
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Green garden.

432
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
That was a great time.

433
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Where the girls in the pool is so apt for this entire thing.

434
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Since all is just funneled into this convenience area, like like housed the slaughterhouse,

435
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,600
ready to fucking finger each other and get our tongues up all up inside some brony mouth and ass at the Brony Conhorgy.

436
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
And we go inside and we just slowly look around as we see the people around us.

437
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,600
And we realize there will be no fingering or tongue and ass here.

438
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
In fact, there will be nothing but your eyes firmly planted at the ground

439
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,600
as you do the virgin walk up and down the escalators.

440
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Try not to notice the people around you who will surely rip out your eyes

441
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
and pull out your intestine if you were to look at them the wrong way.

442
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
It was literally a nightmare.

443
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,600
As long as you equip the sacred red badge of do not approach me,

444
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
you have an impervious bubble that no one can penetrate.

445
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I didn't feel like Brony Con was like a nightmare.

446
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I mean, yes, it's full of freaks and autists and fat, crazy people who don't know how to dress.

447
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
For sure.

448
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Or how to bathe.

449
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Or to talk.

450
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Yeah, yeah.

451
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
It's like it's on the surface.

452
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
On the surface, it's a nightmare.

453
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
But there's something about it.

454
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I mean, I had just come to Brony Con from retard camp.

455
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
So I had been like...

456
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
I forgot.

457
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I had been like taking care of disabled people.

458
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
So I was in the zone at the time.

459
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
And just seeing all these people is just like, yeah, it's normal.

460
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Yeah, they're just people.

461
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
They're just people.

462
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Oh, no.

463
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,600
So it was like, this was like a desensitized to it?

464
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Yeah, a little bit.

465
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
It's just like I wasn't like blown away by how freaky people were.

466
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
It was just sort of like, yeah, ponies are cool.

467
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Everyone's having fun.

468
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
This is great.

469
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
I really love the atmosphere.

470
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I love the atmosphere of just like acceptance and like blind like love.

471
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Alright, bro.

472
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Yeah.

473
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
It was really stupid and I liked it.

474
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Okay, listen.

475
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
No, I was funny.

476
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Yeah, I had a great time for the record the whole weekend.

477
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
No, of course, sure.

478
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I want to illustrate the kind of people that we were there because it wasn't just like

479
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
they were like kind of weird.

480
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Okay, for instance, the first night while I'm getting my badges, there's a person behind

481
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
us.

482
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
There's two people actually who I never turned around to look at because I knew if I were

483
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
to look at them, there would be something wrong.

484
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Like just something bad would happen.

485
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Maybe not even to me, but on the other side of the world, there would be like a terrorist

486
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
attack in China.

487
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,600
So I could only hear their voices and you know, separate from them, you know, many rose

488
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,600
back in the giant long line that was a registration for the badges.

489
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,600
There was a guy playing saxophone, you know, trying to like, like alleviate some of the

490
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
stress of being in line, you know, trying to be a fun kind of kooky guy playing megalovania

491
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,600
and other such songs, maybe smashed mouth a little bit in there, trying to have some

492
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
fun, spread some joy.

493
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,600
He was the meister for the entire line.

494
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,600
And these people, just like whenever a note would be produced from the saxophone, would

495
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:59,600
like violently shudder and like actually like exhale and be like, ah, this shouldn't be

496
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
loud.

497
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Like if it were up to me, like this wouldn't be loud in society.

498
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
They would cover their ears.

499
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,600
They would groan and they would have much disgusted look on their faces.

500
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
And like, like rock back and forth that they were hit with like a psychic wave, like a

501
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,600
blast to the shock and blast to the forehead of the temple.

502
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Like from this dude, like making music, like it wasn't bad.

503
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Like they, they had like a quote unquote like sound sensitivity trigger, which I have no

504
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
idea what that even means.

505
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
And I don't even believe it's true for these individuals specifically.

506
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Like they were just constantly just acting like everyone around them was being so annoying

507
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,600
and so uncouth and improper in line registration for bronicon.

508
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Did you see this person at any other time?

509
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Like, did you see them later?

510
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
No, never.

511
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
This was the only experience I had with them.

512
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Maybe they couldn't, maybe they couldn't hack it and they just didn't show up the next

513
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
day.

514
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Dude, okay.

515
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
They were complaining the entire time about like fun things that were happening.

516
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,600
And then when they weren't complaining to one another, they were like, the only thing

517
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
that's getting me through this is how good my nails look.

518
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Dude, look how good my nails look.

519
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Oh my God, your toes look so good, bro.

520
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
What?

521
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,600
You know, literally not to be mean to these people, but you would simply think if someone

522
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,600
is like some trauma related to sound sensitivity, a con does not seem like the right place for

523
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
them to go, right?

524
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Yeah, just wear earmuffs.

525
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Like sorry, bro, if you are at a con and you don't like con things.

526
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Yeah, it's kind of a strange choice.

527
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,600
It's just like so like incapable of nearly existing.

528
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Like just subsistence is like too hard for people at bronicon.

529
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Yeah.

530
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Like being more subsistence is way too hard.

531
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Boy, that's a big mood.

532
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,600
No, you can't say, you can't turn into Twitter like this, but you can't say things like that.

533
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I honestly said lit yesterday.

534
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
It made me sad.

535
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
It made me sad.

536
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I got the better of me.

537
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Well, you know, being around so many weak people, I think like elevated my powers because

538
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,600
all weekend, like you said, Nate, because I'm so funny, according to Michelle.

539
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Yeah, it's like all weekend, I could feel that my chakras were perfectly aligned and

540
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
my powers were at their peak.

541
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
I was at my most in my most powerful form.

542
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,600
And I think it's because like every every time that like it would have dipped, something

543
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,600
happened that like rejuvenated me and like pushed more power into me, absorbing more

544
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
souls like Shang Tsung.

545
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,600
It was like, you know, it was like seeing Lauren Faust and then seeing Big Evil Fluttershy

546
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
and like because I knew it was the last one and it was a big deal.

547
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
And it's probably the last time that we're going to see some of these people.

548
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
And the last time we're going to have a chance to like be at the big Brony Khan party.

549
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,600
It like I was like willing myself to be in a good mood, like the best possible mood the

550
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
whole time because like going to the convention, I didn't.

551
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
I was like so angry the whole week leading up to it.

552
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Like, I don't want to go.

553
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I don't want to travel.

554
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
That's exactly my yeah.

555
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
And like right up to like right up to where I got to the convention.

556
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
I was just like steaming, fuming mad.

557
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
But then I like walked in the doors and I'm like, OK, it's business time.

558
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
It's time to be like a professional.

559
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
It's time to be everyone's hero.

560
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
It's time to be global icon and national treasure.

561
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,600
The horse, you fucking king and shake everybody's hand and kiss everybody's baby and have

562
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,600
adventures and have stories to tell and fucking lose my fucking mind and go crazy and have fun.

563
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
And I will.

564
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Yeah.

565
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I will myself to be like the perfect being.

566
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,600
And thanks to the powers of all these like mystical totems that I kept running into like

567
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Faust and Big Evil Fluttershy, I was able to accomplish that herculean feat of being cool.

568
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,600
It's so disgusting being the coolest guy at Brony Khan.

569
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
We've had literally the opposite reaction because the entire like month's proceeding.

570
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I was like, dude, Brony Khan.

571
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Well, I can't wait to fucking get crime through Brony Khan orgy and then hang out with all

572
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,600
my friends and I'm going to meet like a whole mob of 60 people there.

573
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
And then I just like get in.

574
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I like become autistic.

575
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,600
There was something about me that like made me like want to like blend into the crowd.

576
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Like it made me regress to when I was 13 at the last Brony Khan or like, you know, whenever

577
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,600
it made me like just like being in that conventions there, being in that mindset, being in my

578
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,600
literal little space that is my little pony conventions.

579
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,600
I just receded back into the recesses in my mind and I just became the same person I was.

580
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,600
So I just became autistic and awkward the entire time and I just became like one of the masses.

581
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Like I was receded into like the mob collective of Brony Khan the entire time, just wasting away.

582
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,600
You know, at the end I was like, it's too loud here.

583
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Oh God, if we're up to me, this wouldn't be allowed.

584
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,600
At the end, after the convention was over, that's when like all the suppressed race

585
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,600
and hate started flooding back like all at once.

586
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Because like it's not like there were no annoying things that happened during the weekend.

587
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,600
But it's that like every annoying thing that happened, I didn't notice because I was willing

588
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
myself not to and I was pushing it all down.

589
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,600
And like the second that I like woke up the day after the convention, it was like the valve

590
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
had turned and it all came pouring back.

591
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,600
All the fucking first of all, all the physical pain and sickness and age that I've been suppressing

592
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,600
when I was like reliving my glory days and my youth at the convention.

593
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
And secondly, all the pent up rage from the whole ordeal.

594
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
And like, like I woke up the day after the after the convention.

595
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
I woke up like in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep.

596
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
And I felt it.

597
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
I felt that I had a fucking sore throat.

598
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,600
And I'm like, oh my, like just instantly pure rage at having a sore throat because there's

599
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,600
nothing more heinous on this earth.

600
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,600
And I'm just thinking, oh my God, which one of you fucking mutants shook my hand and had

601
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
a fucking disease?

602
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,600
And now I'm going to be living with this for a fucking month.

603
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Just like just hating all things.

604
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,600
And then I fucking went to the airport and I got on a plane and there was a child behind

605
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,600
me, just the whole flight home going, where we going, mommy, where we going, mommy, mommy,

606
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
where we going, where we going.

607
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Oh, you want a minge?

608
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah, just like right in my ear, like a dentist drill.

609
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,600
And I'm just like, I almost went through the gate home at the airport in handcuffs because

610
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I was about to chuck that fucking infant out the window, that nine year old or whatever

611
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
infant.

612
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,600
I almost committed a murder on the plane.

613
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
And then I got home and I've just been sick and mad and fucking sad the whole time because

614
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
I'm not at RooneyCon anymore.

615
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,600
I'm not at my post con mortal agony because I'm not in my element anymore.

616
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,600
The one place that I'm an important person and everyone thinks I'm cool.

617
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,600
You know, it's almost like some people like work better when dealing with actual human

618
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,600
beings one on one as opposed to on Twitter or social media.

619
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
It's almost like that.

620
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,600
It's a more natural, like better way to deal with the world to do it in person.

621
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
What's this gobbledygook you're trying to dispense with?

622
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
I know.

623
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
I know.

624
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
It's hard to imagine.

625
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Anyway, time to go sit and tweet to Bernie and ask him for his cockpicks.

626
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,600
The theme of mine, Bernie Kahn, was one of positive character development.

627
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Because the last time I went, I mean, I am still like a shy person, but back then I was

628
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
like, I'm crying right now, guys.

629
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
What are you going to do about it?

630
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Are you going to change my diet before me?

631
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
You know, it's really funny.

632
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,600
It was the first time traveling alone, first time in America, first time meeting all of

633
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
you.

634
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Because you only went once before, right?

635
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Yeah.

636
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,600
And also first time having to say, oh, hi, you like my work?

637
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Cool.

638
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Right.

639
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Right.

640
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,600
And so every experience I had that wasn't as a complete embarrassment felt like a victory

641
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
to me.

642
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,600
So I guess that's why my spirits were so high the whole time.

643
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,600
There were multiple moments where I did something that I wouldn't have done last time, like when

644
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,600
I saw the Susie from Delta Rune cosplayer and I was like, I'm going to go compliment her.

645
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Because last time-

646
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
Oh, that was a perfect comparison to the previous one.

647
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,600
The very distinct moment where I think, I don't remember who of us saw.

648
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,600
The last Bernie Kahn, there was a cool Raven cosplayer and she looked really good and none

649
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,600
of us went over to say, hey, that's really cool.

650
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
And we just looked at her from afar.

651
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
I mean, she knows it's really cool.

652
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Whatever.

653
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I know.

654
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
But this time I felt like I should do the thing that's more difficult and I went over

655
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
and complimented her and I got a picture.

656
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,600
And that was cool and I felt really cool about it.

657
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Way to go.

658
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Way to go.

659
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,600
And I felt comfortable walking around the artist alleys by myself instead of like staying

660
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
with a group cos it's fine.

661
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
I can meet people.

662
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I can find people.

663
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I have a phone that works in America now.

664
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I don't have to be worried about like not being able to call anyone.

665
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,600
So, yeah, like everything was great.

666
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,600
I- Oh, and here's my big thing.

667
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,600
APSAdventures.site, my webcomic website thing.

668
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I had a punk the plush with me.

669
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Rest in peace, the Kickstarter for that.

670
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
But it doesn't matter.

671
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,600
I had the plush and I had a bunch of leaflets that I had made previously and there was like

672
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,600
25 to 50 of them.

673
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,600
And I tried my best to hand them out to as many cool people as possible.

674
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I think I have a list here of like notable ones.

675
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Lauren Faust, I stood in line to get a signature but I said, I fuck the signature.

676
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Could you have this and you become a fan of me please?

677
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
So that was cool.

678
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Hell yeah.

679
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,600
I saw Emma Larson scurrying around acting like blending in because he looks like one of them.

680
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Dude, as the con ended, he was like the first guy out the door.

681
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,600
We saw him like sprinting off away out of BrodyCon forever in the back of your mirror.

682
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,600
I saw him slinking around and I walked up to him and say, hey, did you have this?

683
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
And he's like, yeah, sure.

684
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,600
So I don't know whether he's going to read that but I gave it to him.

685
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
I found SaberSpark and handed it to him.

686
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,600
I love Compossible a lot, famous KP.

687
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Thank you, KP.

688
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Thank you, KP.

689
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Riddle My Ass Batman showed up.

690
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I gave one to him.

691
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Of course.

692
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Oh man, we saw so many capers with Riddle My Ass Batman.

693
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
We riddled so many asses.

694
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
Past analysis, British Ninja.

695
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Dr. Wolfe, I gave one to.

696
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
Kazy said something about my conversation with Dr. Wolfe.

697
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,600
She was watching and Dr. Wolfe sort of leers over you with condescending eyes

698
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,600
and like a more Santa word if you're sitting on his knees saying I won.

699
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
He has the eyes of a predator.

700
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
He's like a skinner.

701
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Like a wolf, dare I say.

702
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Dr. Wolfe, all I want for Christmas is for you to review my web comic.

703
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,600
And he's like, ah, okay, I'll get around to that.

704
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Ah, okay.

705
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
He lied.

706
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
APS Adventures?

707
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,600
I've heard the name, but beyond that.

708
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Oh, the Ice Cold Water Man.

709
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
He was selling Ice Cold Water.

710
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,600
I gave him my leaflet and he didn't get it at first, but I stood there explaining it.

711
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
It's like it's a comic.

712
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Like you can go, you can read it and it's like, are you selling anything on there?

713
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Yeah, sure.

714
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
It's like, okay, I'll give it a look.

715
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
So, you know, he's got it.

716
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
As long as you're selling something.

717
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
As long as you're like, you know, I was advertising.

718
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
He didn't understand advertising if there wasn't selling.

719
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
It was like, what are you selling?

720
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Ice Cold Water Man was involved with perhaps the emotional highlight of the entire arc.

721
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Oh yeah, we will get to that.

722
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,600
I mean, I did give one to Miss Anthropony as well.

723
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,600
And Chad, AKA like the meme Chad guy.

724
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Yeah, Cosplay Chad, whose name was Nate, by the way.

725
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
His name was Nate.

726
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
That was a really cool guy.

727
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
There was lots of really cool guys.

728
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,600
The only other person I have written down here is Ephraim.

729
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Even though like, he's not any more significant than the other people that I gave the leaflet to.

730
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,600
He's just like, the most prominent that I could think of.

731
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Yeah.

732
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,600
And yeah, I gave the leaflet to a bunch of IRCK people and some friends of some other pony-reviewed people.

733
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,600
It was just like, yeah, I am advertising.

734
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Lauren Faust is now a biggest fan of Bailjap.

735
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Please go read it.

736
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
She's drawing fan art right now.

737
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Speaking of RFCK people, let's talk about Slimehouse.

738
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Oh well, I want to talk about Slimehouse on the RFCK that will be recorded.

739
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
But we can mention a brief here.

740
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Well, I'm not going to mention everyone because there was a lot of people and I'll forget someone, I'm sure.

741
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,600
But there was a house of like 12 or 13 people just came along in case you don't know.

742
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
They were just RFCK people.

743
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
13, like Organization 13?

744
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Yeah, it was.

745
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Oh my gosh, fuck yes.

746
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
And they were not pony people.

747
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Like one of them had like ever seen My Little Pony before.

748
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,600
They were just there for basically an RFCK con at Brony.

749
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Yeah, I'm pretty sure T-Fab has probably seen My Little Pony once or twice.

750
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Good man.

751
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah.

752
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
It was so much, I was so glad.

753
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Dude, it was the best part of the con.

754
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
They made it so much more fun.

755
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
It was the best part of the con.

756
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Yeah, by far.

757
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,600
I mean, we had a literal gang around us like the entire time we were at BronyCon.

758
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
It was fucking sick.

759
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
They were awesome.

760
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,600
We could easily dominate any group with our like-

761
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Dr. Wolf should have tried fucking with us and see what happened.

762
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
And Levy Jevy gave me a bunch of communist pins.

763
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,600
He brought like a big box of like old like pins from like communist states and he just

764
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
was like, yeah, just take as many as you want.

765
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
It took like five.

766
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
It was awesome.

767
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
That's sick.

768
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,600
It was so great because the people at Slimehouse are like OG RFCK people and like they know

769
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
what's up and so it was great being able to talk to them.

770
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,600
It was great being able to like, there was one point I forget what I was doing.

771
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
The Gen-1ers.

772
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
They were like all Gen-1ers.

773
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Yeah, yeah.

774
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
I was like walking around.

775
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I was trying to do something specifically.

776
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,600
I might have been looking for Miss Anthropony or I might have been doing something else.

777
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
But the point is I didn't want to talk to anyone.

778
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
And so there was some dude that was like, hey, Munchy, is that you?

779
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
And I was like, yep.

780
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
And I just kept on walking at one point.

781
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Come on, dude.

782
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
You got to say hi or something.

783
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
No, no.

784
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,600
I said like, yo, hey, and then I kept on walking.

785
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,600
But the point is, is that like that was like, you know, that's the PCP had experience.

786
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,600
But like the RFCK had experience where like I like real, they say slime once and then

787
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
I'm all up in them and we just hang out all the entire time.

788
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
And it's great.

789
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
It's a great time.

790
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
And they were great to hang out with.

791
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,600
And after the con on last day at the pier, well, me, Hippo and Ben and Cassie were all

792
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
waiting for our Greyhound bus.

793
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
We're just hanging out in the Baltimore Harbor and it was great.

794
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
It was a great time.

795
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Oh yeah.

796
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Well that last night just like chilling on the harbor was the best.

797
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Yeah, it was.

798
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Yeah, it was red.

799
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
That was nice.

800
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Too bad we left a little bit before that, me and Michelle.

801
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Yeah.

802
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,600
But you know, just on this subject, there was just a whole bunch of people who came to

803
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
BronyCon specifically to like see us.

804
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Yeah.

805
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
There were many people who fit that description.

806
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Oh, there was people who watched my stream, Juicy Shack Meet.

807
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Oh, Russell was there.

808
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Russell was there.

809
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Russell himself in all his ghostly glory.

810
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,100
If anyone watches my stream, Juicy Shack Meet and his fiance who he proposed to live on

811
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,100
my stream or at least was updating as he did it.

812
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
That was there.

813
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Those two were there.

814
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
It was great.

815
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,500
I can't remember everybody, but that was, this is just why Munchy's idea of going to

816
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:27,700
BronyCon, like I don't care about the ponies, I'm totally over it, but just have a unifying

817
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:33,100
place where people can meet, which is kind of what the point of a con is in general.

818
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,760
Honestly, the main thing for me is that it really has my gears were and thinking about

819
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,000
some sort of like PCP meetup specifically for like all, it's not just for PCP heads,

820
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,040
but everyone in the extended PCP universe getting together in one place would sure be

821
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,760
a dope thing without the distraction of outside forces like BronyCon or whatever.

822
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,440
I am a little sad that it was the last one and there's not going to be another chance

823
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,560
to go to it and see all those people again.

824
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,160
Just go to Trotcon, dude.

825
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Trotcon's in October.

826
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Yeah, you're right.

827
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
What is that?

828
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Made up country, like fucking Baselvania or some shit.

829
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Yeah, Maryland.

830
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm sick of hearing about all these fake conventions and fake quarters of the world.

831
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Oh, shout outs to Tarbuck Transom, the belt man.

832
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Oh, okay.

833
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
Let me tell that story real quick.

834
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
I got that belt right here.

835
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
I'm looking at it right now.

836
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
It's fucking sick.

837
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Okay.

838
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
All right.

839
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Listen up, lads.

840
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
I've got the story pulled up right in front of me.

841
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,560
So let me just tell you real quick.

842
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,880
So me and Michelle both, just a preliminary thing.

843
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,560
We both cosplayed like most of the days.

844
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,320
And so Michelle cosplayed as keg standard Phantom Horm and he made it to BronyCon.

845
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:47,160
One Brony Curious was there live as a Rule 63 gender swap version.

846
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Way to go, Michelle.

847
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
Tom lives on through you.

848
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,960
Rest is soul.

849
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
And so I was there.

850
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
I don't know.

851
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,160
I did like a keg standard thing, whatever.

852
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,080
But okay, the biggest thing was I was there in an eight slime corp executive suit.

853
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
Yes.

854
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
I did like Katana.

855
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,080
My Sheen Eye.

856
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
It was glorious.

857
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
And he made those paper pins for everyone.

858
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Oh, of course.

859
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Yeah.

860
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I made a bunch.

861
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I made myself slime corp pins to hand out.

862
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,080
One of which I gifted to Miss Anthropony, of course.

863
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
Indeed.

864
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Indeed.

865
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
As a show of good faith.

866
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,640
It was wonderful.

867
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
And okay.

868
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,760
So I'm wearing my fucking suit.

869
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,200
I'm going out there looking like a million bucks oblivion.

870
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,520
I'm going to need you to add some visuals for this.

871
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,400
But I look down like halfway through the day, whatever, I stand up, I unbutton my shirt

872
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
to walk around or something.

873
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,960
I notice I'm not wearing a fucking belt.

874
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,360
I can't believe my standard issue slime corp belt is nowhere to be found.

875
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,400
And I'm looking, frankly, strictly unprofessional.

876
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,960
And it makes me want to kill myself.

877
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,800
It's a nightmare.

878
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,120
When all of a sudden, he had already happened to walk up to me, one mysterious man with

879
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
a large suitcase.

880
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,120
I don't know what he's doing.

881
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,120
He said, hey, nice to meet you.

882
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Hey, I like your stuff.

883
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Okay.

884
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,120
Thanks.

885
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,120
What's up, man?

886
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
I stand there.

887
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I say, oh my God, I forgot my belt.

888
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,000
He says, would you like me to make you one?

889
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,520
This man, this man was a humble belt Smith.

890
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,840
This was not a setup.

891
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
This was not a scheme.

892
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
This was not a ruse.

893
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,480
I literally realized I didn't have a belt.

894
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,400
He says, I literally will make you a belt on the spot right here.

895
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,600
And by the way, I don't know if people remember this specifically, but this was on a holy ground

896
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,080
because we were in the area, like on the first and possibly the second brony cons were like,

897
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,360
I mean, to me, this is holy ground where we all like hung out the whole time.

898
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,520
There was this balcony.

899
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,360
It was, it was at that sacred spot, the chair, the chair place.

900
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
That's right.

901
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,560
The chair place where you can overlook like the, the main entrance, everybody comes in

902
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,560
and stuff.

903
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,000
It was on this, this hallowed ground where this event took place.

904
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Oh, and by the way, Michelle was unconscious from drinking too much on the floor for this

905
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,760
entire episode and missed the entire thing, but was right next to me.

906
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Hilarious.

907
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Oblivion, edit that in.

908
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
She'll love it.

909
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,080
Um, so the point was right there in front of me, he opens a suitcase, he pulls out his

910
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,280
wares and his tinctures and his potions and his lashes and immediately goes to work measuring

911
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,160
and like measuring my waist to know how much he needs and fucking folding the fabric.

912
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,880
And he has this wooden contraption where Tarbuck Transom, of course, is his name.

913
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,320
And what he does is there's a link in the show notes to the whole Twitter thread.

914
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Go buy this.

915
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
This man's fucking wares.

916
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,240
He's a magic man.

917
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,560
His shtick is he weaves first of all, he's like a handyman of the stars.

918
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,240
But what he does is he uses this wooden contraption and the idea is he makes like like cloth and

919
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,240
belts and necklaces and stuff in the style that a pony would be able to from my little

920
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
pony.

921
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
This is like the conceit.

922
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,760
Now I don't know if this work because he definitely needed fingers to do this, but it's close

923
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
enough.

924
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,240
This wooden L shape that he like hangs the belt off of and like weaves it towards him

925
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,440
like a fucking like a like Don Flamengo puppeting the entire population of Dressrosa from one

926
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
piece.

927
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,280
And basically he just weaves a belt in front of me like like like Charlotte's Web and

928
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,080
gives them it's perfectly black matches my suit perfectly.

929
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,280
I put it on and my honor is restored.

930
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,880
Slime Corp is no longer disgraced on this day.

931
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,720
He saved Slime Corp.

932
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,360
He saved our profits.

933
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,800
There's no greater prize to be saved in this world.

934
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,880
So thank you Tarbuck Transom and people unironically go click the link to the Twitter thread I

935
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,600
made about this.

936
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,080
Just listen to this one little phrase about how I'm describing it as he's weaving this

937
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
belt.

938
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,880
Okay, here's here's from the Twitter thread.

939
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:40,440
And I say with my puny monkey brain, I struggled to comprehend the IRL birth of a new universe

940
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,920
I was witnessing.

941
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,040
Alas, I could only gaze, slack-jawed, and pray that God would forgive this man who dared

942
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,960
create such wonders in defiance of his law.

943
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,520
This was me witnessing the belt being woven before my eyes.

944
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,520
Scroll down.

945
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,080
I have links to like his his fucking cards and stuff.

946
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,920
If you want a holy relic of a belt or a necklace or like a wristband or whatever, look up Tarbuck

947
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
Transom.

948
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,920
He's your man.

949
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
He's a god.

950
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,920
He's a saint.

951
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,320
He also gave me and Munchie a po-nut pins.

952
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,960
And if you don't know what that is, a po-nut is a horse butthole.

953
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Oh my god.

954
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,960
It's funny.

955
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Oh, that's what those were.

956
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
He asked me.

957
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,760
Oh, Tarbuck, you were such a pure man until this very moment.

958
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,600
He shows, he takes out a satchel, right?

959
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,720
He takes out a small satchel containing who knows what.

960
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,240
And he says like, I don't know.

961
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,680
And he just says like, I'm like, oh, what's, I made some joke about, I don't remember what

962
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,680
I said was in the sack.

963
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,640
And he's like, actually, it's full of horse buttholes.

964
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,320
And I'm like, all right.

965
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,880
And so he takes them out and he's like, here you go.

966
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,320
And he's little, these little pins, little buttons, horse buttholes, a mother and daughter,

967
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,320
a twilight sparkle.

968
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Yeah, you got Twilight Velvet, mom.

969
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
And Twilight Velvet.

970
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,840
And he gives us each one.

971
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,680
And I'm like, all right, sick, and I wore it for the rest of the con.

972
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,760
And also, the first day, like first thing that happens before we saw Chris Chan, oh yeah,

973
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,760
we all saw Chris Chan.

974
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
We met Chris Chan.

975
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,440
We took pictures with the lady herself.

976
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,520
And Christine, fuck, wait, where's my Chris Chan still?

977
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

978
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,000
We were talking about Tarbuck and the pussy thing.

979
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yes, okay.

980
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,040
So he, oh, the button, no, first thing that happened before that even happened, like right

981
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,880
through the door, someone puts a sticker on Munchie's back that says, I love ponut.

982
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,080
Yeah, I don't know who did this, I don't know how it happened.

983
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,440
But instead of a heart for love, it's a ponut.

984
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
It's a bottle.

985
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Oh, of course.

986
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,640
Like, so you take it off and I take that shit and I slap it on the back of my phone and

987
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,800
it's still there.

988
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,040
That's like my eye, my eye, my eye ponut, ponut sticker is going to be with me for a

989
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,680
long, long time.

990
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,120
You know, a sales spiked for our boy Tarbuck.

991
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,840
When I started telling the story, but they've plummeted back down to zero.

992
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,520
No, no, no, don't worry, don't worry.

993
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,200
He was a hero to me as well.

994
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,840
Because see, like I came to like, in the vendors hall, I was at this place and they had prints

995
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,680
and I'm like, oh, I want that prints.

996
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,360
And the guy at the vendor's thing was like, oh, okay, here's a ticket, come back in a

997
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,440
half hour.

998
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,400
So I'll print it off for you and I'm like, wait a minute, you're telling me I got a,

999
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,960
I was just about to be out of this hall.

1000
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,040
I got to come back now in a half hour.

1001
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,080
Every other, every other booth has prints at the ready.

1002
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,240
You didn't warn me that I'd have to wait for your ass.

1003
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,760
So I'm, I'm steaming mad.

1004
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,260
I'm steaming mad.

1005
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,840
So then I come back there a half an hour and he still hasn't finished my print.

1006
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,440
I'm like, how long does it take to print off a picture of a flutter shy, you son of

1007
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,440
a bitch?

1008
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,440
I'm fucking, I'm furious.

1009
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,440
I'm so mad.

1010
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
I'm going to lose my fucking shit.

1011
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:45,480
But luckily Tarbuck happens to also be at that same booth and he's like, you know what?

1012
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,480
This is bullshit.

1013
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,920
I'm going to get you your print right now.

1014
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,120
And he like rushes off to the printing machines and he just does it himself in like two minutes.

1015
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,520
And I'm like, what a hero.

1016
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,720
And also I left my energy drink there and he kept it for me.

1017
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,920
He didn't pee or poop or spit in it or anything.

1018
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,840
As far as you know, speaking of leaving energy drinks, Munchy, I left my fucking berry quake

1019
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,840
in your bag.

1020
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,840
It's still in there.

1021
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,040
You better fucking guard that thing.

1022
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,160
And also he got me a belt as well.

1023
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,720
I like, I just saw him.

1024
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,480
I ran into him another time and he was wearing a belt and it was like a red and gold like

1025
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,840
Lannister colors custom belt with like the Lannister symbol belt buckle and it looked

1026
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
really cool.

1027
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,280
And I just like absent mind like, like, Hey man, that's a cool belt.

1028
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
And he's like, you wanted it.

1029
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,280
And I'm like, what?

1030
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,640
And he just took it off and gave it to me.

1031
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,360
And so now I have a cool belt around his ankles and waddled off.

1032
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,800
Truly the element of generosity.

1033
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,760
Oh, it's so true.

1034
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,960
It's so true.

1035
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,680
He really was.

1036
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,240
We should literally do, you know what, Tarbuck?

1037
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,160
We should like, we should like partner with him to make like PCP brand belts, like the

1038
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
PCP belt.

1039
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,160
Oh my.

1040
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,160
We can go for him.

1041
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,160
That's a fascinating idea.

1042
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,160
It's a swell idea there.

1043
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,160
Yeah.

1044
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,200
It's made.

1045
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,400
Hey, let's talk real quick about the, the live action gang warfare that took place.

1046
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Okay.

1047
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,000
There were some highlights of that, of that exchange, specifically me when I fucking

1048
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
killed you, Ethan.

1049
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Yeah.

1050
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You think I'm going to let this go?

1051
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
No.

1052
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
I fucking took a picture of you and you're dead.

1053
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,720
I was literally solid snake.

1054
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,720
I was, okay.

1055
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,000
There was a gang warfare going on between the killers and the rowdies, obviously.

1056
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,520
And it was photo.

1057
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,520
What would you call it?

1058
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,360
Picture tag or photo tag or something?

1059
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:29,280
I mean, you have to shoot the other player with a camera, but it's based on picture

1060
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
tag or something.

1061
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,400
You post a picture, you post it in the discord chat and whoever does it first, then you're

1062
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
dead.

1063
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,440
It's an elimination challenge.

1064
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
That's right.

1065
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,440
That's right.

1066
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,440
So, okay.

1067
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Cassey won.

1068
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,440
Yay.

1069
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,440
Great for you, Cassey.

1070
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,440
You piece of shit.

1071
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,440
But better than that, more interesting.

1072
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,080
Who got the picture of you like bolting?

1073
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,080
That was Cassey.

1074
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,080
That was okay.

1075
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
That's what I'm getting to.

1076
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,080
So I kill Ethan.

1077
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,680
I'm literally the sneakiest man.

1078
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,160
I'm gonna just paint the picture real quick.

1079
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,600
This is going on for like an hour.

1080
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,280
I am hardcore camping in the dealer's room.

1081
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
It was great.

1082
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,800
I'm standing at this one great little corner where I can see a bunch of access points to

1083
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,280
the fucking dealer's room.

1084
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,400
And I've got my eyes peeled.

1085
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,640
The problem is, I don't know any of these fucking unpopular, no-name fucking rowdies.

1086
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,560
Who the fuck even are you people?

1087
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,080
Develop a YouTube presence already, if that would be really convenient.

1088
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,080
Also real quick.

1089
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,440
All the rowdies didn't like post their pictures in that chat the way like all the killers

1090
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
did.

1091
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
That seemed fucked up.

1092
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
What are you talking about?

1093
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
What are you talking about?

1094
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,280
All the killers right before we started posted pictures.

1095
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,520
Why didn't the rowdies do that?

1096
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,360
Because we had all sized up each other right before it started.

1097
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,560
You weren't there at the beginning and you weren't listening to the rules.

1098
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,920
Which would have come handy specifically for you because you would have been able to get

1099
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,480
a lot of revives because you wouldn't have been yourself.

1100
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,720
That's definitely true.

1101
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
I would have run.

1102
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,600
There was a whole section of the stream where we like take, like we like look at each other

1103
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,960
to know what each other looks like.

1104
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,920
Okay, well then why did all the killers specifically go out of their way to post their pictures?

1105
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,720
Because a bunch of new people got recruited and they had to post their pictures as soon

1106
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,720
as they were recruited.

1107
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Exactly.

1108
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,720
Okay, fine.

1109
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,360
But point is, so I was just camping and whatever, everyone's dying, I'm watching in the chat

1110
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,560
as people are dropping, left, right and center, Ethan, I see him coming around the corner.

1111
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,960
He's in hardcore maximum gamer mode.

1112
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,800
He is crouching, he is stalking, he is hiding behind things, he's got his peepers popped,

1113
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,000
he's in every direction simultaneously.

1114
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,840
But that fool, he dips into the bathroom and I knew, I knew this was my chansu.

1115
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,640
So I just go, I go to the corner, around the corner as the door leads out back into the

1116
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,000
dealer's hall and I camp there in darkness praying, he doesn't look around the corner,

1117
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,800
he doesn't, as we say in the biz, check his six as he leaves the bathroom and he did not

1118
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,520
that fool and I get endless pictures of him leaving like a dunce.

1119
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,800
So that's how you do it in the big leagues, lads.

1120
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,000
Okay, but then I see people being like, oh, I gotta, Steve is like, I gotta get into the

1121
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
dealer's hall.

1122
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,760
How am I supposed to get into the dealer's hall?

1123
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,960
I'm camping there waiting to stop any fucking piece of shit rowdy who tries to get into the

1124
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,960
dealer's hall.

1125
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,120
And as I turn my back for one split fucking second, Kazi literally cheating, having revived

1126
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,080
already, oh quote, following the rules, yeah, whatever, suck my dick.

1127
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,040
She comes back and she says, I see her and my phone is down, I'm looking away for one

1128
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,680
half a split fucking second, I see her, eyes go wide with awe that she may have the chance

1129
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,260
to capture the rarest of beasts, me, Nate Bestman, and her phone goes up faster than

1130
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,280
mine can, so I know my only option is to sprint out of there and pray some of these colossal

1131
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,240
land whales will block the line of sight so I don't get captured.

1132
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,160
But alas, despite my incredible speed, oblivion put this on screen, it just wasn't enough

1133
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,400
and she got me and you know what, good kill, good kill, Kazi.

1134
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,160
That's a great picture nonetheless.

1135
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:55,040
The image of forgetting you is so incredible because you are just mid-sprint, you are, it's

1136
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,600
like a gazelle, Gavilan is a man.

1137
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,040
Let me post it in the fucking thing, there it is, there.

1138
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,520
The caption is simply, that feel when.

1139
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
That feel when?

1140
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,560
And you know, people are going and they're posting all kinds of things, that feel when

1141
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,120
someone mentions yang gang, I think a frame posted that, I don't know, that feel when

1142
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,400
someone criticizes capitalism, you know, he's there, the boy is there.

1143
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,720
Oh, this is me and my keg standard cosplay incident.

1144
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,480
Oh my god, this is so incredible.

1145
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,240
Look at my foot is off the ground, I'm clearly pivoting on my left foot, my muscles rippling

1146
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,040
as I'm speeding up, it's like, you ever see that, that animatrix-

1147
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,560
It's like a real statue.

1148
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,840
It is, it is, you ever see that animatrix thing of like that black rile like racer

1149
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:43,200
guy, that Olympic runner, and like his muscles are rippling, yeah, literally me, literally

1150
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,520
me escaping the matrix.

1151
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,120
I think if you look closely at this picture, you can see me physically moving, breaking

1152
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,360
free of the confines of this picture.

1153
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,280
You can see the lines of code around you as you're picking through the machines.

1154
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,960
But it wasn't enough in a Titanfell that day, the Ratties took the victory.

1155
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
They did, they did.

1156
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,960
It was a resounding victory.

1157
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,440
Please just analyze with me.

1158
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,680
All three real life gang violence is Ratties have won.

1159
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,440
All four slime fest, Ratties have won.

1160
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,880
Is there a single victory the killers can point to in any regard?

1161
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,680
Yeah, the moral victory every single time, every single time.

1162
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,280
We are morally undefeated.

1163
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:31,720
No, no, actually, because Ballard, who got me, I didn't, like this guy was wearing like

1164
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,600
a pink and purple, green, like Hawaiian shirt.

1165
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,680
I didn't know him, and I didn't know whether he was a killer or a rowdy, but I took a picture

1166
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,400
of him and I was uploading it.

1167
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,080
And he hadn't seen me.

1168
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,720
And I asked him, you know, are you a rowdy?

1169
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,000
Because I can't actually tell, I'll stop your picture upload if you're a rowdy.

1170
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And he's like, yeah, he wasn't a rowdy, he was a killer, so he clearly didn't win the

1171
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
moral victory on that.

1172
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,480
Hey, lying is within the rules.

1173
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,560
Lying is absolutely fair game in this gang warfare lifestyle.

1174
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

1175
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,600
That's the moral victory to me.

1176
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,920
I want to have a call out post.

1177
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,280
According to the RFCK people who knew this was happening for literal months, they couldn't

1178
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,080
follow the simple rules of wearing your gang colors, and it made me genuinely feel like

1179
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,080
purple.

1180
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,080
I didn't fucking know this was happening.

1181
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,720
It made me so mad that like no one paid attention to that rule, and I hate them all.

1182
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,400
So you're welcome for being so bad at everything.

1183
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
That's fair.

1184
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,400
That's fair.

1185
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,640
Um, that was, that was like one of the highlights of the con before that me and Ben put up all

1186
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,400
these flyers that I had made for Slam Corp and they were super cool and they were there

1187
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,760
until the end of the con.

1188
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,760
They were there until the end of the con.

1189
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,760
It was great.

1190
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,760
Dude, post some of those pictures.

1191
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,520
A couple of them got taken down, but a few of them, like most of them stayed around and

1192
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,800
like we're still there at the very end.

1193
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,200
Yeah, I found a couple.

1194
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,600
It was like finding, it was like finding Easter eggs.

1195
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
Yeah.

1196
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,600
It was cool.

1197
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,400
Someone joined the server, at least one person actually joined the server because of them.

1198
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
That's dope.

1199
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
That's dope.

1200
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
We did it.

1201
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
We did it boys.

1202
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Um, it was awesome.

1203
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
Yeah, dude, sick.

1204
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,400
What else did they just say?

1205
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,400
I mean, what else do we do?

1206
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,400
I mean, there's like, there's like a ton of little stories in a ton.

1207
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
There's tons, yeah.

1208
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,400
It was one of those things where it's like you should have been there.

1209
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,400
I mean, all of the joys aren't, you know, necessarily antidote so there are certainly

1210
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
more.

1211
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,400
I mean, there are thousands that we could tell, but like most of the fun was just being

1212
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,900
there with everyone, you know, being with all of our fans and all of our friends, just

1213
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,400
hanging out around BronyCon.

1214
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
It was great.

1215
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,400
If I had to give one prescription, if I think there's one thing to take away from this,

1216
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,440
it's that look, I understand not everybody had the money to like fly to BronyCon and

1217
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,440
not everybody.

1218
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,840
Like we didn't promise we'd do anything really.

1219
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,160
Like there was no guarantee.

1220
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,440
I'd simply like whenever there's opportunities, try to take them because, you know, like,

1221
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,600
oh, like we were saying, like Ben and Jesse and stuff, you know, they weren't looking

1222
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,560
forward to seem like a pain, but you know, even the pain and even the financial struggle

1223
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,480
of like trying to scrounge up money to afford stuff like this.

1224
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,640
I'm not saying be responsible with your money, but like if you can do it, you know, the pain

1225
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,400
of going there and like the exhaustion is temporary, but the memories, the memories last

1226
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
a lifetime.

1227
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,400
Yes.

1228
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,400
So try, you know.

1229
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,400
This is definitely what I was thinking.

1230
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,160
I was, I was like putting off making the decision about whether or not to go.

1231
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,520
I had made like a half decision like, oh, it's expensive to fly.

1232
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,360
I'm just, I'm, you know, whatever, I'll meet you at Radcon.

1233
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:29,200
But I kept thinking like, am I going to like enjoy these memories more or less than a couple

1234
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,200
hundred pounds?

1235
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,200
Yeah.

1236
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Like really?

1237
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,680
Like money can be made back.

1238
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,600
I can't do this again, especially since it's the last Bronycon and I do have some pony

1239
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,480
things I want to do as in like meet Lauren Faust the first time.

1240
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,480
Indeed.

1241
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,400
So like, uh, I think it was definitely worth spending the money now and having fun.

1242
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Yeah.

1243
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,800
It was, I got what I wanted out of it, which was a ton of really hilarious stories and

1244
00:56:53,800 --> 00:57:01,240
exactly adventures, even, even like the little like just side missions and were hilarious

1245
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,240
and cool.

1246
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:09,200
Finding the random, like the setup game machine and playing the Wolverine game on NES, the

1247
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,360
LG, the LGN game was in Spanish for some reason and Wolverine's going around.

1248
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,120
He has no claws in that game.

1249
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
He just jumps around.

1250
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:23,600
He's like multicolored pipes and fights like star men from earthbound and collects hamburgers

1251
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,600
for health.

1252
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,640
And at the end of every level, saber tooth shows up and starts ranting at you in Spanish.

1253
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,640
He would do that.

1254
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,640
It was dope.

1255
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,520
All the times when we walked to McDonald's and it was so fucking humid and hot, we walked

1256
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,400
to McDonald's and Ben got like 1200 quarter pounders.

1257
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,520
No, this is, this is, this is, this is the hack.

1258
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,520
This is the hack.

1259
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:50,200
You go to McDonald's, $3 for two McDoubles.

1260
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
That's sick.

1261
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,600
That's $6 for four McDoubles.

1262
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,160
You throw the buns away, $6 for eight, eight patties.

1263
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,160
It's pretty good.

1264
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,200
Well, I was with you until you said throw the buns away.

1265
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,200
You monster.

1266
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,280
Throw the buns.

1267
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,280
I know, I know.

1268
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,280
You want the buns.

1269
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,280
Poison.

1270
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,280
It'll be, we will die.

1271
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,000
The thing about the, you know, this makes me, I think about this a lot, but it's like,

1272
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,960
you know, a while ago, I'm not saying it's on the same level, not exactly equivalent,

1273
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,960
but like years ago, I decided I don't want like, for example, like a romantic, long

1274
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,440
dist relationship.

1275
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,720
If that's what like a relationship required, like for me, it would not be worth it.

1276
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,720
So like I, a long distance relationship, like some people are happy to do it.

1277
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,720
That's fine for them.

1278
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,720
I decided I don't want it.

1279
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,720
No one's happy to do it.

1280
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,720
They're all lying.

1281
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,720
Yeah.

1282
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Nobody wants to.

1283
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,720
It's not the ideal, obviously.

1284
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,720
Some people think it's worth it.

1285
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,720
Hey, that's, that's fine.

1286
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,720
That's for them.

1287
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,840
But like, I really think like one of the main reasons why is cause like, I just think there's

1288
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:47,720
something kind of essential about being around other people who you care about physically

1289
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:53,080
and kind of like, I think that these sorts of things, honestly, for us, like as a friend

1290
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:58,760
group, as the PCP, I think it's kind of really important that we too get together to kind

1291
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,640
of like, when once we're together, like everyone, when they're in real life facing each other,

1292
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,080
no one's like as mean as they can be online or like snarky.

1293
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,880
So it kind of just helps like refresh any negativity.

1294
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,880
I don't know.

1295
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,320
Like there's been a little bit of bile between me and Ben lately.

1296
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,880
I don't know about you, Ben, but I felt like totally cleansed and I was just so happy to

1297
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,600
see you and hang out with you.

1298
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,680
I was just like, what are we even arguing about?

1299
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
What does it matter?

1300
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,920
Especially the, with this group in particular, because with this like friend group, the, the

1301
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,440
fact that we're like a podcast and a business is so toxic and poisonous and horrible.

1302
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,440
It can be.

1303
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,440
Yeah.

1304
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,120
Like online, across vast distances, like it's just a business and every part of it sucks

1305
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,120
and I hate it every day.

1306
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,760
I want to kill myself.

1307
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,880
So like with you guys in particular, seeing you in person is vital and I totally agree.

1308
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,640
I totally agree.

1309
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:53,160
And that's why it reminds me of the actual friendship in the way that this doesn't.

1310
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,160
Yeah, for sure.

1311
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,160
For sure.

1312
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,160
Hell yeah.

1313
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,520
We're like, like there was one night when we got back from Slimehouse, me, Kazzie,

1314
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:06,320
hippo, me and Ben saying, that's the ticket.

1315
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,320
Oh, what, Mr. Pepperjack hot dog.

1316
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,320
Yeah.

1317
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,320
Yeah.

1318
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,320
Yeah.

1319
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,320
The whole time.

1320
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,320
We ate hot dogs with Pepperjack.

1321
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,320
We got back.

1322
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,640
And, and, and McDoubles without the buns.

1323
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,120
We got back from Slimehouse and it was really late and we were going to go to bed, but

1324
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,600
we just stayed up talking about the con, just talking, just cracking jokes and talking about

1325
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,360
Lion King one and a half in Tumba.

1326
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,360
And it was sweet.

1327
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,360
We were talking about Tumba.

1328
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,360
Yeah.

1329
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Yeah.

1330
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,360
In Tumba.

1331
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,360
Hey, Tumba.

1332
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,860
You know, that's why I went to a fucking pillow fight, I think as well.

1333
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,860
Jesus Christ.

1334
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,860
Yeah, yeah.

1335
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:39,860
We had a pillow fight.

1336
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,860
Yeah, we had a pillow fight.

1337
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,860
And these guys were doing that every night.

1338
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:45,600
I was out wandering the streets of Baltimore fucking homeless as shit every single night

1339
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,600
of the convention.

1340
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
God, Baltimore is so fucking scary.

1341
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,480
I got offered drugs like eight times.

1342
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,160
It's pretty, pretty spooky.

1343
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
It's pretty spooky.

1344
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:58,280
I said at one point, as there was a literal trash tornado blowing through the street.

1345
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,280
We experienced that.

1346
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,280
Yeah.

1347
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,920
This fucking city makes Detroit look like the emerald city of Oz.

1348
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:10,520
Got my pink hair complimented a couple of times though, so that's pretty good.

1349
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,520
Fair.

1350
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
Fuck yeah, worth it.

1351
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,520
Oh, there's this.

1352
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,520
There's this image.

1353
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,920
You can see my fucking, you can see my trance and belt too.

1354
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,920
That's true.

1355
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,520
You can see my gut hanging out.

1356
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
Oh, yeah.

1357
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,360
We recreated the thing with new friends and old.

1358
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,080
What a wholesome experience.

1359
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,880
And then we dumped him into the bay immediately afterwards.

1360
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,880
Fucking Limies.

1361
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,880
Fucking Limies.

1362
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,480
As pointed out by another Twitter user, Queen, please look at Ben and analyze the way that

1363
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,480
he's holding that pillow.

1364
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,480
I'm far on the edge.

1365
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,480
Look at his hand.

1366
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,480
Look at his hand.

1367
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,480
Where am I supposed to get left?

1368
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,480
Ben, is that a literal hover hand when we're trying to be holding up a man in the air?

1369
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,480
My other hand?

1370
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,680
What am I supposed to be like grabbing his wrist?

1371
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,720
Possibly?

1372
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,720
Yes.

1373
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,720
I don't know.

1374
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,720
I don't know.

1375
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,720
My other hand is on his shoulder.

1376
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,720
My right hand is just like, what's the point of pushing on his arm?

1377
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,720
He's trying to give a thumbs up.

1378
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,440
I don't want to fuck around with that.

1379
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,120
You don't come between a man and his thumbs up.

1380
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,120
Let me see.

1381
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,120
What else have we got here?

1382
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,400
Speaking of hover hands, let's talk about a real cool guy who would never stoop so

1383
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,640
low as to use the hover hands.

1384
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,680
Check out this sweet picture of me and Lauren Foust.

1385
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,680
Yes.

1386
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,680
Wait, where?

1387
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,680
Oh, there it is.

1388
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,680
There it is.

1389
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,680
Incredible.

1390
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,680
My hand right around her waist like she's my fucking prom date.

1391
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,680
I don't give a fuck.

1392
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,680
I do not hover hand ever and I never will.

1393
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,680
You can't make me.

1394
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,680
It's a mistake.

1395
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,680
It's a mistake.

1396
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,680
Yeah.

1397
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,680
It's great.

1398
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,680
It's great.

1399
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,680
What a beautiful image.

1400
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,680
Lauren, she's looking great.

1401
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,680
She's keeping it tight.

1402
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,680
Nothing but salutes for her.

1403
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,680
You know what I'm saying?

1404
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,680
You know what I'm saying?

1405
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,680
Hell yeah.

1406
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,680
What's she up to now?

1407
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,680
At moments after which, she was like, hey, dude, who is that guy with you?

1408
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,680
Dude, APS Adventures?

1409
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,680
Dude, would you know where I can get the document?

1410
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
What's that?

1411
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,680
Oh, by the way, by the way, just in reference to our previous friendship time discussion,

1412
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,680
I think this is the image for me that sums it all up, the bed snubbing time.

1413
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,680
Oh yes.

1414
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,680
Yeah, that's Ben Pepperjack in hand.

1415
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,680
Ben, shoes on foot one day.

1416
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,680
Now, I don't know if everybody saw, but the socket continues.

1417
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,680
Let me fucking repost this here.

1418
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:19,980
Fucking, you know, briefly, in the continued sorties of Shoe Gate, I was briefly able to

1419
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:25,680
reclaim them, and I feel that the moral victory is eternally mine, but one day, you know.

1420
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,680
That's correct.

1421
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:33,680
I was going to say that, you know, like in this foot image.

1422
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,680
This foot image was great because it gave birth to the two dualities of man, you know,

1423
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,680
the Nate souls and the Munchie steppers, which will be in internal conflict to the heat

1424
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,680
of the universe.

1425
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
Very true.

1426
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
Very true.

1427
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,680
Yeah, I kind of regret keeping my socks on, honestly.

1428
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,680
That's the right thing to do.

1429
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,680
I feel left out in the foot fetish community.

1430
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,680
It's the Christian thing to do.

1431
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,680
Oh, you know what?

1432
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:04,680
While we're just saying nice things in general, I believe Ben Craigman, it was Hargadine.

1433
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,680
Hargadine gave me this wonderful United Federation of Planets.

1434
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,680
That's right.

1435
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,680
Incredible.

1436
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,680
And I wasn't supposed to tell you that it was her, but I did.

1437
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,680
In defiance of your plan.

1438
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,680
This is like my favorite.

1439
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,680
As a liar and a cheat.

1440
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,680
This thing is so sick.

1441
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,680
I love it so much.

1442
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,680
It was such a nice thing.

1443
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,680
It's pretty cool.

1444
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,680
Thank you so much.

1445
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,680
It's absolutely beautiful.

1446
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,680
Thank you.

1447
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:34,680
Oh, can we talk just a little bit about the TF2 analysis anarchy panel and the chanting

1448
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,680
and the adoration.

1449
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:40,680
This huge crowd of people have for the worst thing I've ever seen.

1450
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,680
We went to the table in the vendor's hall.

1451
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:49,680
Okay, I don't know why this exists, but they had a fucking table dedicated to selling analysis anarchy merch.

1452
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,680
Where's my tune critic?

1453
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,680
It's in June, guys.

1454
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,680
Damn it.

1455
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,680
It was my tune critic.

1456
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,680
Phantom Horn was not represented.

1457
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,680
He has been erased from history.

1458
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,680
He has, as is tune critic, tragically.

1459
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
Tragically.

1460
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:08,680
Related to that, I just want to say that they gave analysis anarchy, like a huge panel.

1461
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,680
Everyone showed up to it.

1462
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,680
They had their whole booths.

1463
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,680
Bum, fuck, nobody has had panels.

1464
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:19,680
We tried to apply for a panel and they wouldn't even respond to us.

1465
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,680
They didn't say, no, sorry, you could do it.

1466
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,680
They wouldn't even say that they did nothing.

1467
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,680
The fucking guys were hosting the how to be a furry panel who literally had no idea what they were doing and said so immediately.

1468
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,680
They got a panel somehow.

1469
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:41,680
The fucking brony drama panel, which was just a bunch of complete nobodies reenacting a discord call where everyone had a shit mic and they didn't know how to speak.

1470
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,680
It was about that level of quality.

1471
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,680
Well, real quick, I missed the...

1472
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,680
Oh my god, I totally lost my train of thought.

1473
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,680
What were we just talking about before that thing?

1474
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,680
Do you have to analysis anarchy in a panel?

1475
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,680
I was going to ask, for the era, this is the last time we'll discuss it.

1476
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,680
I feel like we just fucked up.

1477
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:08,680
The thing was, I didn't sign on to confirm I was going to BronyCon until like two, maybe three months ago and you had already tried to get a panel.

1478
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,680
Did you never came? Tom intended to. I don't think he was involved.

1479
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,680
How did that go and who was involved with it?

1480
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,680
There's two things.

1481
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,680
Because, frankly, Munchie, you were never particularly well-known.

1482
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,680
If it was just me, Munchie, who wants a panel.

1483
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,680
No, no, no.

1484
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,680
It wasn't like, hey, it's me, Munchie Shatsky, can I have a panel?

1485
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:36,680
It was me on the Procrastinator channel explaining who the horseshoe crew was and that we were the horseshoe crew and saying, can the horseshoe crew get a panel?

1486
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,680
That was my explicit words.

1487
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,680
And I mentioned everyone who would maybe come.

1488
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,680
That didn't get a panel, but the Brony drama got a panel.

1489
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,680
What the fuck was that?

1490
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,680
It was embarrassing.

1491
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:56,680
It was not only the horseshoe crew. I also applied separately for a pony cast panel before that.

1492
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,680
There's no reason the pony cast shouldn't have gotten in.

1493
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,680
Yeah, it's a pony show that was kind of up to date and they did get back to me.

1494
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,680
They just said, sorry, we're fully booked.

1495
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,680
Wasn't it just too late?

1496
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,680
No, I did it as soon as it was open for submitting panels.

1497
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,680
Well, that is very surprising.

1498
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,680
They must have just made an editorial decision that they wanted pony...

1499
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:23,680
Maybe they just really wanted like the most active people, even if they're like terrible discord called drama horse.

1500
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,680
I don't know.

1501
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,680
I was looking for FNGR's panel the whole time and I couldn't find a man.

1502
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,680
I wanted to get up to date on the drama.

1503
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,680
Well, dude, okay.

1504
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,680
Well, speaking of FNGR, we're going to repeat this entire story on the RCK.

1505
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,680
But I want to say it here because it is legendary.

1506
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,680
It is fucking incredible.

1507
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,680
The saga of us trying to find the same.

1508
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,680
Yes, we need to hear it.

1509
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,680
So I want to say, in case you aren't aware, and you should be aware, because if you aren't then you're a fake fan.

1510
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,680
Me and Ben, on Ryfurgers Cop Killers, on our famous Frog Fractions episode, called out Mini a Pony YouTuber.

1511
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,680
And in response, Miss Anthropony, a person who I don't even think we mentioned by name.

1512
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,680
I think we just mentioned like his friends and he got upset and he made a vlog about us.

1513
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,680
In fact, he's probably listening to this right now.

1514
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:14,680
And he made a very funny video that me and Bo thought was very funny in response to us.

1515
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,680
And we thought, haha, wow, silly.

1516
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,680
And in this video, he states that he will kick Ben in the dick at Ryfurg.

1517
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,680
That was a threat made against Ben.

1518
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:31,680
And since then, we had already cooled off and mellowed down and we had already talked to him and everything was fine.

1519
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:42,680
But still, that idea of kicking Ben in the dick at Ryfurg was such a persistent idea in the back of our minds that we knew we had to meet him and get this to be real in any capacity.

1520
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,680
And so we were trying to hunt Dan Mapp, and the first time that we saw him, we were right up next to him.

1521
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,680
Me, Nate, and a whole bunch of people, like Jesse was there, Hippo, Kaz, I think everyone was there besides Ben.

1522
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:59,680
We're in a big group full of like 40 fucking people all just walking down the street in the middle of like Baltimore.

1523
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:06,680
And we saw him walking up to us. We said, hey, Mapp, he walks past us like he was walking up to us. He's past us now.

1524
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,680
Miss Anthropony, Miss Anthropony keeps walking, goes across the street.

1525
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,680
Miss Anthropony, it's us, it's the PCP, it's Hippo, it's Jesse.

1526
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:17,680
Like, turns around, gives us a limp thumbs up, walks away.

1527
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:23,680
A limp thumbs up with his infinity gauntlet. Yeah, on the whole convention.

1528
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,680
Incredible.

1529
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:31,680
We tried to talk to him and he wouldn't pay attention to us. So now we think, okay, something's fucking up. There's something going on right now.

1530
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,680
He is probably terrified of us. He probably thinks-

1531
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,680
There's a literal gang with Munchie, a literal gang of rowdies and killers right there.

1532
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:44,680
Yeah, with these rowdies and killers behind us, all these people wearing gang colors just wade to fucking pop.

1533
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,680
They're just waiting for the go ahead to tear him limb from limb from you, Munchie.

1534
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,680
Yeah, can't blame him.

1535
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,680
And so, we tried to find what we couldn't find. And then last day, we did it-

1536
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,680
I guess there was nothing fucking to do at Bornecombe. There's not a goddamn panel we want to see. There was nothing.

1537
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,680
So we want to see him more than anything else.

1538
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,680
So we dedicate the entire other day to us trying to find him.

1539
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:08,680
If Frim and Ethan stake out the entire Vanillers Hall, we check his Twitter update and we look at his last tweet to find out where he is.

1540
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,680
Okay, it was Miss Lauren Frost. Okay, we saw him go in here.

1541
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,680
Okay, all right, block this interest, block this interest, but we'll be able to get him.

1542
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,680
We're gonna do a fanning, sweeping motion trying to get him out of the Vanillers Hall and trying to get a picture of him. Can't do it.

1543
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:25,680
And so, we're, like, dejected, trying to find Miss Anthorhomne, but he's, like, a skittish gazelle trying to escape our lion's claws at every moment.

1544
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:31,680
Like, he knows that, like, the hunt is afoot and he will not let us stomp down on his chest.

1545
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,680
And so, we're dejected, walking around, going to panels.

1546
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,680
And then we meet a Mr. British Ninja.

1547
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:43,680
And Mr. British Ninja is the person who replaced Hippo on TF2 Nessus Anarchy as the Red Spot.

1548
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,680
And so, we start talking to him.

1549
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,680
And we're just, like, like, you know, hey, how's it going? What's going on? You know, what's up, bro?

1550
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,680
And then we mention that we're trying to get Miss Anthorhomne. He's, like, oh, you want Miss Anthorhomne?

1551
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,680
Why don't I just call him?

1552
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,680
And then we have a guy on the inside. We have a guy on, like, in the TF2 Nessus Anarchy.

1553
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,680
We have him in the analysis pony YouTuber sphere.

1554
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:09,680
We're gonna be able to get to a contact in Lure and literally trap and deceive Miss Anthorhomne into allowing us to take a picture with him.

1555
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,680
Quick aside on that. He showed us his Skype chats with Miss Anthorhomne,

1556
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:21,680
which was just a long string of Miss Anthorhomne saying, hi, hi, hi, hi, hey, hello, hey, are you there?

1557
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,680
Hi, which was really funny.

1558
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,680
Sick.

1559
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,680
I didn't see that part.

1560
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:30,680
And then, by the way, British Ninja was like, yeah, he seemed good.

1561
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:37,680
Yeah. And so, we get him to call, and so there's a meeting arranged after closing the ceremonies.

1562
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,680
This is like the very, very, very tail end of the con.

1563
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,680
It literally just ended. Brony Cotton was ending right at that moment.

1564
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,680
This is immediately the aftermath of the closing ceremonies when everyone was pouring out the doors.

1565
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:53,680
And we all knew there was no other, he had to be in there. There was no option. He was there.

1566
01:11:53,680 --> 01:12:00,680
And so we get a meeting. At first, we're gonna try and, like, literally, we've set up, like, like, centuries to spot him.

1567
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,680
Yeah. But eventually, we're like, no, no, no, let's stream on this.

1568
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,680
Let's just wait outside, you know, British Ninja will tell us when he's coming.

1569
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:11,680
And so we wait outside the doors. Brony Cotton literally ends, like, the bell rings, and the students shuffle out of school.

1570
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:18,680
And then, like, one of the first guys, Miss Anthropon, with his Thanos glove, and then we all, like, surround him in a circle.

1571
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,680
Yes, yes.

1572
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,680
Every, every appearance he made. Yeah.

1573
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,680
Yeah, okay. That thought.

1574
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,680
That really added a lot of texture to the whole experience.

1575
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,680
It sure did.

1576
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,680
So we surround him, and, like, Miss Anthropon gets, like, scared for a moment, and starts to, like, wobble at our feet.

1577
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,680
Like, I'm so sorry for what I said to you, but I'm so sorry.

1578
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,680
He did seem genuinely afraid when we appeared before him.

1579
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,680
I mean, we all surrounded him and just went, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

1580
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,680
So that was an odd choice, but...

1581
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:52,680
And then Ben, like, the benevolent deity he is, says, rise, peon, and then smile upon him, gently.

1582
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,680
And then he rise with tears in his eyes. I think I remember that.

1583
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,680
He paddled back and said, you're among friends to me.

1584
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,680
I'm impressed.

1585
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:05,680
And then the rollercoaster of emotion with Miss Anthropon, it was, like, went from, like, pure, like, terror,

1586
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,680
like, I can only assume at, like, the literal death he thought he was about to experience.

1587
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,680
Like, most likely.

1588
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,680
Actual terror from a little, like, like the daggers of the Furies that were about to go inside of him,

1589
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,680
went from just joy to seeing us, and we got so many pictures with him, and it was great,

1590
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,680
and we recreated, you know, the kicking each other into the dick.

1591
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:25,680
Look, I told him, I told him, like, hey man, you know, there's one, like,

1592
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,680
I've been looking forward to this moment, and I just, the thing that I want more than anything is,

1593
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,680
can we please get a picture of each other kicking one another in the dick?

1594
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,680
And he was super happy with it.

1595
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:39,680
He went like, yes, and it was, yeah, there was a literal crowd cheering for this moment.

1596
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,680
The crowd literally went wild.

1597
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,680
We cannot express how hyped it was.

1598
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,680
It was a crowd of, it was a crowd of all of us, you know, all of our people,

1599
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,680
but because Bronnico was ending, everyone was coming out.

1600
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,680
There was just, like, loads of people around who were also cheering,

1601
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,680
because, like, it's the thing that's happening.

1602
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,680
Yeah, this was the emotional climax of BronyCon, bar none.

1603
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:02,680
And we can't describe how joyful it is that we finally found Miss Anthropon,

1604
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,680
that we're doing this iconic moment, that he's happy, that everyone's happy,

1605
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,680
all of our friends and allies there, you know, all the people that we met,

1606
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,680
all of our fans and friends, and all the people, the new people we met there,

1607
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,680
like, like, past analysis was there.

1608
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,680
I just said, it was all coming to a close, this was the end of BronyCon.

1609
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:23,680
And then, something that I cannot believe happened.

1610
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,680
We need to do some backstory here.

1611
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:32,680
At every BronyCon, there has been one figure that's pre-leaded all of the conversation

1612
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,680
between the upper and lower societies of BronyCon.

1613
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:41,680
This person has single-handedly funded and, you know, armed the BronyCon masses.

1614
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,680
I'm talking about, of course, about,

1615
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,680
Ice Cold Water, one dollar guy.

1616
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,680
Ice Cold Water, one dollar.

1617
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,680
So there was a dude, shirtless, selling water at every single BronyCon.

1618
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,680
He became a national icon, a treasure, if you will.

1619
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,680
He went beyond the legend.

1620
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,680
He went beyond the legend.

1621
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,680
He's an urban superhero, a static shocker, Luke Cage.

1622
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,680
Indeed, indeed.

1623
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,680
Literally.

1624
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,680
And so this guy, who's an icon of BronyCon,

1625
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:15,680
that completely embolifies all that BronyCon stands for, all of its ideals and virtues.

1626
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:19,680
He, just out of the blue, comes up to us.

1627
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:23,680
He just, like, runs right into the center of the big, like, circle of people

1628
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,680
that are, like, cheering and, like, clapping and stuff, and just, like, hooting and hollering.

1629
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,680
We have a picture that someone was down to picture, right?

1630
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,680
I don't know.

1631
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:37,680
And so this spirit of BronyCon past, present, and future, gulp, comes into us.

1632
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:43,680
And we get a picture of Miss Anthropony with the Ice Cold Water $1 guy.

1633
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:49,680
And it is just the encapsulation of all of that period of culture and history.

1634
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:54,680
This, like, closing chapter, all of, like, all that Miss Anthropony represents,

1635
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,680
like, all the analysis of Milo Pony YouTubers, all of the cesspool and stuff like that,

1636
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:03,680
but just that sort of, like, simple naivete and, like, simple, just, like, joy

1637
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,680
that they experience for the show just rubs off on you.

1638
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,680
The Ice Cold Water $1, the institution of Baltimore, Maryland, you know,

1639
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:14,680
the hustling and the streets and the grime and that sort of, like, cess.

1640
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:20,680
Just all accumulates into one giant glob of just, I can't even describe it.

1641
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,680
It was so serene.

1642
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,680
It was just completely disgraceful.

1643
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,680
Transcendent.

1644
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,680
This was, could not be written.

1645
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:27,680
Yeah, it's could not be written.

1646
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,680
Life is stranger than fiction.

1647
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,680
It was incredible.

1648
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,680
It was literally amazing.

1649
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,680
It was definitely the high note.

1650
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,680
It was a magical thing.

1651
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,680
Where's the picture of that shit?

1652
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,680
It was the site of...

1653
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,680
Ice Cold Water Guy.

1654
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,680
Brody Count was a weekend of...

1655
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,680
And then Miss Anthropony immediately called his mom and told her about it.

1656
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,680
I wouldn't blame him.

1657
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,680
It was a weekend of great moments.

1658
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,680
And he wanted to know who had, like, pictures,

1659
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,680
if anyone had been filming when he had initially come out,

1660
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,680
because he wanted to, like, show his mom the video.

1661
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,680
Aw.

1662
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,680
I know some people were.

1663
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,680
At least parts.

1664
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,680
Let me tell you my greatest defeat in life.

1665
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,680
The site of my greatest failure.

1666
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:04,680
It was when it was at that end part when Ice Cold Water Guy was there.

1667
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,680
First, like, Miss Anthropony came up to me and started, like...

1668
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,680
Oh.

1669
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:09,680
He started apologizing to me like,

1670
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,680
hey, for everything I've ever said to you.

1671
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,680
I deeply apologize.

1672
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,680
I'm like, what the fuck did you ever say to me?

1673
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,680
I don't fucking even know who you are, man.

1674
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,680
So, like...

1675
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,680
So, and then Miss Anthropony starts talking to me about Kingdom Hearts and stuff.

1676
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,680
And I'm like, okay, I was talking to this guy about Kingdom Hearts.

1677
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,680
But while that happens, you know, Ice Cold Water Man stuff is happening.

1678
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,680
He's coming and he's taking pictures with everyone and stuff.

1679
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,680
And he goes to take a picture with Kazzy.

1680
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,680
And he's like, who is a phone?

1681
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,680
Who is a camera?

1682
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,680
So I take out my phone to take a picture.

1683
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,680
And I take a picture of Ice Cold Water Man and Kazzy.

1684
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,680
And my phone is on, like, 1%.

1685
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,680
It's about to die.

1686
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,680
And he goes, hey, hey, man.

1687
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:53,680
Let me put my number in your phone so that you can send me that picture.

1688
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,680
So I'm like, I'm freaking out like, oh my god.

1689
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,680
This is my chance to have a real life superhero in my contacts for life.

1690
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,680
I'm literally going to be friends with Ice Cold Water Man.

1691
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,680
And he had just got done telling Ben all about how, like, if someone messes with his friends,

1692
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,680
he'll kill that person.

1693
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,680
I asked him.

1694
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,680
I asked him.

1695
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,680
I said, I was like, excuse me, sir, Mr. Ice Cold Water Man.

1696
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,680
I have to ask because I know I'm a big fan of your work.

1697
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,680
And I just need to know would you consider yourself a rowdy or a killer?

1698
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,680
And then he goes on this long...

1699
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,680
And he goes like a weird, like, tire rage.

1700
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:28,680
Long tangent about how, like, you know, he's like, you know, a peaceful person,

1701
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,680
but he'll defend someone if he has to, you know?

1702
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,680
And I'm like, OK, OK.

1703
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,680
But would you say rowdy or killer?

1704
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,680
And then he just does it again, basically.

1705
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,680
That's a tough choice.

1706
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,680
You know what I realized?

1707
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,680
I should have been like, OK, OK, that's fine.

1708
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,680
Do you like pink or purple better?

1709
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,680
That's just sort of how I finished it.

1710
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,680
But I forgot.

1711
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,680
He didn't give an answer, so whatever.

1712
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:52,680
I mean, he definitely thought you were asking, have you murdered anyone?

1713
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,680
He's the killer thing.

1714
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1715
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,680
I know.

1716
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,680
I look obviously, obviously.

1717
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,680
I just was hoping.

1718
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,680
I just wanted him to say something.

1719
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,680
I just wanted an answer.

1720
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,680
But I will never know.

1721
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,680
He's friend to Juvie, killer, even the lowly stay deads.

1722
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,680
He's a filth.

1723
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,680
You're saying he's a filthy sentress is what you're saying.

1724
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,680
Perhaps.

1725
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,680
Perhaps so.

1726
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,680
So, so Jesse.

1727
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,680
I'm safe forever because this is protection.

1728
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,680
This is my chance to have my own personal superhero in my context forever.

1729
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,680
But my phone is on like 1% battery life.

1730
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,680
It's about to die.

1731
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,680
The Santa Pony is like right here in my ear talking about Kingdom Hearts.

1732
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:29,680
And I'm like, I'm trying to find my contacts on my phone, which I've never fucking used

1733
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,680
ever.

1734
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,680
Fucking so like I can't even find the phone.

1735
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,680
Then I can't find the contacts.

1736
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,680
I can't find like where to make a new contact.

1737
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,680
And I'm freaking out because my phone's dying.

1738
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,680
The Santa Pony is going off about Kingdom Hearts.

1739
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,680
And I'm like, where is it?

1740
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:41,680
Where is it?

1741
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,680
I can't find it.

1742
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,680
And then my phone dies.

1743
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,680
And I miss my chance.

1744
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,680
And then fucking Ice Cold Water Man chews me out.

1745
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,680
Like it's my fault.

1746
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:50,680
Like I'm incompetent or something like, oh man, you don't even know how to even find

1747
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,680
it.

1748
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:52,680
And then I'm like, listen here, Ice Cold Water Man.

1749
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,680
You son of a bitch.

1750
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,680
You know, and it just figures.

1751
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,680
You know, all weekend everyone's coming up to me and shaking my hand and taking pictures.

1752
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:01,680
Everyone gets to meet their fucking hero, their idol, Endless Jazz.

1753
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,680
But when it comes time for me to meet my hero, you know, everything has to go wrong.

1754
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,680
I got no phone battery.

1755
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,680
It's fucking dying.

1756
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,680
I can't find my contacts.

1757
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,680
The Santa Pony's talking off, fucking tangled.

1758
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,680
Shit!

1759
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,680
I'm just freaking out.

1760
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,680
I'm having a panic attack.

1761
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,680
I totally empathize.

1762
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,680
I totally empathize.

1763
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:21,680
Because before that, we had met up with Sarancia and talked about me being on Christeries and

1764
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,680
stuff.

1765
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,680
And like she had been like, you know, here I'll send you a text like, like add me to

1766
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,680
your phone.

1767
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:30,680
And I also realized that I have no idea how to use the contacts menu in my phone.

1768
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,680
And I'm trying to fucking figure out how to add her.

1769
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,680
And I'm, well, at least, at least I struggled with that.

1770
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,680
Like in privacy.

1771
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,680
Like she wasn't around to see me be like, oh, wait, wait a second.

1772
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,680
Wait a second.

1773
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,680
Where's the button?

1774
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,680
It was like out of the open.

1775
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,680
There was like spotlights on me, like under the heat of the sun.

1776
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,680
There was a huge crowd.

1777
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,680
Everyone looking.

1778
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,680
Everyone disappointed in me.

1779
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:54,680
I schooled Water Man cutting a fucking promo on how incompetent I am.

1780
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,680
Such shame.

1781
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:01,680
Like separately, Ben says to you, dude, you choked.

1782
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,680
And then later, if I was there, I say, dude, you choked.

1783
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,680
Like separately, independently of one another.

1784
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:12,680
Well, you know, meeting heroes and villains alike, you know.

1785
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,680
As we said before, I did meet Chris Chan.

1786
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,680
We all met Chris Chan.

1787
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,680
That was great.

1788
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,680
Really, really nice.

1789
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,680
Really nice in person.

1790
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,680
Happy to take photos.

1791
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,680
Interestingly, you know, Chris became such kind of just a staple.

1792
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,680
There were many times where Chris was just sitting, you know, alone in a chair.

1793
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,680
Just, you know, absorbing the atmosphere.

1794
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,680
Chris was just around.

1795
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,680
Just like.

1796
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,680
Yeah.

1797
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,680
We chatted behind her in like a bunch of panels.

1798
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,680
Like right.

1799
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:40,680
But it's like just rubbing elbows with Christine Weston Chandler in the flesh.

1800
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,680
No doubt.

1801
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,680
I never, I never came across her.

1802
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,680
Really?

1803
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,680
That's crazy.

1804
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,680
I would have given her one of my leaflets.

1805
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:46,680
That's too bad.

1806
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,680
Five or six times, yeah.

1807
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,680
I bet Chris would have been into your shit.

1808
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,680
Maybe.

1809
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,680
Don't say that.

1810
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:57,680
Oh, but you know what, while I'm just posting these, also got a picture with the only Pegasister,

1811
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,680
one Jenny Nicholson, who I quite like.

1812
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,680
I'm a fan of.

1813
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,680
Yeah.

1814
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,680
I think she sucks.

1815
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:03,680
Nah, she's garbage.

1816
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,680
I found her as well.

1817
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,680
Let me tell you this.

1818
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,680
Let me tell you my Jenny story.

1819
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,680
We're walking to the, we're walking to the brownie.

1820
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,680
Who Ben and I have worked with on brief bits before and pony stuff.

1821
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,680
She was, she did lend her voice to TBAP a couple of times.

1822
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,680
On occasion.

1823
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,680
Yep.

1824
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,680
Yep.

1825
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,680
I was walking to, yes.

1826
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,680
I was walking to, we were walking to the brownie drama panel and it was in like the other

1827
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,680
building.

1828
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:29,180
We had to go across the skybridge and she, she was like, it was like with two other people.

1829
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:34,000
She just walks out from a hallway and I'm like, oh, it's Jenny Nicholson.

1830
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,640
I don't really want to talk to Jenny Nicholson, but, but I do, I am confused and I am unsure

1831
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,240
whether this is the way to the skybridge where you ask her like, hey, is that the skybridge

1832
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,240
over there?

1833
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,040
And she's like, yeah, we go through there to get to the Hilton.

1834
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,040
Oh man.

1835
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:52,560
And I keep walking and then fucking Nate is like, wait a minute, that was Jenny Nicholson

1836
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,560
and like run back.

1837
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,560
I run back.

1838
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,560
And I got this picture.

1839
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,560
I got this picture with her right after that.

1840
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,560
I got to talk to Jenny Nicholson.

1841
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,200
Ben is so much cooler than me though.

1842
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,200
He doesn't give a shit.

1843
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,200
That's so dope.

1844
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:05,500
Jenny Nicholson is guilty of the worst crime that a person can be guilty of and that is

1845
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,240
being more famous than they deserve.

1846
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,680
I can't think of anything that deserves a more scorn and derision.

1847
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,680
Fair enough.

1848
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,680
I don't know.

1849
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,680
I think she deserves it.

1850
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,680
She's, she's done some good.

1851
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:15,680
That's the fucking dumbest thing ever.

1852
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,680
No, I said to her.

1853
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,680
She made, she's like Friendship is Witchcraft.

1854
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:22,040
She made, she made Friendship is Witchcraft and then she spent the next seven years sitting

1855
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,040
on a bed.

1856
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,040
Hey, look, look.

1857
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,040
I like that.

1858
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,040
That's funny.

1859
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:30,640
That gypsy bard song from Friendship is Witchcraft is the instrumental basis for one of my classic

1860
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,880
songs, Crystal Ball.

1861
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,880
Yeah.

1862
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,200
You know who wrote, you know, you know who wrote that?

1863
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,200
Griffin Miller wrote that.

1864
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,200
That is true.

1865
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,320
Oh, shit.

1866
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,320
I don't give a fuck.

1867
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,800
But I also had an encounter with Jenny Nicholson after you guys had left because every, every

1868
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,560
time you guys left to go back to your like nice comfy, like affluent white people hotel

1869
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:52,600
room, I had to hang around the convention center all night like a, like Oliver and company

1870
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,000
in his cardboard box in the rain.

1871
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Let me listen.

1872
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,360
It's hard being, it's hard being an affluent white person.

1873
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,160
That bed was so soft.

1874
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:06,160
It had such terrible lumbar support that no, this is act gen, genuinely genuine.

1875
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:10,160
I wasn't paying the entire convention because the bed was too soft and it made my back hurt

1876
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,360
and I can't fucking handle like it's awful.

1877
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,360
It's awful.

1878
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,360
It would honestly like kind of ruin like the first two days for me.

1879
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,360
Yes.

1880
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,360
It sucked that bad.

1881
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,360
And this, and this was when I had my fucking depressive episodes like sit on the floor

1882
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,360
with my head in my hands.

1883
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,360
Like, oh God.

1884
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,360
That's not fun.

1885
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,360
Having your pillow fights.

1886
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,360
That was late.

1887
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,360
That was late.

1888
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,360
Sleeping on the rocks and the streets next door.

1889
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:36,560
This picture that this picture give just posted of like Munchie, Ben and Kazi and glowing with

1890
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,560
pink light.

1891
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,560
They must be at the routing rough house right now.

1892
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,560
Wait, wait, where?

1893
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,560
Hold on.

1894
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,560
Look at it.

1895
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,060
It's in the chat thing right there.

1896
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,560
This is the New York layover.

1897
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,560
Oh, that's, yeah, that's the, oh yeah, yeah, when we were on the, man, I look so grumpy.

1898
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,560
When we were on the ride home, we still, we had like a three hour layover in New York

1899
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,560
and then we just fucking walked around Times Square.

1900
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,560
Oh, that's New York.

1901
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,560
Yeah, that's cool.

1902
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,560
That's cool.

1903
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1904
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,560
It was New York, New York at like 3.30 in the morning when like everything was closed

1905
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,560
except for in McDonald's.

1906
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,560
Okay, that's great.

1907
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,560
But Jesse was in the middle of the southern.

1908
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,560
Yeah.

1909
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,560
So what were you saying?

1910
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,560
Sure.

1911
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,560
We had pizza.

1912
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,560
We went to the rate.

1913
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:14,560
You and Jenny had pizza?

1914
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,560
Yeah.

1915
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:16,560
Wait, that's KP.

1916
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,560
Why did you and Jenny, why did you and Jenny have pizza?

1917
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,560
Are you sure you don't mean KP?

1918
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,560
Cause that's KP.

1919
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,560
I was with both of them that night.

1920
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,560
Oh, okay.

1921
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,560
So that's cool.

1922
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,560
Cause like the first night or one of the first days, I don't even know.

1923
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,560
It's like such a blur.

1924
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,560
It was like a 10 months we were there or something.

1925
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,560
Like the first night you guys all went off to your hotel room and I'm like, I'm going

1926
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,560
to fucking wander around here for a little bit.

1927
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,560
So like as soon as you guys left, I ran into KP and we hung out and then the next day.

1928
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:45,560
Oh, but behold, Jesse's KP TF2 sticker from analysis anarchy hanging off his land.

1929
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,560
Incredible.

1930
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:52,560
Well, I had to buy it because like, like to me having KP merchandise is the funniest

1931
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,560
thing in the world.

1932
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,560
It's fascinating.

1933
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,560
It's so like skewed towards young people, like little kids.

1934
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,560
Like I've never made it through a KP video ever.

1935
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,560
And you know, like I like for the longest time, I didn't get it.

1936
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,560
Like one of the first Brony cons is when I actually hung out with her for the first

1937
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,560
time and I saw like all of her fans come up and all the fans coming up to her were

1938
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,560
like actual little girls.

1939
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,560
So like, okay.

1940
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,560
They are not an impressive bunch.

1941
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,560
Yeah.

1942
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,560
So I'm like, okay, I get it.

1943
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,560
I get what you're.

1944
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,560
So like it's, her kind of it is just so like for kids that I find it hilarious.

1945
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:29,560
To proclaim myself an undying fan of KP and to to buy her merchandise and have her sign

1946
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,560
it and stuff.

1947
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,560
It's hilarious and cool.

1948
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:37,560
So yes, I did buy a cool KP sticker, which then I heard from her is not even like an

1949
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,560
official KP product.

1950
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,560
She didn't get any money for it.

1951
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,560
It was all the TF2 guys.

1952
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
So I got ripped off.

1953
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Thank God.

1954
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,560
Yeah.

1955
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,560
Which I think I went to charity.

1956
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,560
I heard.

1957
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,560
So that's nice.

1958
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,560
If that's true.

1959
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,560
Fuck.

1960
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,560
Now I have to be okay with it.

1961
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,560
But then, but then I ran into her again the next night when she was coming out of her

1962
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,560
panel and she came up to me and she's like, Hey, it's you.

1963
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,560
It's my favorite fucking guy.

1964
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,560
What's up?

1965
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:02,560
Let's go to the fucking rave and and fucking I'm like rave.

1966
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,560
That sounds horrible, but okay.

1967
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,560
Yeah.

1968
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,560
So I went down and we met up with Daniel Nicholson and we were eating pizza and shit.

1969
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,560
And he went to the rave and it was it was a fucking rave.

1970
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,560
That's for sure.

1971
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,560
And it was fucking incidentally Jesse played our dad and Jenny played our mom.

1972
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,560
So dad and mom were united at last.

1973
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,560
That is true.

1974
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,560
I'm not completely certain that she knows who I am.

1975
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,560
Like I've hung out with her before.

1976
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,560
I've talked to her.

1977
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,560
She's never addressed me by name.

1978
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,560
I don't know if she knows Jenny or KP.

1979
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,560
Jenny Nicholson.

1980
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,560
Jenny.

1981
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,560
They meet a lot of people.

1982
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,560
I don't know.

1983
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,560
No, KP definitely knows who I am.

1984
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,560
Yeah.

1985
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,560
But we should get we should get we should get Griffin Nilla on the PCP.

1986
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,560
Is he isn't he like really popular?

1987
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,560
You know, I've heard conflicting reports about this, but I've heard that Jenny was really

1988
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:48,560
horrible to him.

1989
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,560
I mean, I'd be interested.

1990
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:53,560
And I want and I want that to be true to validate my preconceptions.

1991
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,560
Fair enough.

1992
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
Yeah.

1993
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,560
Yeah.

1994
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,560
The atmosphere coming out of the rave.

1995
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,560
I think you guys should have been there because it was really something else.

1996
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,560
It was like the real climax of the convention because people were coming out of that rave.

1997
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:09,560
It was like three in the morning and everyone was just losing their minds in like the front

1998
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,560
hall.

1999
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,560
Like security was like trying to like, okay, it's time for everyone to leave for the night.

2000
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,560
Get the fuck out of here.

2001
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,560
And like nobody was listening.

2002
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:20,560
Everyone was just like thrashing in the front lobby, like singing pony songs.

2003
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:26,560
And I like I had a moment where I like I found the the perch by the fountain and I like sat

2004
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,560
up and I perched there and I sat like Indian style, like in the horseshoe finale video

2005
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:37,560
and I watched my fucking people come out in droves from the rave hall and just like filter

2006
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,560
through the lobby and like singing and like this joy celebration.

2007
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,560
I just had this moment where I'm like, yeah, this is pretty fucking cool.

2008
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,560
You just like this moment of like, no one's ever going to get this like you had to be here.

2009
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,560
It's like actually kind of a cool special fandom, even though it's weird and awful, but it's

2010
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:58,560
actually it's like, yeah, and I was like, I was just watching over my people like a like

2011
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,560
a like a lonely God and it was fucking cool.

2012
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,560
That's interesting.

2013
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,560
That's interesting.

2014
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:07,560
And then I went out and I and I walked like a mile to the hotel where the people said that

2015
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:11,560
they had a room for me and they lied and I couldn't get in and they were all asleep.

2016
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:16,560
And so then I fucking was homeless all night and I was fucking wandering around Baltimore

2017
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,560
for like miles and miles, real folk blues on multiple evenings.

2018
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,560
I had the real Baltimore experience because I came to the city the same way I come into

2019
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,560
every city, which is not planning for anything.

2020
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,560
I refused to plan for anything.

2021
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,560
I refused to book a hotel in advance.

2022
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,560
It's life is more interesting that way.

2023
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:40,560
So probably so every single night after everyone was gone and it was time to like sleep for

2024
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,560
the night, I had to like find a hotel myself walking around the city.

2025
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,560
There were no hotels open anywhere near the city.

2026
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:52,560
I had to like the first night I had to walk like two miles into the depths of the city

2027
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,560
into like the real ghetto, like horrifying scary place to find like this crap ass hotel

2028
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,560
that was way overpriced.

2029
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,560
Yeah.

2030
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,560
And I did that a couple nights.

2031
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:06,560
But on the night after the rave, even that hotel was also booked and I couldn't find anywhere

2032
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:12,560
and I was wandering on the city for hours and it was like, it was like four in the morning

2033
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,560
and I just gave up.

2034
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,560
I was like around the convention center.

2035
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,560
I'm just like, whatever, the sun's going to come up in a couple hours.

2036
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:24,560
I'll just like lay down here on the concrete by the convention center and fucking sleep.

2037
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,560
You're not alone.

2038
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,560
You're not alone doing that.

2039
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,560
I'm not alone.

2040
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:32,560
There was a person sleeping on every street corner in Baltimore, mostly like, you know,

2041
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,560
actual homeless people.

2042
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,560
Well, I am actually.

2043
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,560
Yeah.

2044
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,560
I was, but it's never mind.

2045
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,560
Never mind.

2046
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,560
I'm just one of them, I guess.

2047
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
It really is the truth.

2048
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,560
So I'm just laying there on the con.

2049
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,560
I'm like, I'm looking at my phone like this.

2050
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,560
Is there anyone who might have a place for me to stay?

2051
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,560
And I see that Ben's online and I look at it and I think to myself, I would rather die

2052
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,560
than ask Ben for help.

2053
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,560
So I put my phone down.

2054
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,560
Good thinking.

2055
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:58,560
Right choice.

2056
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,560
So I get comfortable there on the concrete.

2057
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:08,460
And then one hero, one, one noble superhero from my Patreon discord, which everyone can

2058
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,060
get in for $5 on my Patreon.

2059
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:11,060
There's my plug.

2060
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:15,560
And so this fucking hero from my Patreon discord came by the name of Tabby Nickel.

2061
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,960
And he's like, I have a room because there was like a group of people from my discord

2062
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,460
who had gotten a hotel room.

2063
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:24,560
But the guy who paid for it, Bryce, could not make it to the convention.

2064
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,060
He had plain trouble and he was really bummed out about it and it sucks.

2065
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:34,060
But there was a vacancy in the room and Tabby Nickel's like, hey, I got this fucking room

2066
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:41,060
so I went in and I went and I slept next to a man for like one hour and he saved my life.

2067
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:43,060
Well, that's nice.

2068
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,060
Yeah.

2069
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:45,060
Yeah.

2070
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,060
We did it.

2071
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:51,060
I would have liked to have gone to that raid, but rave.

2072
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:52,060
Yeah, me too.

2073
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,060
That's something I've never done before.

2074
01:31:55,060 --> 01:32:00,060
We had an Airbnb that was like 20, 25 minutes away from the place.

2075
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:05,060
Like I was, you guys were saying before, just like at Radcon 3, a lot of the most amazing

2076
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:09,060
times, and even when we were at like Anime Expo with me, Digi and Munchy, a lot of the

2077
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,060
best times were just like at night when everyone's just chilling and relaxing.

2078
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:16,060
So like if we could have been there, probably would have been pretty dope, but like it was

2079
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:18,060
already full and we wanted our own space anyway.

2080
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,060
Yeah, it was definitely a raid.

2081
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:22,060
I'm not like a dancer.

2082
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,060
I'm not a, I'm not a reveler.

2083
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:27,060
I'm more of like a, I'm more of like an arms cross standing.

2084
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:30,060
They're just observing the other freaks and mutants having fun.

2085
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:31,060
That's my fun.

2086
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,060
My fun is observing.

2087
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:35,060
So like I will not dance at a rave.

2088
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:36,060
You cannot make me.

2089
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,060
If you try to make me, I'll kill you.

2090
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:42,060
But at the end of it, when the guy came out and he played the discord song, even though

2091
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,060
it wasn't the discord song, it was like a 2019 remix, which wasn't as good, but nobody

2092
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,060
seemed to mind.

2093
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,060
So he came out and he played the song.

2094
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,060
Everyone's going crazy.

2095
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:56,060
And KP, who for the most part was also an observer.

2096
01:32:56,060 --> 01:33:01,060
She hands me like her discord plushie and she's like, here, here's the discord plushie.

2097
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,060
Wave it around and dance.

2098
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:05,060
And I'm like, you fucking goddamn bitch.

2099
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:06,060
So I have this.

2100
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:10,060
So now I have this plushie and I have to like wave it over my head.

2101
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,060
Like I'm part of this and I'm not.

2102
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,060
I'm an observer.

2103
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,060
I'm mad about it.

2104
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,060
Yeah, you're better.

2105
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:20,060
So I have to figure out like some kind of movement for my fucking body to perform.

2106
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,060
So I came up.

2107
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:25,060
I invented this insane autistic.

2108
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:28,060
I guess you would call it a dance.

2109
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:33,060
But if anyone, if it was caught on film, I would delete all of my channels and disappear.

2110
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,060
It was like.

2111
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:41,060
It was like part robot and also part teahawk from Street Fighter two.

2112
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:44,060
You know how he has his elbows out and he's walking towards you.

2113
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:47,060
Like ready to do like a flying eagle dive.

2114
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:51,060
It was it was a teahawk robot and also like with discord plush.

2115
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:56,060
And I just like, I'm like, okay, I have to keep doing this until the fucking song's over.

2116
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,060
Jesus.

2117
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:59,060
And it was, I mean, it was cool.

2118
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:03,060
I guess it's the point.

2119
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:09,060
And then the song was over and I got the fuck out of there.

2120
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:13,060
You know, there's one other person I wanted to mention who was it?

2121
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,060
Brad Khan.

2122
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:17,060
I mean fucking Brony Khan that I did not meet, but I would have liked to if I'd known.

2123
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:19,060
And that was ContraPoints.

2124
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,060
ContraPoints actually showed up to Brony Khan.

2125
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,060
Yeah, she showed up.

2126
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,060
She showed up for like one day.

2127
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,060
Yeah.

2128
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,060
And was around.

2129
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,060
If I'd seen her, I would have liked to say hello.

2130
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:29,060
I saw a picture of her and Jenny.

2131
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,060
And beyond that, beyond that.

2132
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:31,060
I heard about it later.

2133
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:32,060
Oh wait, you met her?

2134
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,060
You saw her?

2135
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:36,060
No, no, I just said I heard about it later and I saw a picture of her and Jenny.

2136
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,060
Yeah, that's right.

2137
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:41,060
Well, ContraPoints said on Twitter, what was this?

2138
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:42,060
This was like a week ago or something.

2139
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:46,060
Said, wow, Twitter shamed me hard for going to Brony Khan.

2140
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,060
The stigma is real.

2141
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,060
And thanks.

2142
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:51,060
Thanks for being on our side, ContraPoints.

2143
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:54,060
Thanks for being an ally, ContraPoints.

2144
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:59,060
Finally, an ally I care about.

2145
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,060
Well, that's it.

2146
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,060
All right, guys.

2147
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:04,060
Check out this week before we wrap up.

2148
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:05,060
Sure.

2149
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:06,060
This is from the day after the convention.

2150
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:10,060
I was still in Baltimore for a day, so I was wandering around and I decided to go visit

2151
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:12,060
the grave of Edgar Allen Poe.

2152
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,060
Oh, shit.

2153
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:15,060
And take a sip for my homie.

2154
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,060
So fucking way.

2155
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:18,060
They're in my KP shirt.

2156
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:21,060
Sit in some fucking vodka.

2157
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,060
It was fucking dope.

2158
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,060
Wow.

2159
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:26,060
This is exactly what he intended for society to become.

2160
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,060
Yeah.

2161
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,060
This is what he died for.

2162
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,060
Sick.

2163
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,060
That's incredible.

2164
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:35,060
This is post-modern all right.

2165
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:39,060
Dude, I hope there's like, you know how there's like the Beatle Burners which is like

2166
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:42,060
a really tech Beatle song to make them like my little pony.

2167
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:47,060
There should be like an edit of like the Raven, but it's just about the bat pony.

2168
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:49,060
Oh, or changelings.

2169
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:51,060
Edgar Allen Pie.

2170
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,060
Yeah.

2171
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,060
What's that?

2172
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:54,060
Edgar Allen Pie.

2173
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:57,060
Oh, it's cutie fucking Pinkie Pie, but it's Edgar Allen Poe.

2174
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,060
That's good.

2175
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,060
That's good.

2176
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:04,060
Well, hey, I don't know if you guys want to talk more about Bronicon.

2177
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,060
I've got one.

2178
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,060
Yeah.

2179
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,060
I don't have anything about Bronicon.

2180
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:12,060
I do want to mention my travel home because it was a slightly unusual.

2181
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:23,060
So me, Munchie, Kezi and Ben, because my round trip flight that I had booked going there,

2182
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:27,060
the flight back was like at 6am on the fourth day and I didn't want that.

2183
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:34,060
So I just skipped that flight and instead I had a flight booked for the end of the fourth

2184
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,060
day or something.

2185
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,060
Or maybe the fifth.

2186
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:39,060
In Boston.

2187
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:40,060
So I went back to Boston.

2188
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,060
We had a layover in New York.

2189
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:44,060
That was cool.

2190
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,060
New York stinks.

2191
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,060
Lol.

2192
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:47,060
I hate it.

2193
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:48,060
No, it was sick.

2194
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,060
It just kind of sucked because it was 3.30 in the morning.

2195
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,060
No, I mean like literally it stinks.

2196
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,060
Oh, no, that's true.

2197
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,060
That's absolutely true.

2198
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,060
Yeah.

2199
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,060
Okay.

2200
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,060
Point taken.

2201
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:03,060
But anyway, I missed check-in at my flight when we went there.

2202
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,060
I didn't realize for a-

2203
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:05,060
Because we had hot pot.

2204
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,060
Yeah, the hot pot was lovely.

2205
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:10,060
I really want to have that again.

2206
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:15,060
But yeah, I didn't realize for check-in for international flights, you have to be there

2207
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,060
an hour early.

2208
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:20,060
And I would have like checked in earlier on my phone, but it wasn't working.

2209
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,060
So I was just thinking, I'll check in at the airport.

2210
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,060
And it didn't work.

2211
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:27,060
And I got, you know, rebooked on a different flight and it took a really long time.

2212
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:29,060
It was really stressful and I didn't like it.

2213
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,060
We thought you were going to have to end up staying until the next day or something.

2214
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,060
I thought so as well.

2215
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,060
It seemed dire.

2216
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,060
Yeah.

2217
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:41,060
They gave me a flight and it was in three hours after the thought, when I was supposed

2218
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,060
to leave.

2219
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,060
So I was fine.

2220
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,060
You know, I can wait in the airport for three hours.

2221
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,060
I had some friendlies ice cream.

2222
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,060
It was okay.

2223
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:50,060
It was just alright.

2224
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:51,060
You got them for big chocolate.

2225
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:54,060
Dude, did you get the green goblin?

2226
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,060
Or did you get the fucking clown head?

2227
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:57,060
I didn't know what to get.

2228
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,060
I just got some chocolate ice cream.

2229
01:37:58,060 --> 01:37:59,060
I don't know.

2230
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,060
Alright, alright.

2231
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,060
It's basically a friendlies experience.

2232
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,060
Nah.

2233
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:06,060
It's not very friendly.

2234
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:09,060
It's not very friendly of me.

2235
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,060
Love you James.

2236
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:15,060
I was waiting in the, I got to my gate on the TV.

2237
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:19,060
There's a TV there and it's showing like the number of people who haven't like properly

2238
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,060
checked in.

2239
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:24,060
And because they rebooked my flight, I had like a special boarding pass.

2240
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:28,060
But it wasn't like a, like I wasn't technically on the flight.

2241
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:32,060
Like it said a seat like request on the piece of paper.

2242
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,060
So I went up to the lady and say, what does this mean?

2243
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:37,060
And she says, oh, you're not on the flight yet.

2244
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:40,060
Once everyone's boarded, then we'll see if there's space.

2245
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:47,060
I'm like, oh, you know, this is going to be like a really stressful wait.

2246
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:49,060
And then I'm going to be told, fuck you.

2247
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:54,060
And I'm going to have to call Munchie and like mess up his plans, his and Kazi's plans

2248
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,060
for like flying the next day or whatever.

2249
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,060
Or I guess I could have stayed with Ben, but I don't know.

2250
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:02,060
Anyway, I was there.

2251
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:08,060
I was there like just watching the long line of people enter the plane.

2252
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,060
There was like three people left.

2253
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:17,060
My name was still on this TV as like on standby and the number of names that hadn't been

2254
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,060
checked in, they were like passenger names.

2255
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:24,060
They were being like checked off as the people walked in and they had the number of seats

2256
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,060
on the plane.

2257
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:26,060
I am.

2258
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,060
I'm Gibbentake.

2259
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,060
MLP famous.

2260
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:29,060
Give me a seat.

2261
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,060
God damn it.

2262
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,060
Lauren Faust loves me.

2263
01:39:31,060 --> 01:39:34,060
I have a video with like a hundred thousand views.

2264
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:35,060
Not bad.

2265
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:38,060
About fapping to horses.

2266
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:41,060
I don't know if it was that one.

2267
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:44,060
Anyway, they had the number of seats on the plane.

2268
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:54,060
They had 168 and it was filling up and it got to 166 and I was like, what do I do?

2269
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,060
I don't know.

2270
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:59,060
I'm just sort of like pathetically standing there like being sad and a cold sweat.

2271
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,060
Yeah.

2272
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:04,060
And the lady, she was not impressed by the fact that I had like a seat request.

2273
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:08,060
I think she was just like, fuck this guy, mischeck in or whatever.

2274
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,060
But finally she says, you can go in.

2275
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:16,060
I go in and I have seat 6A, which is a very like low number.

2276
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,060
Seems good.

2277
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:22,060
I walk into the plane and I'm in like the beginning of the plane.

2278
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:27,060
I'm in the part where it's like the first class business class seats where you have

2279
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:35,060
lots of leg room with a fancy chair and a TV and I sit down at 6A and I'm like, whoa.

2280
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:38,060
I'm like, whoa.

2281
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:41,060
And I'm in business class.

2282
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,060
It was really strange.

2283
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,060
Something I'd never experienced before.

2284
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,060
I got to see all the things.

2285
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:53,060
I was frantically doing like an awful Casey Neistat review of everything.

2286
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:55,060
I barely filmed anything.

2287
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:57,060
I was just too excited.

2288
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:01,060
So was the experience, does anyone know how much more business class is?

2289
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:03,060
My question is, is it worth it?

2290
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:05,060
Should I just buy them from now on?

2291
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,060
Well, all right.

2292
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,060
For me, I mean, it was just comfortable.

2293
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:13,060
It's just like everything that sucks about being on a plane, i.e. you can't go to sleep

2294
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:15,060
and you can't lie down.

2295
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,060
That's solved.

2296
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:18,060
So instantly it's great.

2297
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,060
Also the service is a lot better.

2298
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:28,060
They don't look at you funny if you don't know what to say like they do in the regular plane.

2299
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:34,060
They're very calm and nice and they give you complimentary orange juice for takeoff.

2300
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:36,060
I'm like, what if this spills?

2301
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:37,060
What am I supposed to do?

2302
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,060
I've got to chug it.

2303
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,060
Yeah, like champagne or orange juice?

2304
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:42,060
Like orange juice, I guess.

2305
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,060
What's that thing, orange juice and champagne in the morning?

2306
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:45,060
Mamosa.

2307
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,060
Mamosa, that's the one.

2308
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:48,060
Yeah.

2309
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:52,060
Yeah, so I had like a steak dinner before that had like a soup.

2310
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,060
What?

2311
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:54,060
I saw that.

2312
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:55,060
I saw that.

2313
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,060
I'm retarded now.

2314
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:58,060
Why did you make me stupid?

2315
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,060
What is wrong with you?

2316
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,060
I do not know.

2317
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:09,060
And there's like a button on the chair thing.

2318
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:14,060
There's like an Egyptian hieroglyph with buttons on it.

2319
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:15,060
And with arrows.

2320
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,060
And there's the stripper button.

2321
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:19,060
I didn't know what it did and I pressed it and I was just covered in beautiful naked women.

2322
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,060
It was really like a blow job.

2323
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,060
Oh, did you even really see that one?

2324
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,060
Oh, the shit.

2325
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:24,060
I missed that button.

2326
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:25,060
Were you on the Jeffrey Epstein flight, dude?

2327
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:26,060
Oh, I hope so.

2328
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:27,060
Yes.

2329
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,060
Fuck yeah.

2330
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,060
That flight has a sharp down return.

2331
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:32,060
Were you Indonesian's flight of 337 and you got lost in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?

2332
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,060
Just like Jeffrey Epstein is right now.

2333
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:36,060
It was a body double.

2334
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,060
He's a billionaire.

2335
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,060
You can afford that.

2336
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:42,060
Anyway, I had a fun meal.

2337
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:45,060
I watched Nancy Drew again because I just felt like it.

2338
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,060
You watched her again?

2339
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:49,060
Because I like that movie.

2340
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:53,060
And then I started to watch another one like about this teen singer.

2341
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,060
But then I was like, you know what?

2342
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:55,060
I'm tired.

2343
01:42:55,060 --> 01:43:01,060
Let's get my face mask and my ear plugs from this complimentary toiletries suit.

2344
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,060
A little case.

2345
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:10,060
I pressed the button to go into sleep mode on my chair and it turned into a bed.

2346
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,060
And I had a duvet and a pillow and I just went to sleep.

2347
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:16,060
And before I knew it, I was there.

2348
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:20,060
The whole flight was gone because I didn't wake up.

2349
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:22,060
I was actually soundly asleep.

2350
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,060
It was unbelievable.

2351
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:26,060
I'd never experienced something like that.

2352
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:28,060
One day I got a jolly story.

2353
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:30,060
It's me, your father.

2354
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:31,060
How was your trip?

2355
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:36,060
Oh, well, you know, I just was talking to, you know, creator of my little pony, Lauren

2356
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:40,060
Faust, about some projects that I'm working on, you know, see if she wanted to get involved

2357
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:41,060
in a way.

2358
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:44,060
And then I flew back to my business class, see, you know, in my airplane.

2359
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:47,060
And also I drank caviar and I kicked orphans.

2360
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:48,060
Also, I'm fucking stupid.

2361
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:49,060
Wah, wah, wah.

2362
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,060
I'm pissing my pants right now.

2363
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:53,060
Change me, change me, dad.

2364
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,060
No.

2365
01:43:56,060 --> 01:44:02,060
No, he's in my representation.

2366
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:07,060
But basically, the moral of the story is miss your flight.

2367
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:10,060
Miss your flight and good karma.

2368
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:13,060
Miss your flight, change your life.

2369
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,060
Yeah.

2370
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:17,060
And like, I think because I was so positive, that was good karma.

2371
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:20,060
That was like, I believe in karma now only when it suits me.

2372
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,060
Oh my God, you know, had the worst karma at the entire fucking time?

2373
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:27,060
You talk about how Ben was just so unbelievably mean to that one waiter when we were getting

2374
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:28,060
the flat bread.

2375
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:29,060
No, you're wrong.

2376
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:31,060
Oh no, they accidentally charged me full price.

2377
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:32,060
He would have lowered it, Ben.

2378
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:35,060
You just have to remain calm and ask politely.

2379
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:38,060
Okay, that, look, I talked to that, maybe it wasn't the same waiter.

2380
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,060
That place like overcharged like everyone.

2381
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:44,060
I was not the only person that they, look, I think they're, I honestly think they were

2382
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:47,060
doing it on purpose and just like not applying the discount.

2383
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:48,060
Maybe.

2384
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:49,060
Okay.

2385
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:50,060
And I didn't yell at the guy.

2386
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:52,060
I just said like, hey, my order is wrong.

2387
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:53,060
You charged me wrong.

2388
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:54,060
Fix it.

2389
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,060
Look, that may be true, but it's also a fact.

2390
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:57,060
What do you mean that may be true?

2391
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:58,060
That's the whole crux, the argument.

2392
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:02,060
No, no, it is because Ben, how do you explain how everyone around the table turn you and

2393
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,060
said like, whoa, Ben, relax?

2394
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,060
I don't know because you're all fucking weird.

2395
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,060
Oh, is that what it is?

2396
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:07,060
Because you're all fucking weird ones.

2397
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:09,060
Yeah, you're all fucking weird losers.

2398
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:16,060
I think that it's strange to complain to the waiter when he charged you the wrong amount

2399
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,060
for your meal.

2400
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:22,040
The facts are, you could in a polite, reasonable, calm way say the exact same thing and get

2401
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:26,040
the problem solved without being mad at the waiter who probably didn't do anything wrong

2402
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,040
in the purpose.

2403
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,040
It was just funny because there was no build up to the rage.

2404
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,040
It was immediate.

2405
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,040
Yeah.

2406
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:32,040
Okay, it's kind of funny.

2407
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,040
It's a meme.

2408
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,040
You guys are overstating it.

2409
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,040
There was not rage.

2410
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,040
I just like said it.

2411
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:37,040
I didn't yell.

2412
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,040
I just said.

2413
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,040
It was very funny.

2414
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,040
Hey, you got my order wrong.

2415
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,040
Fix it.

2416
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,400
You did kind of like slam the paper down at the end and like cross your arms at the guy

2417
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,400
and look at him pointedly.

2418
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,400
Yeah, I guess.

2419
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,400
Yeah, I guess.

2420
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,400
Okay.

2421
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,400
I wasn't like yelling at him.

2422
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:53,320
I was yelling, but there was there was there was vim and vigor in the vocal tones.

2423
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,320
Yeah, I was really.

2424
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,320
Yeah, I was annoyed.

2425
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,320
Yeah.

2426
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,320
I was annoyed that they didn't charge me.

2427
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:58,320
Right.

2428
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,320
You did kind of talk and talking.

2429
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:02,320
You did kind of talk into the other kind of flip the table over and punched a dishwasher

2430
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,320
on the way out.

2431
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:07,960
Yeah, I guess, but they charged, they literally charged me double what my order was supposed

2432
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:08,960
to cost.

2433
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,080
I talked to other slime guys and they told me like, yeah, the same thing happened to me.

2434
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,160
I thought it was an odd choice to whisper to the general manager as we walked out.

2435
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,760
I don't want to see him again when I come back.

2436
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,760
I mean, you know, fair enough.

2437
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:28,760
Ben, we just need to address your also burning hatred for weight staff in that class of people.

2438
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:29,760
Weight staff.

2439
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,760
You just hate them.

2440
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,960
I was extra annoyed because the meal that I had ordered was shit.

2441
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:34,960
It was a terrible order.

2442
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:35,960
Well, okay.

2443
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,840
I mean, I was pissed about that.

2444
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,840
Fair enough.

2445
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:39,840
Fair enough.

2446
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:43,160
Dude, over on the main justice side of the table, we were living it up.

2447
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,160
We were eating disgusting.

2448
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:48,160
We were eating like whiskers from walruses.

2449
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:49,160
Yeah.

2450
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,160
Yeah.

2451
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,160
Yeah, we had the barbecue.

2452
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,160
We had the classic barbecue.

2453
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:57,160
Not only us, like us and like all the slime guys.

2454
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,160
Frankly, the PCP boys were weak.

2455
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,160
They were not united in getting the flatbread.

2456
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:04,160
But like all the slime guys got the flatbread.

2457
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,160
I am like thinking about it now.

2458
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:09,160
I am salivating thinking of the mozzarella flatbread that I got.

2459
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,160
That was good too.

2460
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,160
That was good too.

2461
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,160
The margarita pizza or whatever.

2462
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,160
No.

2463
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:14,160
Okay.

2464
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:17,160
Actually, we can't end this because we need to talk about the saga of trying this to

2465
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:18,160
come true.

2466
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:21,160
This was another like prevalent saga and I need to say this because it was me who was

2467
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:22,160
trying to organize it.

2468
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:26,160
So we all walk into Burning Con knowing one thing.

2469
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:33,160
Listen, Digi Bro, the greatest YouTuber ever loves the Kona Grill barbecue chicken flatbread.

2470
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,160
He talks about it day in and day out.

2471
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:40,160
He did an entire video dedicated to him discussing the ups and downs about this beautiful piece

2472
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:44,160
of food that brought him to tears at one point.

2473
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:47,160
We were there when he discovered his love for it.

2474
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,160
Yeah.

2475
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,160
Yeah.

2476
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:55,160
So it's a magical almost holy, almost like ambrosia, like a modern day representation

2477
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:58,160
of ambrosia given pizza form at Kona Grill.

2478
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,160
I mean, knew we had to go there.

2479
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:03,160
By the way, just the background of this, Kona Grill's are closing.

2480
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:06,160
The company is bankrupt and they're like mass closing stores.

2481
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,160
Just like BrodyCon.

2482
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,160
It's just a miracle that this one was still opening.

2483
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:10,160
It all comes full circle.

2484
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:11,160
Yeah.

2485
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,160
Dude.

2486
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,160
Okay.

2487
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,160
All right.

2488
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,160
So we all immediately, we gather that barbecue can flatbread.

2489
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,160
Of course.

2490
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,160
Like we can't go here and not get it.

2491
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:24,160
So like the first day, we are in a giant, giant group full of RCK people, you know, PCP

2492
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,660
people, you know, all the fans and friends, everyone wants a barbecue can flatbread.

2493
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:34,160
And so I'm like, okay, we obviously just like can't like walk in because, you know, it's

2494
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:38,160
right next to the con, like literally like two feet away, like right next door.

2495
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:39,160
Everyone's going there all the time.

2496
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:41,160
We got to make a reservation.

2497
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:48,160
And so I call up this person, I and I say to the person, hey, listen, we've got a big

2498
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,160
party here.

2499
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,160
30 people.

2500
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,160
Can I make a reservation?

2501
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:54,160
They say, yes, no problem.

2502
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,160
For on the third, you can come back.

2503
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,160
We're going to be able to get you 30 people.

2504
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,160
No problem.

2505
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:00,160
What's your email?

2506
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:02,160
I give them munchy wears tiny hats.

2507
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:07,440
And then they say like, Hey, by the way, if you want to like, if you want to have the

2508
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:10,320
full menu since there's going to be 30 people, it's going to be extra because, you know,

2509
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,820
we're going to have to make a whole bunch of stuff.

2510
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:14,440
Can you just like tell me like what you're going to order so we know we have enough for

2511
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:16,080
all of you?

2512
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:21,120
And then I'm like, yes, all 30 of us will be ordering the barbecue chicken flatbread.

2513
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:26,160
And she says, okay, we'll get more, we'll get extra barbecue chicken for you.

2514
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,620
So I'm like, okay, cool.

2515
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:28,620
That went great.

2516
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:30,120
Actually, you know, look, I'm coming back.

2517
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,120
Okay, we got a reservation.

2518
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,120
That's, that's great.

2519
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,120
You know, cool.

2520
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,660
30 people are barbecue chicken flatbread.

2521
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,160
It's all in the bag.

2522
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,160
Smash cut to the third.

2523
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,600
And I'm like, okay, let me just check in, you know, let me, let me just see, you know,

2524
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:40,600
what's going on.

2525
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,360
Like, you know, let me just say like, Hey, we're coming over.

2526
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,080
Make sure, you know, they didn't forget about us.

2527
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:49,880
We call the manager is put on the phone, can't speak English, like as like a very, very,

2528
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:54,560
very big, which I can't even like understand what they're saying really.

2529
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:59,320
And so I'm like, Hey, reservation for 30 tonight.

2530
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:03,740
And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, you made a reservation request.

2531
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:06,000
You made a request for a reservation.

2532
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,600
You didn't actually make the reservation.

2533
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:14,920
And so we're going to need to get a $15 from every single person involved in order to make

2534
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,920
a reservation.

2535
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,640
Otherwise, we can't help you.

2536
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:20,720
We can't even get you a table like, like, I was like, can we just get like a smaller

2537
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:23,480
group and like, no, no, no, no, like, you like, you just have to like a complete, that's

2538
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:27,520
$450 for the layman by the way, doing the quick maths.

2539
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,520
Yeah.

2540
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,520
Insanity.

2541
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:30,520
Yeah.

2542
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:33,040
Um, literal insanity.

2543
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,760
And so I like, I'm just do check it because that was the whole point.

2544
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,760
Like we were talking about like all the time, like barbecuing flatbread.

2545
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:38,760
That's the thing we're going to do.

2546
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:39,760
We're going to get this.

2547
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:40,760
We're going to make this happen, bro.

2548
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:42,000
And then I made the reservation.

2549
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Everything was fine.

2550
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,880
And I just wanted to check in just to say hi.

2551
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,240
And they said, no, everything's ruined and we're going to gouge you for fucking, we're

2552
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,960
going to fucking extort you for this barbecuing flatbread.

2553
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:51,960
You want to cry?

2554
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:53,880
You want to, you want to follow in your father?

2555
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:54,880
Did you bros footstep?

2556
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,520
You want to eat barbecuing flatbread?

2557
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:57,520
Give us money.

2558
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,520
Suck our fucking cock.

2559
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,520
Right.

2560
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,520
God damn now.

2561
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,480
I'm just not gay enough.

2562
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:07,600
And so, and so what ends up happening is that like I scurry around all the PCP people just

2563
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:11,720
like, you know, the core group and like, okay, don't tell me what we like got to get a reservation.

2564
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:14,800
So I make a reservation for just us, for just the people.

2565
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:19,400
We all walk in and apparently it's like a sweatshop.

2566
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:25,160
There's like, we walk in and like half of the restaurant is EMT.

2567
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:30,480
We could have easily fit 30 people in there and we ask, Hey, why is this entire section

2568
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:35,840
of the restaurant, like this entire fucking room not being used and they're like, we like,

2569
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,640
we even working like all day, there have been no shift changes.

2570
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:42,600
We there's like six people on the entire staff.

2571
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:46,280
We are like being worked to the bone like it like help us were dying.

2572
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:52,400
We're being like the Indiana Jones to children being whipped by our corner girl overlords.

2573
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:59,440
And and and then they purposely and spitefully try and charge been $35 for his two years.

2574
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,240
And I just draw my righteous very down.

2575
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:02,840
So true.

2576
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,360
So true.

2577
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:10,160
This, you know, you know what you did when you became he'll never, he'll never work.

2578
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,160
I mean, who?

2579
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:17,240
Yeah, when any and Jones gets corrupt, like mind break, dozen into hating all children

2580
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:20,640
and love slavery, he'll never work in this town again.

2581
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:24,120
Just a beautiful Ben moment because he just like, like the waiter was just like asking

2582
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,760
around the table, like, how was everybody's meal?

2583
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,040
And it was like, great, good, lovely, fantastic.

2584
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:29,920
I didn't like it.

2585
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,720
You charged me too much.

2586
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,680
I didn't say I didn't like it, even though I really didn't.

2587
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,720
But anyway, it was all fine.

2588
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,040
All this time has people got to come in.

2589
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,840
They got to like shuffle in like one by one.

2590
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,360
They all had like that could be split up.

2591
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,280
It wasn't like a unified thing.

2592
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,040
Like we all wanted to.

2593
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,040
But you know, it's fine.

2594
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:51,200
Most of the people who really wanted to were able to come and kind of go real.

2595
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,280
The barbecued chicken flatbread, my rating.

2596
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:55,800
8.5 out of 10.

2597
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,480
It was really good.

2598
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:57,960
I give it an A.

2599
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,960
It didn't make me cry, but it lived up to the hype.

2600
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:00,960
It lived up to the hype.

2601
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:01,560
It was really good.

2602
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:02,960
It was acceptable.

2603
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:03,800
I had a bite.

2604
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:04,720
I'd give it a 7.

2605
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,400
It's pretty good.

2606
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,400
But it's a little too strong.

2607
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,840
It was a restaurant with food in it.

2608
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,400
Yeah, that's that's my that's my appraisal.

2609
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,560
Jesse, I can't get over your food.

2610
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,240
Like the entire time I was I was like talking about, too.

2611
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:22,480
Like, I was like continuously looking over like I was like gas.

2612
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:27,800
I was like, oh, everybody was getting on the like the meme train

2613
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,520
of the barbecue chicken flatbread.

2614
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:30,360
But I'm an adult.

2615
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,400
So I was like, fuck that.

2616
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,840
I want I want like a sushi thing.

2617
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,000
Like, yeah.

2618
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,160
So I got some kind of like sushi crab lobster fucking every undersea creature

2619
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:43,320
at once, like rolled into like this alien pot, like from the movie Aliens.

2620
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,880
And it was awesome.

2621
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,360
Put them in your mouth and they fucking like explode in your mouth

2622
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,760
and all the little meats and the little critters come out

2623
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:55,000
and all the little sea spiders run down your chin

2624
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,360
and start to study about the table.

2625
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:01,240
When fucking Munchie said he's never had sushi, I was like, what?

2626
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,000
Nani? That is that is honestly shocking.

2627
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
That's crazy, dog.

2628
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,120
And you're from California.

2629
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:08,400
Cuck Sushi Central, as I understand it.

2630
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,160
But well, that is, of course, true.

2631
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,320
I mean, I mean, I mean, in what?

2632
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,720
I'm not going to go to a Japanese restaurant.

2633
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,640
What about for? Well, you get both.

2634
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:19,440
Just try it once. It's good. I'm telling you, it's good shit.

2635
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,760
I don't. I don't.

2636
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:22,800
My name is Ben.

2637
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,320
And please, that's for me as such now on question me ever.

2638
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,680
OK, so people confused us for a long time.

2639
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,120
People confused us all the time.

2640
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:35,600
People like refer to me. I got called Ben multiple times.

2641
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,720
Yeah. Yeah, same.

2642
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:39,360
I don't know what the one time. OK, I'm dressed.

2643
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,000
I think I'm I don't remember.

2644
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,160
I think I was like Slime Corp.

2645
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:43,280
Nate or whatever. So whatever it's me.

2646
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,520
I'm wearing communist glasses, part of the N8 suit or whatever.

2647
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,680
So like, OK, pretty recognizable.

2648
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:51,720
I'm standing next to Michelle dressed as phantom horn.

2649
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,120
Oh, no, no, I was keg. I was keg.

2650
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:55,640
So whatever. I have my keg glass on and my normal purple glasses.

2651
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,240
Michelle's next to me as phantom horn.

2652
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:03,480
Someone walks by points to Michelle as as phantom horn says,

2653
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:07,680
hey, it's Ben Saint and then keeps going

2654
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:10,200
and doesn't even acknowledge my presence.

2655
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,320
First of all, I'm keg standard.

2656
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:15,480
You look if you recognize phantom phantom, you should know.

2657
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:20,040
And I'm like me and this is Michelle, not actually Ben.

2658
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:21,840
I could I could understand.

2659
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,680
I could understand someone knowing who phantom horn is

2660
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:26,480
and not knowing keg standard.

2661
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:30,080
But if you know that phantom horn is Ben Saint, then you must know.

2662
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:33,320
The implications are mind boggling here.

2663
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:36,040
Although, OK, do the possibility do you remember?

2664
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:39,600
Do you remember that that girl who like was talking to Michelle?

2665
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:43,120
She came up to Michelle and asked her about her phantom horn cosplay

2666
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,440
and was talking about it.

2667
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:48,080
Oh, yeah, he was in like, she knew that he was like in the first episode

2668
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,400
of an Al-Zaki and stuff.

2669
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,000
And she's asking like, oh, yeah, who was that guy?

2670
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,400
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know anything.

2671
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,400
And I'm standing right there, just kind of like looking between the two

2672
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,360
and like, should I say something?

2673
01:55:58,360 --> 01:55:59,200
And finally, I did.

2674
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,560
Finally, I was like, oh, yeah, by that was me, by the way.

2675
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:02,360
Yeah, I was phantom horn.

2676
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,240
And she was like, oh, OK, I just walked away.

2677
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:09,360
Singles, you bought a point of totally

2678
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,520
inconsequential curiosity for her.

2679
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:16,120
I think I may have been like as give and take, recognized by more people,

2680
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:20,000
which is funny. Yeah, I think it feels like T-Bap was more popular.

2681
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:21,840
Well, T-Bap, I don't know.

2682
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,560
I feel like I feel like phantom horn was a pretty iconic, well-known design.

2683
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:27,240
I don't think it was very phantom horn.

2684
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,600
I think phantom horn reached a bit.

2685
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,360
Yeah, beyond beyond.

2686
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:35,120
He had a little bit of reach beyond just people that watch T-Bap.

2687
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,480
Like I heard about it.

2688
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,200
It's a great design. It's a great design.

2689
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,080
Well, I mean, he was also in analysis.

2690
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,400
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2691
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,440
I think even I think even beyond that, people knew about, oh, yeah,

2692
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,840
that that one OC with the toilet paper roll, which for the record,

2693
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,120
keg standard, me was offered the role of demo man.

2694
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:52,600
I turned them down because I read the script.

2695
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,880
That is what happened.

2696
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:55,200
People forget this, but it's true.

2697
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:56,960
I deserve all the praise.

2698
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,920
Thank you very much.

2699
01:56:57,920 --> 01:56:59,120
People don't forget.

2700
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:01,200
Nobody cares. Yeah, you might be right.

2701
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,760
You might be right.

2702
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:06,120
Hey, OK, so moving on to Bronicon, I have one outside story of something

2703
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:09,280
that happened to me yesterday that I would love to tell everybody.

2704
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:12,680
It's a bit of a saga, but I think when it's done, you will agree.

2705
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:15,000
This is this might even rival

2706
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,600
Bronicon in its sheer ferocity of energy.

2707
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,240
OK, so so so Jesse, have you been to King's Island before?

2708
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,920
You've probably been there, right?

2709
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,280
No, where is it?

2710
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:28,680
No, OK, it's an Ohio, Ohio.

2711
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,840
Design Park. That's like Nate.

2712
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,880
Wait, I just want to say real quick.

2713
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,760
This is so bizarre, serendipitous,

2714
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:37,240
because I also went to a seer fair owned amusement park.

2715
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:38,920
OK, so I was there yesterday.

2716
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,760
But yeah, timeline is pretty close.

2717
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:43,320
So so the thing was we had gone.

2718
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:45,080
Me and Michelle, just like at the beginning of summer,

2719
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:47,160
we're like, hey, we haven't been to like a water park thing.

2720
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:47,920
Let's go to King's Island,

2721
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:49,720
which is like a water park slash amusement park.

2722
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,960
And like we paid like exorbitant prices for the tickets.

2723
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,760
They try to get you to do like student discounts or mill.

2724
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,400
Like they really try to do discounts.

2725
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,600
I'm like, I don't know any of this.

2726
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:00,120
I'm just paying the full price.

2727
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:03,160
And they were like shocked that someone is like actually paying full price.

2728
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,400
But whatever, I did it.

2729
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,880
But the thing was, if you buy the crazy, the ticket,

2730
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:10,000
they're like seventy five dollars per person for one day.

2731
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:12,200
I know it's it's insane.

2732
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,120
But here's the thing, when you do that,

2733
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,680
you actually get a second day just free.

2734
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:20,280
You can just come back and it's so basically that like halves the price.

2735
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,640
Now, you're not actually like making your money back.

2736
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,080
You're going to spend more at the park,

2737
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:25,680
but like it feels good.

2738
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:27,360
And so I did it.

2739
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:30,800
So me and Michelle went yesterday, August 10th, 2019.

2740
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:32,880
So the park is great.

2741
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,520
Me and Michelle spent most of our so last time we were there,

2742
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:39,480
Michelle and I, like the first thing we did was go on like a wooden coaster

2743
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:42,040
that we were told was not that big a deal.

2744
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,760
Oh, right. I've told this before,

2745
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:47,120
but was actually horrific for her and deeply traumatizing

2746
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,960
because she is not good at these things.

2747
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:49,920
So she was traumatized.

2748
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,200
So we spent most of the time yesterday doing like baby coasters and baby rides.

2749
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:55,640
There were a lot of fun, had a good time.

2750
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:57,960
OK, but but as the day went on,

2751
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:02,200
the looming mountain that is Diamondback.

2752
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,880
Diamondback is the fastest roller coaster.

2753
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:09,000
I think in like the like the Midwest,

2754
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,280
it's like it's like a million feet tall.

2755
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,920
It goes like 80 out 80 miles per hour or something.

2756
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:18,440
And like it loomed over me as a challenge to my masculinity as like I

2757
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,840
when I was young, I did like the Superman ride is Six Flags, New England.

2758
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,080
I did all those crazy rides, but I'm like, I'm like spooked.

2759
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:29,320
This is the final boss of King's Island and I don't know.

2760
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,440
I'm going to do other stuff.

2761
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:33,160
So as the day goes on, I start to do the more serious rides.

2762
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:36,800
And then as we get close to the end of the day, I'm thinking like, oh,

2763
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:37,920
maybe I'll do like the Banshee.

2764
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,080
It's like the second fastest one.

2765
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:40,560
I'll do this thing called the monster.

2766
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,600
These are other kind of more serious rides.

2767
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:46,400
But like, no, I've got like an hour and a half until the park closes.

2768
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:47,800
It's like eight thirty.

2769
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,640
And I'm like, Michelle, now's the time.

2770
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,280
I'm going to be a real man.

2771
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:54,400
I have to get in line for Diamondback and oblivion.

2772
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:58,360
Please edit in some footage of what it looks like to ride Diamondback

2773
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,680
and just the sheer scale of this thing.

2774
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,320
It's fucking insane.

2775
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:06,600
And I was legitimately terrified, but I get in line at like some like eight

2776
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:11,960
forty five, an hour and 15 minutes or so before the park closes and the saga begins.

2777
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:16,240
So so time is ticking and I'm waiting and waiting and waiting.

2778
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:19,480
I told Michelle it probably be like 45 minutes, but 45 minutes passes.

2779
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:21,240
I'm like not even halfway there.

2780
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:23,760
And it's getting closer and closer to the closure.

2781
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:25,800
People are in line way behind me.

2782
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:27,840
And I'm like, there's no chance they're getting in.

2783
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,360
Why are they even waiting in line?

2784
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,120
I don't even know if I'm going to make it.

2785
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:35,200
But hey, whatever, I'm just I'm just praying that I get there so I can actually

2786
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:37,560
overcome this obstacle that's been there.

2787
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:40,160
Because like the first time I went, I was too scared to even try.

2788
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,720
This is my second time.

2789
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:45,640
I don't even know if I'll live in Ohio like this time next year, like summer next year.

2790
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:49,360
If I'll ever get another chance, this is my last opportunity to do so.

2791
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,960
So the pressure is building.

2792
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,480
I give Michelle my phone and my wallet and I get whatever I get in line.

2793
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:55,880
I'm waiting. OK, so here we go.

2794
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,840
So I'm starting to get nervous as we're getting closer and closer up to the line.

2795
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:04,360
And and, you know, the duration of the wait starts to introduce fears into the mind,

2796
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:07,360
you know, little little demons, little demons start to creep in.

2797
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:11,320
And I'm like, I'm just watching other people go line after line of people

2798
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:13,800
doing this insane, like vertical drop.

2799
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:16,120
You guys, I've got to get a fucking picture of this thing.

2800
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,120
It is so fucking.

2801
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:19,240
I'm watching it right now.

2802
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:20,920
Link that to the other guy so they can see too.

2803
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:23,120
It's fucking insane, this fucking ride.

2804
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:26,960
And so I'm thinking to myself, do I really want to do this?

2805
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:30,760
What if I just get on there and I'm just panicking and crying

2806
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:33,800
and pissing myself and shitting and I'm legitimately too scared?

2807
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,600
So my my heart is wavering in a big way.

2808
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,360
OK, all of a sudden, like the Virgin fucking Mary,

2809
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:46,560
a kindly mother of like two people up in the line starts chatting with other people.

2810
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:50,680
And I just hear her over say that, like, like this is like a 50 year old mother

2811
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:54,440
with her child, and they've both done this before and they're like,

2812
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:57,400
oh, yeah, she's like, oh, you know, it's a little scary on the ride up.

2813
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:00,800
But like after that, it's like such a smooth ride, like because it's metal.

2814
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:03,440
And sure, it's fast, but you can really you can endure.

2815
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:04,480
It's no big deal.

2816
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:08,760
And like hearing those words, this encouragement from this from literally

2817
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,520
I mean, that's her and her son, presumably Jesus Christ himself.

2818
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,160
It just it fills me.

2819
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,320
It fills me with confidence.

2820
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:17,280
I'm like, this mom did this.

2821
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,440
No problem. I am a boy.

2822
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,560
I am a man. I can do this.

2823
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:23,480
And so I feel I am at peace.

2824
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:25,280
I feel reassured and serene.

2825
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,440
I'm committed.

2826
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:29,160
So, you know, the lines go on for a long time.

2827
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:29,920
We're getting close.

2828
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,160
We get to like the stairs.

2829
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,320
The final approach.

2830
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,120
It is five fifty seven.

2831
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:36,000
So sorry, nine fifty seven.

2832
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:38,680
We've got three minutes until the things close.

2833
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,720
Everyone's starting to get spooked that we're not going to have enough time.

2834
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,240
And I'm getting spooked, too.

2835
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:47,280
And meanwhile, so of course, Ben, I'm sure you'll appreciate this.

2836
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:52,960
The fucking like gold speed pass people are just waltzing right by all of us

2837
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,520
waiting in line. Those capitalists, did you?

2838
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:58,560
Did you know that one percent of the theme park visitors ride?

2839
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,520
Ninety nine percent of the.

2840
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,200
Oh, it's it's it's unconscionable.

2841
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:02,200
It's fucked up.

2842
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:05,680
And OK, so me and Michelle, because we knew that this was an issue,

2843
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:08,480
we just we went and asked like, hey, guys, we're just curious,

2844
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,640
like we might get speedbasses.

2845
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:10,560
This is early in the day.

2846
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,360
Should we get them? How much should they be?

2847
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:17,520
And they were like, they're between seventy five and ninety dollars up hop

2848
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:20,600
for one day, the fucking speed pass.

2849
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:25,000
Can I was my mind exploded into a thousand pieces when I heard that.

2850
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:26,560
It was fucking insanity.

2851
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,600
So obviously we didn't fucking do it.

2852
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,640
But so so I'm in line.

2853
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:34,400
These fucking speed pass fat cats are just waltzing right by.

2854
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,440
And I'm like, you know what?

2855
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,240
Capitalism, it had a good run.

2856
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:38,640
It's time to end.

2857
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:41,040
We need equal opportunity for equal people.

2858
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:44,160
This is fucked up to the core that they're just waltzing by.

2859
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:46,760
But as we're good, did you did you seize the means?

2860
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:48,040
We you know, I tried.

2861
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:51,520
I initiated my plan to start writing my manifesto right then and there

2862
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,360
to be published probably tomorrow revolution.

2863
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,080
OK, but but as we were getting there, now I notice.

2864
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:58,640
So we're like on the stairs.

2865
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:01,600
Just me, Michelle was waiting for me the whole time as I'm climbing the stairs.

2866
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:05,160
I see that actually I'm getting to a point where the speed pass people are

2867
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:08,560
actually only being allowed like four or five at a time.

2868
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:12,320
And actually the main line is actually going faster, even though there's a lot

2869
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:17,120
less speed, people like, sure, the speed people get on like faster overall,

2870
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:20,680
but they still have to wait until their line clears before they're allowed to go.

2871
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:23,680
And the general admission, people like me, we're getting on like there's like,

2872
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:27,240
you know, like 20 of us getting on paride and it's making pretty good time.

2873
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:30,400
So like I said, it was nine, nine fifty seven, the clock is ticking.

2874
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:33,840
We're going, but we're actually getting a pretty close, you know,

2875
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,280
we're getting pretty close to being in line.

2876
02:04:35,320 --> 02:04:37,600
It's like nine fifty eight, nine fifty nine.

2877
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:42,800
And then finally that, that, that humble child, that, that school, uh,

2878
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:45,600
fuck school child on summer break, getting his summer job.

2879
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:50,120
He looks at me with the patience of, of Buddha himself and gives me the slow

2880
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:53,880
nod and ushers me into the golden realm of this ride.

2881
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:58,680
So I'm stepping like a fucking pimp onto my row 10.

2882
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:00,560
I believe it was a fucking diamond back.

2883
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:02,360
I'm next to, I'm next to some guy.

2884
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:02,960
I don't know.

2885
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,120
We sit down.

2886
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:07,280
We chat, we're bantering and as we're getting, it is pitch black.

2887
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:08,400
It is 10 p.m.

2888
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:11,800
You know, there were a couple that went after us, but this is among the very

2889
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:16,240
last rides that go on down and back, but that's not all because at 10 p.m.

2890
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:23,360
every night at Kings Island, a fireworks show begins and right as we are sitting

2891
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:28,480
in the seats about to go, the, it is fucking stroke at 10, the fireworks

2892
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:32,920
begin to go off in the distance and we're, we're just, we're in awe.

2893
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,560
We're like, this is, this is, I cannot believe you're talking about the fucking

2894
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,680
gold saucer fucking date night.

2895
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:40,760
That's exactly it.

2896
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,320
I had Tifa next to me.

2897
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,760
She was sucking my dick and squeezing those titties.

2898
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:46,360
It was an incredible experience.

2899
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:51,440
And so as we're climbing up this, this terrifying mountain that I'm

2900
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:56,480
experienced utter panic at the, at the prospect of going down, but I have the

2901
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:01,000
Virgin Mary's words in my mind, keeping me calm and at peace as literally the

2902
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,480
fireworks are going off directly above our heads, like a little bit to the left

2903
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:08,680
past the fucking Eiffel Tower that's at Kings Island.

2904
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,720
We're filled with the spirit of America.

2905
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:17,360
And as we go over the peak towards the plummeting distance down below, I'm

2906
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,400
filled with the courage.

2907
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:23,240
And so I sing out, I know that it was due to only because capitalism, I didn't

2908
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,240
get a gold pass.

2909
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:26,360
It was the system works perfectly.

2910
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:29,280
It is operating as intended.

2911
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:31,000
I'm experiencing the fireworks.

2912
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:33,840
I'm experiencing a love of my people and my country.

2913
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,960
We were the most diverse group of people on the planet.

2914
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:38,320
We were all brothers in this enterprise.

2915
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:43,360
We go over the peak and I literally in real life, breakout, looking at the fucking

2916
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:54,040
fireworks and the rocket red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through

2917
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:59,080
the night that our flag was still there.

2918
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,920
The crowd, everyone on the right is cheering with it.

2919
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:03,680
They join in the song.

2920
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:05,440
This happens in real life.

2921
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:08,480
We're all singing the national fucking anthem.

2922
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,960
We go crashing down.

2923
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:10,960
No fucking way.

2924
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:12,600
We go over the first hill.

2925
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:14,280
We're singing our fucking hearts out.

2926
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,480
We're saluting the flag over the second hill.

2927
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:17,880
Okay.

2928
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:18,880
The thing about it's 10 p.m.

2929
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:19,600
There's no lights.

2930
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,560
We are in pure darkness.

2931
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:26,520
We're going down over the second hill, but we feel the spirit of George

2932
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:29,560
Washington filling our hearts as we're going down.

2933
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:35,880
It's darkness, but the fireworks, the bombs bursting in air are illuminating

2934
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:40,080
the ground below and we feel safe and it fills us with the courage to handle it.

2935
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:41,440
And we're writing it out.

2936
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,760
We're going down and we keep singing the song.

2937
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:54,000
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave 80 miles an hour tear streaming

2938
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:06,360
from my eyes, from the, from the wind or the land of the free and the home of the brave.

2939
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,680
We come to a stop.

2940
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:11,080
We ease into the final, the final resting place.

2941
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:15,240
And I just shout to myself, this one's for you, George Washington.

2942
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:17,320
And they burst into applause.

2943
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:22,360
The guy next to me, Dennis or Derek, whoever he was, he's my new best friend.

2944
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:26,800
He turns to me and he says, that was the most patriotic thing I've experienced

2945
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:28,640
as long as I can remember.

2946
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:34,360
A child in front of me turns around and says to me, quote, nice singing.

2947
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:38,240
It was the most, it was the most heroic experience I've ever had.

2948
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:39,960
We're, we're, we're cruising in.

2949
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:40,680
I'm getting off.

2950
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:43,560
I see Michelle waving to me, having experience.

2951
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:46,720
She was thinking to herself, oh, I wonder if Nate's on that last one.

2952
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:47,360
I hope he makes it.

2953
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:51,720
I was, I was in heaven with George Washington, with America.

2954
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:53,400
We, we saluted the flag.

2955
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:54,480
We joined in brotherhood.

2956
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:58,920
I've never felt more at one with my people of America as I did that day.

2957
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:00,600
Thank you, capitalism.

2958
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,400
Thank you, George Washington.

2959
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:04,080
And thank you, America.

2960
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:05,560
God bless us.

2961
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,920
Everyone and scene.

2962
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:12,640
And that's, that's the story of me.

2963
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:13,520
I made it.

2964
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:18,520
I made it onto Diamondback and I love America more than I ever have before.

2965
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:20,480
Take that, Karl Marx.

2966
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:25,760
That's a real story.

2967
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:26,840
It's a real story.

2968
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:29,080
That, that was, that was beautiful.

2969
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:30,360
I'm crying right now.

2970
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:31,520
I thought I really saw it.

2971
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:32,520
That was a journey.

2972
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:39,520
I fucking shredded my throat on that ride and now.

2973
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,600
And maybe it's time for those voicemails.

2974
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:43,600
What do you say?

2975
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:44,800
Let's go on a high note.

2976
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:48,320
Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

2977
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:53,160
I got the one right here.

2978
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:56,840
Oh, by the way, about the Diamondback thing, I, the thing was,

2979
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:02,160
I kind of feel a little bit guilty, like I didn't fully experience all the terror.

2980
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:06,960
I think I almost had like an unfair buff of patriotism and courage

2981
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:09,920
because I don't remember the ride that well.

2982
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,800
I kind of blacked out with love.

2983
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:14,400
Everyone knows, everyone knows courage is cheating.

2984
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,520
I kind of agree.

2985
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:16,520
I kind of agree.

2986
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:20,160
OK, OK, that said, let's go to the fucking voicemails here.

2987
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:21,880
Let me hit play.

2988
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:25,520
This one is from saying goodbye to a goat.

2989
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,600
OK, go.

2990
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:30,680
So Quentin Tarantino's new movie came out.

2991
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:32,240
It's pretty dope.

2992
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:40,240
In the past, Tarantino has famously said that he would retire

2993
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:42,920
after he directs 10 films.

2994
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:50,480
And since he considers Kill Bill volumes one and two to be one film,

2995
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,040
that makes this his ninth movie, meaning he has one more and will then retire.

2996
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:00,760
As artists, how do you feel about this approach to art,

2997
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:05,600
setting a limit for yourself so that your career doesn't dwindle on

2998
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:09,880
and you lose your creative spark or ability later in life?

2999
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:12,960
You think it's a good idea?

3000
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:14,480
I think it's bullshit.

3001
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:16,000
I think it's bullshit.

3002
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,280
I mean, I think it's bullshit.

3003
02:11:18,280 --> 02:11:20,120
Yeah, it's a weird idea.

3004
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:23,360
Yeah, if you if you have like a good idea that you want to make later,

3005
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,280
why would you be like, oh, but I made 10 already.

3006
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:28,160
It's one thing if he's not going to stick to it.

3007
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:33,280
Come on, if they were like, oh, I've made 10 movies and now I'm burnt out

3008
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:35,520
and I feel shitty and I don't want to make stuff.

3009
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,120
That would be I don't understand that.

3010
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:40,440
But to say from the beginning, you know, I only got 10 ideas.

3011
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:42,000
And then after that, fuck it, fuck it.

3012
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:42,600
Who gives a shit?

3013
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:44,680
It's like, what the fuck are you talking about, man?

3014
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,680
You know, on its face, it sounds like a preposterous idea,

3015
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,920
but let's let's give the idea it's due because I think it's kind of interesting.

3016
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:54,840
Jesse, I'm sure you remember there's a famous Star Trek, the next generation episode

3017
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:57,760
where I think I've talked about a bunch of times where like there's this there's

3018
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:01,680
this dude who's like in charge of some important science thing or whatever.

3019
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:05,480
And like he meets Diana Troy's slut mother who's dope.

3020
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:11,480
And they they like he hits his 60th birthday or something.

3021
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:15,400
And like his people come around and they're like, well, this is what we do.

3022
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:18,440
On your 60th birthday, we literally celebrate your achievements.

3023
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:22,200
And then you commit suicide because like this is the time limit.

3024
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:26,480
We give our people to like achieve things in their life before they we kill

3025
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,680
them, like they kill themselves in honorably, so they don't be a burden.

3026
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:31,640
Double that other movie.

3027
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:34,120
The new movie Midsummer is also that.

3028
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,000
Oh, oh, is it about that, too?

3029
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:38,160
Yeah, dude. Oh, did you see Midsummer?

3030
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:39,280
Oh, did you see it?

3031
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:39,840
Did you see that?

3032
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:42,480
Dude, it was so good.

3033
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:44,440
Scary spooky bullshit, baby.

3034
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:46,040
Dude, yeah, dude, I love that.

3035
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:47,920
It's a horror movie every single day.

3036
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:49,760
I was a sunshine the whole time.

3037
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,000
Yeah, that's dope.

3038
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:51,880
Yeah.

3039
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:57,360
Dude, OK, my alarm is the scene from my god, I got to see that every single day.

3040
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:00,280
It's like a half week or more or else I'll be stuck up every morning.

3041
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:01,560
Oh, my God, I'm a burning bear.

3042
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:02,400
I'm a burning bear.

3043
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:03,400
Let me out.

3044
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:08,720
Well, OK, OK, so so obviously I'm not actually in favor of that idea.

3045
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:13,120
But like the idea is, I mean, I'm sure Quentin thinks that in a couple of ways

3046
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:17,640
that like he doesn't want his legacy to be tarnished, probably by like the

3047
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:21,280
shittier things he might get older and loses them and vigor and shit.

3048
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:26,720
But like you just got to I mean, definitely like some people only have

3049
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:30,560
so many like creative sparks in them before they're dead.

3050
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:34,280
Like like an artist that makes albums

3051
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:39,120
past their peak just because money fucking David is like it's on.

3052
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:40,320
It's not ideal.

3053
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:43,800
Well, David Bowie was just very little David Bowie is kind of an exception

3054
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:47,520
to, you know, many of these things that David Bowie is the ideal.

3055
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,480
I guess it makes sense when you look at like Quentin Tarantino himself

3056
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:56,720
specifically as like a guy who just like makes the movies he watched growing up

3057
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,840
because you can kind of see like, OK, well, he made his crime movie

3058
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:03,640
and he made his David Caradine Kung Fu movie and he made his horror movie

3059
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:04,960
and he made his Western.

3060
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,640
So I could see how like he just wanted to make his version of the movies he liked.

3061
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:11,720
And now that he's run out of those genres, that makes sense, I guess.

3062
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,480
Yeah, I've changed my own mind.

3063
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:16,440
I think it's cool.

3064
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:19,720
You know, basically, if somebody wanted to do that,

3065
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,240
I can't really find a way to like object to it.

3066
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:25,560
I wouldn't do it because it seems silly.

3067
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:27,920
Like I would take more of the approach of limiting.

3068
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:32,120
It just seems like why would you like I think I mean, at the beginning,

3069
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:35,040
like it's just like if you have nothing else to say,

3070
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,720
they don't say just for the sake of it.

3071
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:42,040
But like it seems weird to me to just like say that like, oh, I will.

3072
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:46,240
Well, he is also talking about doing a Star Trek movie

3073
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:48,480
and how that wouldn't count towards the 10.

3074
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:54,160
So so like I can see how like maybe I think director still right,

3075
02:14:54,160 --> 02:14:57,120
but not like both on one movie or something is his point.

3076
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:01,800
Well, yeah, I'm sure he do things, you know, to fucking fill his time

3077
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,600
and be somewhat creatively fulfilled in other ways.

3078
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:05,920
I don't know.

3079
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:09,840
I mean, also, it's it's just sort of like a pretty cool marketing idea

3080
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,120
to like this is my final film.

3081
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:13,480
So you better go see it.

3082
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:16,600
He calls one like the hateful eight.

3083
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:17,720
It's the eighth movie.

3084
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:21,840
He's really he's really sticking to that theme with his like numbered movies,

3085
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:24,600
at least a little bit, the fucking once upon a time in Hollywood.

3086
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,600
It's not called like nine boys in Hollywood.

3087
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:29,720
X nine boys.

3088
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:32,840
I mean, it's us.

3089
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:34,680
Damn, that is us.

3090
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:39,480
OK, well, there you go, Quentin, do your thing.

3091
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:42,040
Let's go on to the next Quentin himself left that voice.

3092
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:43,880
Was that a good idea?

3093
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:49,040
No, no, no, no, Quentin, you have no more lollipops.

3094
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:54,400
Let's listen to our boy, Dang Energy, Dang Energy calling in.

3095
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:57,360
OK, go. Hello, PCP.

3096
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:02,400
You might have heard of bang energy, which reverses retardation.

3097
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:08,800
Well, let me tell you, energy drink called Dang Energy.

3098
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:10,120
You know what it does?

3099
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:15,120
It gives you retardation and I've been drinking by the gallant.

3100
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:20,920
My IQ is like the city New Orleans below sea level.

3101
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:28,200
Well, I just cannot shit, even says on the side of be aware, you may shit.

3102
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:33,160
And man, the best thing this energy drink has done to me

3103
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:36,760
is make me appreciate my little pony.

3104
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:39,480
I just can't get enough of it, man.

3105
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:41,880
Dang Energy, get retarded.

3106
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:46,160
Get retarded.

3107
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:48,160
Is it on Amazon?

3108
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:50,040
We're kind of by it. I need it now.

3109
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:56,840
I mean, I will just say to this guy that he seems dare I say almost a fake fan

3110
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:03,400
because this is just literally just like this just is exactly what

3111
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:05,720
the fuck energy is maybe as a competitor.

3112
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:10,680
It's not all any like, oh, yeah, like you thought of it being like it makes you retarded.

3113
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:13,280
Yeah, wow. OK, yeah, that's really funny, dude.

3114
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:16,320
Smash cut to the entirety of New

3115
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:20,920
Los Angeles City, OK, I know Milwaukee being being forced upon.

3116
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:24,320
Fuck energy just day and day out for like months preceding this.

3117
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:25,720
Come on, bro. Come on.

3118
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:28,880
Pretty fucking crazy, pretty voice jail.

3119
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:31,960
If you ask me, I just thought the marketing team for Dang can afford

3120
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:34,320
the rights to the hit retard anthem.

3121
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:36,800
Let's get retarded and let's get retarded.

3122
02:17:37,240 --> 02:17:39,640
I mean, it really writes itself. It really writes itself.

3123
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:46,160
I mean, I mean, does does does does Dang Energy even steal your soul

3124
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:49,560
and make your soul into slavery by the devil?

3125
02:17:49,560 --> 02:17:50,840
I don't think it does.

3126
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:52,680
Yeah, come on, dang.

3127
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:53,800
OK, let's go on.

3128
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:55,840
We've got one from a comfortable.

3129
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:58,600
Sama, comfortable, Sama. Go.

3130
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:01,520
Hey, fellas.

3131
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:04,200
Yo, have any of you guys been to a movie alone?

3132
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:06,560
If so, please tell me about it.

3133
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:08,560
Once the movie was over.

3134
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:11,200
When you stood up to leave, did the women of the crowd laugh

3135
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:13,880
and help you with their snacks and sodas?

3136
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:19,040
I'm a fight with no social connections, but I want to see

3137
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:25,080
millennia mattress and I want to see these Djibouti movies that are coming to theaters.

3138
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:28,400
But to be honest, what's wrong with this person?

3139
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:30,440
I'm not with you.

3140
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:32,680
It's just I'm a little anxious.

3141
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:34,600
Wait, what's happening here?

3142
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:39,840
You said he's he's anxious about the idea that if he goes to the theater by himself,

3143
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,320
people will notice. Yeah, yeah.

3144
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:42,480
And laugh at him.

3145
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:44,320
Nobody will give a shit.

3146
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:46,320
Yeah, I'm laughing right now.

3147
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:49,840
I achieved that fucking mode of like, I'm finally old enough.

3148
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:52,200
I can go to the theater by myself now.

3149
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:56,520
And I saw Spider-Man Far From Home by myself in the fancy theater

3150
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:59,320
with the big chairs that recline and it was dope.

3151
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:05,160
That's that fucking scene where Mysterio is doing the fucking messing with Peter's mind.

3152
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:07,600
Fucking Kino.

3153
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:08,640
Oh, was that good? Was that good?

3154
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:10,440
I was thinking about actually didn't like it that much,

3155
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:12,480
except for that scene with Mysterio, which was great.

3156
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,440
I like Jake Gyllenhaal.

3157
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:16,880
All of these all of these zoomer Spider-Man movies

3158
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:20,040
are just not hitting the right spot for me to be perfectly honest.

3159
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:22,840
Yeah, I feel you.

3160
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:27,360
All these people with anxiety who don't really the house need to understand

3161
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,440
that only you think about you.

3162
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:33,080
No one else is like looking at you and being like, oh, what's that?

3163
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:35,720
Dude, it doesn't have any friends, huh? That's sure strange.

3164
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:38,080
Everyone's just like, oh, it's a weird thing.

3165
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:41,000
It was great, but it was it was it was not my taxes.

3166
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,200
Now fair. That's understandable.

3167
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:46,040
I'm not I'm not going to tell you just don't care.

3168
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:48,920
But I will say no one does care.

3169
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:52,000
So, you know, let let that fuel you with with power.

3170
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,080
Nobody cares. You're fine. You're fine.

3171
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,000
Yeah. Yeah.

3172
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,560
No one no one cares about you or what you're doing at the movie theater.

3173
02:19:58,560 --> 02:19:59,920
This is a silly question.

3174
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:01,160
Please kill yourself.

3175
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:03,480
You know, I'll give you I'll give you some courage on this.

3176
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:06,880
I don't do this a lot, but like I will go to the movies

3177
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:08,280
and generally I'll take Michelle or whatever.

3178
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:11,240
But like I am both happy and willing

3179
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:14,720
and honestly eager to go to the movies by myself.

3180
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:16,600
I don't even want to go with people.

3181
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:20,720
I only do it because like I might as well take someone along for the ride

3182
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:21,720
who might want to see it.

3183
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:25,400
I would love to go alone and just not talk to anyone.

3184
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:26,720
The movie is great.

3185
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:27,920
And I do recommend it.

3186
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:31,480
If you can't afford to go to Bronycon, go to the movie theater

3187
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:33,880
and you can't go to Bronycon ever again.

3188
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:36,200
So go to the movie theater instead.

3189
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:37,200
It's better.

3190
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:41,280
Midsummer was so good.

3191
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:46,440
I think about that scene when when Christian is a high off his ass

3192
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:50,680
and then this dude like writes in his face and he says why would you do that?

3193
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:52,040
I think about that every single day.

3194
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:55,880
Did you see the previous one by the director of Pereditary?

3195
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:57,240
That one is also great.

3196
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,240
No, I haven't seen it.

3197
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,880
I haven't seen the thing that I did a video, but it was a patron thing

3198
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:02,520
because I forgot to release it.

3199
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:04,440
It was for the scary spooky bullshit thing.

3200
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:07,240
And it was like the last one that I forgot to ever make public.

3201
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:09,160
So I have to wait till this October to show it.

3202
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:13,680
But I think the world's first heli movie.

3203
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:16,800
Like, you know, you know, there's scary spooky bullshit.

3204
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:19,320
Some of it's scary and some of it's spooky and it's all bullshit.

3205
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,560
Some of it's scary, spooky bullshit.

3206
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:23,520
But the next level, the next category is heli.

3207
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:25,160
You don't want to see a heli movie.

3208
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:28,320
You don't want to do 70s drugs and then strap yourself in for a heli movie.

3209
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:29,320
It's too intense.

3210
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:32,280
You'll fucking you'll have night terrors in real life in real time.

3211
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:34,880
And it's a great experience, but it's an experience you never want

3212
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,720
because it is hell. It's cool.

3213
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,320
So that was how it is.

3214
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:43,440
I don't think that Midsummer was quite as heli as hereditary, but it was great.

3215
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:46,480
It was as good, but not as if that makes sense.

3216
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:48,320
What's the general premise of hereditary?

3217
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:51,480
Just the they're kind of like the same movie.

3218
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:52,920
They're kind of like companion pieces.

3219
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:56,600
They're both about a cult doing a stupid ritual.

3220
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:01,680
They believe in retarded gods and demons and they have stupid customs.

3221
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:04,920
The first movie is like

3222
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,920
like anything like the whole plot is a spoiler.

3223
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,720
So you can't say anything about it.

3224
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:13,920
It's basically like a movie about someone being sacrificed by a cult

3225
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:18,240
from the perspective of the person, like from the perspective of the sacrificial lamb.

3226
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:20,760
It's how I saw it described, and it's really scary.

3227
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:24,000
And it's just like horrible things happening to this family.

3228
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:26,800
And there's it's just bleak and horrifying.

3229
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,160
And it's awesome.

3230
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:30,120
And I'm watching both now.

3231
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:33,880
And Midsummer is like a companion piece to where like it's also about a cult.

3232
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:36,040
But this one is during the daytime.

3233
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:41,440
And it's kind of it's got like a real like a like a 70s wicker man atmosphere to it.

3234
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:44,080
And it's just the bees.

3235
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:45,320
Yeah, like she goes there.

3236
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:48,400
She's got this like horrible fear and anxiety about death

3237
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:52,080
because her sister committed suicide and her parents are killed in it, too.

3238
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:54,400
And she's like all messed up and she goes there.

3239
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:59,240
But these like crazy like Swedes just like pumper full of like magic mushrooms.

3240
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:02,040
And they start like they have these like ridiculous rituals

3241
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:05,240
and people are jumping off cliffs to like kill themselves because they're too old.

3242
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:08,920
And and it just it just gets crazier and crazier until at the end.

3243
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:13,440
It's like the most completely fucking but fucking insane shit you've ever seen.

3244
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:16,200
And it's cool and it's disturbing and it's rad, dude.

3245
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:17,960
Yeah, it's so good.

3246
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:19,080
The end the end of the year.

3247
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:21,640
I saw this review that really earned me.

3248
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:26,080
There's this channel that I found when the Game of Thrones finale was happening

3249
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:27,880
and everyone was shitting on it.

3250
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:29,680
I found a channel who was also shitting on it.

3251
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:33,680
It was pretty cool called the the the critical drinker or something.

3252
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:35,280
I think that's it.

3253
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:38,200
He's like this like Scottish guy and this thing is that he's drunk

3254
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:41,640
and he just complains and like when he was complaining about Game of Thrones,

3255
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:44,000
it was cool and I was all on board.

3256
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,880
But like the more you watch of his videos,

3257
02:23:45,880 --> 02:23:49,400
the more you realize that he's one of those who like sees every movie

3258
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:52,680
through the lens of like this is SJW propaganda.

3259
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:58,120
Oh, it's another SJW movie and all these fuck it's all feminism.

3260
02:23:58,120 --> 02:23:59,760
I can't stand it.

3261
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:02,360
And it's just like shut up, you fucking idiot.

3262
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:06,400
It's just like like I agree with you, but shut the fuck up.

3263
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,880
It always makes me sad when I hear people like that,

3264
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:13,000
who might not do something like say, enjoy the awesome,

3265
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,200
wonderful experience that was watching Steven Universe or something.

3266
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:19,400
It was his midsummer review that was really irking me because he just like

3267
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:22,240
he only saw it through the lens of like, and of course,

3268
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:26,280
the main character who's a female is right about everything.

3269
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:30,560
And her boyfriend, her boyfriend has to, of course, be a stupid asshole

3270
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:34,080
because he's a man and it's like, oh my, that's not the point of the movie.

3271
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:37,760
And it's like like he was like and the part the part at the beginning

3272
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:42,280
where the parents die and the sister dies, ultimately had no impact

3273
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:43,720
on the story or the themes.

3274
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:45,480
And it's like, are you fucking retarded?

3275
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:47,480
You actually say that, what the fuck?

3276
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:49,240
It gave her like this anxiety about death.

3277
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:50,560
The movie is about death.

3278
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:52,040
It's not about feminism.

3279
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:55,280
You're just choosing to see it through these fucking insane

3280
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:59,320
anti-SJW culture warrior goggles and you're missing the whole fucking point of it.

3281
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:00,680
That's one of the reasons.

3282
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:02,480
YouTubers, stop it.

3283
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:04,800
I watched Red Letter Medias.

3284
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,440
I watched Red Letter Medias review of this.

3285
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:07,960
And that's one of the reasons I like them so much.

3286
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:11,680
I feel so confident that they are not political and it's like fantastic.

3287
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,760
Great. Just tell me what happened.

3288
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:14,240
Is it good? Great.

3289
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,240
That's what I want to know.

3290
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,120
OK, well, sick.

3291
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:19,240
Let's move on to our next fucking voicemail.

3292
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:24,120
This is from Loll Pussies Put Here Eating With Spoons.

3293
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:25,760
I don't like that.

3294
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,840
Go.

3295
02:25:26,840 --> 02:25:33,440
If you get ice cream in cups and not drinks, you're literally pussy, bro.

3296
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:35,440
I don't like this.

3297
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:39,120
Liked for the burp in the middle.

3298
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:41,240
Wait, what?

3299
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:42,440
What? OK.

3300
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:44,040
Yeah, I agree. Let's play it again.

3301
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,560
Let's play that again.

3302
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:47,000
I'll turn up. No. Oh, you heard it.

3303
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,600
OK, never mind.

3304
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:51,760
I think he's just saying if you don't use your pussy, that's true.

3305
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:53,400
Hard to agree. Hard to agree.

3306
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:54,160
It's the wrong.

3307
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:55,880
It's the wrong way to do it.

3308
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:57,080
It's the coward's way out.

3309
02:25:57,080 --> 02:26:00,480
I. I don't want to see that person in here again.

3310
02:26:01,960 --> 02:26:03,720
Voice jail. Voice jail.

3311
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:04,960
You know what?

3312
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,200
You know what? He doesn't he doesn't deserve it.

3313
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:08,160
But yeah, voice.

3314
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:09,920
All right, let's just one and done.

3315
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:11,600
Let's just one doesn't deserve it.

3316
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:12,400
But let's do it.

3317
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:13,280
One and done, buddy.

3318
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:16,000
Loll Pussies Put Here Eating With Spoons.

3319
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:16,520
There you go.

3320
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:17,880
Straight to jail.

3321
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:18,960
Let me post that.

3322
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:21,080
OK. Yes. Yes.

3323
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:21,800
Oh, my God.

3324
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:26,200
Let us get more liberal with our ban hammer and our jail key.

3325
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:27,480
We'll throw the whole.

3326
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:29,160
This is what Roque Pierre felt like.

3327
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:30,920
He was like, oh, yeah, we'll kill the king.

3328
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:32,360
Oh, I can just kill anyone now.

3329
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:34,240
They just went around doing it.

3330
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:36,200
It's great. OK, we got one from.

3331
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:41,640
Let me see. This is idea man slash woman or creator man slash woman.

3332
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:43,840
OK, go.

3333
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,480
Hey, PCP, so.

3334
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:49,720
So with a unique group like yours, I'm wondering,

3335
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:54,840
you guys as creators, do you guys have more trouble

3336
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:58,680
with coming up with an idea for something?

3337
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:01,600
Or do you guys have more trouble

3338
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:04,960
actually doing the work of the creating?

3339
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:06,960
Definitely doing the work.

3340
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:08,160
Yeah, definitely.

3341
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:12,440
Some of you not to name the names and they didn't seem to be lacking

3342
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:15,240
in the making things department.

3343
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:16,480
Shut up, dude.

3344
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:19,920
OK, I'd be the answer.

3345
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:22,200
I have I have a huge backlist of projects.

3346
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:26,480
So yes, obviously, look, my problem right now is it's hard to make weekly

3347
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:28,120
videos and still carve out time.

3348
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:29,520
But I'm fixing it, God damn it.

3349
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:30,880
Give me time. It's been one month.

3350
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:31,480
Give me a break.

3351
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:33,720
I'm easing into a new job.

3352
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:34,160
Fuck you.

3353
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:37,600
My thing is that like the ideas are come easy and they never end.

3354
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,320
And it's yeah, like so.

3355
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:41,560
But my problem is that massive backlog of stuff

3356
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:45,160
and this becomes overwhelming to start on anything like I'll have an idea.

3357
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:48,000
And I'll just be like, well, I better just forget about that,

3358
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,760
because like I have other ones.

3359
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:52,000
And like, yeah, that hurts me so much.

3360
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:56,000
Yeah, and I don't have I don't have like writer's block ever so much

3361
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,880
as I have like the block of like, oh, my God, what's the point?

3362
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:01,360
I don't want people paying attention to me.

3363
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:03,280
I don't want to fucking upload a video.

3364
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:05,400
I fucking hate all of this so much.

3365
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:07,800
Like, I feel like that 99% of every day.

3366
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,520
So that's my thing.

3367
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:10,560
Like, I have the ideas.

3368
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:13,600
I just don't want to be seen easy.

3369
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:17,240
I like really enjoy like working like actually just like making something happen.

3370
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:20,480
But I hate like having to come up with ideas for like what to do.

3371
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:25,360
I hate having the initial just like, oh, God, OK, so what's going to happen?

3372
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:27,600
Like here, like what's going to happen at this aspect?

3373
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:28,520
I don't know.

3374
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:31,560
But like once I have like, you know what I'm doing, then it's like really like fun.

3375
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:33,200
Well, that's I mean, that's that's the work.

3376
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:34,120
That's doing the work.

3377
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:38,120
Like having the idea is one thing that's like like actually flushing it out

3378
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:41,400
and like figuring out the details is part of the work.

3379
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:46,600
Yeah, like, like, like, like right now I'm drawing comics.

3380
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:48,280
And it's like, yes, I came up with the idea.

3381
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:49,640
I know exactly what's going to happen.

3382
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:54,280
But like the literal like panel layout and the smaller things,

3383
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:56,400
like I don't have that in my in my head.

3384
02:28:56,400 --> 02:29:00,440
I have some panels that are like the big ones, but like getting to from,

3385
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:05,160
you know, all of the stuff getting to doing all of the smaller parts.

3386
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:08,520
They're still creative, but there is like a lot of work in there.

3387
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:13,320
Yeah. And it's just it's it's just it's like I'd rather just be doing the end.

3388
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:14,960
I'd rather be doing the cool.

3389
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:15,880
I feel you on that.

3390
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:19,360
But like I'll I say this this I know I said this before, but like

3391
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:24,000
honestly, the place I am that is the happiest that, unfortunately, tragically,

3392
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,400
I'm not really in right now.

3393
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:29,440
The place I'm happiest is when I'm working on a project that I think

3394
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:33,560
that I at least initially think was good and I'm, you know, was excited to be

3395
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:39,000
working on it. I just love being trapped in basically the prison of working on

3396
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,280
that project and not having to worry about other things.

3397
02:29:42,360 --> 02:29:45,640
Like that's like when I'm working on like a big smash video when I was like,

3398
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:48,680
that's why like my six month periods of like making those big videos,

3399
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:52,480
the best anime ever is or whatever, I love being there because like every day

3400
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:54,160
I know exactly what I have to do next.

3401
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:55,520
I know the purpose I have.

3402
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:59,680
It's it's honestly freeing to have that kind of restriction on what I can do.

3403
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:02,360
It makes me not have to worry about when you get on when you get on a roll,

3404
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:04,560
even the working part can be the fun part.

3405
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:05,640
It's just like the general.

3406
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:06,160
Yeah, totally.

3407
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:10,200
It's just for me, the general anxiety of uploading a fucking thing.

3408
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:15,000
And it's just like increases every year and it never gets any less.

3409
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:17,840
So now it's like everything is your second guessing everything.

3410
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:20,480
Like, oh, my God, someone's going to take this out of context and someone's

3411
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:23,560
going to weaponize this against me and someone's going to fucking not get

3412
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:25,960
this joke and someone's going to take this too seriously.

3413
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:27,120
And it's like, what's the point?

3414
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:29,720
Just make everything Patrick on exclusive, which I do.

3415
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:31,880
Patreon.com slash endless jazz.

3416
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:33,520
Become a patron and give me money.

3417
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:34,120
It's cool.

3418
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:36,320
That's that's fair.

3419
02:30:36,320 --> 02:30:36,800
That's fair.

3420
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:42,160
I feel that it feels so good to have a clear, like very specific

3421
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:43,720
goal thing you're working on.

3422
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:46,960
Like right now I'm working on a what?

3423
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,720
Undertale to the air.

3424
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:49,320
Oh, yeah.

3425
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:52,240
Yeah, I'm working on a sequel to like the ARG

3426
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:55,240
that I talked about previous on the PCP for more endless war stuff.

3427
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:56,240
And it's just great.

3428
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:59,200
It's just great coming up with stuff and like, oh, dude, I can do this

3429
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:01,240
and it'll be really neat and epic.

3430
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:04,160
And then I write a bunch of stuff like, wow, I'm doing it and it's great.

3431
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:07,760
It's the only thing the thing that I like I said, I love being in that space.

3432
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:12,000
But the one thing that haunts me fairly frequently, it's not even that

3433
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,760
like I write down every good idea I have, basically, I write down and I have

3434
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:18,240
documents and I have like things relatively organized.

3435
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:21,120
So it's unlikely I'll like lose track of them.

3436
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:25,760
But specifically in that process, the thing is there are periods where I get

3437
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:28,080
an idea and I'm really excited about it.

3438
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:31,560
And I know that if I worked on it right then and there, I could make something

3439
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:32,400
really cool.

3440
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:36,000
The problem is, even if I write down all my thoughts, if I get back to that

3441
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:40,960
project in like six months, it's just that that fire oftentimes will go out.

3442
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:44,840
And then it's like, oh, like, even if I make this, like, am I even that excited

3443
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:45,200
about it?

3444
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:47,640
Like, is it it's the exact same ideas?

3445
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:49,640
I've simply lost the passion for it.

3446
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,080
And that's that can happen.

3447
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:52,200
Sometimes it's the opposite.

3448
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:57,120
And sometimes I'll write half of a script and stop giving a shit about it.

3449
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:00,240
And then I'll find it again, six months later, having forgotten it and be like,

3450
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:00,800
oh, that's cool.

3451
02:32:00,800 --> 02:32:02,760
And I'll just absentmindedly start adding to it.

3452
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:04,680
And then I'll finish it randomly six months later.

3453
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:08,400
Like, hey, you know, it's like once once you kind of bring the project back

3454
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:11,280
to life, like when you work and like you're actively working on it and like

3455
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:11,880
changing something.

3456
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:14,640
Oh, I can add this here and like you're editing it, which, you know, I do

3457
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:15,400
that fairly frequently.

3458
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:18,080
Yeah, that is a pretty gratifying process.

3459
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:21,680
If you're losing the passion, like halfway through a project, you can just

3460
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:23,080
take a break and come back to it.

3461
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:24,360
And sometimes that works.

3462
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:25,720
Sometimes it gets lost forever.

3463
02:32:26,600 --> 02:32:27,200
That's very true.

3464
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:32,080
You know, I like I have like everything I've ever written for like the last eight

3465
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:35,800
years, like every lyric, every song, every like video idea, every script,

3466
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:40,280
like everything like fucking like terabytes of like written stuff is all

3467
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:42,600
on this one laptop that I've used forever.

3468
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:44,640
And none of it is backed up anywhere.

3469
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:45,440
It's not in the cloud.

3470
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:46,640
It's only on this laptop.

3471
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:50,280
So I live my life in a constant state of fear and anxiety that something will

3472
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:53,720
happen to my laptop, because my entire life is on there.

3473
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,640
I feel like you almost kind of want that to happen.

3474
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:59,720
I think I do kind of do and it almost because you can back those up to

3475
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:00,960
like Google Drive or something.

3476
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:04,400
But it's really it's hard and weird because it's on like this.

3477
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:07,920
It's on this old MacBook from 2014 and everything is written on this

3478
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:10,000
program called notes or something.

3479
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:13,680
And it's not like any other like document that you can't export the files

3480
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:17,640
anywhere, they export in this weird file type that like only works on a Mac.

3481
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:19,240
Can you not like copy paste?

3482
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:23,120
I have to I have to highlight everything manually and copy paste it to

3483
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:26,360
like Google Drive if I want to do it, which I've started doing.

3484
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:27,600
I've started doing it.

3485
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:28,760
It's like a forever.

3486
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:30,280
What? Yeah.

3487
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:31,160
Wait, what did you say?

3488
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:36,240
Like highlight, Command A or like Control A is like highlight everything.

3489
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:38,280
My God, I've never heard of such a command.

3490
02:33:38,960 --> 02:33:40,440
Is that true? Is that a joke?

3491
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:45,240
Uh, what if I just click and click on a text thing and you press Control A?

3492
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:46,240
No.

3493
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:51,040
All right.

3494
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:51,240
Yes.

3495
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:53,840
Well, that's Troll A selects everything in a page.

3496
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:54,840
Well, that's OK.

3497
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:56,240
That makes it command A.

3498
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:57,640
But yeah, that will be easy.

3499
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:01,840
I almost I almost had a tragedy the other day because I was in bed and I was

3500
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:06,840
I was looking at my laptop and stuff and I see like the biggest

3501
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:10,240
brownest, hairiest, strongest spider I've ever seen.

3502
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:17,640
Literally on my laptop, like very near to touching me and like instinctively.

3503
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:21,440
I'm like, ah, and I just and I chucked my laptop across the entire

3504
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:26,720
fucking like landed upside down and it like caught just right on like a plastic

3505
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:30,160
bin so that it didn't smash and it was like it was a stroke of luck.

3506
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:33,120
It was a miracle that it didn't get destroyed because I chucked it full

3507
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:37,280
fury across the room before the spirit of George Washington wants you to make

3508
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:38,360
those videos.

3509
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:40,560
He wants you to create those those things.

3510
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:45,160
But by the way, I just want to say an unrelated to all this.

3511
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:49,160
I just want to say that it just dawned on me that like I haven't posted

3512
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:52,880
anything on Twitter besides like bronicon updates in like literal months.

3513
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:55,680
I have not posted anything on YouTube in literal months.

3514
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:58,120
Probably like everyone like has no idea what I'm doing.

3515
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:00,360
So I'm just going to say again for the thousandth time,

3516
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:02,240
dude, I'm in RFCK get in there.

3517
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:04,960
If you're ever wondering what happened to that guy, come in there.

3518
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:06,080
Go there.

3519
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:06,760
Fair enough.

3520
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:10,160
Don't you stream like what's your live streams on your main your channel there?

3521
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,240
No, no, no, it's on RFCK.

3522
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:14,200
Those are on Twitch. OK, OK, that's cool.

3523
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:15,520
Yeah, it's all in ours.

3524
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:16,720
I'm I'm all in on that.

3525
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:17,640
That's what I'm doing now.

3526
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:20,480
So if you're ever wondering, that's that's it guys.

3527
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:23,240
Come on over. OK, we've got one last voicemail.

3528
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:26,080
This is from Make Rebel Pickles.

3529
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:28,600
Great again. OK, great. Go.

3530
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:31,000
The last episode of the PCP was great.

3531
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,960
They talked about t-shirts for two whole hours and I was in trance by every fucking

3532
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,880
minute of it. So I was thinking why is this boring business talk interesting?

3533
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:42,800
The obvious answer is because they care about it.

3534
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,120
They care about making money.

3535
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:45,280
They care about their business.

3536
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,960
They care about their artistic process.

3537
02:35:47,240 --> 02:35:49,440
And that's what I really want out of a discussion topic.

3538
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:52,240
I don't want to see this good idea.

3539
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:55,200
No, I want you guys to fucking care about what you're talking about.

3540
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:57,480
Don't just say something because you gave a good topic.

3541
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:58,720
Say it was you like it.

3542
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:00,000
Say it was you mean it.

3543
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,160
Problem I have been talking about politics is was he's the only one who cares about

3544
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:05,200
politics.

3545
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:07,400
OK, OK, politics.

3546
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:10,120
But every time they talk about it, he says, I'm not a professional.

3547
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:11,320
I haven't researched this.

3548
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:14,400
True. Nate did research during fucking log in.

3549
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,400
He should fuck research the fuck out of green log in.

3550
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:19,560
So he could be an authority on it.

3551
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:22,600
So Nate, why are you talking about politics when you can talk about green

3552
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:24,680
log in instead of what you care about?

3553
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:25,600
Talk about your art.

3554
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,160
Talk about their artistic process.

3555
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:29,720
Make the PCP Rebel Pixels again.

3556
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:32,520
OK.

3557
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:35,000
Yeah, I mean, fair, fair comment, fair comment.

3558
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:37,320
Can't can do that.

3559
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:40,200
You know what, actually, this was almost kind of entirely

3560
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:43,120
like one kind of like topic dedicated PCP.

3561
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:45,360
You know, we've been talking about tossing back and forth.

3562
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:48,120
The idea of like doing like a topic episode.

3563
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:51,360
And I just think that like trying it out couldn't hurt,

3564
02:36:51,440 --> 02:36:53,120
even if it doesn't not the whole episode.

3565
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:55,200
We tried it out for like a year and a half.

3566
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:56,320
Well, we tried for several years.

3567
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:57,720
Wait, stop, stop.

3568
02:36:57,720 --> 02:37:00,480
Everyone is like, oh, God, like,

3569
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:02,720
poppics are banned now when, like, at the very beginning,

3570
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:03,720
we went back to topicals.

3571
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:06,600
It's always like, hey, the reason why we don't like to talk about this is

3572
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:09,920
sometimes a lot of the time, the topics aren't anything that we care about.

3573
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:11,120
That's the specific problem.

3574
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:13,560
And if there ever was a topic where we wanted to talk about something

3575
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:16,000
exclusively, then we should do that, and that makes sense.

3576
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,120
True. This was like established at the very beginning.

3577
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:20,840
Like this isn't like a controversial, like, oh, we have to either do.

3578
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:22,440
Either. I totally agree.

3579
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:23,680
I don't disagree.

3580
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:26,840
I mean, today's episode was a topic.

3581
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:28,880
It was right. And obviously we all did.

3582
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:33,800
I think what will generally make it better for people is to just be more

3583
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:38,560
mindful of, like, rotating the cast of characters on the show.

3584
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:42,960
Because, like, the last week, it was all just Digi and Majin Tom,

3585
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:46,800
which is a unique cast of characters for the podcast.

3586
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:49,680
And everyone in the comments seemed pretty positive about it.

3587
02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:55,440
True. Maybe it's just separating Nate and Ben forever on the podcast.

3588
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,840
Maybe that's what needs to be done.

3589
02:37:56,840 --> 02:38:00,920
Well, I think we've because everyone's just complaining about the pot.

3590
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:03,880
By the way, in the in the hotel room,

3591
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:08,640
I got to witness firsthand the loudest and most furious communism debate

3592
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:10,480
I've ever heard from this.

3593
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:13,440
Yeah, that was between Nate was going to let him finish.

3594
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:15,800
Yeah, it was Ben and Michelle.

3595
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:17,520
That's true.

3596
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:20,880
And it was like it was like the PCP were a physical location

3597
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:23,520
and I was inside of it with Noah and you can't leave.

3598
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:25,760
Except that.

3599
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:27,280
Yeah, I had to run away, though.

3600
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,040
We just left the room.

3601
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:29,880
Well, that's the night.

3602
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:31,440
You're all cowards.

3603
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:35,200
Thing about the thing about that was that, yeah, we were like literally

3604
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:38,920
shouting at each other and then like, but then like at the end,

3605
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:41,840
it was just like it was just over and it was fine.

3606
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,120
Yeah. I don't know.

3607
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:46,160
It was like even even when even when we even when we were shouting,

3608
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:49,160
like I didn't feel like bad, like I felt like a little annoyed,

3609
02:38:49,160 --> 02:38:52,440
but I didn't feel like I wouldn't consider this person shouting.

3610
02:38:52,800 --> 02:38:54,800
And like there was there was no cool down either.

3611
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:59,040
It went from it went from loud shouting to just in the debates over at the end.

3612
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:00,120
That's true.

3613
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:04,560
There was some form of conciliation that was like they agreed that like

3614
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:06,680
something was bad or something.

3615
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:08,320
And then it was like, yeah, OK, we're good.

3616
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:11,120
It was like she if I remember she was like,

3617
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:13,440
what are you what are you going to do?

3618
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:16,360
Just like storm rich people's houses and take their shit.

3619
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:18,640
And I was like, no, I just think we should tax them.

3620
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:20,120
And she was like, oh, OK, I agree.

3621
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:20,760
Yeah, yeah.

3622
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:22,840
That was the end of the end of the debate.

3623
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:26,200
OK, you know, for the record, I just wonder about this sometimes.

3624
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:30,320
Sometimes I no one's ever said this, but I always wonder if people think

3625
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:33,840
that in some way, Michelle, who, you know, basically seems to agree

3626
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:38,160
with me on a lot of these things, like is like my agents are like acting

3627
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,080
on my behalf, but I just want to be clear.

3628
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:42,000
That's absolutely not true.

3629
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,960
We I mean, sure, we talk about these things,

3630
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:47,640
but she's not like an indoctrinated mind person.

3631
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,480
And we disagree on quite a bit.

3632
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:52,280
So I don't know if anybody ever thought that I just want to be clear.

3633
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:53,400
That's not the case.

3634
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:55,200
Michelle's a fucking name.

3635
02:39:56,200 --> 02:40:00,040
Yeah, I mean, if Nate had around the worst.

3636
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:07,640
I I like I giggle with glee laying back in my my soft bed, thinking

3637
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:11,680
about how I've slurred if I'd made about how it's like the worst thing

3638
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:12,840
that you would you did.

3639
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:14,760
Achieve slurring the term Nate had.

3640
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:16,280
That's true. That's true.

3641
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:18,760
Possibly because I didn't push back against it at all.

3642
02:40:18,760 --> 02:40:20,880
And also and also invented the term.

3643
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:22,920
That's true. Yeah, that's true.

3644
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:24,400
Well, rest in peace, Nate heads.

3645
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:27,920
That's going to do it for another episode of the procrastinators podcast.

3646
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:29,600
The party's just the end.

3647
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:31,560
Yeah, that's that. That's the last one.

3648
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:33,400
Oh, thank thank God.

3649
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:35,520
How long was this one? This is what are we at?

3650
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:36,800
Two and a half hours.

3651
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:38,960
Good. So this is a meaty one.

3652
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:39,800
Patreon.com.

3653
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:41,520
Rack on four today.

3654
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:42,440
Let's see, guys, the air.

3655
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:44,560
That's that's that's next on the agenda for sure.

3656
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:48,280
We didn't even get to talk about how I destroyed my basement floor.

3657
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:50,600
Do you want to talk about the real quick, save it for next time?

3658
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:55,040
Or I'd be happy to feel like you want to talk about that next time,

3659
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:57,320
Munchie? Yeah, yeah, talk about an RFC.

3660
02:40:57,320 --> 02:40:58,000
Let's see about RFC.

3661
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,280
I'll talk about just fucking fair enough.

3662
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:02,360
Follow us on RFC K.

3663
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:04,000
Oh, RFC K is on YouTube now.

3664
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,080
I've I've I've moved.

3665
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:07,400
Well, I haven't as of you hearing this.

3666
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:08,960
Yeah, yeah, I moved all the streams.

3667
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:12,880
I'm uploading all the streams onto the ratty fuckers cop killers YouTube channel

3668
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:16,320
because I know some people just don't in don't won't go to Twitch.

3669
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:17,240
So if you're on YouTube

3670
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:21,240
and you want to see all that, there's like 40,000 hours of a ratty fuckers.

3671
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:23,520
Well, now that my boy ninja is not on Twitch,

3672
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:25,880
why would I dane to go there?

3673
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:27,440
It doesn't have the stamp of approval.

3674
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:30,080
So, you know, he was sucking up all the traffic.

3675
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:31,560
So like, it's got to go somewhere.

3676
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:34,160
And why why would it go anywhere but ratty fuckers?

3677
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:37,600
Are you guys going to stream there or just like re upload the the streams there?

3678
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:40,400
You know, I was I was I was thinking about maybe we could do

3679
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:42,400
I mean, it's possible to dual stream.

3680
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:45,240
It's possible to dual stream to Twitch and YouTube at the same time.

3681
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:46,440
Oh, that'd probably be good.

3682
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:48,960
I don't know exactly how to do it, but I know it's possible.

3683
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:51,760
Well, we can think about it.

3684
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:55,080
Yeah, OK, in any case, my body is all sore from yesterday, Ben.

3685
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:57,680
I'm still like I'm like writhing in pain right now.

3686
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,680
Why are you sore? That's what I wanted.

3687
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:02,080
Oh, because Munchy came over and worked out yesterday. Oh, sick.

3688
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:04,400
That's dope. Munchy and Munchy and, you know,

3689
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:07,840
Cassie's been coming over and this time she brought Munchy and we all fucking

3690
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:13,280
lifted and I'll just yeah, the floor of my basement is destroyed as a result

3691
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:15,720
of this other lifting exercise or yes.

3692
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:17,040
Yes, that's right.

3693
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,800
How interesting.

3694
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:21,040
Turn to literal gravel. Oh, my God.

3695
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:22,840
That's a story for another time.

3696
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:23,800

02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:13,360
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3722
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:16,160
But I'm not working.

3723
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:18,760
I'm doing nothing.

3724
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:21,400
My dick, I'm jerking.

3725
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:24,120
Myself, I'm sucking.

3726
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:26,760
I am an asshole.

3727
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:29,400
I am a stupid.

3728
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:32,080

02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:34,480
Don't want to do it.
