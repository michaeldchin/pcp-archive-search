1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Hey, so Ben, about that Christmas thing.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,160
Hey, about that Christmas joke I just made!

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,760
Um, I said Merry Christmas, and you said, you missed Christmas, and I said, what?

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,600
You mean I was visited by those three ghosts of Christmas, only to wake up too late and

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
miss it?

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,720
Now I can't make it right.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,440
It's a literary reference, do you understand?

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,040
No, and I don't want to.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,560
You're from the country of Dickens.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,120
Explain it.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,280
Well you see, there's this character called Kermit the Frog, and he's struggling to make

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,920
ends meet with his tiny little family with pigs and frogs, Miss Piggy.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
Was Kermit the Scrooge?

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
No.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,080
I've never seen him up at Christmas Carols.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,560
You've never seen the only Christmas Carol adaptation, the only one.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,880
Not even the original exists anymore, that's the only one.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,600
There is no original, it's simply existed from the beginning of time.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,720
It's older than Christmas itself.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,480
It's got Michael Cain as Scrooge.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:26,200
People read that story by Dickens about a fanciful world in which holidays exist, and

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,840
they were like, this sounds so cool, we should make this real, and then they invented Christmas.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,720
They invented Christmas, and they invented hard working conditions, and curmudgeonly

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
old men, and ghosts.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
They invented labour.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
They invented capitalism.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,640
They invented London.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,160
They invented snow, all kinds of great stuff.

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,160
The childhood, they invented children.

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,040
They even invented the passing of time and death.

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,600
Yeah, it was pretty nice.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,040
The ghost of Christmas future in the Muppet Christmas Carol is the scariest version of

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,120
death that exists.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,240
I'm curious.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,560
Well, it's not like a visual thing necessarily, it looks like a Grim Reaper, but it's just

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,320
like juxtaposed with all the funny Muppets the whole time, and then it's like actually,

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,800
you'll die, and no one will care.

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Oh my god, yeah, that's one hell of a guy there.

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
How could they not?

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
They didn't even have a Muppet.

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
They didn't even have a Muppet?

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Play the guy?

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
That's crazy.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,440
Yeah, if it was a Muppet, it would be like, ah, like a little death, little time guy.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,240
No, I mean Michael Cain.

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Oh, Michael Cain.

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,880
I expected that like Kermit would be Scrooge or something.

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,560
Well, they always had people intermixing with the Muppets.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,560
I guess so.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,600
I watched Muppet Treasure Island, I think specifically because Jesse said it was the

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
best movie ever made.

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
I love that movie as well.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,360
I thought it was pretty good, I guess.

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,320
There's a lot of little things like that that sort of made me realize that Jesse was cool.

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,840
He liked Tomb Raider, and he likes Muppet Treasure Island, and I was like, oh.

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,320
Rare qualities in a person liking those two things.

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Liking those specific medias.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,440
Rest in peace, Jesse.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,080
Well, hey, I like stuff that's cool.

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,560
I like Homestuck, so, you know, fuck that guy.

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,800
Homestuck, Homestuck, actually.

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,080
Yeah, you're right.

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,240
And I know you're right, but I won't admit it.

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,800
The only thing good about Homestuck is the porn people make.

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Oh my, oh my God.

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Never mind.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,040
No, no, that's not true.

68
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,240
That's not, that's not, not only is it not the only good thing that's not even good or

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
cool at all.

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
No, it is.

71
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:18,080
You shouldn't, you shouldn't say a nasty thing like that.

72
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
You fuck.

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:26,880
Look, I just say what is the truth to hell with, with what is acceptable on youtube.com

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
or any online space.

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
Pornography is good.

76
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,200
I said it.

77
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,480
Don't you know that what is acceptable on YouTube is the good?

78
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,080
They are one and the same.

79
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Nope.

80
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:53,160
Oh, shit, I don't have an argument, I just thought it was true, like, shit.

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,560
Are we waiting for Tom?

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Tom said he was in New York Times.

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,680
I assumed he was going to be here.

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,200
I mean, I guess we can start without him, I mean, yeah, he knew we were starting.

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,080
He knew when we were doing it.

86
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,320
Yee-haw.

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,920
So we can give him another minute or two.

88
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,240
Give him, give him the 10 minute grace period and then start, well, we're already like nine

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
minutes into it.

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,560
You know, I mean, if Tom doesn't show up, maybe we should just use this as the episode.

91
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,680
Yeah, maybe.

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
Maybe we should just say fuck it.

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,360
This is, see, that audience, what you just heard was supposed to be, what you, what you

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,640
just heard was meant to be bonus content, but we're, so that's a taste of what you'll

95
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,280
get at patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

96
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,720
Eventually when the bonus behind the scenes footage episode is made, it is not made yet,

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,200
it's not real, but it will be eventually.

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,040
So I don't know.

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Sounds pretty cool, right?

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,320
It's like a conversation, but again, it's almost, it's almost like a real conversation.

101
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,160
Uh, I, well now, okay, I just, I just glanced.

102
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,160
The reason I got excited a minute ago was I glanced over at, at the ticker.

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,440
Bitcoin went up, Bitcoin went up a little bit.

104
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,040
Just a tiny little bit, just a, just a tiny, just a tiny little bit of the amount that

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,440
I've lost just today was recouped.

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,800
Just a tiny little bit, just a tiny little coin.

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Just a tiny, the tiniest little smidgen of crypto value was reclaimed.

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,720
Uh, I have had my, my, my crypto is, today's been rough.

109
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,400
Today's been rough because I made terrible decisions.

110
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,720
Uh, I bought in at the worst possible fucking time.

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
Uh, very, very stupid.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,480
You know, I was like, I was like, you know, it seems so obvious that I shouldn't buy

113
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,600
when the price is high, that probably everyone's not going to buy now when the price is peaking.

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,760
So I should buy right now because it'll trick them.

115
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,560
You see, they won't, they won't see it coming.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,640
And that's exactly what I did.

117
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,720
So you bought more?

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
Have you talked about this on the PCP so far?

119
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,520
I think this is like only happening in the last few days.

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
I might have briefly mentioned it on the last one because I think I bought

121
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,200
a little bit of Bitcoin before the last episode.

122
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,200
Um, I just, just yesterday, I bought, I sold what I had because I got spooked.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
And then I was like, and then it rose again.

124
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,600
And I was like, ah, fuck, I missed, I missed out on that.

125
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:49,920
Fuck it.

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm in for the long haul this time.

127
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
So I bought a bunch more right as Bitcoin was peaking.

128
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,240
And all day today, it has been slowly trickling down.

129
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,560
And I'm just trying to resist the temptation to be skittish and sell.

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Um, because that's what I did last time.

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
It fucked me up.

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,520
All right.

133
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,760
I, it's actually, it's actually gone up.

134
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,000
It's actually gone up, um, like, wait, uh, let me, uh, it's gone up like 200,

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
it's gone up like 200 points just since this episode began, which is kind of nice.

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,640
But anyway, it's, it's like,

137
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,320
part of the, um, the reason I didn't get into Bitcoin when I could have,

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
because I think I bought some, I told, I told you this earlier,

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,600
but I think I'm pretty sure I bought like 44 pounds worth in like 2018 or something.

140
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,560
You, you said, you didn't say, when you said it was 45 pounds, I was like, oh, okay.

141
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,160
Because before that you said, do you think you own a tenth of a Bitcoin?

142
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,280
Yeah, I didn't know how much it was.

143
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,320
Do you know how much a tenth of it?

144
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
That's like, that's like $3,000 worth of Bitcoin.

145
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
Yeah.

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
Or it would be now.

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,320
At the time it would have been, you know, 600.

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah.

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
I don't know what it was at the time I bought it.

150
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,760
It was like 0.0 or something, 0.0 or something.

151
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,720
Um, but I bought it because it was like all in the news and it was like everyone who had,

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,560
who had Bitcoin was like a million.

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,520
It is skyrocketing.

154
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,760
It is skyrocketing right now.

155
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
It just shot up another like 100 points.

156
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
Is it going to the moon?

157
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,960
It's going to the moon.

158
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,320
33, 2, 9, 9.

159
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh, it's going back down.

160
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,360
33, 2, 7, 7.

161
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Oh, 33, 2, 9, 1.

162
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,360
See this?

163
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
8, 9.

164
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,640
90.

165
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,440
Oh my God.

166
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
It's just the sheer vertical green line.

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,800
It's like, oh, that's literally money in my pocket.

168
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,040
This is the most fucked up I've ever been.

169
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
This is the most addicted to anything I've ever been.

170
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,920
This has completely ruined my life and I'm over.

171
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,400
It's done.

172
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,320
I found the thing that destroys me.

173
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,400
Yeah.

174
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,920
And it's watching the fucking Bitcoin.

175
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,880
It's that this is part of the reason why I didn't really

176
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,160
want to get too much into it because like stonks and shares

177
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,080
and money things that are like money can go up and down

178
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
and you don't really do anything.

179
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,600
You just sort of keep track of it and buy and sell.

180
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,320
That whole lifestyle, it's always appeared as though

181
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,320
you can get like a maximum amount of money

182
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
from a minimum amount of actual work.

183
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,200
You just need to invest initially and be smart

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
and learn about all this stuff.

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
And it's like, cool, that's great.

186
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
But my brain doesn't work like that.

187
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,280
And I get too overwhelmed looking at the thing.

188
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,160
I would probably just like, yeah, it would ruin my life.

189
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,120
It would make me just sit here doing nothing

190
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
but looking at the thing going up and down

191
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,600
and being sad constantly.

192
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
Honestly, that's what I've been doing.

193
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,440
That's what I've been doing today and it's really bad.

194
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
Like, it's bad that, oh, I kind of lost money

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
because I had to pay fees to buy in and oh,

196
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,080
it kind of went down so I lost a little bit in value.

197
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,280
But the real cost of it has been that it has cost me

198
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,040
like a day or two wherein I've been able to do nothing

199
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,760
except look at these fucking numbers.

200
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,360
The way it feels to me is exactly the same as Cookie Clicker

201
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,960
or one of those other idle games where I know

202
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,800
that if I start one of those,

203
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,400
I will get into it for a month, two months,

204
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,160
and I will be so dedicated to getting all the achievements

205
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,120
like from the ground up.

206
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
I never like start from a loaded save file.

207
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,560
I always start new, fresh, and I just play

208
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
and I'm loving it seeing the numbers go up,

209
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
but it really fucks up with everything else

210
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
and that's going on.

211
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,600
And this is real life.

212
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,480
So like it's even more damaging if it doesn't go well.

213
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,200
So it's even more stressful.

214
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,720
And I'm like, I don't, even if I could get a lot of money from it,

215
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,880
even if I could somehow find my fucking password and account

216
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
because I lost them,

217
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,520
because I didn't pay attention to what they were.

218
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,080
Where did you buy them?

219
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,920
Because like I didn't realize, I didn't know how to get some.

220
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,360
I only got some because PayPal made it

221
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
so you can just buy it directly from PayPal.

222
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
And I was like, fuck yeah, because they offer me 25 free dollars.

223
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
I think like when it was in the news initially

224
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,520
and it was like Bitcoin is now making people millionaires,

225
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm like, ah, fuck, I missed the boat.

226
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,880
But maybe it'll keep going up because it was currently going down.

227
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,000
It's literally going to the moon right now.

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,640
Right now.

229
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm watching.

230
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,960
I can't fucking believe it.

231
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,280
Okay, four context.

232
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Four context.

233
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,880
I bought in last night at like 3.15 a.m.

234
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,800
and the value was about, Bitcoin was valued at about 34.2 thousand dollars per Bitcoin.

235
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,600
And then over the next like, you know, however many hours,

236
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,800
it's it's it's it's sank down gradually to about 32.4.

237
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
And then just since this podcast has began,

238
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,080
it is up back to 33.4.

239
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,080
So I don't know, pretty fucking epic, I guess.

240
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah, my value judgment is that even if I can make a lot of money off of it.

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,560
It's not worth the cost of your soul.

242
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
It's it's not in a moral sense, but just sort of in a like, I know what you mean.

243
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,320
Yeah, it really drains me to think about it too much.

244
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,200
You would have to be.

245
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,160
I would have to be a business boy first and foremost in order to like live like that.

246
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,640
Well, I mean, you get you get into it because you think that it's like, oh,

247
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,040
all I have to do is make like a couple of smart plays and that and then I'll be set.

248
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
And then I won't have to do it anymore.

249
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
But then, you know, it's never quite that simple.

250
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,320
It's and eventually you maybe you become one of those.

251
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,080
Because you've done it once, then you you feel compelled to do it again.

252
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,160
And then it just it will stay there.

253
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,200
It'll continue.

254
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,680
You can't just stop doing something like that if it works.

255
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,560
I bought the first time I bought in, I just got some just kind of let it sit for a week.

256
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
Looked at it and I was like, oh, wow, the price went up pretty good.

257
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,360
And then like I was watching it because the price was going up really fast one day.

258
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
I was like, oh my god, this was the day that Bitcoin hit 30 K.

259
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,000
It was it like as soon as it hit 30 K, it like it like shot up another like 10%

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,120
in like a couple hours.

261
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
It was crazy.

262
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
So I watched it do that.

263
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
And I was like, holy shit.

264
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
And then it started to go down.

265
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,280
And I was like, okay, time to I'm out.

266
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm out.

267
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
So I sold.

268
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,160
And then I and in all told, I think I made like 100 bucks just from like,

269
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
I think I invested like $500 or something in it.

270
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,480
So I made a huge return.

271
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,680
That was like a really good time.

272
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
I wish I had invested more.

273
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,680
And I thought that I was like, damn, if only I'd invested more, I would have made.

274
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
I could have made so much more.

275
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,920
And then I saw that after I sold, it went down, but then it went up again.

276
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
And I was like, I missed out on more.

277
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,640
I missed out on more gains.

278
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,160
I have to be invested.

279
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,120
If I'm not invested, I'm constantly missing out on profits.

280
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,920
And it's literally damned if you do, damned if you don't, because if you're invested

281
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,560
and you could be, you could be losing out because the numbers are going down.

282
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,880
But if at any point you're not invested, you could be missing out if it's going up.

283
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,800
Like you're literally fucked.

284
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm fucked forever.

285
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,920
It's a hindsight.

286
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,160
Like it's all predictable, unpredictable, especially with this sort of stuff.

287
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,760
Like normal market shares and stocks are a little more predictable, I assume, than Bitcoin.

288
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,120
Because people always talk about how Bitcoin is insane.

289
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Bitcoin is much more volatile.

290
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
It is much more volatile, I think, than a.

291
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:39,600
Like if you don't pay attention to it every hour, it could plummet until it's completely worthless.

292
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
And if you aren't paying attention, if you're not awake during that time,

293
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
you might miss out, you might lose all your money.

294
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
So it's like, I don't know.

295
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,520
Yeah.

296
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:54,000
But really, I keep trying to, because I made money a little bit of money the first time,

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,520
because I just let it sit.

298
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,440
And really, that's what you want to do.

299
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,720
You want to get some and just let it sit and accrue value over time.

300
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,280
Like buying it and selling it over and over again, because as the market goes up and down,

301
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,320
up and down in little waves, is really stupid and self-defeating.

302
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
Because you have to pay fees with every transaction.

303
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
And that's not how you're supposed to do it.

304
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
You're supposed to buy some and hold some.

305
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,960
So that's what I'm trying to do.

306
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,520
It's been going down all day, but I keep looking at it and I'm like,

307
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,280
just because it's going down right now, doesn't mean it's going to keep going down right now.

308
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,800
I didn't buy it with the idea that I would sell it,

309
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
like as soon as I could make a few hundred bucks off it or whatever.

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,160
I was like, I'm just going to buy it and I'm just going to hold it and just see what happens.

311
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,200
Yeah.

312
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
And but it's, I'm not, I can't stick to it.

313
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
It's too difficult.

314
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,720
Yeah.

315
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm not trying to like moralize saying it's a bad thing to do.

316
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,760
No, no, no, no.

317
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,760
But it's, you definitely need the right kind of brain wiring to like keep on track of it

318
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,800
and not go insane.

319
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,760
And I don't have that.

320
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,760
I'm sure, I'm sure I will eventually learn to just ignore it

321
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
or just check it like once in the morning or whatever.

322
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,240
One of these days I might actually remember where my bitcoins is

323
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,960
and then I will be able to look at it.

324
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,520
You said you got it like before last year, which means that it must be worth much more now than

325
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,400
when you got it.

326
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,440
I have no idea.

327
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,080
I remember getting it at a time when it was plummeting and it just continued to do that.

328
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,480
Lol.

329
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,880
And I was like, well, maybe Bitcoin isn't for me.

330
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
And so I forgot all about where I had it and what my password was.

331
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,760
So I've been, when you were talking about it earlier, I was like, maybe I could try and find

332
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
that and I couldn't find it.

333
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
I didn't know where the hell to start looking.

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,720
I remember this thing called Coinbase or something seemed familiar, but I did the thing

335
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,760
where like forgot my password, send an email and I didn't get anything.

336
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
So I'm not sure if that was the one.

337
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,760
Honestly, if I was going to do crypto trading, I should probably do it in something like Coinbase

338
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,560
or something like not PayPal, because I'm pretty sure PayPal does not have the best fees.

339
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,920
I'm pretty sure I'm probably paying more in fees with PayPal than I would with some other

340
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,040
more dedicated trading program.

341
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,440
Yeah.

342
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
I just Googled something at the time.

343
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,680
I was like, how to get Bitcoin here.

344
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,240
Here's how.

345
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
And it was very confusing and I was scared.

346
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,440
Yeah.

347
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
And I managed to spend money.

348
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm surprised you went through with it because it seems complicated and daunting.

349
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,320
And like if PayPal didn't just give me a button to click to do it, I'm sure I wouldn't have done it.

350
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,640
Yeah.

351
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:38,160
I read enough that I was like, well, I'm just going to throw like 50 or 40 pounds into this

352
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
and expect it to just disappear and never be found ever again.

353
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,960
Because that's not a lot of money.

354
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
I can take that on the chin pretty easily.

355
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,560
Yeah.

356
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,240
That was my mentality at least.

357
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,000
Like it's scary, so I won't do much.

358
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,600
And then I was stupid and I forgot all the things.

359
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,720
That's my thinking.

360
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,320
I'm looking at these numbers go up and down.

361
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,560
Like, oh God, that's my real money.

362
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,680
But I invested an amount that I could afford to lose.

363
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,040
And like, okay, worst case scenario is what?

364
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm out like a couple hundred dollars.

365
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,720
Like, well, oh well, what a tragedy.

366
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,120
So, I don't know.

367
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,320
But you know, maybe it's like a, I almost feel like it's a cultural thing.

368
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,920
Like I feel like Bitcoin is sort of a cultural institution.

369
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,400
Is maybe something that I am a little bit chuffed to be participating in?

370
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,280
Yeah.

371
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,520
Yeah, I mean, there's no, as far as I understand, there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue

372
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,400
to act like this.

373
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,800
It may actually settle over decades into a normal sort of currency that doesn't go

374
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,480
insane like this does.

375
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,640
And then it would just be a normal part of life.

376
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,480
But this is like the advent of Bitcoin in the last few years.

377
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,240
Yeah.

378
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,960
It's pretty cool.

379
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah.

380
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,560
The first time, I said this in the chat before, but the first time it peaked and like it went

381
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,280
from nothing to like whatever, it hit like 10 or 12K or something.

382
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,160
Uh, it seemed like that was seemed like a once in a lifetime event.

383
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,320
But it's much higher now.

384
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,440
I mean, to be fair, that proportionally that rise was much higher because it started out

385
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,360
being worth like a fucking like a dollar per Bitcoin and it went to 10K.

386
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,040
The second time it went from maybe like 6K up to like 30K.

387
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,280
So proportionally, like, yeah, the first one was a much bigger spike.

388
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,880
Even if it's the absolute numbers are higher now.

389
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,720
I really like how the slime coin that I'm currently holding is modeled after the Bitcoin

390
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
in the way that it's got the data all over it.

391
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,120
The little circuit board stuff.

392
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,520
It's great.

393
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:04,960
I spent so, so long taking an image of that like physical Bitcoin representation and like

394
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,880
photo bashing it and then sort of like drawing over the photo bash to make that design.

395
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,680
And then I paid and then I paid someone to make that into a vector.

396
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,280
And then they did kind of a crappy job.

397
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,240
So I had to go in and manually like make adjustments to the vector that that slime

398
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,880
coin is like weeks of work, just like getting it to look right.

399
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm honestly shocked that it didn't that like it looks as good as it does physically.

400
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,920
I thought they would fuck it up or like there would be parts of the text that like got mashed

401
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,800
together or something.

402
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,640
But no, it's perfect.

403
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,120
It is.

404
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
It's remarkable.

405
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,680
It's so good.

406
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,640
I just ordered 100 more of them actually.

407
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,600
What for fun?

408
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Or are you going to sell them?

409
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,480
Well, the idea is that I'm assuming that they will be sold or or used as promotional items in

410
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,920
some capacity in the future.

411
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,480
I don't know exactly what I'll do with them, but like I almost I didn't quite sell out of the first

412
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,880
hundred I got, but I was close enough that I was like, I should get more of these.

413
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,400
And so I did.

414
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
They're not here yet, though.

415
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
They're, I don't know, in the mail or whatever.

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,840
I like the idea of slime coin being the only physical exclusive cryptocurrency.

417
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Yeah, like it's it's crypto, but every crypto it's contained on these circuit board coins

418
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,560
and you have to physically exchange them.

419
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,480
And they had like a USB port that you could like you could like jack into to extract the data,

420
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,040
but it's been like sanded off and you can't do that anymore.

421
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,440
The data is in there, but it's it's totally inaccessible forever.

422
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,720
It's all dumped up with slime.

423
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,240
That's right.

424
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,880
That's right.

425
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,080
Yeah, money.

426
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,240
I fucking love money.

427
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,600
Not me.

428
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
Sad to say, but it's true.

429
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,920
But I only love money so much because capitalism means that I have to.

430
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,160
It's not my fault.

431
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm a product of the system I was raised in.

432
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,400
True that.

433
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Patreon.com slash Benzane.

434
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,000
If you want to make me happy by giving me more money.

435
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,680
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators to make both of us happy and less like like split the

436
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,600
split it down.

437
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,640
That's true.

438
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
That's that's true and valid.

439
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,240
Very, very.

440
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,880
I could also say my own Patreon, but I haven't been making anything.

441
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,160
So I feel like that's stupid.

442
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
I have been I revealed.

443
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,160
I've been hinting at Twitter on Twitter about the thing I've been working on.

444
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,600
Oh, you haven't said it.

445
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,520
You said it in a Patreon Ben thing that I still haven't listened to yet.

446
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,640
I talked.

447
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,280
I talked about it in the Patreon Q&A.

448
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:01,600
I talked about what it was and I said in that Q&A that I will probably be posting like patrons only

449
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:09,360
like updates and like little previews and stuff at pieces of it as they get done.

450
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,600
Actually, I was just working on a little bit for it before we started recording and thinking like,

451
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,920
okay, when I'm done with this, I will, you know, maybe arrange it into into something

452
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,160
that will make it for a nice little update thing.

453
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,200
Just show show those fucking guys over there.

454
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,160
What's what's going on?

455
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Uh, I was pretty I was pretty drunk when I recorded that, uh, F Q&A this month.

456
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,680
I didn't think that I was at the time, but thinking back on it, I was like, you know,

457
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,560
I kind of don't remember recording it very well.

458
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,080
So I think maybe I was drunk.

459
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,920
Lol.

460
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,600
And I just didn't realize.

461
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,040
Yeah.

462
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,240
Yeah.

463
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,560
You know, so who knows how these things happen.

464
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,280
You know, you're talking about your mysterious construction.

465
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,600
My mysterious construction.

466
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,160
I kind of have a mysterious construction and the same reason I'm not going to talk about it is

467
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,040
the same reason you have is that if I talk about it, the idea will be gone out of my head and it

468
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,560
will have less in like incentive or less like less gusto.

469
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,240
It'll drain my gusto and then I won't be making it as hard anymore.

470
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,200
Yep.

471
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,920
Yeah, that's that's that's a little thing.

472
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,200
So, so I guess we're at a standstill.

473
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,680
We're at a standstill.

474
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,240
So I guess neither of us can talk about anything.

475
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,520
So that's the episode, everybody.

476
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
Well, hey, Ben.

477
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,760
Happy New Year.

478
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
That's right.

479
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,360
Happy New Year.

480
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,000
Did you get it?

481
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,200
Did you get a big drunk at the Happy New Year time?

482
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,680
No, I didn't do anything for New Year's.

483
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,520
I actually I got drunk the next day after one of my roommates had bought a bunch of

484
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,080
whiskey and then none of us did anything.

485
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,880
And I just went to bed early on New Year's.

486
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,800
I didn't stay up for midnight because fuck it.

487
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,680
And I woke up the next day and the whiskey was just out on the table and I just drank some.

488
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,160
And then I went and I recorded the Q&A.

489
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,440
So no, I didn't do anything for New Year's.

490
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,720
Did you?

491
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,360
I guess, well, every year for the past like three years, I've been doing like a

492
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,560
live stream on Gibbon Gaming for like, oh, it's going to be like the fireworks will

493
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,040
go off and it'll be Happy New Year during the stream.

494
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
And like everyone does that.

495
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,680
But since I'm in a different time zone, it'll be earlier for a lot of people.

496
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,520
And, you know, that was fun.

497
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,000
Played 24 of the video game.

498
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,840
And why?

499
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,200
I don't know.

500
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,040
Because it's the countdown?

501
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,800
No, it was just like my brother got me a bunch of shitty PS2

502
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,160
weird games that like just cheap.

503
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,120
And we like playing them and seeing how strange they are.

504
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
24 was actually pretty fun and good.

505
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,720
But it got too hard near the end of the stream.

506
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Is it a shooter?

507
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,920
What is it?

508
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,320
You know 24 of the TV show?

509
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,240
Yeah, with what's the name?

510
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
Kiefer Sutherland, yeah.

511
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:22,400
It's basically like a series season of 24 where there's things in different

512
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,960
boxes moving around and you're Jack Bauer or you're this agent or that agent.

513
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,160
And you've got to kill people and jump and shoot and do the hacking and drive real fast.

514
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,040
And it's like, it's actually quite good for a PS2 game at least.

515
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,320
It's quite a latent development.

516
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
It was an all right stream.

517
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,160
It was quite a few funny moments.

518
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,520
But during that stream, after like a really funny moment, I thought to myself,

519
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,680
that thing that I was thinking of doing, going back over Gibbon Gaming to see.

520
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,440
Do I know what it is or have you not told me?

521
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,960
The thing you were thinking of doing.

522
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
Do I know what it is?

523
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,200
Yeah, I talked about it on the last heckles for shackles live stream, I think.

524
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,760
We were talking about going back over like our own streams and like maybe potentially

525
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,840
paying somebody to get like highlights of stuff.

526
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:25,120
And I was thinking, I should at least check to see how possible it is for myself to even do that.

527
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:33,680
So I look back, there's like 556 hours average sort of like a ballpark estimate.

528
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,480
You have 500 hours.

529
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
500 something out of stream over the last three or four years.

530
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,920
Oh my God.

531
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,000
Not actually that much.

532
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,120
I say, oh my God, but I wonder maybe I might have a lot.

533
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,360
I would do really long streams once in a while.

534
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Maybe I don't know.

535
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,080
That makes me wonder how much I've got saved up from the past.

536
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
A few moments later.

537
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,120
Eleazar, cut that out.

538
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,160
Cut out all the way.

539
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,120
What did you do?

540
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,760
What did you do?

541
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,680
His dinner arrived.

542
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm not going to eat it now.

543
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,440
Oh, what was I saying?

544
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,560
You were saying the fight.

545
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Okay, Eleazar, cut me rambling there.

546
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,240
That was, I don't know what I was talking about.

547
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,920
You were saying about there were 550 hours of streams.

548
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,560
Yeah, yeah.

549
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,440
So there's like 500 something hours of streams.

550
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,520
And if I played that back, it would be like 225 something,

551
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,080
a bunch of hours of rewatching my shitty streams at double speed.

552
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:40,160
And I was like, you know, that's like a full month of work if I watched my own streams

553
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,120
for eight hours a day.

554
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,560
Yeah.

555
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,280
And that's like, that seems like a fucking lot.

556
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,040
But maybe I could just check like skim through a few episodes, a few of the streams.

557
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,360
I go back to some of them and they all have this terrible noise on them.

558
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,360
And I never noticed before because I just remember them having been like a thing.

559
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,440
I never really go back and re-listen to them and they've all got like noise.

560
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,880
Well, like fan noise or something?

561
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,080
Yeah, fan noise or just like background noise that's just annoying.

562
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,440
And I'm like, oh God, I'll have to like download these, get rid of the noise and then look through it.

563
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,040
And it's, I just, I just realized that my given gaming streams suck.

564
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,640
And like you really have to be there.

565
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,400
And you really have to be in the room with me playing the game if you want to enjoy it.

566
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,160
And I understand why nobody watches them.

567
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,720
That's that's just what streams are.

568
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,160
Yeah.

569
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,640
It's just like that.

570
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,520
I think most people don't really care about a little bit of fan noise.

571
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,400
No, yeah, I suppose not.

572
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,200
But like it's, it's, it's annoying me that like I had never noticed and nobody has ever pointed it out

573
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,640
all that time.

574
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,520
But that's on me really for not listening back at all.

575
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,680
Given gaming sucks.

576
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,720
I thought it was okay.

577
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
I thought it was like cool or something.

578
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,480
Nothing's cool, Gib.

579
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,800
That's your fucking problem is you think

580
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,400
that's a thing that things can be.

581
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,440
I am going to flip my fucking shit.

582
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,120
I will, here's my promise.

583
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,560
I will flip shit if I'm watching the ticker.

584
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:23,760
If Bitcoin hits, if Bitcoin hits 34K while we're on stream, I will, I will punch my fucking monitor.

585
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,480
I will crack it.

586
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,520
I will punch my Cintiq and smash it with a thousand pieces for your, no, I won't do that.

587
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,360
But it'll be fucking epic.

588
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,600
And I, and I will let you know.

589
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,960
Did you hear any of that?

590
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,360
Yeah, yeah.

591
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,040
Yeah, you'll, you'll, you'll punch your Cintiq and destroy it.

592
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,720
I'll, I'll literally kill myself.

593
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,560
Oh, don't do that.

594
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,840
Then all the money will go.

595
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,440
Yeah, you're right.

596
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
Yeah, you'll go to your first one.

597
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,160
Just Elon Musk will just inherit it by birth, right?

598
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,720
I assume.

599
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,680
The other thing, the other thing that's keeping me going, the other thing that's keeping me from

600
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,920
suicide is that Bitcoin has been trickling down today.

601
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,600
However, I also got some Ethereum and the Ethereum went up and did really well.

602
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,280
So I lost with the Bitcoin, but I gained some of that back with the Ethereum.

603
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,960
So it's kind of like, I'm a little down, but I'm not so far down.

604
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,920
I'm like, I'm good.

605
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm just, I has on the prize.

606
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,640
I has on the prize, Ben.

607
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,080
Why is it called Ethereum?

608
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,840
That's like, like a World of Warcraft magical crystal gem currency.

609
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,360
It sounds, its logo is a fucking Final Fantasy jewel gem.

610
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,200
What a fucking nerd made that.

611
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,560
It looks fucking sick.

612
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:36,880
Yeah.

613
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,880
I don't, I don't know.

614
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,800
There's a little blurb that PayPal lets you read about each of the crypto.

615
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,480
And it's like, oh, Bitcoin, Bitcoin pioneered blockchain technology,

616
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,240
meaning the secured, secure data is very secure and can't be hacked.

617
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
And I'm like, okay, all right.

618
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,600
And then it's like, Ethereum showed what else was possible in the realm of cryptocurrency.

619
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,840
What makes Ethereum special is that it's used in the development of apps.

620
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,600
And I'm like, what the fuck does that mean?

621
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,680
What, what do you mean it's used in the, and it's like, oh, Ether,

622
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,440
Ether is the actual currency.

623
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,960
Think of Ethereum more as an engine with Ether being the fuel that it run.

624
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,640
Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

625
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,520
What, what the fuck are you talking about?

626
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,000
I really feel like alien technology that, that I need a Vsauce video to explain cryptocurrency.

627
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,320
I need like basic baby shit to like, like none of the, none of the fundamental things of like,

628
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,960
you can make coins with computers that just mine like, what?

629
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,800
Like, I don't get it.

630
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,520
I think I understand the idea.

631
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,640
Do they mine at night?

632
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,440
Is that the thing?

633
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,280
The blockchain.

634
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,120
I don't, I mean, I obviously don't know how it works,

635
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,760
but I think I understand the idea of the blockchain is basically just like a peer-to-peer

636
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,280
network, sort of like, what's the word?

637
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,520
What's that thing, the way that you get illegal movies and stuff?

638
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,640
Right, it's some kind of like peer-to-peer network and like,

639
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,920
you can't, I don't know, I read a little thing and it's like, it's secure because to like,

640
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,520
hack it at all, you would have to hack like every, every computer that runs it simultaneously or

641
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,680
something. It's like, okay, so it's this, the reason why Bitcoin is, is a real thing is because

642
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:32,000
this blockchain is very secure and that means that a Bitcoin is not able to be like spoofed

643
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,440
or duplicated because of how secure it exists.

644
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,400
Does it exist in many places at once? Is that the idea?

645
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:46,880
What I believe a Bitcoin is, is, okay, I watched a video about this a while back and I'm like,

646
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,040
a Bitcoin is just data, but it's like a specific piece of data. I think, I think it's like a string

647
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,480
of numbers that are the solution to some arbitrary equation and there are like a set of these equations

648
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,160
or something like that and what each, each Bitcoin is the solution to like the next equation in the

649
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,640
set, but it's like a very complicated one and it needs like a huge amount of processing power

650
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,600
to arrive at each one and that's how what mining Bitcoin is. It's like, it discovers these solutions

651
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,560
through just computing.

652
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,320
So like a daisy chain, a daisy chain of, of computer like equations that is linear?

653
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,920
Can you find the original Bitcoin?

654
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,520
I would assume so. I think so, probably, yeah.

655
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,680
What if, what if everybody turned their computers off? What would happen then?

656
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,840
I think, then I think, well, then Bitcoin would probably cease to exist in the same way that

657
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,320
the universe would not exist if we weren't around to experience it.

658
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,000
I hope that I'm making a complete fool of myself, by the way, and everyone in the comments is like,

659
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,960
Ben, you don't understand. The first thing about the blockchain, Ben, you're not a blockhead like

660
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,720
me, Ben, you don't know shit, you're a moron, you're a rude, I hope.

661
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,240
This is the right way to be, is you make a fool of yourself online about something that you don't

662
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,960
know and then you rely on people saying, oh, actually, and then now you know. It's much easier than school.

663
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,720
It's, it's better and cheaper than school and you don't get coronavirus and it's not,

664
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,920
it's remote learning, but it's in the good way because, and I don't, and the best part is,

665
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,600
I don't even have to learn it because I don't have to read the comments if I don't want to.

666
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,200
I can choose my own custom reality. I can choose to acknowledge or not acknowledge

667
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,440
whatever facts the commenters choose to present me with. It's mine, the universe is mine to command,

668
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,840
to control. Yep. Yep.

669
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:01,200
So, oh, speaking of, speaking of another graph that is constantly going to the moon right now

670
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,600
is the coronavirus in the UK. Oh, it's, oh, America too, America too. Massachusetts really,

671
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:17,040
it's really gross and I don't like looking at it. It's so fucking bad. If you google Covid UK and

672
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,120
you get like the statistics, the Google statistics up and it's like new cases, the little blip at the

673
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,800
like March of last year is like, it's, it's now a little blip, it just goes up a bit and then

674
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:38,640
December, November and now January is like fucking crazy. Okay. This is worse than I thought.

675
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:47,840
It's so upsetting. I mean, I'm scared, Ben. What do I do? Okay. I mean, if you look at the one for

676
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:55,040
the US, the US is similar, although I see that the UK in particular has like a really dramatic

677
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,200
shoot up just in the last like couple weeks. So that's a fucking, that's a bummer. Yep.

678
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,360
I mean, the US also has like, since like late October, it has just, you know, the waves in

679
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:17,920
March and July are like pretty fucking small. Yeah, I'm pretty concerned about it too, but you

680
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,600
know, I'm very glad my dad, my dad, I think is qualified for a phase one vaccination,

681
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,840
which is good because he works in nursing homes. So,

682
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,040
Oh, well, there you go. That's very good. So he's probably going to get vaccinated pretty soon,

683
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:42,240
which is good because he was the one I was most worried about just in terms of him, you know,

684
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:49,200
because of that, because of his vocation. Yeah, I'm not so much scared of dying myself. It's just

685
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,240
like, yeah, if I don't want to give my dad COVID, and he's the only one who actually has to go out

686
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,080
because he works in construction, sometimes he needs to leave. Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, it's pretty

687
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:10,160
bad. And so fucking bad. It's, I'm crossing my fingers, but like the whole like new strain of

688
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:19,200
the virus that's super, super catchable. It's not nice. I don't like it. Is that what it's

689
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,720
deal? It's super catchable? Yeah, I forget the terms that are like smart people use them.

690
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
High transmission rate? High transmission rate, like it can easily pass from one person to the

691
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,760
other much more than the previous variant did. And so it's like you don't need to,

692
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,280
you know, before it was like you wear your mask and you'll basically be all right. As long as you

693
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,640
don't like jump into like, you know, you don't as long as you don't sniff somebody's like nose or

694
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,760
whatever. But now I feel I feel like if I go outside and I breathe the air, somebody nearby

695
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,600
buys breath, breathed, then it could happen. I don't know exactly how it works. I just I'm,

696
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm scared. I'm scared. And I just really is fucking with me every day. I don't like it.

697
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,640
I'm trying to distract myself by thinking happy thoughts and playing video games,

698
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,200
but like I'm trying also to not do that and instead work and get stuff done.

699
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:27,360
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I'm, I'm, I was disappointed to see that it seems like

700
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,600
vaccinations won't be available to the general population before like, April or so. So,

701
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,240
I want one. I want one real bad.

702
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,040
I want one as well. I don't mind waiting personally because

703
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,720
as a younger person, it I'm not as much at risk and I don't need to get out so much. And I would

704
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,560
like to know a bit more about the longevity of the vaccine based on how long it's been around

705
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,600
and people, you know, once once they start reporting how it's been for the people who

706
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,840
got it initially, then I'll be more like confident in taking it.

707
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,880
Yeah, for sure. I agree. I am a little bit glad that I don't have to be the first one to

708
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,960
fucking take it because like, who knows? Although, I mean, it seems like all indications are that

709
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,240
it works pretty well and doesn't really carry much risk of anything. But we'll see, you know,

710
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,160
there'll be like a whole bunch of people to get it first and we can find out for sure, LaMau.

711
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,040
I mean, I don't think there's going to be like a risk of the vaccine itself and also like,

712
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,080
how long does it last and how effective is it at doing the thing it's supposed to do?

713
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,120
Do you need to take them once every two months? I don't know.

714
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,920
It seemed like, okay, you get, it lasts longer than that. I think it might last like

715
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,080
up to a year or something. Well, you know what, I'm pulling figures out my ass. I don't even remember.

716
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,760
But you have to get two. You have to get like vaccinated once and then you have to go back

717
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:15,200
a month later for a second one. And like, you're only like semi-vaccinated in the time between.

718
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,600
They were saying on BBC News that the first one is like, the Oxford one they're talking about,

719
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:29,440
is like the first jab is like 95. So it's pretty, pretty effective. And then the next one, or maybe

720
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:37,920
it was like 91. And then the next one bumps that up to like 98, 99. So the second one is not as

721
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:45,040
important apparently, but it is important if you want big immunity. I do want big immunity.

722
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,280
Yes, I would like that very much, actually. SS tier immunity, please.

723
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,280
I'll take the good immunity. Keep that shit immunity for the birds.

724
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,480
Do you imagine trying to vaccinate a bird? Your needle would just go right through it.

725
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,080
Because it just pierced it like a sword. It just explode like in shred.

726
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,760
Wait, it's time. I got to check on my Bitcoin. It's down a little bit.

727
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,840
Is this going to be like a PCP arc? Been checking Bitcoin and going, that's right.

728
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:39,840
Oh, it's 33, 33, 55. Oh, 33, 60. Oh, 33, 570. Oh, no. 33, 570. Oh, 33, 6. Okay.

729
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:53,520
35, 577, 65, 544, 39. Remember, I bought in at 34.2. 33.2. So that's what I really want.

730
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,440
You could probably do a live stream of you just looking at the thing and saying the numbers out

731
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,280
loud. Yeah, like the live stream, it just shows the graph. I'm just like, oh, 33, 612. Oh, 604.

732
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:18,160
Oh, 33, 604. Going once. Okay, 613, 619. This is the best fucking game I've ever played.

733
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:26,640
I can't believe how grossing this is. It would be like a job for people who are blind

734
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,400
and they want to get into Bitcoin, they would listen to your stream to get the numbers.

735
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,920
It's just me like saying them. Saying them and occasionally going,

736
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,360
okay, no, no, no, it's fine. Okay, 35. Okay, 36. Okay, 110. Okay.

737
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:51,040
They can tell this from my tone of voice how excited they should be. Oh my god.

738
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,720
No, this was a mistake. Becoming a crypto guy, big mistake. This is the last mistake I'll

739
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,680
ever make. This is it for me. I'm toast. I'm toast after this. There's no coming back from this,

740
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,800
not for me. I just don't have what it takes. I feel like funny mistakes are pretty good, actually.

741
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:17,200
Well, I hope you think it's funny. I hope you think it's funny when I'm in the poor house.

742
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:26,880
Like you're a hundred or two hundred dollars having lost. That's right.

743
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,280
And I can't afford the rich house that you have now. That's right. That's right. I'll have to go to,

744
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:43,760
I'll have to be a Bitcoin debt peonage. I'll have to, I don't know, hammer license plates or whatever

745
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,720
it is you do. I'll have to hammer license plates to put on Elon Musk's Teslas.

746
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,880
I thought you were about to say testicles. I don't know why.

747
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,560
That's right. That's right. No, that's what I was going to say, but I censored myself

748
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,360
because I knew that wouldn't play on YouTube. That would get us. That would get us. That would get

749
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:14,560
us demonetized. I ran out of gummy shit. I ran out of my good, I ran out of my good gummy shit.

750
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,280
Yeah. I was, I was off keto. I was doing sugar gummies, but now I'm back on keto.

751
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,560
So I need to use the gummy, the keto stuff, the isomaltoligosaccharide or the IMO.

752
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:35,440
And I just use the last of it and I don't have anymore and I'm sad because that's so,

753
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:42,480
that's stuff so good. The last batch I made with it came out so good. I made little watermelon,

754
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,760
like little half cubes. I didn't make worms. I made little cubes and they were perfect. It was

755
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:57,520
like the best ones I'd ever made. They were like chewy, sticky. They were, they tasted just right.

756
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,280
They had the perfect consistency and I can't do it again because I don't have the stuff anymore

757
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,040
because nobody, nobody sells it. No, no American company sells it and the Chinese

758
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,160
distributors will only sell it in like units of a metric ton and I'm not going to drop like

759
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,840
thousands of dollars on a metric ton of this fucking tapioca fiber.

760
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,800
So what is it? Is there a way to like science experiment your way to making it yourself?

761
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,720
Or is it like the raw materials themselves are still also too difficult to get?

762
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,360
I feel like it's probably extracted in some sort of chemical process that I would need like industrial

763
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:43,920
equipment to replicate. I would have to, I would have to like receive shipments of

764
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,240
whatever fucking Jerusalem artichokes or whatever and, and run them through some sort of like chemical

765
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:57,600
bath is probably in a series of chemical treatments in order to separate the fiber powder from the

766
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:04,640
fruit. So I don't think I can do that. But I can dream.

767
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:13,520
No, no. I've been watching a YouTuber called Niall Red who does chemistry videos. They seem like

768
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,320
they do a lot of fun things where they're like Niall Red Niall Red and I L E Red.

769
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,360
And it's just sort of like basic, not basic chemistry. It's quite

770
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,520
complex and they use a lot of know how. I know this. I know this guy. I saw a video.

771
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,440
I saw a video of him trying to take the caffeine out of Red Bull.

772
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,600
Yes, to make caffeine free Red Bull. He's made a lot of really interesting things where

773
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,280
honestly, my favorite part is just seeing the chemical processes he goes through

774
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,080
and him just dryly explaining that I did this and then I did that and then I waited until it was

775
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,640
the right temperature and then I took it up and I did this and I filtered it off and I did that

776
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,560
and now I have this and it's like, it's just going through the process in a very like non-charismatic

777
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,800
way, which is really, I don't know. I love, I love listening to him.

778
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:20,240
Non-charismatic. Yeah, I like. Charisma sucks. I love videos that suck. Charisma is just like,

779
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:28,400
hey guys, video and I'm like, shut up, shut up. Don't ever say that to me again.

780
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,480
You're all so smart and handsome and you're talking to me like and you're on stage or like,

781
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,680
shut up, just be boring and shitty. I like that more.

782
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,720
If you make me like you, it makes me hate you. It's true.

783
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,880
Yeah, I know. I agree. I unironically agree. I hate it. I hate it when,

784
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:02,320
I don't know, there's a, there's, I think there's a, there's a, an uncanny valley. There's a very

785
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:08,960
steep uncanny valley where someone can be almost, when someone can do something in an almost charismatic

786
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,600
way and maybe they get close, but there's something a little off and it just makes me hate them.

787
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,280
It makes me, it makes me distrustful. Like you're manipulating me. I hate you.

788
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,360
Yeah. It's sort of a very subtle way. Not like, oh, this guy's clearly fake. It's just sort of like,

789
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,200
like a very vague feeling that I can't really like accuse anyone of being anything in particular.

790
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,680
I just, I just, I like it when there's just a straightforward series of events explained

791
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:43,040
by a person. They don't need to be completely devoid of, of like comedy or, or heart.

792
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,160
I don't know. There's just, maybe it's just some sort of, some sort of something

793
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,240
that I dislike about like the biggest YouTubers. Like I can't imagine, I can't imagine like

794
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,480
having a conversation with Matt Pat. You know? Oh my God. Oh my God.

795
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,280
Not that I would really want to have a conversation with like a YouTuber, like ew,

796
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,320
ew, gross, but like, I don't know. That's not really the metric I was going for. I'm trying

797
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:18,000
to explain it, but I can't because I'm stupid. Anyway, Nalred's really good. He made a video

798
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,400
recently where he turned plastic gloves into grape soda flavoring and drank it.

799
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:33,840
Because there is a chemical in a specific kind of like surgical glove that is very

800
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:40,080
similar to the same chemical used to make grape soda flavoring. And so he chemically changed

801
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:48,880
the thing using acids and bases and all these sorts of processes. And it was like, I just,

802
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,360
I just love being along for the ride on those strange journeys. Like what if I could do this?

803
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:59,120
I tried it and here's what happened. And it worked. I'm looking at that video and watching

804
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:09,280
him just make like weird brown dirt looking powder out of stuff. Yeah. And it looks gross, but damn.

805
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,720
I wonder how it tastes. I guess it must taste all right. Is this, he goes into the hole like,

806
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,600
Is he a trans guy? Is he a trans guy? Not to my knowledge.

807
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,840
Okay. I mean, not to assume. He seems quite young. He looks like quite a young guy.

808
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:42,240
Like he's, I don't know, some sort of science prodigy or like was really good at it in high

809
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,480
school and then went straight into doing this sort of thing. He's been making videos for a long

810
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:53,280
time. Has he? He looks, I think he looks like he's not actually that young, but he has like

811
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:59,920
a youthful face for his age. Yeah, something like that. Because it surprised me. It surprised me

812
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,040
to see him like, I mean, even his voice is a little high pitch and I saw his face for the

813
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,360
first time once. I was like, that can't be the person who's making all these incredible science

814
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,240
videos. That doesn't make any sense. How could somebody so young this are good? He looks like an

815
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:21,200
idiot. No, no, I didn't mean that. But I did. Secretly.

816
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:33,040
Yeah. I've seen, I've seen a few of these. The caffeine one was the one I remember. I've probably

817
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:47,600
seen one or two of these. Man, I love YouTube. I love YouTube videos. Man, a new new summoning

818
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:55,760
salt new summoning salt came out this past week. Yeah, boy, just I just watched that. Oh,

819
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,360
his videos are great, but they just sort of, something about them is different from the

820
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,800
original few that he made, where they seem like extremely long and I get kind of tired.

821
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,800
There's a, there's a, there's a thing about the funniest thing in a summoning salt video is when

822
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:23,680
like, he'll, he'll get to a point where like, this guy had finally achieved the ultimate,

823
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:30,560
the ultimate run. He got all the good luck and he did all the good tech and everyone was blown away

824
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:38,400
and the record was, was, was set and it would stand for years, except no, because the very next day,

825
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,000
this fucking guy showed up and he'll introduce some new guy. He did it in this past one and he's

826
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,600
done it before and he'll show like the guys, whoever is being introduced, the guys like YouTube

827
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:56,000
Avatar and their, their screen name and it'll be like some guy and it'll be like so and so,

828
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:05,280
900 subscribers. It's like, I don't know. It's like, it's, it's, he's, he's describing them as

829
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,960
of if it's big fucking like heavyweight, they're like a celebrity that we should be like, oh,

830
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,400
shit, it's this guy, but it's like someone who you've never heard of and nobody's ever heard of them

831
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,240
and this is the only thing that you would ever know them for.

832
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:24,320
I mean, I think it's just because watching speedrunners is such a time-intensive thing,

833
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,200
keeping up with them. I think most people who watch speedrunners actively are speedrunners

834
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,600
themselves. So it's a very small community of like hardcore people and then us, like laymen

835
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:41,920
on the sidelines are just like, oh, what was that? More like laymen. It's just like, huh,

836
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,080
what's that going on there? Is that a record? Cool. They did it real quick, didn't they?

837
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,000
Wow. Video games. I like video games.

838
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,360
But I would, I would never like watch a speedrunner.

839
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,640
Oh, like watching over and over again. Yeah.

840
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,920
No, God, no. God, can you imagine?

841
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,040
You'd need to, I mean, at first you'd need to know the run that they're doing and why it's

842
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,080
difficult. I can't, I can't imagine getting into speedrunning without also

843
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,480
doing speedrunning. Do you know what I mean? Like watching it.

844
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:22,080
Yeah. The most, the most dedicated viewers are probably. Speaking of speedrunning,

845
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,360
I watched another video that I watched, I think this morning or last night or somewhere in between.

846
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:36,800
There's a guy called Carl Jobst and he released, he made a video asking about dream and whether

847
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,920
dream cheated or not. Do you know about this whole dream thing?

848
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,720
I think, I think I've seen the video you're talking about.

849
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:52,960
It was really good. And I, I, I, I've been one of these, I've been one of those people who is just

850
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:59,760
like sort of bewildered by this suddenly seeing everyone talking about this guy dream

851
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,400
all over Twitter and stuff. And I guess now I understand what it was. It's very frustrating

852
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,640
because after watching that video, I, I, I understand, I feel like I understand completely

853
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:18,080
what happened and why and how he cheated and why it seems like he definitely did cheat,

854
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:27,680
but I also completely understand how people could like fail to get how it was that he did

855
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,920
cheat and like how they know. I don't know, like he gives some examples, he shows examples on screen

856
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,240
of people saying like, uh, oh, but, or I don't know, because it, because it wasn't like he,

857
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,600
it wasn't one particular run of Minecraft that was cheated. It was like the game itself was

858
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,640
altered to give him better odds of getting a particular thing to happen. It was very sneaky,

859
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:57,200
very sneaky and you know, sort of impossible to prove unless they go to all the, they do all this

860
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,640
fucking, you know, running trillions and trillions of like statistical

861
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,720
models of it to like see if they can get luck like that and they can, it's, and it's impossible.

862
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,840
I don't know, it was pretty, pretty neat. I thought it was a neat thing that happened.

863
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,680
It is pretty like, like I could imagine he cheated based on the evidence that was provided,

864
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:27,520
but there's still wiggle room to say like, like, no, no, but like it's the fact that there's like,

865
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:36,000
it's not proven like concrete. There's wiggle, I feel like there's wiggle room for him

866
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,480
to be a weasel about it and be disingenuous about it in a way that people will believe because

867
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,680
they don't understand. Right. Because they haven't had it like explained numerically to them,

868
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,760
because what it really is is like a numbers question of like, are these numbers possible?

869
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,480
No. But if you like sort of divert from that question, you're like, oh, but the run itself

870
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,440
is totally possible. And it's like, yes, that's true, but that's not the point.

871
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,920
But you can, you can make it about that if you want to, which, you know, he has every reason to do.

872
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,440
Yeah. LaMau. So I don't know. Now I know. Now I know what the deal with that is.

873
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:20,160
I did see, I guess we're just talking about YouTube videos we've seen recently.

874
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,320
I guess so. I mean, what else do we fucking talk about?

875
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,000
Well, I could talk about have been depressed.

876
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,240
Lol. Did you see my Money Spenders podcast? You said you listened to it.

877
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:39,120
I did. I did listen to it. I did. You've been clean in that room for like a long time now.

878
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:45,840
Well, I mean, it's pretty clean now. But like, I feel like it's I feel like it's been months

879
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:51,200
that you've been saying like you were going to clean that room. You know, I mean, it was the

880
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,040
whole of December, basically. Like I said, I would do it. I said I would do it at the end of

881
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:03,120
November. And then it was, I don't know. Maybe maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm smoking crack. But I feel

882
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,440
like I feel like multiple times in like previous ones, you've mentioned that as a thing that you

883
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:16,000
were going to do. I don't know. I probably mentioned it multiple times as in I talked about it on

884
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
November's Money Spenders podcast and on the PCP maybe once or twice.

885
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:30,080
Maybe, maybe, maybe that could be it. In any event. Yeah, I've it's it's weird and annoying.

886
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:36,560
I seem to have like the big like, like everything sucks. And I'm the worst guy ever.

887
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:44,160
Time to die in the morning when I'm waking up. And then I'm like, oh, yeah, whatever. And I'm

888
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:52,080
okay. And I've been doing that. My mysterious construction has been underway. And then during

889
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:57,760
the end of the day, I'm like, Oh, but you know what? I really am the worst guy. And I should die.

890
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:02,160
And all that stuff. And I go to bed and wake up and it's fine in the middle of the day. And it's

891
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,680
like, well, I mean, I guess I guess I guess it's working. I guess something's working here.

892
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,280
I can't wait to tell my therapist will be useless about these things.

893
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,200
Is your therapist useless?

894
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:21,520
It's it's just early days right now. I've did they they asked me to like write down what I do

895
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,520
during the day. And then they'll start formulating a plan of like reform your thoughts and think

896
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:35,760
positively instead of negatively. It's the sort of stuff you hear and it's like, yeah,

897
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,880
that sounds easy. Just do something else. Just have a different thought instead of the one you're

898
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:48,640
having. I really wish there was like an obvious way to change it. But there isn't. You just need to

899
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,400
figure out how to trick yourself into thinking the other thing.

900
01:01:52,960 --> 01:02:01,680
Okay, hold that thought. 33, 3, 3, 7, 5, 4, 33, 7, 5, 4. We're getting there. We're going to make it.

901
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:11,200
Nice. Oh God, 33, 7, 5, 0, 4, 7, 34. No. Okay, I can't look. Keep going. Keep going.

902
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:22,640
Um, I don't know. There was this, this Wiser app, W-Y-S-A, which is supposed to be like

903
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:29,200
therapy, but like an AI. And I'm like, well, I guess I'll do fucking anything. I'll do the

904
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:36,160
the the cream therapy, but an AI. Does it like prompt you with questions to think about or something?

905
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,200
Or is it like a chat bot? Yeah, you chat to it and you say things and it's like,

906
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:47,280
how are you feeling? Oh, I see. Here's something that maybe like you could think about, maybe try

907
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,000
doing this. And here's some examples of thinking patterns that lead to depression. And it's like,

908
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,680
it's kind of helpful hearing it like written out based on what I'm telling it. It's not that

909
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:05,520
very good though, and it repeats itself a little. But I think just having that has been all right

910
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:12,080
the past few days. It sounds like something like that is good and that it can just like

911
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:18,480
prompt you to be thinking in the right way. And like, you don't need a person to

912
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:24,480
basically remind you the same, the same things over and over again, right? Yeah, a lot of the

913
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,640
difficulty is to keep your mind on the right mindset or whatever. Is when you slip back into

914
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:40,160
the bad mindset, it's difficult to use your compromised brain to do anything,

915
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:46,400
you know? Because it's already thinking in the wrong way. And you need someone to tell you,

916
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:54,480
actually, this is a logical fallacy and you need to think differently to maximize everything.

917
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:01,360
And the ways I'm thinking are like, oh, I see that is this sort of problem that I keep having.

918
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,120
I get it. Like having just knowledge of thinking patterns is useful.

919
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:11,680
I have the same, I find the same thing about like at night time, my mood often

920
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:20,960
markedly gets worse at night. And I feel the most depressed at those times. And I don't know,

921
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:30,160
my usual solution to that is, well, better get on a regular sleep schedule. So I'm going to sleep

922
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:41,280
before I start feeling like that. That is, that's what is helpful to me about that particular issue.

923
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,800
A lot of the things that are like the simple solutions to these problems, like get some

924
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:55,040
exercise, have a regular sleep schedule, change your place, change your environment regularly,

925
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:06,320
change your diaper, stinky. I mean, at the moment, it's, oh, shut up, don't say the word,

926
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:11,760
you can imply it, we can't say it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, YouTube, I'm sorry, don't demonetize us.

927
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:21,520
I'm already losing so much. Oh my god, 33, 6, 5, 0. Jesus Christ. I'm already lost everything,

928
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:30,000
YouTube, please don't take this from me. What was I saying? I don't know. Oh, the basic things like,

929
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,840
yeah, like get exercise, change in scenery, like environment, if you stay in the same room for

930
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:44,000
all day, every day, it makes you go insane, which is a problem right now because that's what they're

931
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:52,960
expecting people to do in the lockdown situation. And I'm like, gee whiz, gee willikers, I can't

932
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,680
really, I can't really solve that problem. So I got to escape into the VR world or fucking play

933
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:06,160
Minecraft or just think, just think about all the, I need a video game analysis video to say,

934
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,800
this is the most immersive game ever. And I'm like, I'll play, I'll buy it, I'll play it.

935
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:17,200
I want to be immersed, I want to pretend I'm somewhere else. Yeah. But yeah, all I can do

936
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:25,920
right now is exercise on like a bike, like a stationary bike. That's a pretty good one.

937
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:32,000
I'm lucky I have that. That is pretty good. If I had a stationary bike, I might use it.

938
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,760
Or a running machine. Those are all right as well.

939
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,920
You mean a treadmill?

940
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,120
Treadmill, yes.

941
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,560
A running machine is like those robots that they make.

942
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,400
You know, the ones that are going to be killing us soon. The Boston Dynamics ones.

943
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,000
They're right in my backyard. They're right in my backyard, kid. They're coming for me.

944
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,880
Could you send a little drone over to take a sneak peek?

945
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:05,120
I can't, I'm afraid that I can't tell them what to do. Nobody can anymore.

946
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:12,240
I saw that they were doing like, oh, the Boston Dynamics robots are doing a little dance now.

947
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,960
They've learned how to dance. And it's like making them, making them appeal to the human brain as

948
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,640
like not a danger, not a threat. And then they don't fall for it. It's the same. It's literally

949
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,800
the same as the Pete Buttigieg Jants. He's trying to convince you that he's a real human being,

950
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,280
and you shouldn't be afraid of him. Don't fall for it.

951
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,000
And, you know, the spot or dog, whatever the Boston Dynamics dog is,

952
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,720
he's got like the little crane head with the clamp. And he's like coming in and then he just,

953
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,720
oh, he pulls out a Glock and he's just such fucking going to town.

954
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,320
He loves it. He loves it.

955
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:57,360
You know, all we need to do is to develop guns that robots can't use with their

956
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:05,040
mitten hands, and we'll be all right. We've got a developed weaponry that can only be activated by

957
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,120
sincere creativity, and we're just like, artists will be the most powerful people.

958
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,960
No, you just, you have to, no, wait, it's literally endless war. You have to enter a

959
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:21,120
capture every time you fucking fire a gun is literally that we fucking pioneered it.

960
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,600
Ah, you have to solve it. It's on the side of the gun as a little touchscreen.

961
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,800
You have to solve the capture before it can fire. Robots can't use it. Robots neutralized.

962
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,840
Dude, robot uprisings is going to be so fun when we have to, we get to shoot people and we don't

963
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,640
have to feel bad about it. Oh, because they're robots? Yeah.

964
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:50,960
There's a, there was like a, there's a VR game. There's a VR is an Oculus game that I think is

965
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:58,000
about shooting robots that seemed like was very well reviewed. And I think I at some point planned

966
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:05,120
to get it, but I didn't. And I don't remember what it was called anymore. And I, you know,

967
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,360
and I have a problem where I feel like my Oculus Rift went heavily underutilized because the only

968
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:17,520
thing I ever used it for was super hot and a little bit of Beat Saber that one time, not Beat

969
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,000
Saber, whatever the VR one is where you slice the cubes. Yeah, that's Beat Saber. Oh, okay. Yeah,

970
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:31,680
Beat Saber. Dur, didn't get, I feel like I didn't get my money's worth out of that freaking thing.

971
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,920
And it's such a fucking hassle to set up. It wasn't your money though. It was the

972
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:44,720
vaporous Kickstarter money. Oh yeah, I guess that's true. You gotta give the people what they want.

973
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:50,560
I never set up, back when I used to stream, I used to, I said that I was going to set up like

974
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:57,280
VR chat. That I was gonna do like VR chat. Or I said I was thinking about doing it, but I wanted

975
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:04,400
to have it like, I wanted to set it up so that I could see the Twitch chat on like in the headset,

976
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,880
like displayed in front of me so I could read what people were saying while I was VR chatting.

977
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,560
And that seemed like so, I tried to do it and I, I couldn't figure it out. One guy,

978
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,480
one guy like kept messaging me like, reminded me like, here, this is how you do it. Here's

979
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,760
some software that lets you how to do it. And I kept saying like, okay, I'll check it out,

980
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,760
I'll check it out. I never did it. I never checked it out. I let everyone down. I failed.

981
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:35,440
What you eating? I'm eating beef bourguignon.

982
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:44,720
What? You made that up. Beef bourguignon. Beef, that's not real. Beef bourguignon and rice.

983
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:51,120
You're a fucking liar. Google it, if you can. How do you, I can't, that's not a real word.

984
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:57,280
Beef bourguignon. It's French. Burger. Oh God, it's, oh God, it's real.

985
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,000
Burger. It's basically, it's, it's basically just like a stew. It's just beef. It is. It's a beef

986
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:13,360
and onion stew, but it's very nice. Sure. Whatever. Whatever. Let me, let me complain. Let me complain

987
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:20,880
about something. I'm actually very upset about this. I said before that fat Ben is back, right?

988
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,280
And then I found this out right before I went to go see my parents for the holidays

989
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,600
because I weighed myself. Now, when I weighed myself, I was like, oh wow, I'm almost back up to

990
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:40,160
like the weight that I was in my heaviest, right? At my heaviest before, like around at radcon four,

991
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:46,400
no, sorry, radcon three, I was, I was about 195. I was almost 200 pounds.

992
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:55,200
This time, I weighed myself and I was about the same. I was like 190 something and I was like,

993
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:01,600
oh shit, damn. Good thing I didn't hit 200 though. Time to clean up my act, right? So,

994
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:07,520
I'm like, okay, I'm not, I, I'm glad I caught myself before I could hit 200. So, you know,

995
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,320
I go back on strict keto. I go back on very strict keto. I start eating cauliflower. I'm,

996
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:18,720
I'm, I'm eating chicken. I'm eating, I'm eating, you know, I'm cutting back on all the stuff.

997
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,240
I'm going back to strict keto diet. Well, I weighed myself yesterday and I fucking gained

998
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:32,720
like eight pounds and I'm like 200 and something now and I'm so angry. I'm so angry to report that

999
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:37,760
because I've been keto for like a week now. And usually when you start keto, you shed a bunch

1000
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:44,000
of weight at the beginning because your fucking glycogen depletes. What the fuck happened? I don't

1001
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,200
understand. I don't understand and I'm fucking mad about it. And I'm taking it out on you.

1002
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:56,000
Fuck you. Okay. I don't really feel like I've been attacked, but good job. Well, darn.

1003
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:05,840
I fucked it up then. Feel sorry for me right now. Okay. There, there.

1004
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Okay. Don't fucking go overboard. That's enough. Stop.

1005
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,880
I'm upset. I'm upset, but it's okay. Just gotta, just gotta stick to the plan.

1006
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:27,440
Just gotta trust the plan where we go one, we go all. Follow, follow, follow. Q is the thing.

1007
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:33,440
That's what I was missing there. It was a joke. Do you think it might be fate to be fat, Ben?

1008
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,560
Because it's like similar to letters to fate and fate.

1009
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,080
Horrible. Yeah, you know, that actually makes a lot of sense.

1010
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:49,520
Fate, Ben. I think that this is just destiny. It doesn't even have anything to do with my diet.

1011
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,160
It's just destiny. Just how fat, how, how, what weight do the stars want me to be?

1012
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,520
You get 3,000 pounds.

1013
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:06,160
Wait, hold on. Eleazar, cut this part. I gotta mute. I gotta, I gotta be back. I'll be back.

1014
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,600
Okay, I'm back. Hey, what's up? Hey, what are we talking about? Hey, what did I miss?

1015
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:17,200
You missed the Gib song. The Gib is a lone song. That's part of the bonus episode.

1016
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:24,560
Oh, yeah. Boy, I should head over to patreon.com slash the procrastinators

1017
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:31,760
for an only $5. Make it possible to in the future hear that in the, in the,

1018
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,520
in the, the, the outtakes bonus content episode that will exist one day, I'm sure.

1019
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,360
We surely, surely we must be getting close. Surely we must be approaching the point where

1020
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:49,280
we have enough to make that. And when we do all this foreshadowing will, will pay off in splendid

1021
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:56,880
fashion. People can try to piece together what, what clips each episode is from. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,

1022
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:04,400
yeah. Ooh, it's a puzzle and a podcast. You have to work for your entertainment.

1023
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,720
That's, I mean, isn't that, isn't that the best kind though? Isn't that when you feel

1024
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,920
the strongest connection to a work? Yeah, I suppose. When it demands something from you.

1025
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,520
Yeah, you know, if you, if you just listen to a podcast and you didn't, you don't like put

1026
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:28,480
it the work in, you know, you didn't, what was the copypasta? Like you didn't improve,

1027
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,960
you didn't learn nothing. Oh, you cheated not only the game, but yourself. But yourself, yeah.

1028
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,400
Hell yeah. Hell yeah. You cheated not only the podcast, but yourself.

1029
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:52,400
Oh no. We're stalled out. We're stalled out at 33, 5, 7, 35, 83, 35, 99, 5, 99. Can I get 600? No.

1030
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:59,920
Oh, there it is. 613, 613. 610. Holy shit. It's too much. Best update quite quickly.

1031
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:06,160
Yeah, like every few seconds it does. Maybe it's just your heart rate that you're looking at going

1032
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:14,480
up and down. If that were true, then whenever I looked at it, it would skyrocket. Earlier today,

1033
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:21,440
I opened up the thing with the ticker on it and I looked at it and there's a glance at it and I

1034
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,800
saw like, okay, it's been holding pretty stable. But as soon as I looked at it, it just plummeted.

1035
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:32,720
It just like went through the floor. I was like, no, I have to not look. I can't look at it.

1036
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:37,440
And I looked away and I closed the window and it worked because now it's going to the moon.

1037
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:43,360
Wait, wait, wait. I got to update you. I got to give you live updates. I know you crave them.

1038
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:54,720
Here's where we're at now. As you see, it's progressed. Oh, so yeah. It's been wibbly wobbling

1039
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:00,240
around that same bit, but it's still pretty high up there. It's just kind of been chilling.

1040
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:07,920
Just kind of been chilling. Well, wait, wait, I'll show you where it started for me.

1041
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:18,080
This is for context. For context. For context there. That was where it was when I bought it.

1042
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:24,480
So as you see, it was a harrowing day of it just tanking. And then just when we started the recording

1043
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,280
this, it was like, oh, maybe things aren't so bad. Oh, wow. You bought it pretty high up.

1044
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,560
Yeah. That was the second time you bought. That was the second time I bought it. And it was a

1045
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:44,800
mistake. No, no, no. It seems pretty stupid. But then like, I mean, this is, let me show you the

1046
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:54,320
last day or two, or this is the last week or so. And you will see that it's even worse

1047
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:04,720
it's even more foolish than it appears at first glance around here is where it is on screen

1048
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:13,760
in the grand scheme of things. Oh, so, so, you know, obviously that's that's the time to buy.

1049
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:22,800
What if that's the like peak for like next whole year? It might it literally could be.

1050
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:28,560
It literally could be that like, that Bitcoin will never ever be this high again. And this was

1051
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:35,040
the highest it will ever go in the history of the universe. That's funny. It's been,

1052
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:42,240
it's been, I mean, okay, just for just for one more, just for one more piece of context, what is

1053
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:49,440
the what is the here's here's the entire history. Here's the entire history of Bitcoin.

1054
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:55,600
And it shows like where we're at now relative to where it started. And

1055
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,000
you know, so we're up there, we're up there on fucking mounts, mounts, whatever.

1056
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:13,280
2011, I think it started and then 2018 or 2017. Big boy. Now, yeah, wow, twice almost

1057
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:21,440
like, like 2020 end of 2017 beginning of 2018 was when it was like, because you know,

1058
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:26,480
over on the left there, it's worth like fucking a couple dollars. And then it explodes up to like

1059
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:32,080
almost 20k. And that's when like fucking freaks like Elon Musk all made like a shit ton of money

1060
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:39,760
selling at the at the peak or whatever. Yeah. And then it kind of went down. And then,

1061
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:46,800
in the ensuing years, I remember I'm thinking like, dang, you know, that was the time that was

1062
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:52,400
that if I was ever, if Bitcoin was ever going to make, you know, fortunes, it would have been then,

1063
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:59,680
you know, surely it's not going to happen again. Well, here we are. Oh, well, I mean, yeah,

1064
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:03,600
what are you gonna do? It's not really going to make fortunes from from because it didn't

1065
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:08,160
start so low, you couldn't have bought it. Yeah. And then it increased. It's not it's not such a

1066
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,760
dramatic. Yeah, you're not going to go from owning like a few hundred dollars to owning like

1067
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,360
hundreds of thousands of dollars, or millions or whatever. You're gonna, you're gonna go from

1068
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:25,040
you're gonna go from having a few million in Bitcoin to having like a few tens of million in

1069
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:31,600
Bitcoin. If you have a single Bitcoin, I mean, it is a big increase. That's that's an interesting

1070
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:37,520
graph. I like looking at graphs. Pretty cool, right? Numbers, they really, they really make you

1071
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,640
think really make you really get the get the the juices flowing.

1072
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:52,400
All right. Oh, I love bogging down the podcast with Bitcoin talk. This is my new thing. This is

1073
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:58,640
the new arc. This is the start of the Bitcoin. This is the Bitcoin podcast now. Oh, no, do I have

1074
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:04,960
to learn about something? No, well, yes, but the person who doesn't know about Bitcoin. Yeah,

1075
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:11,120
you can explain things to you can be the guy who's always like, but Ben, what does that mean?

1076
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,040
And I'll you're like the audience surrogate who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.

1077
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:21,360
And I could be like, aha, you fool, you rube. Well, I'll explain it to you. So yeah, and then

1078
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:27,200
and then you'll make a fool of yourself. The chat will the chat will like correct you over and over

1079
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,720
again. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It'll be like a comedy routine where you're like the straight man

1080
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:40,160
audience surrogate and I'm like the the pompous dullard who thinks he knows and and that's where

1081
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:48,000
in the comedy emanates when that's whence the comedy emanates. I believe that's how comedy works.

1082
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:57,440
You know, I've ever since ever since I became the trans as they say, um, Lamel, all these like

1083
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:03,440
terms that are like male gendered that I used to think, oh, you know, they're like

1084
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:11,280
gender neutral, like layman and straight man. And it's like, it feels different now thinking

1085
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,680
about it. Like, I don't want to change the word because that sounds weird, because I know it as

1086
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:24,640
straight man. Straight man. Straight man. I like that. Straight man. I like that a lot. It's the

1087
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:30,960
first thing I think of like replacing man with man, but it's kind of hard to notice. So I don't know.

1088
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,840
When I when I posted that picture from the Radcon calendar, uh, uh, suggesting that Tom would be

1089
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:44,160
the next to transition, I thought it was really funny when people said people suggested like

1090
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:52,000
can't wait for Tom Tom boy Oliver. And I thought that was really funny. Because like a Tom a Tom

1091
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,560
boy is a girl. So to make Tom into a girl, you make his name boy. I don't, I don't know.

1092
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:07,200
Hilarious. It was hilarious. I loved when I saw comedy, comedy genius. And then in that lineup,

1093
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:14,160
Munchie would be next. So, uh, no, no, Nate, Nate after Tom. Oh, oh yeah, Nate. Nate than Munchie,

1094
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:18,560
then you. Then me. Wait, are we missing someone? No.

1095
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,760
It's only the, it's only the, it's only the, um, oh yeah. Yeah, you're right. Five of us, six of us.

1096
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,680
Only the five of us. Man, I look so fucking good with my goth makeup and my, uh, and my wig.

1097
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:40,000
That wig was sick. Lending me that wig, lending me that wig was the only good thing May ever did

1098
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,040
in her entire life.

1099
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:50,720
Lama. Uh, uh, good times. Good times at Radcom for, um,

1100
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,200
Oh, I've got a, I've got a cool new thing to, to announce. So it's not really an announcement,

1101
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:03,600
but I'll be the judge of that. I never knew. Because I didn't know what Webkin's was. I didn't

1102
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:09,920
know the hypocrite, the hippo, the plush was a Webkin. I still don't know what Webkin's are.

1103
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,960
I know that they are, it's like, you know, beanie babies from, from the time of when that was the

1104
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:23,280
thing, it feels a little bit similar to that where they're like collectible animals of some

1105
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:30,400
brand. Uh, okay. So it's, it's a specific, it's a specific like company. It's a specific line of

1106
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:36,080
plushes. Yeah. Well, yeah. They have like different, different, I don't know, seasons of

1107
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:41,280
plushes. Like not all the plushes look exactly the same style. The one I had was like sort of

1108
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,440
anatomically correct hippo as opposed to a cartoon hippo, which is the other things that

1109
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:52,400
Yeah, hippo does not look like he's part of like a, a line. He just looks like a hippo.

1110
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,880
Yeah. He, he look, he's like a National Geographic Webkin's crossover. I guess, I don't know.

1111
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:05,440
Um, but Webkin's is a digital video game sort of like Club Penguin, MMO, uh,

1112
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:13,360
early internet stuff where you get your pet and you, you have them, you have them digitally and you

1113
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:19,520
can have, they have a room, they have a house they had, they can play mini-game, you play mini-games

1114
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:26,560
to get coins that you can spend on furniture and outfits. And it's, it's Club Penguin, but with

1115
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:34,560
plushes that you buy. So is it like Club Penguin, but with like a Skylanders sort of element wherein

1116
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,400
you buy like a physical toy and then you scan it into the game?

1117
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:50,640
Um, I suppose, I think you can get like, like pets in the, the, the, the website Webkin's.

1118
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,200
I only played it for a long time. I thought, I thought that's what you did. I, I thought you

1119
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:59,120
like scanned hippo in and yeah, yeah, I scanned, I scanned hippo in and I scanned hippo in and hippo

1120
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:04,800
now exists digitally on my account. Um, I never played this when I was young. So I, I had like

1121
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:11,120
Kazi tell me all about it and, and I played like a bunch of their funny flash game things they have.

1122
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,880
Uh, Rest in Peace flash, by the way, that's gone. It's all dead.

1123
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:24,560
Oh yeah, that just died. I haven't checked, I, I haven't felt the need to check to see if things

1124
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:32,320
are dead, but I had to check because in, in, in the, the patron Q&A for, uh, I, I brought up, um,

1125
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:38,640
CCC city, you know what that is. I've, I've talked about that, right? Uh, is that Sonichu?

1126
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:47,280
No, what is that? No, it's not quick bill. Oh, no, it's the opposite of quick bill. No, CCC city,

1127
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:55,360
CCC city is a bit like a, like a, a flash. I think they were originally in flash video

1128
01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:01,040
animation series by this guy called Vinnie Veritas on Newgrounds and I used to really like them.

1129
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,080
I remember you saying those names. I, I forget what it's about.

1130
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:10,080
It's not really about anything. It's just like animations that take place in this

1131
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:18,080
like sort of fantasy urban location called CCC city. Um, and, uh, uh, anyway, I went to Newgrounds

1132
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:24,400
to see if they had survived the death of flash and yes, they did. Um, they're just, they're just

1133
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:33,120
uploaded as videos now. I guess they've been converted somehow, which is nice. Uh, I, I wonder if

1134
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:40,560
everything is, I wonder if like, I mean videos are just worse than the way because they weren't

1135
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:45,520
designed like on all the flash games, of course, I don't know what they're going to do. Maybe there's,

1136
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:51,520
I've, I've seen HTML games. Maybe they've been transformed into that some people, but they would

1137
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:56,480
have been, they would have had to like actively like the owners of those games would have had to

1138
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:01,120
actively preserve them. Anything that was just left on, I think doesn't work anymore.

1139
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:07,360
And that sucks. But I'm on, I guess that, I guess that might be like, this must, this must not have been,

1140
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,440
huh? This must not have been flash. I'm on the Newgrounds page for triacnid and it still works. So

1141
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:19,920
that must not have been flash, I guess. Wow. I mean, I know nothing really about it. I just

1142
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,920
have heard that flash is dying and everything will be gone. I'm like, Oh, that's sad.

1143
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:30,080
Wow, that's sad. Yeesh. I didn't really do anything about it.

1144
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:39,280
I know that there were, I mean, I know there were efforts to preserve stuff. And I,

1145
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:46,160
I don't know, I, it'll be, it'll be sad. It'll be sad when I start hearing about specific things

1146
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:51,760
that were lost. It's like, Oh, this doesn't exist anymore because flash is dead. I mean,

1147
01:28:51,760 --> 01:29:00,720
even if flash is dead, one could hypothetically still like get, download something and then like

1148
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:06,640
run flash locally on their computer and like convert it like that. Like, like just because

1149
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:10,480
flash is dead doesn't mean that things that were in flash can no longer be converted to.

1150
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:17,360
Yeah, I feel like it's possible to, to, it's just all of the things that are not easy to get a hold

1151
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:24,000
of or are like abandoned. They will, you can't just, I don't know, you'd have to put in the effort

1152
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:32,640
to make it work again. And if it was, I mean, I don't know what Club Penguin rewritten was like

1153
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,080
when Disney destroyed Club Penguin because they're evil bastards and I can't ever forgive them.

1154
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,240
Wait, who did? Who killed it? Disney. They bought Club Penguin quite early on,

1155
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:50,080
I think. And, and it was a Disney property for a while, but then they deleted it. They got rid of

1156
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:56,240
it so that they could push their new Club Penguin mobile app game, which was a 3D version of Club

1157
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:02,400
Penguin on mobile. And it was fucking terrible. It was filled with micro transactions and bullshit.

1158
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:09,120
Nobody played it. So they realized there was a failed investment and they canceled the new thing.

1159
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:14,880
So now Club Penguin doesn't exist, except in this illegal version of Club Penguin that fans

1160
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:22,960
recreated. And I assume that still uses Flash, so maybe that is in trouble. They probably figured

1161
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:29,520
it out there. That's just like, that's just like when Cuomo said that you'll get a million dollar

1162
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:36,400
fine if you vaccinate anyone who's not, who's not supposed to get vaccinated. It's the same.

1163
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:42,560
Capitalism. What? Capitalism ruins everything. Vaccinations, Club Penguin, it's all part of the

1164
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:50,160
system. That was the thing, I guess. I don't follow. Quick. You know, you know, because, because,

1165
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,960
I don't know, the Disney bought it and they had it and they were like, oh, we can't make money off

1166
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:01,280
it. So we'll throw it in the trash. Nobody gets it. And Cuomo, Cuomo is like, nah, nah, only the

1167
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:06,080
fucking, only the fucking, the essential people get the, get the, get the vaccine.

1168
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,720
Get the Club Penguin. Anyone that doesn't get, anyone that doesn't get vaccinated,

1169
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,640
no, you can't use it on someone else. Throw it in the trash. If it doesn't, you can't,

1170
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:17,680
you can't, you can't find the priority guidelines. Oh, I didn't know about that. That's stupid.

1171
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:21,840
That's what I'm hearing. That's what I'm hearing is that these, it's like, you're not allowed to use

1172
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:27,600
it except on people who are, who are set for it. And like, apparently this is going to cause some

1173
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:36,320
sort of, some sort of supply glut, which might lead to doses of the vaccine just getting discarded

1174
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,440
in trash because they expire after a while. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.

1175
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:49,680
This is what seems, this is what seems to be what is potentially the result of this new order

1176
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:54,640
of Cuomos to not vaccinate. They'll be, they'll get fucking, you'll get fucking murdered. You need

1177
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:59,520
to lose all your fucking practicing licenses if you do, if you fuck around, if you fuck around

1178
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:07,040
with this and vaccinate anyone who's not supposed to get it. Capitalism. Stupid. The primary goal

1179
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,320
should be very clear. Vaccinate as many people as possible. Prioritize the people who need it most.

1180
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:19,200
If you have it lying around, give it to people. That's so simple. Fuck, like, yeah, like literally,

1181
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:25,760
like, if you, if you've got them, literally just give them to fucking anyone. And it's, it's, yeah.

1182
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:34,480
I mean, for sure, I agree. I mean, I'm sure. Did they do it? So, so that the people who, like,

1183
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:39,040
I don't know, they don't trust the doctors to not use it on themselves and to their families first,

1184
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:44,720
they, like, you have to do it on these specific people, otherwise we'll kill you. Yeah. Because

1185
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:50,480
we don't trust you to use it responsibly otherwise. I think that's the idea, yeah.

1186
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:57,600
But, you know, if, if, if doses get, get discarded because of that, like, fuck that.

1187
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:05,120
Yeah. Fuck that. It's much worse. Yeah. Pretty cringe, pretty cringe. But anyway,

1188
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,520
I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about Club Penguin. I want to hear more about

1189
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:17,200
that and Webkin. Dude, Club Penguin's so fucking good. You get your penguin and you club them

1190
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:24,640
over the head. I always wanted, I always wanted to play Ragnarok online. Do you ever,

1191
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:30,640
you ever play that? You ever see that? I feel like I saw a review of Ragnarok online.

1192
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:39,360
Ragnarok online looked like, I don't even, I never even saw anyone play it. I

1193
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,920
literally just saw, like, the sprites from it and I saw some screenshots from it and I just

1194
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:50,000
really, really wanted to play it. But, like, I couldn't and I, I don't know why. Like, I tried

1195
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,920
to sign up online and they couldn't, maybe my internet wasn't good enough or I didn't have this,

1196
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:59,360
the specs for it or something. And I don't even know what it was. I just remember a burning desire

1197
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:06,160
in my young child heart to play Ragnarok online because it had cool looking anime,

1198
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:12,160
it had, like, Gaia online sprites but, like, less stupid looking and I think you could, like,

1199
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:20,960
fight monsters. It's on Steam. I guess you can play it. Is it? Wait, wait. I just googled it and

1200
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:27,440
it looks like it's on Steam. Oh, wait. Oh. No. At the request of the publisher, Ragnarok online

1201
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:36,640
is no longer available for sale on Steam. What? Did they turn off the servers or something?

1202
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:44,480
I see an article that says Ragnarok online goes free to play. Okay, well, there's a Ragnarok

1203
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:52,880
online mobile that I think is a remake or something. It might be a new thing. I don't

1204
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:58,560
know when this is from. This could be years old for all I know. This is from October 17th, 2019.

1205
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,080
Okay, a new Android version of the well-known MMORPG for PC is coming West this year after

1206
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:09,600
experiencing enormous success in Asian countries. Okay, so they're remaking it basically and that's

1207
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:16,960
probably why they took it off Steam, the old version. I mean, I'm sure it was crap. I'm sure

1208
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:22,960
it was dog shit fucking grindfest Korean bullshit. Just like, uh, just like, uh, what's the other one?

1209
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:28,000
Everything. MapleStory. You ever play MapleStory? Is that the side-scrolling one?

1210
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:36,240
Yeah. Yeah, it reminds me of when I did the 24-hour stream and I played MapleStory for like half of it.

1211
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:42,240
I remember a bit of it. That was so cool. This game sucks so fucking bad. MapleStory is like,

1212
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:48,000
it's like, oh, what was that game we played for RFCK? Oh, uh, yeah, I know. It's, um,

1213
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,920
and it's the one by the, by the, the, the Diary of a Wimpy Kid guy.

1214
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:58,720
Oh, was it from that guy? PopTropica? Yeah, literally the guy who made Diary of a Wimpy Kid

1215
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:06,160
also made PopTropica. That's really funny. It's so fucking weird. I love shitty games. They're so great.

1216
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:11,600
I had never heard of PopTropica before Munchie told me about it, but when I played it,

1217
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:18,240
I was just like, oh my God, this is literally just MapleStory, but without like cool anime combat.

1218
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:26,640
It's the same fucking game. Or, or I guess a, a, a MapleStory is just PopTropica, but with anime.

1219
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:32,640
But I'm pretty sure MapleStory came first. So I think it's really around. I mean, I was playing,

1220
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:41,040
I played MapleStory in my freshman year of college, which was 2000 and wait, MapleStory is 2003?

1221
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,000
Yeah. Well, I'm just looking at Google that says that.

1222
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:51,760
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. How old was I in 2003? Like 15?

1223
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:58,880
Like 58? Like, like, uh, like 80? Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's over. It's over for me.

1224
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,440
Wait, um, PopTropica come out.

1225
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:10,800
I don't know. It was, it was very surreal, very surreal experience. Uh, uh, I don't know.

1226
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:19,680
Is initial release date September 2007. Oh yeah. Yeah. Developer, the Jeff Kinney group.

1227
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:24,240
Jeff Kinney is the, um, that fucking guy. Wimpy Kid guy.

1228
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:30,640
Meh. When you're, when you're a fucking rich, powerful dude, you literally just make everything.

1229
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:40,640
Uh, you literally just, just, just bend culture to your will. Diary of a, of a, of a, of a oligarch.

1230
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,080
More like diarrhea of a Wimpy Kid.

1231
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:52,080
Is they made, they, anyone made that joke before? Diary, uh, of a Simpy Kid.

1232
01:37:52,080 --> 01:38:03,280
Diarrhea. Um, no, no. I'm sorry, but no. Uh, what were we, what were we fucking talking about?

1233
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:08,960
I don't know. Old games. Club Penguin. Old, old games. Flash dead. Flash dead, gone.

1234
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,680
Flash dead, uh, uh, Hippo, Webkinz.

1235
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,920
I didn't really have anything else to say on the Webkinz front. It was just like,

1236
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:23,920
I'd never played Webkinz before and now Hippo exists digitally. And if anyone likes Webkinz,

1237
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:31,760
that's cool. I, I ran around for a bit and I, uh, I, I gave her like some funny shoes.

1238
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,560
I, I went to the school and during recess, I dug in the sandpit and I found a full like

1239
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:44,000
football outfit and I put that on. Can I visit Hippo online? Uh, can you give me a URL

1240
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:50,400
to go to her house? I think it's possible. And vandalize it. We could do like a thing

1241
01:38:51,040 --> 01:39:02,800
where Ben St. comes to Hippo Critt's house. Agreed. Uh, I'm ready. I'm ready when you are.

1242
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:08,160
Just give me a time. Just give me time and place. You can have a, we can have a socially

1243
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:14,640
distanced date. Socially. Oh yeah, me and Kazi were on there, right? Kazi has like a

1244
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:19,520
horse that looks just like a little bit and I- What on Webkinz? On Webkinz. She, she was a big-

1245
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:25,200
Is little bit, is little bit a Webkinz? No, but she has something that looks just like him.

1246
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:32,160
Just a generic horse thing. And it's not called little bit. So it's from before. She played Webkinz

1247
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:38,720
a lot. And we were, we were going around trying to harass some of the weird, some of the kids,

1248
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,760
some of the youngsters, would basically be- So the children. Basically-

1249
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,880
Okay, so you and Kazi were going around harassing children. Okay, got it.

1250
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,160
But nobody paid attention because I think they were just min-maxing playing the game.

1251
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:53,680
They were going into this one room. Min-maxing. They were gooning out.

1252
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:58,960
Yeah, literally gooning, like goon central over here. They, they just walked into this room

1253
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:03,200
and they clicked on a thing and then they disappeared. And we clicked on it and it was like,

1254
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:08,800
every day you can come back here and get a thing. So we figured that these players were like,

1255
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:14,720
like non-socially playing Webkinz to maximize and get all of the stuff every day that they can.

1256
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:19,360
Doing their daily quests. And it was really funny because these little funny animals,

1257
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:23,920
they'd moving across the screen and me and Kazi, because you can't like type in Webkinz.

1258
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:29,200
You can only say stock phrases. And we just, we just surrounded them when we could and we just

1259
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:39,280
said, I feel bad. Wait, really? Oh god. You can say like, you can say I feel good and then people

1260
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:45,280
can respond in kind by clicking on your like speech bubble. And so we were just being like,

1261
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:51,120
I feel mad. I feel mad surrounding them. And it was very strange, but I don't think any of them

1262
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:58,000
paid attention. It was just really funny for a while. So Webkin bandits. If you want to join

1263
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:04,880
my gang, you should, you should have streamed that honestly. That sounds like some performance

1264
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:14,160
art. Shit. I could stream it. It could happen again. Arrasing kids in Webkinz. Damn, we're just,

1265
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:20,080
they're just trying to do their dailies, bro. It's so funny when we realize that. Like, why?

1266
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:24,880
I mean, I guess any game can be min-max and gooned, but it's just funny. Because it's,

1267
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,000
I mean, they're so, they're so cute. What do you do dailies for? Like,

1268
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,040
to buy like clothes or something? Or like furniture for a house? You get money and you

1269
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:42,160
can buy furniture and clothing and different houses and special, I don't know, access to mini

1270
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:49,120
games or membership or whatever. Do you think, do you think it's actually kids? I would imagine

1271
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:55,840
that it's people who play it as kids who just still play it. Because nostalgia. I don't know how

1272
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,080
big Webkinz is though. It could still be like, there weren't that many people around. There's like

1273
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:09,760
one or two. So I don't know. No idea. Something, I don't know, something about, something about

1274
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:16,640
that makes me really sad. I don't know whether it's sadder in my mind to imagine a child doing that

1275
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:22,000
or an adult doing it out of nostalgia. They both kind of bug me and get under my skin in different

1276
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,120
ways. And I don't like thinking about either one. I think it- It- Perfectly honest. It makes me feel

1277
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,520
a little sad, the idea that they're, they're playing it alone, presumably and min-maxing by

1278
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:38,400
themselves. Because like the whole point of those things is like, you have your cute little animal,

1279
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:43,440
you dress them up, and then you show off like, look what, look what I have. I got shiny shoes,

1280
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:49,760
ha-ha. And it's like, if there's no one around, like that was what depressed me about playing

1281
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:55,520
War the Warcraft back when I was doing that. I was like, man, I feel compelled to do all

1282
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,760
these quests and get all these numbers go up. But at the end of the day, all these incredible

1283
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:06,880
achievements I have and all this cool gear and mounts and titles, nobody is paying attention

1284
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:12,720
to anyone. They're all just focused on themselves and the community's soul is completely gone.

1285
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,000
Sucks. Yeah. Yeah.

1286
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:23,120
Feels like living in the city where everyone's walking past each other. You can't even stop

1287
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:27,200
and say, hello, how are you doing? You always got somewhere to be. You can.

1288
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,160
You can. You can stop and say, hello, how are you doing? But then they say, get the fuck away

1289
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:36,160
from me, freak. And then they throw you to the ground. They say, they say, they say, get on the

1290
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:47,600
ground. Get on the ground so you're easier to hit. Yeah. Bummer. Sad but true.

1291
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:59,840
I don't know. Video games, man. Video games. Yes, that is such a thing as that.

1292
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:08,400
I got a really strange game this week. I just bought it on a whim because it looked interesting.

1293
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:15,760
But let me tell you about it. It's called Neute, N-O-I-T-A. Oh, yeah. Do you know it?

1294
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:22,080
I know it's based on a specific German 985 stream moment that is quite infamous, but yeah, keep going.

1295
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:28,720
Oh, really? Okay. Because I've never heard of it. It's not related to the game that moment. It's just

1296
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:36,000
a really funny German moment. Wait, what is it? I'm curious. Well, he was playing the game and he

1297
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:44,240
started betting with his audience about community subs where you give subs to whoever's in chat and

1298
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:50,400
it just randomly distributes them. So he gives subscriptions. He was betting with this chat

1299
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:57,920
that he could do certain things in the game, hitting an enemy or not dying in this next room.

1300
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:03,600
And if I do it or if I don't do it, I'll give 15 community subs. And then he did it and he was

1301
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:08,480
like, haha. And then chat was like, double or nothing, double or nothing. And then the bets

1302
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:16,960
kept getting higher until he was like, all right, if I don't want, if I don't, if I miss the next

1303
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:25,920
shot out of this gun, then I have to give like 500,000 community subs. It was getting ridiculous.

1304
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:33,440
And predictably, he was right next to the enemy. He shot right past it. He missed. It was the

1305
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:43,440
funniest moment. And now, German 985 owes chat like two something 0.5 billion dollars in community

1306
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:51,520
subs. And so much stuff about what is happening in his current streams is like, he'll do something

1307
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:57,360
that chat wants him to do if they they shave off like a few million dollars from the debt.

1308
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:03,920
And it's a running joke. It's really funny. So funny. That's really funny. Okay, wow. I'm surprised.

1309
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:10,800
I'm surprised that the Noida was related to that because I've again, I've never heard anyone mention

1310
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,600
this game. But I saw it and I was like, oh, wow, that looks really fucking neat. Is it like a well

1311
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:22,480
known game? I'm not sure. I think it just played it because it was cool and Indian out recently.

1312
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:28,480
Well, for the for the for the audience, I'll say that it's it's like, it's a rogue like sort of,

1313
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,600
it's like, it's like, you know, randomly generated dungeons. But like the way the world is generated

1314
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:39,680
is it's based on like, those like sand physics sort of games, you know what I'm talking about,

1315
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:44,800
the ones where you put fucking sand in a in a on the screen, and then you like drop other

1316
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:50,320
kinds of sand on top of it. And they like pile on each other and you can make like gas particles

1317
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:57,200
and stuff and they float around. Like it's like physics based like that. And there's yeah. And

1318
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:03,280
it's really fucking neat. But it's really fucking hard. And I have honestly not made very much

1319
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:08,880
headway at all. I think I got to like the third stage like one time and I have no idea how many

1320
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:14,320
stages there are. I found a I found like a couple of secrets in like, I found a secret boss in the

1321
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:20,480
first stage, but it was like so far beyond my ability to deal with. I got obliterated. It's

1322
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:25,920
hard. It's a hard game. But I really like that like, I really like playing with those like,

1323
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:33,520
particle physics games. And I thought it's just really wild to me that they actually that they

1324
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:38,000
would make a game that combines those two things. I just think that's neat as hell.

1325
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,720
And I probably fuck around with that some more this week. Because, you know,

1326
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,800
if I like I like video games, I'd like to play them for fun.

1327
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,760
I like to play them for not fun. I like to play them for rage.

1328
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,520
Play them for spite. I'll play them for for hate's sake. I spit at the.

1329
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,480
I do it to spite my parents who said you'll never play video games. And I'll show them.

1330
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:10,960
They said I couldn't do it. They said I couldn't do it, but I did it. They said,

1331
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:17,840
they said you'll never beat Undertale. It's too hard. Well, you'll never be cloudy. Well,

1332
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:24,080
guess, well guess what? I fucking did it. I fucking got the good ending to mom.

1333
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,240
Um, fuck you.

1334
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,200
Uh, you want to go to voicemails? Yeah.

1335
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:38,720
Okay. Unless there's any unless there's any bullshit you want to bring up.

1336
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,600
Uh, well, there was that one time that cow took a shit.

1337
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:50,400
All right, you got them up. You ready?

1338
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:57,360
Speak pipe.com slash the PCP voicemail. How do you do it?

1339
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:02,960
Well, speak pipe.com slash PCP voicemail. That's how you send us a voicemail and we listen to it

1340
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:08,080
on the show and we don't we don't have any any quality standards whatsoever.

1341
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:14,560
Uh, except occasionally, but very rarely, almost any little play almost anything,

1342
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:22,640
uh, Lamal. Uh, so send us your most racist shit. No. And we will seriously engage with it.

1343
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:32,480
We will treat it as valid. I promise. Uh, or do I? Uh, are you ready?

1344
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:37,200
Uh, the first one is called seven. Oh, so yeah. Yep.

1345
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:41,280
Okay. Three, two, one, go.

1346
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:45,600
Climate change. Am I right, fellas? You're right.

1347
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,240
Fucking climate change. Nobody likes climate change.

1348
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:53,680
Climate change is shit. It's fucking everything up.

1349
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:58,640
Now I'm not claiming that I have the solution to climate change because I don't.

1350
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:04,160
What I have is fucking information that might reveal the ultimate cause of it.

1351
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:08,400
Right. So what we're told are the two leading causes of climate change.

1352
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:12,720
It's the fucking coal mining industry and the fucking farming industry.

1353
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:18,000
We have these heavy fucking machines, production, all this fucking shit that's going up into the

1354
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,360
stratosphere. We all know how climate change works. I'm sure. Right. And it's causing fucking

1355
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:28,160
climate change. This shit in fucking air caused by fucking. Is this is just like

1356
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:32,240
in the fucking farming. Now before we had these heavy machines, you know what we had?

1357
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:39,200
We had slaves. So ultimately climate change is the fault of two men.

1358
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:43,600
Number one, Abraham Lincoln, number two, Martin Luther King Jr.

1359
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:49,600
And if you disagree, you are also to blame for climate change. Okay. Discuss.

1360
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,240
Well, I don't I don't see any fault in this logic.

1361
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,800
The isn't like me saying a greenhouse gas.

1362
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:02,800
Don't don't we don't fart that? Or is that just cows?

1363
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,320
We probably do, but not as much. I mean,

1364
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,680
I don't fucking know. I guess I guess he's right. You know what?

1365
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:16,960
He's I guess he's right. I guess slavery was pretty based after all.

1366
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:21,920
And you know what? I think it's time for us all to be slaves, every single one of us.

1367
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,960
We get the get the fucking throw away the keys. It's jangles chains up. We don't need to be

1368
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,240
chained because we're doing it voluntarily, but it's like for the aesthetic, I guess.

1369
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:35,520
Let's get all those chains around our necks. Bring back slavery, but with a twist,

1370
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:40,160
there were literally all of us become slaves. No masters, only slaves.

1371
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:43,680
Yeah, people look up and it's like, who's whipping with me? There's no one.

1372
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:47,520
There's no one there. It's like, shut up. Just keep you got to do it.

1373
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,880
Digging. You're responsible for your whipping yourself.

1374
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:57,040
Yeah, you got to pick yourself up. You got to pick yourself up by your whip straps.

1375
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:01,440
If you really think about it, rule slaves to whatever we want to do.

1376
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:07,280
We are slaves to our own free will. Yeah, right.

1377
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:10,720
To our own free choice and association with our fellow man.

1378
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,400
Damn. Got to say, I never never thought about it like that.

1379
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,040
Next one. Oh my God, these are great. These are great so far. Next one is called

1380
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:25,040
Why the ethno state is a good idea and you should support it. Damn, voicemails on point.

1381
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,640
You know, last week we had shitty voicemails. This time they were like,

1382
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:33,360
we got a fucking step of the quality and they did it. Three, two, one, go.

1383
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:44,560
Konnichiwa. Oh, oh, okay, okay. Samurai-sama, see how it is. Here he comes.

1384
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:51,120
Voicemail, fan favorite, brother character, Samurai-sama. He said,

1385
01:52:51,120 --> 01:53:00,560
Konnichiwa, you react like that. Well, Samurai-sama, come this week to finally accept

1386
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:09,120
to apologize. Very happy, but you, after honoring here, Konnichiwa, react like that.

1387
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:13,760
Well, fuck you. We didn't react enough. That's the problem.

1388
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:21,680
Return no Samurai-sama. At this point, you honorly have yourself to blame.

1389
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:25,440
This is abuse, honestly. See you next time. Sayonara.

1390
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:32,320
This is the abuse tactic wherein you just, you abuse someone

1391
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,720
and then they react negatively to the abuse and then you say,

1392
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:42,320
see, it's because you act like that. It's because you act like that that I have to treat you this

1393
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:51,280
way. This is what it is. This is an abusive relationship now. There's no way out.

1394
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:57,200
It really was unfortunate that we'd said absolutely nothing and that the whole point

1395
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:02,080
of the thing was that, oh, you react like that? I think it makes sense. I mean, it makes sense,

1396
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:08,720
right? I would be offended if I introduced myself. And we didn't go, oh my god.

1397
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:18,880
No reaction whatsoever. Next is an, oh lord, next one. Now here's a fan favorite,

1398
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:24,640
a real fan favorite if ever there was one. And we should put these two in a,

1399
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:32,400
in a, some sort of deathmatch against each other. Riddle my ass, Batman. Here we go. Three, two, one, go.

1400
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:40,080
Hello. Riddle my ass, Batman here. Yes. Yes, I'm ready. The question for one thing

1401
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:43,760
is still going on. It's going to be the second episode coming up right after this or possibly

1402
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:53,040
two after this. And it's still going on, but I'm on a shittier mic now because my laptop broke.

1403
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:58,480
I will tell you the story in a second. It involves... This is just a voicemail about why he couldn't make

1404
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:04,320
the voice... ...mander and origins and masturbation. Well, look forward to that story in a minute.

1405
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:09,040
I'm excited. Anyway, that's why I'm on my phone microphone right now. So just so you know,

1406
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:13,600
it's kind of shit. Oh, and RiddleMyAssBatman.com, class Patreon, or whatever the fuck it's called,

1407
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:20,480
you know how to find it. It does exist. You just have to look it up when it exists. I didn't take

1408
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:27,760
it to account. The fact that you were in it a week early. I was in it. Sorry. Okay, on with the show.

1409
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:33,680
Oh, it's just explaining the context for his next voicemail.

1410
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:50,000
I'm going to die. Well, now we're fully rarity for the next one, a bird and origin masturbation.

1411
01:55:50,720 --> 01:56:02,560
Hold on. Hold on. It's in the next one. Okay, Patreon, Patreon.com slash RiddleMyAssBatman.

1412
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:14,240
No, it's not... It doesn't exist. It's not there. Wait, what? Let me try RiddleMyAssBatman.com.

1413
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,800
No. No.

1414
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:32,080
Well, he reversed him, right? He said like RiddleMyAssBatman.patreon.com or slash...

1415
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:42,960
It's not... It's not real. It's a fantasy. It's a mere... It's a rooster illusion.

1416
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:50,400
Uh, RiddleMyAssBatman YouTube. Maybe there's a link from here.

1417
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,680
What? Where? Where do you see it? Where?

1418
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:57,600
I just googled RiddleMyAssBatman. I got to a YouTube channel.

1419
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,240
There's no link. There's no link to it.

1420
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:07,360
I mean, he had the... Was it Wattpad or what was like the...

1421
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:13,840
There was the page where his stories, like the novel version was.

1422
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:19,360
Okay. Okay. The trail's gone cold. The trail's gone cold. All right.

1423
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:25,440
Let's hear what he's got to say about a bird, an orange, and masturbation. Shall we?

1424
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,080
Yeah.

1425
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,960
Three, two, one, go.

1426
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:33,280
Okay, the bird, orange, and masturbation story.

1427
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:33,760
Here we go.

1428
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:37,920
I was masturbating while eating an orange.

1429
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,320
Same.

1430
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:44,560
Because I consider orange to be an erotic fruit, in my opinion, an aphrodisiac.

1431
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:53,600
Turn me on. And I treat myself good. Anyway, my bird, she squawks like a bad hell.

1432
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,480
And it scares the living Jesus out of me for just a moment.

1433
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:01,280
And I squeezed the orange. And just because of the angle I happened to have it at,

1434
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,760
I squeezed the orange right into a sensitive spot on my dick, right into the fucking hole.

1435
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:08,240
Right in the...

1436
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:15,920
It burned like nobody's business. And it caused me to drop my laptop and I broke it.

1437
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:20,240
Now, of course, I'm, you know, I'm halfway through a fat.

1438
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:22,560
I mean, what am I supposed to do? I'm supposed to stop there?

1439
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:26,560
No. No, I can't stop just a minute away through a fat. You got to finish your fat.

1440
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,360
So I grabbed the nearest erotic thing I can find.

1441
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:33,920
The calendar from Ragscon.

1442
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,160
Yes, the Ragscon swimsuit calendar.

1443
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:40,480
The calendar knows which picture I used.

1444
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,440
And there's so many good ones.

1445
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:44,480
There's so many to choose from.

1446
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,200
That's what I did, yeah.

1447
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,600
And that's why I don't have a laptop anymore.

1448
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:49,120
Was it worth it?

1449
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,040
Yes. Okay.

1450
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:55,520
That's the explanation. Same PCB time, same PCB channel.

1451
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,560
On with the show, Quest for Corona episode 2. Bye.

1452
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,280
Sound off in the comments.

1453
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:08,080
Okay, commenters, if you backed Ragscon 4 and you have the calendar,

1454
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:18,400
let us know in the comments which month you think Riddle My Ass Batman finished his fat too.

1455
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,440
Because there's no wrong answers, really.

1456
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:23,200
They're all good choices, in my opinion.

1457
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:29,760
I think, I'm going to guess it might be the solo munchy one, if you remember what that looks like.

1458
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:37,200
Yeah, I think I strongly objected to that one.

1459
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:45,280
On the grounds of it, crossing the line from Etchy to Full-on Hentai.

1460
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:53,360
I found it, it was no, yeah, lascivious, lascivious.

1461
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,960
But they wouldn't have it.

1462
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:00,560
There's a fucking story about bird orange and masturbation.

1463
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,240
The bird had almost nothing to do with it.

1464
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:05,280
It squawked.

1465
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:06,560
Yeah.

1466
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:12,960
Like, so much of it seems silly and like, why, how, what orange, why would you have an orange?

1467
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:21,440
Well, he explained in the text, he considers it an erotic fruit and he treats himself good.

1468
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:24,320
I know, it's just, it seems like it's a bit, but it could actually,

1469
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,680
like, feel like it could actually have happened, which is the funny part.

1470
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:34,800
I don't, I don't, I don't, in one hand, wait, in one hand you have an orange.

1471
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,960
I don't know what about it makes you think it's a bit.

1472
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:44,960
Because it's so fucking silly, Ben, who eats an orange while holding their laptop and

1473
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:45,680
masturbating.

1474
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:46,560
That's just life.

1475
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,560
You know, life's truth is stranger than fiction sometimes.

1476
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,240
Go straight into the pee hole.

1477
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:53,040
I know, I know, I know you're uncomfortable.

1478
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:58,240
I know you can't stare unblinkingly into the void of meaning that is reality.

1479
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,000
But I can, and that's what, and that's what I do.

1480
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:06,960
Whenever, when Riddle My Ass Batman leaves as a voicemail.

1481
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,720
This is, this is, this, accept it.

1482
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:15,280
The sooner you accept that this is what life is, the sooner you can just get on with it,

1483
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:15,600
you know?

1484
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:17,680
I don't know what's real anymore.

1485
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:20,160
I see things on the internet and I'm like, that's not true.

1486
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:20,800
And then it is.

1487
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,320
It's always true.

1488
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,080
It's always true.

1489
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:26,560
Next one?

1490
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:27,440
Yep.

1491
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:30,000
Next one is called Thoughts.

1492
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:33,840
Three, that's with a G-H, like in your brain.

1493
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,680
Three, two, one, go.

1494
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:39,520
Hey, what are your thoughts on Donkey Kong?

1495
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:41,520
I like him.

1496
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,520
Gib, thoughts on Donkey Kong?

1497
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:48,960
Donkey Kong is a pretty funny guy.

1498
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:52,480
He's big and he has a fun game called Donkey Kong Country.

1499
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:54,880
One and two, maybe, he's not in three.

1500
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:56,640
And then he's in Smash.

1501
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:57,680
He's not in two either.

1502
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,320
He's not in two either, you fucking nerd.

1503
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:03,120
He's, he's in trouble.

1504
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,880
In the third one, I feel like he's just gone.

1505
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:07,360
He's just gone.

1506
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,680
He's gotta be somewhere in three.

1507
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:11,840
I never played three, let me be clear.

1508
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,880
I played three.

1509
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:18,480
You know, I didn't, as a kid, it seems like public opinion now

1510
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:20,400
is that three was not as good as two.

1511
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,760
I never noticed much of a difference.

1512
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:27,280
I thought they were both just fucking great.

1513
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,480
And I never beat either of them

1514
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,160
because they were both way too hard for me as a kid.

1515
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:33,680
I think it's really just a surface level detail.

1516
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:39,520
Kitty Kong is a fucking freak and he's not as epic and swag as Diddy Kong.

1517
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,280
With his beatbox.

1518
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:45,840
I've heard people say that three is like more gimmicky

1519
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:48,960
or like has more like like bullshit in it.

1520
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:52,720
And I've heard critiques of it that I forget what it is.

1521
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,400
People have like reasons.

1522
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,320
But as a kid, I just thought they,

1523
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,560
I just thought three looked really nice.

1524
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:01,840
And I like collecting silver coins.

1525
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,120
And I thought the silver coins looked nicer than the gold ones.

1526
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:08,240
And I probably just liked it on that basis.

1527
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:10,160
I mean, I didn't play too much of three,

1528
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:12,400
but I did like the beginning few levels

1529
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,360
where it's just sort of nice, sort of, I don't know,

1530
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:21,440
almost like American red pine forestry like pine wood.

1531
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:24,080
Nice, like unusual for monkeys to be there.

1532
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:26,640
Like unusual for like the Kong people.

1533
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:28,160
Oh yeah, snow levels.

1534
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:31,040
I think I like that about it too, that it just had snow levels.

1535
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:32,640
And you had a hovercraft.

1536
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,040
And you could drive a little hovercraft around the world map.

1537
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:38,960
The fact that you could, that was so cool, right?

1538
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:42,960
Like you're not constrained to a linear path.

1539
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:43,440
Yeah.

1540
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:43,600
Yeah.

1541
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:46,480
You're not just doing, you're not just doing like a Mario three,

1542
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,400
like world to world on the line thing.

1543
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:51,200
You hop in your, I mean, on the, on the land you are,

1544
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:53,440
but like you hop in your fucking little hovercraft

1545
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:57,440
and get on the ocean and you go, and there's little secrets.

1546
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,040
Like there's secrets in the ocean, right?

1547
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:00,720
Like you circle around like a rock

1548
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:02,320
and it turns into a hidden level.

1549
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:04,560
Oh my God, what a fucking video game.

1550
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,280
I should replay them.

1551
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,760
They were, they were very difficult for me.

1552
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:15,760
Answer your question, Mr. voicemail man, Donkey Kong, whatever.

1553
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:20,880
But the, I like the games, the guy, the monkey himself.

1554
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,320
Eh, it's fine.

1555
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,920
He's finally here, the leader of the bunch,

1556
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:30,720
coconut gong, Kong, Donkey Kong.

1557
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:32,400
Donkey Kong.

1558
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,400
Donkey Kong.

1559
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,400
Donkey Kong.

1560
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,400
Donkey Kong.

1561
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,400
One hell of a guy.

1562
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,400
Okay.

1563
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:46,400
Next one is called a bright outlook.

1564
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,400
Three, two, one, go.

1565
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:52,400
Just wanted to say some words of encouragement.

1566
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,400
Thanks man.

1567
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,400
You guys are chads, you know, you guys are troopers.

1568
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,520
That's true.

1569
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,520
Sticking around, still being here.

1570
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,000
Agreed.

1571
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:04,160
Doing your own things, doing your own art, doing good.

1572
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:06,720
Doing your own podcasts, some Patreon stuff.

1573
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,640
Good stuff, you know.

1574
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:09,680
Keep it up.

1575
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,720
Here's to a good year.

1576
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:16,080
And I hope that maybe all the Radcon stuff could come out.

1577
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:17,200
That'd be pretty sick.

1578
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:17,840
What are you guys saying?

1579
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:19,600
I think that's a good goal for 2021, right?

1580
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:21,760
I think all the Radcon stuff will be out this year.

1581
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:23,680
Sorry, lads.

1582
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:24,320
Have a good one.

1583
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,080
Don't be sorry, we have to do that.

1584
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:39,440
Yeah, I think the stuff that is getting done is definitely on track to be done, you know.

1585
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:46,000
Before the year gets too far in, everything else we will figure out.

1586
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:49,200
We can definitely have it all out this year.

1587
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:52,800
For some specific people, for some specific bits of it, you know.

1588
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,280
Yeah, we gotta kick some asses.

1589
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,560
Thank you for the encouragement.

1590
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,640
We'll do that with pleasure.

1591
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:01,680
We'll do that with pleasure.

1592
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:08,640
Yes, all the Radcon stuff will come out this year.

1593
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:11,440
And because of that, it will not be a good year.

1594
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:16,400
It will be a bad year, because the content will be bad and you will hate it.

1595
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:19,520
Yes, you will say we waited all year for this.

1596
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:21,600
You'll say I waited my whole life.

1597
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:26,000
If you said I ever since I pledged to Radcon and then I literally didn't leave my house

1598
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,440
for a fucking year and change because all I wanted was this content and then you'll get it.

1599
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:34,720
And it won't fill the hole inside you and you'll say what was it all for?

1600
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:36,880
And the answer will be nothing.

1601
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:39,600
Damn, bleak.

1602
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:44,560
Next voicemail.

1603
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:47,920
Wait a second, did I get that one?

1604
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:48,640
Yeah, I did.

1605
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:51,440
Next voicemail is called Let's Kill Fat Ben.

1606
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:54,080
Three, two, one, go.

1607
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:56,480
All right, Ben.

1608
02:06:57,200 --> 02:07:00,000
Last week you said it would take until about April to get rid of Fat Ben.

1609
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,480
Maybe.

1610
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:04,240
And as a fellow disgraced keto boy myself, I kind of wanted on this.

1611
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:08,400
So I'm going to use the tool of public internet shaming to keep both you and me on track.

1612
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:10,880
So I'm going to start today.

1613
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:12,320
What about you?

1614
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:13,680
How's the past week been?

1615
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:15,520
And isn't it about time we started lifting again?

1616
02:07:16,240 --> 02:07:17,280
See you next time.

1617
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:24,000
Yeah, I was lifting for a little bit there for a couple weeks.

1618
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,400
I fell off it again and I haven't in a few weeks now, which is shit.

1619
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:35,840
I already said that I'm back on keto, which has not, I have not lost any weight,

1620
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:37,200
which is very frustrating.

1621
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:42,480
But what I do need to actually start doing in addition to just being keto is calorie counting.

1622
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:49,120
I need to start like cooking very specific things and knowing the calorie counts and like

1623
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:53,760
logging them and like actually keeping myself to like a numerical limit.

1624
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:57,360
That's, that's the thing that I have not, that's, that's what I need.

1625
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,560
This, this is secret sauce.

1626
02:07:58,560 --> 02:07:59,600
I got to add into it.

1627
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:05,920
If I do that, then I'm guaranteed to kill Fat Ben in a reasonable timeframe.

1628
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:08,640
And lifting again would be good too.

1629
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:10,160
I should definitely do that also.

1630
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:16,640
Why, why would you lift away from the earth when you could push the earth instead?

1631
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:19,280
I'm sorry?

1632
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,760
Instead of lifting, you push downwards.

1633
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:26,080
It's easier.

1634
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:26,400
What?

1635
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:27,680
Much easier.

1636
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,080
That's a body weight exercise.

1637
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:31,280
You just push the earth.

1638
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:32,240
That's what, that's what a pushup is.

1639
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:34,480
You're moving the entire earth when you push.

1640
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:35,680
You are.

1641
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:41,840
But, you know, in a minute, in an infinitesimal way, because it's like, you know, between you

1642
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,400
and the earth, you each, it's between your center of gravity and like the difference in

1643
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:53,920
mass is so vast that the equal and opposite reaction, just keep pushing, just push the

1644
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,400
earth, just keep pushing everything.

1645
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:59,040
Just you get down, you get down on the ground.

1646
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:02,240
Stop lifting, stop dropping, stop dropping things.

1647
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,280
Stop walking things.

1648
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:07,600
Put your hands on the ground, jump, jump, jump, jump, moving all around.

1649
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:19,520
You know that, that first song?

1650
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,600
What is that called?

1651
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,680
I know the second one was Caramel Dancin'.

1652
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:25,920
Do you know that song that I was just humming there?

1653
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:27,120
No, I've never heard it.

1654
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:31,520
It's, there was a, there was a, there was a New Ground song,

1655
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:35,280
animation of a bunch of like video game characters.

1656
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:40,400
It was like really crappy, like old like New Ground's flash style animation in the sort of

1657
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:43,040
pseudo anime style that was popular at the time.

1658
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:47,360
And it's that song is playing, and they're all playing DDR.

1659
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:51,920
Jump on the ground, jump, jump, jump, jump, moving all around.

1660
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:55,120
Maybe it's called Jump on the Ground.

1661
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,360
It was probably called Jump on the Ground.

1662
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:01,600
Anyway, that was Caramel Dancin' before Caramel Dancin' was Caramel Dancin'.

1663
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:05,920
Ted Dancin'.

1664
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:06,800
Okay.

1665
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,720
Anyway, next one is called Die.

1666
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:11,200
Three, two, one, go.

1667
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:19,360
To all of you guys asking them to stop the podcast or kill the podcast.

1668
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:20,400
How does that benefit you?

1669
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:20,880
Oh yeah.

1670
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:28,960
You can just leave, stop watching, unsubscribe, go away, die.

1671
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:34,880
Like if they kill the podcast, what does that help you?

1672
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,000
Yeah, there was one or two commenters.

1673
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:38,960
That's stupid.

1674
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,800
There's one or two comments on the last one.

1675
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:42,960
Every now and then we get one.

1676
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:45,920
That's just like, just kill the podcast already.

1677
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:52,160
And like, yeah, and actually yesterday I responded to someone saying like,

1678
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:55,920
but you're literally here watching, listening to it.

1679
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:58,240
You're literally here on the giving us the view.

1680
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:00,880
So like, why?

1681
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:06,400
It's, I mean, I know why, but it's just a really petty like stupid reason.

1682
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,480
It's because from their point of view,

1683
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:14,560
like the show that they once loved is now ruined.

1684
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,440
And every time they see it, they're reminded of better times.

1685
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:22,240
And they sort of tears form in their eyes when they realize that it's just not the same.

1686
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:25,440
And it's like, that is not a good enough reason for us to do anything.

1687
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,600
Yeah, sure.

1688
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:30,880
Just get some blinders, get some horse blinders on.

1689
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:32,560
They probably know.

1690
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:34,720
I mean, they probably know that we won't do it.

1691
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:41,200
But I guess they just want to let us know that in their opinion, it's what we should do.

1692
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:42,720
And okay.

1693
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,800
Yeah, whatever.

1694
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:50,160
Yeah, we're just, we're just, we're just never going to agree on this, I guess.

1695
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:52,720
You think we should die and we think we shouldn't.

1696
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:55,120
And there's just, there's really no middle ground there.

1697
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:57,840
Yeah, or you should, you should be active about it.

1698
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:03,680
You know, try to destroy us, cancel us, create your own podcast and make fun of us.

1699
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:05,280
What did, what did I see?

1700
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:07,200
Oh God, I saw an image.

1701
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:09,440
I think it was on Twitter like yesterday.

1702
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,160
Well, what the fuck was it?

1703
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:15,680
It was, it was something and it was captioned like,

1704
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:22,240
if it was like, if you hate me, either kill me or shut the fuck up.

1705
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:28,000
It was funny in context, but I don't remember what the context was.

1706
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:33,040
But anyway, yeah, if you, if you hate us so much, we're not, we're not going to kill,

1707
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:34,320
we're not going to end the show.

1708
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:37,040
You're literally going to have to come and kill us yourself.

1709
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:39,280
God, I shouldn't say that.

1710
02:12:40,080 --> 02:12:41,440
They'll fucking do it.

1711
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,680
They'll fucking do it soon.

1712
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,960
If I'm, if I'm not on the next episode,

1713
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:50,800
know that it's because someone took me up on that offer.

1714
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:52,000
Uh-oh.

1715
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:53,700
Gulp.

1716
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,640
Uh, next one.

1717
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:58,080
Oh my God, we're almost done.

1718
02:12:58,080 --> 02:12:58,960
We're almost done.

1719
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:03,040
And, you know, honestly, these voicemails have been pretty decent this week.

1720
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:04,720
These are, these are, these are all right.

1721
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:06,480
These haven't been too annoying.

1722
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:07,520
So pretty cool.

1723
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:14,080
Uh, last voicemail is called an actually somewhat obscure Pokemon game.

1724
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:15,760
Three, two, one, go.

1725
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:19,680
Heart gold, soul silver, not obscure, their main series games.

1726
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:21,120
Most Pokemon games are not obscure.

1727
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:22,160
Pokemon's huge.

1728
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:24,480
It's hard to have an obscure game in a franchise so big,

1729
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,240
especially if it was released in English.

1730
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:26,960
Conquest.

1731
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:31,120
Probably the most obscure English game that is actually great.

1732
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:36,800
And obscure might even be putting it too hard is a Pokemon conquest.

1733
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:40,000
Really straight as the DS was dying and the 3DS was already out.

1734
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:45,680
In the dip between, uh, there was sort of a popularity dip of Pokemon at that point

1735
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:49,200
of time before completely surging in the 3DS games.

1736
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:55,120
It was also targeted towards older teens and adult, which again was kind of a dip and would be,

1737
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,160
it would do so much better if it was released today is basically.

1738
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,120
He has not said what it is.

1739
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:00,880
It's crossover in Nobu Naga's ambition.

1740
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:03,360
Yes, historical Nobu Naga, the samurai.

1741
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:06,880
He has a Zekrom and he's a pretty big deal in that game

1742
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,960
as he was an actual Japanese history.

1743
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:13,360
It plays like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics

1744
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:17,040
because nobody knows what Nobu Naga's ambition is in America.

1745
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:19,440
Has a pretty interesting story.

1746
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:20,640
Total on Fire Emblem is the best thing I've ever heard.

1747
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:23,840
If you like Texas gameplay, Pokemon Samurai's

1748
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:28,400
and, uh, late DS aesthetics would recommend Pokemon Conquest

1749
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:32,560
because it's certainly more obscure than HeartGold and SoulSilver.

1750
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:34,240
People love those games.

1751
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,600
People constantly talk about them.

1752
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,640
They're not obscure.

1753
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:37,040
I, I, actually.

1754
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:39,280
If you're going to talk about obscure Pokemon stuff,

1755
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:43,200
know something at least mildly obscure that isn't a main series game.

1756
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:47,680
I might actually go and play that because, um,

1757
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:52,160
I love the gameplay of Fire Emblem and I dislike the gameplay of Pokemon so much

1758
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,160
that might, that might be cool.

1759
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:59,200
Well, have you played, um, have you played the, the Mystery Dungeon?

1760
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:00,560
I have.

1761
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:01,280
I like those.

1762
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,160
Okay.

1763
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:02,560
Okay.

1764
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:06,800
Um, I mean, this looks similar to that, but

1765
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:10,160
I mean, I, I wonder how, like,

1766
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:13,600
Mystery Dungeon is not like Fire Emblem in the same way.

1767
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:14,560
Yeah, okay.

1768
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:16,880
Because it's like you just move one thing at a time.

1769
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:20,880
It's honestly, this is like Turn Lua.

1770
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,680
I assume if it's Fire Emblem Life then it's Turn Lua.

1771
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:26,560
What actually turns me off from this is that it's like,

1772
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:31,120
has humans, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1773
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:36,320
No, I don't see any human, I don't see any human in characters.

1774
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,880
It would be like humans who have Pokemon, right?

1775
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:40,800
And they fight using those.

1776
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:44,720
No, this, this is a man.

1777
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:46,800
This is a man right here, right?

1778
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:51,040
Like, between that Arceus and that Darumaka.

1779
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:53,840
Darumaka, Darumaka.

1780
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,680
If you get to kill people, that would be great.

1781
02:15:59,280 --> 02:15:59,520
Yeah.

1782
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:02,320
Look at the little black person in the corner.

1783
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:06,000
Honestly, yeah, like, I don't, I don't really love the actual,

1784
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,640
like, gameplay part of, um, the, the Mystery Dungeon.

1785
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:11,920
Like, it was fine.

1786
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,600
I used to really like, like tactics, uh, you know, um,

1787
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:19,360
grid based, like a tactical RPGs like this.

1788
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:23,600
If this were just that with Pokemon, I might think that was pretty cool.

1789
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:27,680
The fact that it's tacked on to the fucking Nobunaga's ambition, which like,

1790
02:16:28,640 --> 02:16:32,480
what the fuck, uh, is, is kind of a big turn off.

1791
02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:34,640
Like, I don't want to fucking deal with like,

1792
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:38,080
wall.

1793
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:38,800
Look at that.

1794
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:39,520
That's cool.

1795
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:40,160
I like that.

1796
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:45,040
I don't, I don't, I don't want to fucking know.

1797
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:48,480
I don't want to deal with these fucking, these humans.

1798
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:49,360
You just don't want it.

1799
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:53,360
You just don't want them to say directly into the camera.

1800
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:55,920
Konnichiwa.

1801
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,120
You don't want them to do that.

1802
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,640
I mean, they'll do it.

1803
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:06,240
If the, if the, if the premise of the game is that like, you are a fucking,

1804
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:14,880
I don't know, like a foolish samurai warrior and you've got your fucking six Pokemon team.

1805
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:18,320
And you got to, you got to catch Pokemon and you get to fight your way.

1806
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:24,000
If this is like, if it's like, it's like Pokemon, it's the premise of a Pokemon game,

1807
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:29,520
but it's set in like feudal Japan and it like plays out that way.

1808
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:30,560
That would be awesome.

1809
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:34,640
But I feel like it's definitely not that it's probably some bullshit.

1810
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:38,800
It's probably actually just like this other game, but like some of the characters have

1811
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,240
been reskinned to be Pokemon.

1812
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:41,520
All right.

1813
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:45,840
I, I'll, I'll download it illegally and play it and then I'll get back to you.

1814
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:47,120
Okay.

1815
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:48,000
Yeah.

1816
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,200
Let's be like a thing to keep track of.

1817
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:52,960
You should, you should do a podcast.

1818
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:56,800
You should do a fucking GRPJ about Pokemon conquests.

1819
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:58,960
Bring that back.

1820
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:00,800
Dude, little Curlia.

1821
02:18:02,480 --> 02:18:02,880
Show me.

1822
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,520
Show me fucking Curlia.

1823
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,400
She's like doing a magic right now.

1824
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:09,840
Ooh.

1825
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:10,240
Wow.

1826
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:15,520
Um, they're like fighting beach balls or something.

1827
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:19,120
Pokemon.

1828
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:25,360
I mean, hmm, Pokemon in other formats is a cool idea.

1829
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:32,880
I just, I feel like if this were good, more people would talk about it because it is so obscure.

1830
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:35,360
You, you'd, you'd literally never heard about it.

1831
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:38,000
I had heard about it because I do feel like

1832
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:40,880
if it were, because I was literally googling myself.

1833
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:45,200
I was googling a Pokemon conquest because I made that fucking Nuzlocke about it.

1834
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:48,560
And then I was like, I found this and it was like, wait a minute,

1835
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:52,880
there's a game called that and it was this and I was like shocked and horrified.

1836
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:57,520
I think that the reason nobody knows about this would be,

1837
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:01,840
like the guy said, in between DS and 3DS.

1838
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:04,800
And also it's not a traditional Pokemon game.

1839
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:06,800
So people are like, oh, it's not the game I know.

1840
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:07,520
I don't care.

1841
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:08,560
And then nobody cared.

1842
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:10,320
But it could be a secret hidden gem.

1843
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:17,200
I mean, I, well, I think it's probably that because of it's weird,

1844
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,640
the weird time it was released.

1845
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:24,080
I mean, it's a crossover series with something that nobody in the West has ever fucking heard of.

1846
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:25,360
Nobody, wait a minute.

1847
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:30,240
Are the Nobunaga's ambitions games, like are they called something else in America?

1848
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:34,800
They're called Japan Fight.

1849
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,080
Amazing.

1850
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:40,560
Okay.

1851
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:42,960
I was thinking they might be called something else in America,

1852
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,120
but no, I don't think they are.

1853
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:45,440
Yeah.

1854
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:46,960
So it's a crossover with something.

1855
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:50,480
Maybe it's popular in Japan and maybe more people know about it over there.

1856
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:55,840
But in America, it's like, why, like, how would you even explain what this is to a Western child?

1857
02:19:56,160 --> 02:20:03,680
Like, well, it's like a, it's like a historical, like, period piece, but we put Pokemon in it.

1858
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:08,720
Like, if I were Nintendo, I also probably just wouldn't even bother advertising it in the West.

1859
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:09,920
So I think they made the right call.

1860
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:19,040
Honestly, honestly, it sort of seems like a bit of a, I feel like it's a little bit of a brand

1861
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:19,680
mismatch.

1862
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:24,080
And probably, if they were asking me, should we make,

1863
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:25,200
making me like it more?

1864
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:28,000
I like that no, no Pokemon fan would enjoy this.

1865
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:33,360
If they were, if they were, if I was, if I was a big wig at Nintendo and some fucking

1866
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:37,360
interns, some intern was like, I have a passion project I've always wanted to make.

1867
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:40,320
What if, what if we combine Nobunaga's ambition with Pokemon?

1868
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,800
Look, I mean, I spent my sleepless nights.

1869
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:45,520
I spent my weekends at the office making this prototype.

1870
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,400
What do you think, boss?

1871
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:48,400
I would say no, absolutely not.

1872
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:49,680
This is brand mismanagement.

1873
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:53,760
This will damage our fucking family friendly image.

1874
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:57,280
This is like, this is fucked up and you're a piece of shit and you're going to jail.

1875
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:03,520
And I would end that interns life right there.

1876
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:07,920
I would say put your hat on my fucking desk and I would take out my katana and behead him

1877
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:11,680
right there and make an example of him.

1878
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:15,280
Like this is what you do and you fuck with the Pokemon company.

1879
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,440
When you fuck with our brand, you die.

1880
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:20,960
And that would, and that would be, that would be it.

1881
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:22,960
And then, and then we lesson learned.

1882
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:25,840
And hopefully it would only have to be the one and no one would ever do.

1883
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:26,880
Maybe that's what happened.

1884
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:28,800
Maybe that's why this never happened again.

1885
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:31,680
Because they put this game existed and someone got executed.

1886
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:34,560
And they were like, well, we know not to fuck around.

1887
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:37,360
The guy, this guy fucked around and found out.

1888
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:39,200
Is what I'm saying.

1889
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:43,040
Anyway, yeah, looks, let me know, let me know if it's fun.

1890
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:44,000
Yep.

1891
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:44,960
Okay.

1892
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,960
Uh, well, shit, that's the last voicemail.

1893
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:50,080
We're free.

1894
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:52,240
Oh, no.

1895
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:53,120
Wait, wait.

1896
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:55,200
It's time for a Bitcoin update.

1897
02:21:58,880 --> 02:21:59,360
Zero.

1898
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:03,120
Oh, there's no more Bitcoin.

1899
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:04,160
Bitcoin's canceled.

1900
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:07,680
It's actually costs money to have Bitcoin now.

1901
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:09,200
No, as you, as you see.

1902
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,000
It's minus 10.

1903
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:11,360
Okay.

1904
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:16,400
It dipped a bit, but it kind of bounced back and it's a little lower than it was before.

1905
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:20,160
We're at 33, we're at 33, 550.

1906
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,600
So there you go.

1907
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:25,040
Uh, uh, all my money is gone.

1908
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,560
But next week I'll be rich.

1909
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:32,400
It's going to the moon.

1910
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:37,360
Give Bitcoin, it's, it's, people think it can't rise any higher.

1911
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:37,920
They're wrong.

1912
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:39,920
Ye a little faith.

1913
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:41,760
It's going to the moon.

1914
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:43,680
They haven't seen nothing yet.

1915
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:45,920
It's going to be, it's going to, it's going to triple again.

1916
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:47,280
It's going to triple again.

1917
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:48,640
It's going to hit 50K.

1918
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:50,080
It's going to hit 50K this year.

1919
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:51,360
It's only a matter of time.

1920
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:52,480
Just got to hold it.

1921
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:53,920
Just got to hold it for long enough.

1922
02:22:59,600 --> 02:22:59,920
Okay.

1923
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:06,800
Sorry, I'm just googling Pokemon conquest ROM and maybe it's like so nobody cares about it.

1924
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:07,680
It's hard to find.

1925
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:10,960
Oh wait, no, I may have found it.

1926
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:13,200
Was it on the DS?

1927
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:13,920
DS, yeah.

1928
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:21,040
God, I love still having my, my R4, my DS, uh, pirate thingy.

1929
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:24,000
I'm going to play all of classics.

1930
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:27,440
Is that the thing that you can like the cartridge you put games on?

1931
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:33,200
Yeah, you can put games on it using a USB to SD card thingy and then you just play them

1932
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,160
and they fucking work.

1933
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:36,480
I think I had one of those.

1934
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:38,640
I think I had one of those.

1935
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,640
I think Nate got me one at one point.

1936
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:48,880
I think that was what I played heart gold on in the run that Brunswick came from all those years ago.

1937
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,280
I wonder where, I wonder where that is.

1938
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:59,680
I feel like that cartridge that had that copy of heart gold on it is like in a box in my parents house

1939
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:03,760
somewhere or, or some, it's got to be somewhere.

1940
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:04,640
It wouldn't have been thrown out.

1941
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:10,560
It's really under a fucking shelf somewhere that no human will ever lay eyes on again.

1942
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:15,920
Hidden treasure.

1943
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,000
One piece.

1944
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:18,480
Are we done?

1945
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,000
Are we, are we,

1946
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:21,280
can't-

1947
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:21,440
Yeah.

1948
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:22,880
What happened?

1949
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:29,200
Patreon, patreon.com slash the procrastinators, right?

1950
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:33,040
Yeah, what, why'd you keep asking me?

1951
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:33,280
Yes.

1952
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:38,000
Because I never, okay, okay, give a bonus episode.

1953
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,920
Uh, we did a bonus episode.

1954
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:43,520
I think it should be coming out soon, right?

1955
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,440
We did one last month that should be releasing soon.

1956
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:46,720
Yeah, what was it?

1957
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:48,000
Is that the one where I get really salty?

1958
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,200
Is that the one with Gamers Tavern?

1959
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:53,040
The one with Gamers, yes, I'm really salty.

1960
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:58,800
I complain about everyone and Gamers Tavern's there and we do the fucking thing again where we,

1961
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:06,320
where we do the retrospective on the other time Gamers Tavern was on the show and it's fucking,

1962
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:09,840
it gets, it gets hot, one might say.

1963
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,200
Okay, the end.

1964
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:13,200
Goodbye, see you next week.

1965
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,280
Happy New Year, America 2020.

1966
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:16,480
Uh, uh, what?

1967
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:17,760
I don't even know what that means.

1968
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,000
Okay, good night.

1969
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:20,800
Yeah, good night.

1970
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:21,600
Bye-bye.
